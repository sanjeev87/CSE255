S"I am a fan of all things Sangria, and Firefly has to have some of the best around.  I love places with a great happy hour, atmosphere, and patio.  Firefly has all  three plus great tapas.  The service is always fantastic they are very attentive and friendly.  I can't think of a better place to start off a weekend in Vegas with your friends than this place.\n\nThe must haves for me when I go is of course the Sangria (red) and the stuffed mushrooms with chorizo and chicken.  The Calamari is quite good, and on my most recent visit the Shrimp a la Diabla was fantastic.  I look forward to my next visit to Firefly which will be very soon."

S"There's only one thing that's bad about this place...  the wait!  This food is as good as it gets and at a fraction of the price you will pay for the big names on the strip.  Its not an elegant dining room, its tight and usually a bit noisy, but the food is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.  If you've never eaten here, shame on you.  Come in and order a variety of dishes and you will be BLOWN AWAY by all of them!  Words can't describe the wonderful flavors on the menu.  I moved to Vegas from Orange County just so  I could eat here all the time!"

S"LOVE this place. I always go here when I visit Vegas. Its a very cute place and definitely very happening at all hours. They have plenty of tables and can easily accompany a large party. its dimly lit in the evening which makes it both fun and romantic. They also serve delicious pitchers of sangria. portions are slightly larger than I'm used to for tapas (which is a plus for us anyway). I think every item on the menu is equally delicious. Ok now for the food breakdown, please forgive me if I'm off in titling the food items...\n\n-Steamed mussels- one of my favorites here! Its a generous serving of mussels in what seems like a thai like curry sauce. \n-Lobster escargot- lobster pieces served in a garlic butter sauce, a must try for sure\n-Charizo clams- serviced in a great and very light sauce, i think its white wine and something else\n-ham and cheese croquets- i know it sounds boring and lame, but they make it really well!!\n-lamb skewers- not overly cooked, served on a bed of lentils\n-Apple and manchego salad- strips of apple and manchego cheese. sounds odd but they go very nicely together\n-Tuna tartare- diced cubes of raw tuna with avocado served with taro chips. The taro chips are very nice and light\nBaked filets of tilapia- good, but doesn't stand out against the other dishes. The sauce is very simple\nCamarones a la diabla- grilled shrimp in a nice spicy chile sauce. LOVE this dish"

S'This place is overly rated from a locals standpoint, for those of you out of towners that like a party scene this might be the place for you folks. This might be a place to get a quick bite before or after clubbing. The food is just so so, not great. The portion are not satisfying for the price you have to pay per dish. As for the Sangria, it\'s alcohol and what is there not to like about anything that\'s mixed with alcohol....it\'s so overly advertised by some of the yelpers. Been here a couple of times with friends from out of town....and can\'t really say...."ummm I remember that was good you gotta try it!" Don\'t really have a dish that you have to go back for more of. The steak skewer was dry, the mushroom with puff patry was tasteless, the Firefly Fries was soggy, if you have a big party your gonna have to order a couple of orders per dish if you want enough to go around. The music of this place is loud that you\'ll have to shout across the table to talk to your friends and the place is so dim that you have to be careful of what your putting into your mouth. Overall, the service was poor. The hostesses working there seems to have some kind of attitude problem...they first ask you if you have a reservation to make it seems like you should know better to make one next time ...cause we\'re sooooo busy!'

S"not usually a big fan of tapas since the plates make me feel like a giant, but this place is the perfect place for both locals and tourists alike. that means it can get really crowded! the food is really good; good bold, flavors and well balanced - not overly salty, spicy or sweet. since it gets crowded, it does affect the service, but our server did good job as did our hostess. and since the restaurant is in an outside shopping center, parking can be an issue. but if you're stick of the buffets and high-end hotel restaurants, this is a solid choice."

S"This is by far one of the best Tapas place we have ever been to!  This place stomps all of the fancy and expensive tapas restaurant.  Firefly  is bustling!  Located about 10 min away from the Strip of Las Vegas, is a gem.  When we arrived, this place was PACKED!  We were very impressed with the service, considering the amount of people they were serving, they were cranking out small dishes very very efficiently.  We noticed a small kitchen with only a few workers, but their efficiency was equivalent to about 10 cooks.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was noisy, dark, yet very inviting.  We were very happy with the prices, everything we ordered was $10 or less, but you are definitely getting loads of flavor and ingredients that is worth more than $10.\n\nWe started out with what we thought was the best dish of the night...Anchovy Toast!  The anchovies were delicious...very good quality.  Slightly salty and perfectly paired with creamy avocado, fresh parsley, chewy baguette, and drizzled with a mildly spicy olive oil.\n\nSkewers of spicy chorizo, shrimp, and tender steak.  These skewers were delicious!  All the components were cooked well and nothing was overdone.  This is actually pretty difficult when you have things on a skewer that cooks at different rate.  Kudos to Firefly for doing it right!\n\nGrilled octopus with potatoes were quite tasty.  The octopus was so tender and seasoned well but it didn't cover the sweetness that came from the octopus. \n\nThis was actually surprisingly good!  A chorizo fondue ..wow YUMMY!  This came out pipping hot...the flavor was spicy yet creamy and gooey at the same time.  This was pretty addictive. \n\nThe lamb chops were excellent!  Probably one of the best dish of the night and so affordable.  For $10, we got 2 thick cuts of lamb chops, it cost that much usually just to buy the ingredient if not more.  The lamb had a very good lamb flavor, cooked to medium rare, tender, and very juicy!  We wish we had room to eat another plate =)\n\nThis last dish was the lobster escargot.  So this dish is basically a new creation of garlic butter escargot, but instead of the meats being escargot, they made this with lobster nuggets.  This was just as you would imagine...buttery, tantalizing garlic flavor, and savory goodness of the lobster meat.  How can you possibly go wrong?\n\nOverall this was a great FIND!  This is one of the places we would hands down come back for a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th meal.  Firefly has a big menu so you could probably order different dishes every time   This place had speedy and efficient service.  I would say it's not as comfortable to sit in just because this place is always packed and there is not very much elbow room.  The food is amazing and much better than any of the highly priced Tapas places we have eaten before.  We would rate this place a 9 for service, flavor, creative dishes, and affordability."

S'Nothing better than ending a LOSING trip to vegas with some good eats.  My buddy use to be the former exec. sous at TAO, recommended this joint.  Cant believe it took me this long to try.  One of the better tapas places i\'ve ever been....granted, my tapas tasting has been limited due to younglings.... anyhow...on to the food:\n\nStuffed Dates:  Lived up to the hype.  Must eat all components together.  My first bite was without the blue cheese crumble, and it was eh...then the second one was HOLY SCHMOLY!  Very good... And i dont even care for dates.\n\nChicken Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms;  Good...but no wow factor... they tricked me by printing "YUM" on the menu description.\n\nCalamari:  Very good....the garlic aioli was excellent\n\nTuna Tartare:  Fresh, cut too big, but nice cold app to go with alcohol.\n\nPaella:  MONEY MONEY MONEY.  Now this is good stuff.  Not too salty, plenty of shrimp, chicken, sausage, calamari, very very good.  ONLY minor glitch... i think because of the wait and the crowds, they served the dish in a cold paella dish.  The best part of paella is the crunchy part of the rice on the bottom of the pan.  Otherwise, this was first rate.\n\nWhite Sangria:  Only had a sip, but it was ok....better off with hard liquor or cold beer.\n\nService was good considering the crowds.  Kinda hot though...the A/c wasnt on full blast.  Definitely worth another visit..... nice change of pace from the Overpriced strip eateries....'

S'This place is fantastic from all angles. Love the tapas experience. It can get pricey quick but the selection and ability to have a little bit of everything is welcomed in this tapas setting. If you have at least 3-4 people makes it a lot easier to try many things. Sangria is also quite good. Food is real tasty and satisfies all appetites. It is a great place socially but that also means it tends to be very busy. It is worth the wait in my opinion. Have been going there for years now and appears to be the De facto place for my friends and I to celebrate birthdays.'

S"I was visited Firefly last weekend on Friday night and I have to say bacon wrapped dates!  That was the best part of dinner.  The ambience was trendy and the service was quick and polite.  Besides the bacon wrapped dates, which were amazing we had the filet mignon sliders, which were good but I don't think filet mignon should be served in a burger.  It takes away from what it is.  We also had the patats bravas and skewers which were good as well.  I tried the sangria, which was good but a little too sweet and light on the alcohol for my taste.  The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because while we were waiting to be seated outside because it was so crowded all the smokers were lightiing up right outside the door and it was super gross coming from a nonsmoker.  They should designate a smoking area.  Also, we were seated outside where there are no smoking signs posted everywhere yet we saw some girls smoking on one side and none of the staff people said anything."

S"7 girls + 18 dishes + 2 pitchers of Sangria = a tummy full of HAPPINESS!!\n\nWent on a girls reunion trip with the UCLA girls to Vegas and we knew we wanted to have a good dinner meal for Saturday. With no idea what to get, the lovely May suggested Firefly. We heard it could be busy so we called to see if we could make reservations but they told us it wasn't that busy around 6:30 which was the time we wanted to go and that it gets busy later at night (very true). \n\nThe atmostphere is awesome. It's dim with red accents, and there's latin dance type of music playing. Right when we walked in I had already seen two of the waiters/waitresses dancing a little- it was very cute. \n\nSo we sat down, and decided to order whatever we felt like because either way it would have been cheaper than if we had decided to go to Joel Robuchon's restaurant in the MGM (which I definitely want to try). \n\nHere's what we ordered- \n\n1. 2 plates stuffed dates ----soooo good\n2. 2 plates manchego mac & cheese- pretty good but not the best of all the dishes\n3. 2 plates of chorizo & chicken stuffed mushrooms\n4.  ceviche shrimp- very good\n5. Thai beef salad\n6. petite filet\n7. lambchops\n8. spicy lamb sausage\n9. mussels\n10. shrimp diabla \n11. paella\n12. ham and cheese croquetas\n13. tuna tartare\n14. chocolate cherry bread pudding\n15. dessert platter\n\nMy favorites- stuffed dates, the ceviche, the petite filet, stuffed mushrooms, ham and cheese croquetas, lamb sausage & Paella- the paella is very good to get and large enough to share with a lot of people. \n\nMy least favorites- the tuna tartare (tasted a little funny, we think they added mayo or something to it) and the lambchops (didn't have that lamb flavor). \n\nand of course the chocolate bread pudding was very good with ice cream. \n\nThe dent- only $35 per girl with tip. A lot better than the minimum of at least $100 at Robuchon =)"

S'This place is pretty cool for tapas. They have A LOT of small dishes and I liked how they make their own sangria, and on the menu it says they marinate it for 3 days. it was pretty refreshing and delicious. I came with a large party so it was a little difficult to get full since everything is small plates. Some of my favorites were the tuna tartare, thai beef salad, skewers, and the big bowl of chicken salad. Also since we were still hungry we ordered the herb roasted chicken which came with fries and devoured it.'

S"Stuffed dates? Nothing I'd ever order.\n\nLuckily, I tried them. And they were delicious. And most of what I ate here was great! Along with the dates, I sampled the empenadas, petite filet, chicken chrorizo stuffed mushrooms, shrimp a la diabla, and the nutella sammiches for dessert. The stuffed mushrooms were disappointing since they were under the heat lamp for too long, so the cheese was hard and not very tasty. But everything else was pretty great. The Sangria rivaled what I've had in Spain (or at least, what I remembered I've had in Spain), and it was a great lively feel to the place.\n\nIt was absolutely packed on a Tuesday night, though. So reservations are recommended. \n\nAlthough I'm not a local, I was treated like I was an regular, with attentive and helpful service from our server and the busboy quickly grabbing our old plates to make room for the new ones. \n\nI'll be back here again, hopefully for Happy Hour next time."

The place was definitely packed and I was glad I had called for reservation for the party of 4.\n\nThe food was great!  I had been missing Spanish food since I came back from Spain and the food here definitely hit the spot.  \n\nThe boquerones were traditionally done and were delicious.  The stuffed dates are to die for and a must-have.  We even tried it without bacon since we had someone following kosher diet in our group.  The veggie empanadas were also very tasty.  Another traditional spanish dish is the patatas bravas.  They made them very much like the ones I had in Spain though I would have liked them a bit spicier.\n\nTo compliment all the delicious food, we also enjoyed a couple of pitchers of sangria.

I finally found them! This place is one of the best food places in Vegas. The food is cooked to order and served very hot. I ordered the red Sangria and it is incredibly delicious. I recommend ordering a pitcher. The fresh bits of apple are so good.  My favorites on the menu are the dates, empanadas and lamb chops. They season the chops perfectly with a wonderful sear on them. They melt in your mouth. Their garlic fries are addicting.They are open late and service is amazing. Every time I am in Vegas, this place is always on my list. It\'s busy but a romantic place. It\'s a tapas bar, so you can try lots of food and not spend lots of money. Every mouthful of food is an experience and it makes you want to come back again and again. Thanks brother!

We have friends in Vegas this weekend (hot!) and I just reminded them to check out the Firefly on Paradise - can't vouch for any others!\n\nWe had a group of 8 and ordered a different plate for each of us and ate them family style. Then we ordered more, ended up ordering 16 plates, which was too much food. \n\nAll of them were OK, but a few were simply outstanding. I reluctantly tried a stuffed date - I usually don't like bacon on sweets - but that was one we ordered 2x! Also a shrimp dish. \n\nThe mac and cheese and sausage plates were OK, but only ordered once. I'm getting old and waited too long to remember the rest.

What impressed us was that we arrived at probably the busiest time with no reservation, and had a minimal wait for a table. The mango mojito was definitely something I would have again, and the food was, as the other reviewers stated, very good. Not in my top ten, but I could see myself coming back and bringing friends. \n\nWe ordered the ham & cheese croquettes, ahi tuna tartare, filet mignon sliders, crispy duck rolls w/ cherry sauce, and the dessert plate...no complaints, but next time we will probably order something different off of their expansive menu. \n\nSome cons - It was very dark inside, to the point that I thought my ahi tuna was tomatoes because I couldn't see. It was very very loud, but I guess that's expected at prime time on a Saturday. There was almost too many servers for the relatively small restaurant. We had a few different people come to our table, and had a hard time remembering who was our actual waiter, and who was just a busser."

Ended up going here because wicked spoon is lame and closes at 2p n reopens at 5p -_- still love wicked spoon tho, but my sister told me over a year ago to eat at firefly. From the time she told me about it to the time I actually went I had been to vegas SIX times.  I thought by the time I actually tried Firefly I would be like "ehh its ok" coz I have been anticipating it for so long, but boy was I wrong. I ordered 4 tapas for myself. I got the ham and cheese croquette, firefly fries, sirloin burgers, and bacon wrapped dates. All were delicious. Apparently bacon wrapped dates are supposed to be the sh.t but when I tried, it was OK, kinda salty. If you want to try it share with 2 or 3 other people. Firefly is not too far away from the strip so you dont have to be concerned about sky high taxi fare. I really wish we had a fire fly in the bay but it gives me another reason to fly out to vegas!'

We each had a glass of wine and an after dinner digestif, and ended up at about $80. The atmosphere is casual, and portions are ample.\nMussels: Very tasty in a coconut curry broth, served with bread to soak up the goodness\nTuna Peppers: probably the lowlight. We're big fans of peppadews, but they were pretty much just stuffed with canned tuna, drizzled with oil, and plated. Disappointing.\nLamb Chops: cooked perfectly, interesting side with lentils and veggies\nStuffed Dates: YUM! Everything they should be.\nPulpo Asado: very tender octopus, pretty flavorful\nWe ordered the sliders, and they showed up on the bill, but never came out. We were already getting full by the time we noticed, and the server was apologetic and gracious about taking it off the bill."

We ordered about 15 to share. \n\nThe bacon wrapped, stuffed dates and the manchego macaroni and cheese were among my favorites.  Strangely enough, the "firefly fries" with Parmesan cheese were so good that we ordered a second batch.  Some other standouts were the tierra y mar skewers, a mushroom topped fillet mignon, and shrimp with garlic sauce.\n\nI would stay away from the stuffed mushrooms, which were dry and boring, despite the menu description -  "(yum)" and the baked brie with chorizo, which just seemed like a collapsed salty mess.  \n\nThe delicious meal, decent atmosphere and a price of less than $35 per person would entice me to return.'

S'So I guess this is Tapas Day. So Firefly - I\'ve driven by so many times - Saw it on Rachel Ray\'s $40 a day....Hmmm finally went there and was quite impressed. BTW THERE IS NO THAI BEEF SALAD IN SPAIN. Whatever and your tapas fusion. Overall - great atmosphere. A little Loud....Drinks are delish. Hmmm Reading all reviews...I\'m just gonna copy and paste everyone\'s to make my own :) Mwahahaha Behold Plagerism!!!\nA great, inexpensive, off the Strip dining choice for Spanish tapas.\nAN extra star because they are open until 2 a.m. but minus a half a star because they don\'t tell you when you call that you need reservations even at 11:30 at night.  Firefly is a welcome alternative to the overpriced strip restaurants and clubs.  This is where all of the local crowd hangs out.  It\'s up the street from the Hard Rock, quick cab-ride from the strip.  Great food, hip but relaxed atmosphere.  Open late with DJ\'s and more of a bar/loungey crowd the later it gets.  \nBTW, I realized that if you say "I\'m going to a tapas bar" that it sounds like something not so innocent.  Good for a laugh or two (but gets old very quick).  It\'s also a handy way to find out how dirty your friends are.\nSo, Firefly is becoming a weekend tradition with my crew.  And even more exciting....John (the restaurants owner/chef) has opened a sequel next door called Dragonfly...we\'ll talk about that later.\n\nTapas is a treat, literally.  And the best way to pigout with friends for less money that you would expect. It\'s like ordering a table full of appetizers.   Hmmm....like TGI Friday\'s, but good.\n\nFirefly friend pleaser\'s.......Jug O\' Red Sangria\n                                              Baked Brie and/or Cheese & Meat Plate\n                                              Empanadas\n\nYummy and way fun to share.  An awesome bar.  Thankfully a bar that knows how to make a kick ass martini.  Cuz when the Sangria is gone you might as well kick it up a notch. BAM!!!\n\nAnd it sports a pleasing trendy atmosphere at Happy Hour.  Believe me....wall to wall SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE.   Men who use product, and the women who love them.  Wink, wink. \nMwahahaha and that is my review completely not plagerized and true...\nNo Really I knocked it for the crowdedness, and noise levels, oh and for we had really crappy seats when we went....table small.

Now,  onto the REALLY GOOD stuff.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\n\n*Apple and Manchego salad - GOOD\nGreen apple, manchego cheese, smoked almonds\n\n*Tuna Tartare - If you've tried Wolfgang Puck's Tuna Tartare, Firefly's comes in a close second\nMarinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips\n\n*Tuna Peppers - DELICIOUS\nSmoked yellowfin tuna salad, stuffed in marinated peppers\n\n*Tomato-Basil Soup - Tomato soup was good but if you dip the brie in the soup, it tastes a little funky\nTomato soup with mini grilled brie sandwich\n\n*Veggie Empanada - OK\nSpinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese, red pepper aioli\n\n*Thai Beef Salad - I've had better at Coconut Bay or Presidente\nSeared beef, thai dressing, romaine, tomato, cucumber, giner\n\n*Baked Filets of tilapia - SO GOOD\nMarinated with herbs, lemon, garlic\n\n*Chicken Skewers - YUMMY\nMarinated chicken, tomato, roast garlic cream\n\n*Crispy Duck Roll - I'm not much of a duck fan so I didn't try but everyone else loved it\nCherry hoisin sauce\n\n*Tierra y Mar Skewers - OK, Meat was kind of hard to pull off the skewer\nGrilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde\n\n*Filet Sliders - DELICIOUS\nMini burgers with Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions\n\n*Ceviche of Shrimp\nTiger shrimp, avocado, crispy corn tortillas\n\n*Babyback Ribs - GOOD - Meat slides right off the bone\nMango BBQ sauce\n\n*Camarones Ajillo - GOOD\nShrimp in lemon-garlic butter sauce\n\nUnfortunately, despite eating all of the glorious food, I had a stomach ache and had diarrhea.  However, I would eat Firefly's and experience diarrhea again.  I think it's worth it.  =)\n\nThe total amount was $104.32.  Not bad at all.  We split the tapas between five people and we came out stuffed."

S"Thanks Yelp!\nOnce again, we have found a restaurant that we would not have visited if we would only have followed the tourist information in an unknown city.\n\nWhen we were in Vegas last week, we checked Yelp for restaurants close to the Hard Rock Hotel, where we stayed. Firefly on Paradise had such exceptionally good reviews that we decided to try it... And we were not disappointed.\nGreeted by a very friendly waiter with the funkiest hairstyle (a leopard-Mohawk combination that rocks!), we were seated immediately at a very nice table by the window.\nFollowing other reviews, we tried the sparkling sangria (usually I always go for red one, but omg, this is delicious!). It had blueberries, apples and pears which we picked out - awesome.\n\nWe were pretty hungry, so we decided to go with 3 Tapas each. For European standards, that would be the minimum, here you get ore American-sized Tapas, and we were stuffed after 3 per person.\nWe had the Apple Manchego Salad (which I copy at home now, it's so simple yet so good), the veggie empanada (yumm), the pulpo asado (great fresh pulpo with a nice sauce), the Thai beef salad (pretty large tapa, very good), the merguez ( you get two sausages, nicely spicy), and of course we had to try the dates (my family lives in Spain, and we had a lot of bacon-wrapped dates there - Firefly dates are even better!).\nWe decided we had to try the desserts after those tapas, so we went with chocolate cakes tres leches and the bread pudding. Again, the presentation is mouthwatering, and the taste simply exquisite.\n\nIt's a shame we don't live here, otherwise I'd be a regular. Make sure to try out this tapas restaurant when you're in Vegas, especially if you stay in the Hard Rock Hotel or closeby - it's just a little walk away!"

S"Who would of known that there is an AMAZING Tapas restaurant in Las Vegas? \n\nFirely is located off the strip but well worth the trip. As we enter, it was dark and social with latin jams blasting in the background.  I was starting to dig this place!\n\nTo get the party started, I order the sangria and mojito. Both drinks were TERRIFIC! Don't judge me it's VEGAS! \n\nThere were so many tapa dishes to choose from. The bacon wrapped figs, tierra y mar skewer, crispy duck rolls and tuna tartar were incredible. The filet mignon sliders and mac n cheese was outstanding. Each tapas dish ranges from $4-$8. \n\nI would definitely be back here on my next trip to Vegas!"

S"My friend and I hit this place up on a Friday evening before I went over to the Hard Rock Pool for a concert.  I've driven past this place a hundred times and it always seems packed.  This was true on a Friday night, yet when we went inside, we were seated immediately.  In fact, we were able to sit out on the patio in the cooling summer weather.  \n\nWe just wanted to eat a couple of appetizers and enjoy a couple of drinks.  I ordered the patatas braza (red potatoes in a hot sauce) with the duck rolls (egg rolls but duck instead of egg).  Both were small portions, but considering we weren't that hungry, they were perfect.  The flavor of the sauce accompanying the duck was excellent.  The patatas were good but a little too spicy.\n\nMy friend was craving a mojito all day and since we couldn't do some at home, she got one here.  No plain pre-made mojito here, it was full of mint leaves and left a nice aftertaste in my mouth when I was allowed a sample.\n\nWe shall return here to sample a more complex menu in the future, as well as sit inside and enjoy the atmosphere and seating within (cool couches for seating instead of your regular high-back chair faire.  The cost was relatively inexpensive (as long as you don't come in too hungry), so we can come again before a Friday Night Live concert at the Hard Rock pool without feeling like a broke pig."

S'Biggest Tapas proportions that I have seen!!! Also, how can you complain about anything that is under $10 and takes a nano-second to get to your table?\n\nSeriously though, if you are looking for a place to take a date, take a hook-up, take your parents, or take your crazy best friends for a night of sangria madness then this is the place! \n\nIt is cozy, dark-but not toooo dark, lively, cheap, fun, and best of all the clientele is totally random. The food is amazing as an extra added bonus!\n\nTry the Tiger Shrimp Ceviche, i swear my mouth had an orgasm.'

S"Came here last Saturday for an early dinner with the gals. The location of Firefly is a few miles away the strip and near a corporate plaza (which reminded us of Orange County). Since we got there early (before 6 PM), there was no wait but the place was still more than half full. The restaurant has a nice, cozy, intimate feel with dark red interiors.\n\nEveryone got a glass of white sangria but I opted for an Amstel light since I'm not a fan of fruity, sweet drinks. We all ordered 2 plates each but I ordered 4 since I was starving and wanted to try a few more plates.\n\nFrom the plates I sample, my favorites were:\n\nHam and Cheese Croquetas - This was a flavor explosion in the mouth! I loved the rich cheese mixed with the tasty ham and the crispy outside batter. There was some sauce drizzled on top but I couldn't make out what it was\n\nCamarones Al Ajillo  - So.Freaking.Good. The shrimp was fresh and cooked perfectly. The butter sauce was delicious - I wanted to drink it with a spoon. Next time, I will try the Camarones A La Diabla since that one has a spicy kick to it.\n\n Petite Filet - Despite the filet being cooked pretty much well done (I asked for medium), it was still very tender. It would've been 10x better if there was some red left in the meat. \n\nAll in all, this is a great place for a date or a group outting. The atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back but the ambiance is fantastic. We're planning another girl's trip this summer and we're definitely planning on coming back here!"

Maybe Rachel Ray messed it up by telling us non-Vegas locas about this in $40-a day. The price is right, the menu is damn good, and the assortment of sangria and especially mojito is endless. My next trip to Vegas I will have to stop here for a bite."

S"My boyfriend was feeling an Ibiza themed night. After having a lazy Sunday soaking in the sun at the pool we started to talk about dinner plans.\n\nNow I have been to Firefly on a couple of occasions to mainly grab a small bite at the bar and enjoy their great happy hour special. This was my second full dinner and now I can say it has easily become my go-to spot.\n\nThe decor is a fiery spanish inspired theme with lovely paintings of the flamenco dancers draped on the walls. The room is separated into three dining areas, one inside, separated by the bar, one mid point with a glass wall allowing you to peek outside and another just outside with heat lamps to keep it tolerable on the chillier nights. Firefly is festive with spanish music blasting in the background. It's a fun spot and always busy. Great to go alone or to dine in a small group. Reservations are highly recommended, although most times I've been lucky and was sat right away. \n\nThe service is spot on at the tables. The food is quick. The bussers are always cleaning up and the servers - (the best is Juan) are always smiling and ready for any question you have. I would have to say the bartenders need some work because I think they live in their own planet and are too busy chatting with each or checking their phones instead of engaging with the guest (from one bartender to another: that's what a guest looks for when they choose to dine at the bar, especially if they are alone)\n\nFood. Yummy. Great Value. Quality ingredients.\n\nHighly Recommend: Tuna Tartare (some of the best I've ever had and I have it a lot)\nBacon wrapped stuffed dates (very heavy so be in the mood) \nPaella (share, share, & share the goodness.\n\nI also recommend their pitcher of Sangria. It was slightly too sweet this time around but they quickly fixed that by bringing us some fresh cut oranges to balance the sweetness (sorry but we are in the service industry and sometimes we can fix the problem ourselves). Mojito's here are fantastic too.\n\nAnother quality find in Vegas! An attestment to its success is the fact that there are three different locations! Tapas I heart you...."

S"I wish I didn't have to drive to this place from the Mandalay Bay so I could have had more sangria!\n\nArrived in Vegas around 8pm.  Drove over to Firefly where there was only a 10 minute wait for the two of us.  It was a Friday night and it was busy so I was surprised the wait was so short.  Our hostess, server, and bussers were all very nice.  The sangria was so good and pretty strong.  We ordered a handful of tapas as well. \n\nMushroom tart - AMAZING.  \n\nVeggie Empanada - Not as good as I hoped it would be.  I wish I had skipped that and ordered another mushroom tart.\n\nMac 'n' cheese  - Definitely some of the best mac 'n' cheese I've ever had!\n\nFries - Good but the aioli tasted like nothing :(\n\nI will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas, but I'll be sure to either take a taxi or not be the DD!"

S"Great Sangria, red and white, but I personally prefer the red. Everything is in the style of tapas, but is ethnic infusion of all kinds. \n\nEverything is good, but my favorite dishes are the  Baked Brie, Mushroom Tart, Gazpacho, and the fries. Okay, but they're not just fries. They're heaven in a bowl with shredded parmesan and awesome dipping sauce. I'm kind of a fry connoisseur, by the way. \n\nOne dish that I wasn't too hot on was the tuna tartar. If I want raw fish, I'm gonna go to a sushi joint. \n\nThe service is kinda slow sometimes. Well, the wait staff is sometimes slow, but the kitchen is fast. I go with my bf and we order two rounds of three dishes per round. Go with more people and order at least three rounds. Once the food starts coming, it never stops. \n\nIts a little pricey, but you can order small or you can order large. Just don't go after you've smoked a blunt. \n\nWe always take out-of-towners here to entertain. It always earns points. \n\nI don't recommend this place for a date during prime time as it can get really crowded and loud.\n\n* off the strip (just barey), non-casino"

S"Let me start off with MY only complaint: it was a little loud for my taste. My wife said its just cause I'm getting old as we were celebrating my 35th this past Friday in Vegas. But I'm a talker, and I like to talk and hear myself talk and the people I'm talking with talk, and the music playing made that a little difficult. With that being said, there is nothing else to complain about. So if you like a more quiet, intimate vibe, this isn't gonna be a spot you'll like.\n\nSo for those of you that don't know, tapas are small appetizer plates. In fact, most of the plates are no bigger than the size of the bowls most Mexican restaurants put salsa in. Don't expect big portions. These bite-sized Spanish appetizer plates are only a mere fraction of the size of a typical American app. Thus, if you are a big eater, you might want to order more than a couple. Or, go in decent group and share, as our party of 8 did.\n\nWhen we arrived, the hostess told us it would be a 40-minute wait. We didn't complain because they had misters outside, which was very refreshing in the Las Vegas heat. We decided to go to the bar while we waited instead so that we could try the sangria everyone keeps talking about here on Yelp. Hands down, the best sangria I've had in a while. Better than the sangria they serve at Buca di Beppo, which was my favorite until I tasted the deliciousness of this red wine and fruity goodness! Twenty minutes into our wait, we were seated and expertly attended to. Service here is impeccable. We didn't have to ask for anything and they were quick with all our orders.\n\nMoving on to our food, this is what we ordered and shared:\n\nStuffed dates- date wrapped in bacon, smoked almond, blue cheese and served in a red wine reduction. Winner all around. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese and I loved these! Portion size is about 4 or 5 dates. I'd highly recommend them.\n\nChorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms- no explanation needed. Smokey chorizo flavor enhanced the earthiness of the mushroom and was nice on the chicken too.\n\nFilet mignon sliders- moist, juicy, tender and if that flavor could be duplicated in a normal size burger, they'd run out of it everyday!\n\nLobster escargot- don't let the name fool you. No snails here. Just little balls of lobster tail meat in a garlic herb butter, and perfectly grilled.\n\nCamarones a la diabla- just like the Mexican version, not as spicy. Very flavorful.\n\nBaked filets of tilapia- herbs, lemon and garlic. Melt in your mouth white fish. \n\nShrimp temura- beer battered, very crispy.\n\nTierra y Mar skewers- grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo and salsa Verde. All cooked to perfection, all compliment each other.\n\nRibeye steak entree- 14 oz. ribeye in a red wine sauce, topped with cabrales cheese. Outstanding steak on its own. Tender, tasty, no A-1 needed.\n\nOverall, make room for eating here while in Vegas. Unanimously vote on as being g a place to come back to on our next trip."

S"I've heard so much about Firefly from some locals, so I FINALLY had the opportunity to check this AAAMMAZZING place out. It definitely lives up to the hype and everyone's raving recommendations. I'm starting to think that I need to venture off the strip for better tasting food for cheaper prices.\n\nAmbiance:\nFirefly has an amazing vibe. It's dimly lit, quiet, and chill. I like how you can sit on couches as opposed to chairs. You can sit comfortably on the couches while you sip on some delicious sangrias.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?userid=0f_0XfO2qcgNwSJAHwfR9g\n\nFood:\n1) Filet Mignon Sliders - Sliders are always a safe bet.

Even after reading all the reviews, I was still skeptical since I hate dates. However, I will ALWAYS order the dates here because they were bacon-wrapped and contained smoked almond, red wine reduction and blue cheese. The bacon combined with the almond, reduction, and reduction masked the flavor of the dates. Whatever they did, it WORKS.\n\n6) Firefly Fries - can't go wrong with parmesan, herbs, and garlic aioli on fries. Not too salty, but enough flavor and perfectly fried.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=WLctqbU82YT1yw6nSKfLBQ\n\n7) Manchego Mac n' Cheese - I love mac n' cheese and it didn't disappoint here.\n\n8) Grilled octopus - FAIL. Overcooked and too chewy.\n\nParking:\nPlenty of free parking in the strip mall parking lot. Not crazy like the strip."

If you book a large group, have the first person check in when they arrive. I brought a group of students here and we didn't check in until everyone arrived and then despite being 15 minutes early for our reservation, we waited over an hour after our reservation time to be seated (with pre-made reservations guaranteed with a credit card). Once we were seated, everything was fine. However making 20+ people wait while one table sits (and doesn't order anything else) is ridiculous.\n\nHowever, if you aren't bringing a large group, this place is awesome. The dishes are priced right. The drinks are pricey but no more pricey than the nearby strip!\n\nYou have to try the dates. Seriously. No really. Has anyone mentioned those dates yet in a review?

We had a pitcher of their famous red sangria which is a definite must - sweet and perfect. We had about 8 different plates that we ordered and the portions are small so this was adequate for two people. Out of all the plates the one's that I recommend and would order again are:\n*mac & cheese - really very delicious\n*shrimp in lemon-garlic butter dish\n* shrimp, chorizo sausage, and filet mignon skewers\n*bacon wrapped dates\n*ham and cheese\n*firefly fries\n\n\nFor dessert we had the dessert sampler and the bread pudding.

I\'ll probably want to give this place another shot to taste the "must-haves" of the menu...but that depends on if anyone else is in the mood for some tapas.'

S"Hmm......\n\n30 minute wait?  Check.\n\n2 hot messes in clothing that was too tight and too young for them?  Double check.\n\nGreat food?  Check.\n\nHot hostess?  Check.\n\nSo we got here at around 745pm on a Wednesday, and it was a little crowded, but I think it was worth it.  I grabbed a Jameson rocks and a Vodka cocktail at the bar for me and my buddy and we drank it happily while we waited for our table.  The thing that surprised me was how big and full of liquor my glass was!  I'm used to the glass being smaller and less full, so that was a nice surprise.  I hoped for a table outside since it was a nice warm night, but we got in at one of the lower slung tables near the front.  Comfortable seating at the low table.  A plate of bread and olives appears with waters soon after we got seated, and so did our server who took our order of the following..\n\nA pitcher of white sangria. \n\nCold tapas  \n\nApple and Manchego Salad - Surprisingly filling for a salad, and the cheese and almonds provided for a nutty, almost meaty addition to the salad.\n\nArtichoke Toasts -  I didn't eat any of them, but they were pretty!\n\nTuna Peppers - Marinated poppadew peppers stuffed with tuna, and seated atop a taro chip, these were perfect morsels of food combining salty sweet and crunchy!\n\nBoquerones - I love anchovies and I like vinegar, so I ate most of these, and am biased to salted fish, but these were awesome and I don't usually like red peppers but they make sense on this dish to contrast the brininess of the anchovies and acidity of the vin.\n\nHot tapas \n\nStuffed Dates - Crispy bacon wrapped around a date stuffed with a smoke almond, in a red wine sauce with blue cheese, these were like the Mediterranean Turducken you've never heard of.\n\nPatatas Bravas - Roasted potatoes with spicy aioli.  Wish we got the sauce on the side, and the potatoes could've been spicier, but overall solid.\n\nFried Calamari - These were done well, not overcooked, crispy batter that stuck to the rings, and they included the heads!  Yes, I love tentacles, don't you??\n\n Me, my wife, her sister and boyfriend split the above.  We were absolutely stuffed to the brim, and in a good way.  And, it didn't break the bank, I was expecting the bill to be much higher, but then, we did only have one pitcher and 2 drinks.  But that's because we were saving room for Luv-It.  Oh yeah.....\n\nGo to Firefly!  You go now!"

S"OH MY GOD! this place was amazzzzzzzing. Please open one in Chicago just like it!!! I was visiting Vegas with a friend for 4 days. Please note that I ate here twice during my stay. Wowzers.. Talk about tasty food. We had dinner the first time- The place was packed and the hostesses were very friendly and helpful. We didn't wait too long since I had called for directions and made a last minute reservation. \n\nMy friend had the dates wrapped in bacon- she couldn't stop raving about it. Almost made my vegetarian self try some :) But I didn't. I did however, have the eggplant stuffed with ricotta cheese and marinara sauce.. I have never had eggplant that tasted that great. It was perfectly cooked and the cheese melted in my mouth. YUM. We also had the beet and goat cheese salad. That was pretty tasty also.. the perfect mix drizzled with olive oil... and least but not last, we had the dessert... oh I thought I died and went to heaven. Bread pudding mixed with ice cream covered with raspberry syrup... I don't care for sweets too much but I couldn't stop eating it. \n\nMy friend really liked their sparkling sangria. The second time we had the tortilla espa\xc3\xb1ola(hot) and manchego cheese- mac and cheese.. This folks is something you should not miss out on. \n\nDid I mention the service was impeccable and they even called a cab for us. One of my favorite places. Now if I could just go back to Vegas more frequently I would definitely do so. Go here. Just in case the 4 1/2 stars didn't persuade you to do so:)"

S'This is the 2nd time I\'ve been here.  The 1st time was two years ago when I was on leave from Iraq.  I came during lunch and sat at the bar.  Had a great time and the bartender treated me really well.  Food was fantastic-I mean I had better tapas here than I did in Madrid, Spain.\n\nWanted to come back and swung on by on a Saturday night.  Real mistake on my part.  I didn\'t realize this was a hang-out place for the "hip" crowd.  OK, so I really detest the hip crowd but I didn\'t let this sway my opinion.\n\nI sat down at the bar and waited a bit and the bartender gave me a menu.  At the same time I ordered a glass of their red sangria which was recommended to me the 1st time and I really liked.  The red sangria is still really good.  So I perused the menu and it looked pretty much identical.  made a couple choices and waited.  Waited a bit more.  Finally the bartender comes to me and I mention that I haven\'t been here in 2 years.  Just as I was going to tell him my order he turns to help one of the waiters that comes up.  OK, np the bartender supports the waiters-I got this.  So I wait some more.  The bartender either completely forgets about me or ignores me.  I wait a while now, deciding to be a nice guy and try to give him another chance.  He takes someones else\'s order that walked up to the bar while I\'m sitting at the bar.  I wait a good while and I\'m finally feed-up.  Seriously?  I flip the menu over to see the price on my glass, put out exactly $6.50 for the drink on the bar and exit.  I was flabbergasted.  It\'s been a while since I\'ve gotten this kind of treatment.  And the bar is really small.  There was me, and maybe 5 other people at this bar.  I\'m thinking he just decided to blow me off.  Amazing.  I would have given this place 5 stars two years ago but now...\n\nMaybe in the future I\'ll revisit at lunchtime again and write an update for this place but until then, I guess I just wasn\'t hip enough for this place.'

It was all amazing!!!!!!!!! Even the bread and almond butter you get when you sit down.\n\nWe all had a different mojioto- blood orange, raspberry, and mango! All yummy!\n\nMy only complaint is that it isn't in Portland, Oregon.\n\nSo do you deliver? ;)"

They added 2 new items, would have loved a few more new bites but the spicy chicken empanadas were yummy. The mussels are still my absolute fav and the mushroom tart was delicious!!! Honestly, right now and for the next year at least... it's probably the safest and cleanest resturaunt in Vegas. Highly recommend to all!!!"

S'I think I\'ve been here twice in the past month and I am ready to come back to nom again very soon.  For a big guy like me, I usually prefer "healthy" sized meals in comparison to a plethora of small entrees to pick from.  But, Firefly seems to get me every time.  From the Camarones a la Diabla to the Tuna Tartare, all of the dishes ordered at Firefly seem to continually hit the spot.  Plus, they have a nice malbec on the menu at a nice price.  What more can I ask for??  Actually, I would ask for a decrease in the hustle-n-bustle and a little more of a quieter atmosphere.. but when everyone else is enjoying it just as much as I am.. well, I can\'t do too much about that now can I?\n\nDefinitely coming back to grub here soon.. make sure to try out the Camarones a la Diabla (the sauce is bangin\'!) and the Passionfruit Cheesecake when you stop by!'

We gave The Fly on Paradise a second chance tonight due to the awesome management and there contact. \n\nWe walked in and checked in for the 9 o\'clock reservation and the hostess was very friendly and let us know that it would be about 5 minutes before our table was ready... " No Problem" 1 star to Firefly.\nOnce we had been sat the waiter was at our table and taking our drink order and asking if  we wanted to get some food started.  We decided to start out with a drink and 4 of the Tapas.  Now, I am not kidding... I had pulled out my phone, unlocked it, logged onto yelp and then the food was at our table. AS fast as we could eat it they were bringing it. \n\nWe made a few more orders and all the food was amazing, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The Drinks were all perfectly concocted and the waiter who i wish i could remember his name because I would definitely like to give a shout out to him. He was all over the service... Can you say "TOP NOTCH".\n\nFirefly Paradise, you are back on the top of the list. Lets recap this one time. Why is firefly back on the top?

Got to this place, pretty typical strip mall but could tell this place was popular.\n\nWalked in to the lounge area, awesome atmosphere and was seated right away on one of their low couches.  Scanned the menu, ordered some drinks and some food.\n\nBacon Wrapped Dates - Perfect!\nChicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms - Decent\nChorizo Clams - Amazing\n\nAbsolutely great experience, 3 dishes and 3 drinks for the two of us and we got out of there for around $50, wish we had time to go back, this is definitely somewhere you don't want to miss on a visit to Vegas, it's worth going out of your way for.\n\nAlso because this place is so popular, there are always a taxi or two waiting outside, very convenient."

S'yummy tapas? good.\npitcher of sangria? good. \nwhats not to like about firefly???\n\nwhat i ate:\n- mushroom tart: puff pastry filled with a delicious concoction of various mushrooms on a bed of creamy cheese. you wont miss the meat in this one, the mushrooms are so earthy.\n- bacon wrapped stuffed dates: i LOVE these things. its such a simple tapas, but so tasty. the sweet date pulled the sweetness out of the bacon but the saltiness was still there. the cheese inside balanced everything out with some creaminess, and the nut gave it just the right bite of texture. i could pop these things all night\n- steak and mushroom skewers: i wasnt expecting much, i mean this isnt a steak place (ruths chris is right next door). but omg, the steak was perfect! it was tender and perfectly cooked. the mushrooms were a nice balance. i dont know that the sauce was on the plate, but i sopped up the rest with some bread\n- empanda: this was also tasty. the meat filling had a nice spice to it, and i loved that it came with a bit of salad on the side. the salad was vinegary, crunchy and fresh. a nice palette cleanser\n- sausage plate: i dont know all the different meats that came, but there were four different kinds. came sprinkled with capers and gherkins. \n- firefly fries: you know why these were good? because you know firefly peeled the potatoes and made them on site, FRESH. because these tasted like in n out fries... but BETTER (i know i know, you didnt think it was possible, but these were actually better)\n- sangria: light, fresh, fruity but there was still a nice wine flavor to it\n- bread: yea, i know who cares about bread when you have yummy food to eat? but honestly, i get turned off by places that dont take details into account. i wasnt worried about the food when i had the bread at firefly. the baguette was good, but the butter that also came out with it was amazing! kept eating it with the rest of our small plates\n\npros:\n- FOOD: i cant rave enough about everything i ate!!! my mouth is seriously watering about all the food we ate. i know its a tapas place, but the portions were generous!!!! i left feeling stuffed! and we didnt even finish everything\n- price: 6 tapas plates and a pitcher of sangria for about $70. cheap considering everything we ate! \n- service: server was attentive and always filled our glasses when he saw that they were empty. the busboy was also adorably eager to whisk away our plates. \n- ambiance: definitely a great place to take a date! the patio was nice and cozy with dim lighting. inside was nice too, though CROWDED when i went.\n\ncons:\n- the WAIT. they dont take rez on the weekends i think. \n*TIP* try calling ahead and asking to be put on the list. the hostess will politely say, ok, but this does not put you on the actual waiting list and it does not guarantee you a table upon arrival - basically just talk to cover her ass just in case. we did this before we left and got seated right when we got there. awesome! \n- bathroom: i know its a busy restaurant, but my god, this was a bad hollywood club bathroom! paper towels all over the floor, and a line of bitchy girls that stared every girl down as they entered. *shudder* \n\nwould i come again? YES'

I have hit up this spot many a night with groups of people to enjoy the ambiance and of course the food. Their sangria is absolutely amazing and is THE way to start of the Firefly experience, some of my favs on the menu are the pork empanadas, the petite filet, the filet mignon sliders AND....the BACON WRAPPED DATES...augghhhh it pains me how good these morsels are because they are so simple.

Yes its a small place inside a little strip mall but  the sangria is the BEST you can find in the desert. They also have an outside patio which is great for summer nights. They serve tapas which for those of you who don't know they are more like appetizers and not actual dinner plates. I recommend the steamed mussels. They are soo delicioso!! hmmm... But their Sangria is the best. Their staff is awesome and very friendly. If you are in the Vegas area check out Firefly. There are two locations. This one is on Paradise which is close to the strip. The other location is in old town Vegas down off of Fremont street."

S"For my Th30th birthday, I celebrated it at Firefly on Paradise Rd.  How should I start?  I found out about this place through my cousin who spent his birthday here last year.  I was very attracted to the laid back and casual setting of the place.  It looks like a bar on the outside so you wouldn't know if it was a place that you can sit down and have a meal in.  \n\nWhen entering the restaurant, on the right there are hostesses to greet you and ask for the reservation name.  When a table was ready for my party of 9, we are led through a crowded looking room and retro design artwork on the wall.  It was a little difficult to maneuver your body through the tight squeeze between each chair and table.  Finally managing not to knock anyone food or glasses, I finally sat down and  was able to relax.\n\nBeing my favorite drink there was the Mojito, they were happy to serve it to me a few minutes after ordering it.  We dug straight in to the tapa's menu.  I had a craving for Tomato soup with mini grilled brie sandwich.  Nothing worth saying about that.  It's just your regular grilled cheese dipped in tomato based soup.  We also ordered the Firefly Fries mixed with Parmesan, herbs and aioli.  I liked these fries.  It wasn't too cruncy and not soggy.  My favorite dish in the whole restaurant is the Paella.  It's a dish containing saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage.  All mixed together made my mouth feel like it was partying.  I know a little over dramatic.  But, it's the only way I can describe how good it tasted.\n\nThe service was okay.  I think our server was getting mad at us because our party was always unsure of what to order.  I really didn't care since it was a day of celebration.  He had to constantly come back to check if we were ready.  We all ordered at our own pace.  \n\nI would go back just for an evening out to drink and get drunk.  It's a fun atmosphere and always seem joyous.  I've never seen any fights there or any drama going on.  They're definitely headed in the right direction.\n\nUpdate:  10/20/2007\nMy bestfriend, Alisa, decided to have her 3rd 30th birthday here.  Reservation was for 7pm so we didn' t have to wait for a seat.  Good thing coz I wasn't about to wait in the cold outside with the wind blowing all over the place.  \n\nAfter being seated, a sangria was waiting for me to be sipped and eventually gulped, and a menu to stare at until I was ready to order.  \n\nWhat's good here?\n*  Firefly*fries [parmesan, herbs, aioli] \n*  Shrimp tempura  [beer-battered, ponzu dipping sauce]\n*  Paella [saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage] \n*  SANGRIA* [marinated 3 days for maximum enjoyment]\n*   MOJITOS* [lime, fresh mint, rum cocktail] \n*  Terra y Mare skewers  [grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde]\n*  Smoked salmon toasts  [brioche toast, sour cream, pickled ginger, capers] \n*  Warm spinach salad  [artichoke, red pepper, pine nuts, feta] \nService this time was great and I can't complain with her efficiency.\n\nWhat I thought was mediocre.\n*  Tomato soup  [mini grilled brie sandwich] \n*  Crispy duck rolls [cherry hoisin sauce]\n*  Babyback ribs [steamed, mango BBQ sauce]\n*  Filet mignon sliders  [mini burgers with Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions] \n\nI still would go back over and over again for the atmosphere.  I always have fun here."

Of course I ordered the mushroom tart because I LOVE mushroom (see my russian family bistro review). The fried calamari is a bit oily though. Everything else was good, but not so spectacular that I remember the individual dish to put on this review.\n\nWe also ordered a pitcher of sangria, but later on I found out that I actually do not like sangria. So my boy had to finish the whole pitcher by himself. Not that he's complaining.\n\nI'd definitely come back!"

S'Tapas usually are Spanish specialties. Those are anything but Spanish. No taste or should I say all taste the same. Looks like they use the same sauce base for all. Yerk!.  No management either. Staff comes out of the kitchen with mouthful chewing on food and are constantly chatting. I went to the bathroom and this waiter was   leaning against the wall, behind my back, texting on his cell, while I was taking a leak. We left and no one said thank you or goodbye or anything whatsoever, not even the two little smarties at the host stand. I will NEVER go back and certainly not recommend it either.

S"Ah, Vegas.  Revisiting the past again.  I actually ate at Firefly for the first time years ago when my wife and I were visiting with our friends and were guided here by an old high school friend that lives in LV now.  Prior to eating at Firefly, my wife and I had never had Tapas.  Being in town for CES last weekend with the same friends that came the first time, they requested to revisit Firefly for a dinner and we obliged.\n\nWhen my wife found out that they wanted to come back, she had a feeling of discomfort associated with the restaurant that should couldn't really place the reason behind at the time.  But as soon as we walked in, it came back to her; she didn't like sitting at the lounge table.  For those of you who have not been before, be aware that there is a bar, a set of normal tables with chairs and booth seats, and then a number of tables surround by low couches that require leaning over a lot to eat.  We requested a normal dining table this time to appease her, and it made all the difference.\n\nWhen we arrived on Thursday night after our first day at CES, it was already pretty hopping.  We put our names down for a table and went to the bar.  I remembered having the Sangria last time, but didn't remember how good it was.  I asked the bar tender if I could try the red wine Sangria (effectively ordering it), but then he actually made a mini version of the drink with fruit bits and all for me to try it.  I then asked to try the white and champagne Sangrias (meeting more and more resistance each time, understandably) before ordering the champagne version.  The fact that he was wiling to let me sample all three was greatly appreciated.  Great bar tender.  My wife ordered a Mojito (so-so), and then a couple caramel apple martinis because they blew her away.  Highly recommended.\n\nSoon we were told a table was available for us and we sat at a comfortable, standard table.  Here is what we ordered (that I can recall) and our impressions:\n\nShrimp ceviche - Nice shrimp, but way too citrusy (sour).\n\nStuffed dates - A great blend of sweet and savory (dates + bacon).\n\nFrench Fries - A great filler. Shoestring with Parmesan and herbs. Ask for aioli to dip in.\n\nManchego Mac 'n Cheese - A favorite for my wife (the mac 'n cheese connoisseur).  Very good and cheesy.\n\nTerra y Mare Skewers - Tasty and good quality filet, shrimp, and chorizo.\n\nChicken and Chorizo stuffed mushrooms - Sizzling awesomeness.  They're hot when they first come out, so be careful.\n\nLamb skewers - Very good and tender.\n\nFried calamari - I don't like squid, so I didn't really partake, but the other three said it was very good.\n\nCamarones a la diabla - Shrimp with a nice kick and a smoky sauce.  Good stuff.\n\nChocolate Tres Leches Cake - Amazing! Melts in your mouth. No chewing necessary.  Super soft and moist.  Drooling...\n\nWith the 10 entrees and multiple rounds of drinks, you'd think the bill would be nuts, but it was around $150 total, which is perfectly reasonable for 4 people given the quality, variety, and quantity.  I recommend you check this place out if you want a great tapas experience.  There's a nice cigar bar in the same strip mall, too.\n\nSummary: Great food. Very reasonable prices.  High quality.  Full bar.  Lots of parking.  Place gets hopping at night, so come early or plan for a wait.  Great bar service and drinks.  Lounge seating and normal tables.  Lounge seats require leaning forward a lot.  Highly recommended restaurant."

S"We tried to get a reservation but they were booked, but we decided to try our luck at the door. We waited a good half hour, but it was totally worth it!\n\nWe started with a pitcher of their red sangria. $28 and two of us couldn't finish it, and we love Sangria! They marinate it for 3 days and it's delicious, full of apples but not too sweet. Great bargain, easily good for 3 people!\n\nWe ordered a variety of plates, all of which were reasonably priced and delicious!\n\nApple and Manchego Salad - $4.00. Really different, with tiny strips of apples and manchego cheese, with a light dressing and a hint of almonds. Not like anything else I've ever had. 5 stars!\n\nTuna Tartare - $8.00. A nice portion with an unusual taste. I found it light and pleasant, and I normally don't enjoy any type of raw fish at all. 5 stars.\n\nMushroom Tart - $7.50. Light pastry with mushrooms and boursin cheese and some sort of sauce that was delightful. Thoroughly enjoyed. 4 stars.\n\nBaked Tetilla - $8.00. A cheese fondue type dish with tomoatoes and toast. It was good, although probably my least favorite dish of the night. Nothing special, but certainly not bad. 4 stars.\n\nHam & Cheese Croquettas - $5.00. 3 small but delicious croquettas that we totally inhaled. Absolutely a must! 5 stars.\n\nSteak & Mushroom Skewers - $8.50. Absolutely heavenly. Tender steak, huge mushrooms, and an amazing creamy red wine sauce that just melted in your mouth. AWESOME! 5 stars.\n\nDessert Platter - $12.00. We had flan, passion fruit cheesecake, chocolate tres leches and lemon-berry tarts. The flan was delightful--light and caramely and flavorful. The passion fruit cheesecake was really different, a hint of the fruit and lots of cream! chocolate tres leches is definitely not my thing, although my dining partner liked it--I thought the chocolate took away from the dish (least favorite thing I ate all night). Lemon-berry tarts were wonderful! Light and tart and creamy! good value!\n\nWe heard about this place from a waiter on the STrip who said this is where locals eat--you need to eat here!"

There is nothing "amazing" or "fantastic" about it.  \n\n*Mushroom Tart with Boursin Cheese- I love mushrooms and Boursin but thepuff pastry was dry and tough- not soft like a croissant- just a hard piece of pastry dough. \n*Steak & Mushroom Skewers- Boring, steak isn\'t very good and the sauces are mediocre.  Tastes like diner food.\n*Baked Brie- this was one of the best dishes- the fondue and tomatoes make a nice combo\n*Kobe Sliders- these are good although I hated the green chili that was hidden inside the beef- no mention of that on the menu\n*Fries- these are pretty decent and the accompanying aioli is good\n*Tomato soup- good but not much different from Campbell\'s\n\nIf I found myself in the adjoining mall (highly unlikely) and wanted a quick bite- sure I would stop here- but it\'s not worth seeking out...'

S"So I went on a Yelp'ing frenzy on my last Vegas trip since I did more eating out than I did partying and sleeping. It's usually hard to find tapas bars in Orange County, or at least ones I like eating at. So when I came upon this one in Vegas, I debated on writing to the owner and having them consider getting one out in Orange County...like really. I highly recommend you come here, bring a couple friends, grab a couple glasses of sangria, order a couple of dishes, order a couple of more, and then have yourself a darn good time. Bacon wrapped dates...very few places have these, only one other place (in Whittier, CA...) ties with this place on this dish. This is currently my newest addiction...I have no idea what it is about this savory-sweet combo that gets me every time, but it does...Also get the firefly fries and the tierra y mar skewers...flavors that'll leave you wanting more, like a good strip tease. Next Vegas trip, I'm heading straight for this place for more yummy!"

We decided we better arrive early so we wouldn't have to wait. We showed up right at 5 and were seated immediately, but by 6 the restaurant was full! \nThe three of us split the following menu items: Artichoke Toasts, Stuffed Dates, Roasted Eggplant Cannoli, Pork Empanadas, Shrimp Tempura, Filet Mignon Sliders, Passion Fruit Cheesecake, Gelato, and Caramel Flan. \nWe loved everything! Our favorite item was the Stuffed Dates, definitely give those a try! My parents enjoyed the Sangria and I had a delicious cappuccino (it's ok if it's after 10am in the states, right?).

We sat at like a big rectangle coffee table with a sectional on one side and a couple of cushioned cubes on the other.  Real casual and relaxing.  Perfect for tapas, sangria, and hanging with the friends.  \n\nWe were feeling a good from the sangria.  You have to get this.  We got a couple of pitchers of the red.  It was good.  Real good.  I think too good.  ;)  We knew we wanted to the stuffed dates.  Stuffed with bleu cheese and an almond, wrapped in bacon and drizzled with a red win reduction.  Yeah, we got more than one order.  A lot more.  The rest we just told our server to bring us his favorites.  There was the artichoke toasts which we liked.  The steak and mushroom skewers, nice.  Paella was pretty good.  The Fillet Mignon sliders were not bad but the crispy onion rings on that plate was light, crispy and delicious.  And a lot of others that the sangria made me forget.  \n\nGreat place to eat some good food and hang out with your friends.  \n\nComing back here for sure."

Although I was eating different items, I could not find a dish that was so stellar that  I yearned for when I lie in bed. My tastebuds weren't on fire but I was OK with that because I was having a lot of fun catching up with my friends who were vacationing from California. We were chatting and picking at food and when we got thirsty we had a gulp of sangria and went back to chatting and picking at food. In the end, we ate and drank everything. I think this is a great place to hang out, eat a little to hold you over for dinner, and loosen up for the night ahead.

S'I and company dropped in here for a quick bite to eat after arriving in Vegas.\n\nThe aforementioned "company" ordered weird non meat dishes. Ugh. I cannot comment on what they had, as I ignore things that don\'t include dead animals in them.\n\nI can, however, speak for the Thai Beef Salad with dead cow and the Filet Mignon Sliders with more dead cow.\n\nMmmmmmm...animals.\n\nOk, ok, I\'m just giving my vegan hosts a bad time. Firefly is totes vegan friendly and also caters to us uncouth carnivores. The best of both worlds.\n\nThe Thai Beef Salad was super delicious. Huge slices of meat come with this salad; this is no dinky portion at all. The flavors were fresh and lively and the beef was served at the perfect temperature to compliment an Asian flavored salad. When I have a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate with my beef I really find appropriate meat temperature an important feature of the relationship. \n\nHowever, after the Thai salad the sliders left me a bit on the outs. A good size...but holy cow (literally) the meat was SO SALTY!!! Like, somebody had a salt seizure up in that kitchen. Simma down now with the salt on the filet. We aren\'t aboard The Mayflower, there is no need to salt meat so severely that it will not spoil after a 6 month trip across the Atlantic ocean. I mean, this is filet mignon, COME ON!!! Minus 2 stars for dead animal abuse.\n\nAlso, the Gin & Tonic could have been a little less short on the poor.\n\nBut that salad, yum!'

They use manchengo cheese for their mac n cheese that I absolutely love, and have not seen it ever used for mac n cheese. Got the sliders which were delicious, but I had to scoop off some of the cheese cuz I can only have so much blue cheese.

We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.\n\nNot to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me.

The mac 'n cheese was extra cheesy and creamy. The vegetables and lentils had a fresh citrus flavor. My boyfriend liked the duck dumplings, but thought that they had too much sauce (I'm sure that you could ask the chef to go light on the sauce). The ham and cheese croquets were my boyfriend's favorite. They looked like gourmet tater tots and were very creamy.\n\nEven though we were stuffed I ordered the caramel flan for dessert. It wasn't that gelatinous stuff that you get a Chevy's. It was delightfully creamy and smooth.\n\nGo to Firefly even though it's not on the strip.

Their late night menu is still pretty impressive with a vast selection of burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, and even some Asian and Mexican specialties.\n\nOn the night that I went though, I wasn't too hungry, but I wanted to fill my stomach with something to cap of the night before going back to my hotel.  So I settled with ordering their Short Rib Sliders.\n\nShort Rib Sliders --  http://bit.ly/11dsW4p\nI was pretty impressed that it came with four sliders instead of the usual two or three.

After exhausting yourself thusly, head to the Grand Lux and order the Grand appetizer platter for the table (try to do this around 3 or 4 am). This is way too much food for two people, but it's affordable and tasty (I especially love the Asian inspired items on the plate). \n\nWhile you wait the 45 minutes for your food to arrive, take in the sites: pretty and polished Venetian clientele dressed up and popping energy tablets with their wine (I think they're in from LA). Sitting here is reinvigorating! It makes you realize that you can stay up and play some more poker! You can drink five more $1 Miller Lights at O'Sheas!

For night number 2, I had developed a strange craving for soup. Had a generous bowl of the vegetable and loved it from the first bite to the last.

S'Great food, huge portions at decent prices!  This is the upscale version of Cheesecake Factory, so you will notice that the decor and menu is very reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory.  I love the food here and I love that it\'s open 24 hours!\n\nThis restaurant is located on the bottom level of The Venetian.  My friends and I were starving and got here around 1am to a short line.  Their menu consists of a section for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night.  Dinner lasts until midnight and late night is from midnight to 6am.  Lucky for us, they said they were still serving up dishes from the dinner menu when we got there so we had a wide array of options to choose from.\n\nMy friend and I both ordered an "appetizer salad".  I got the Greek Salad and added chicken.  My friend got their spicy calamari salad.  When we got our plates we were shocked because it was still a huge portion!  I added chicken to my salad because I didn\'t think I\'d be full off just greens, oh how wrong I was!  Neither of us were able to finish it.  \n\nMy two other friends split an entree salad called the "Sheila\'s Dream" and it was sooo good!  Seriously, a party in your mouth.  It had an eclectic blend of ingredients and the dressing was top notch, I\'m gonna get that the next time I come.  So worth the $12!\n\nEven though everything on the menu here is delish, I\'d strongly recommend the Miso Glazed Salmon - best dish on the menu!!\n\nAs far as desserts go, their strawberry shortcake dessert here is excellent!  I\'m inclined to say it is the best ever - it\'s fresh strawberries, shortbread, and cream all thrown onto a plate together so it isn\'t a sliced piece of cake like you\'d find at other restaurants.  You just have to try it for yourself.  Drooool...'

LOL.\n\nIn any case, I came here for a late lunch one time, and I ordered what I expected to be a light snack - Asian Nachos - but as it turns out, the portions were HUGE.\n\nThe Asian Nachos consisted of crispy fried wontons covered with chicken in a sweet-hot peanut sauce that was topped with Wasabi cream and melted cheese...and on top of that, there was fried rice in the middle of the dish. MMM....this dish was pretty yummy!!\n\nIn addition to the nachos, I also had a Spicy Calamari Salad which consisted of crispy calamari, organic greens, carrots, cucumber and green onions tossed with a delicious spicy vinaigrette!! This salad also came in a large portion and could be easily shared between 2 people.

It goes without saying that the deserts are sensational, but the dinner menu is just brilliant. They have two menus - the 'Skinny' menu (appropriately in a skinny format) if you're after healthier options and a regular menu. As others have said - very refreshing to have the option given that there are not a lot of veges involved in most fast food joints (potatoes being the main exception in the guise of fries of course!). We were surprised at the extensive range of things to choose from as well as the really very reasonable pricing. The hard part was trying to decide what to have! I had the fresh-made guacamole and it was hands-down the BEST I've ever had. My gf had Tuscan chicken off the skinny menu and he loved his as well. Servings are generous without being over the top. The atmosphere was great, nice little booths and they seemed to cater really well to families and large groups as well having a glance around us. Bathrooms exceptionally clean.

Ashley was kind enough to switch it out for us , and offered salad or soup while he waited! \n\nShe was great on our refills, and was very sweet. Overall great food, greatttt service, (thanks Ashley!) and wonderful atmosphere! We will be back!"

The portions were huge, as is consistent with the Cheesecake Factory, which is in someway affiliated with the Grand Lux (again, not the most educated review).  I ordered the fried chicken and waffles.  It was basically a belgian waffle with chicken fingers over top of it, but the food made my night.  The bread they serve as an appetizer is also pretty delicious.  Overall, a great dining experience.  I can't remember the name of my server, or anything in particular from that aspect of the meal, which is usually a good thing."

The typical hash browns, omelet, watery eggs, fruits, yogurt, cereal, make your own toasts, bacon, sausage...which also includes a beverage.  It was only around $15 for this or you could choose something from the menu which I did another day.  Their corned beef hash was the worst I could have possibly tasted, we were hoping it would taste the ones similar to Bellagio's room service or the one at The Cafe at TheHotel at Mandalay Bay.  \nWe only came here because it is located in the Venetian Hotel where we had stayed.

The soup was perfectly creamy, not too overwhelming.\n\nThey have a late night menu from 12am-6pm which means that they are open 24 hours a day!

They also have a $15 "express breakfast" which is really a small buffet with an Omelet station, fruit, oatmeal, muffins, pastries, breakfast meats and toast. Coffee and juice also included so a good value. Bad thing about it was the "conventioneers" who descended in masses and lined up for this breakfast so to get an omelet took forever. Coffee was great also, very rich and yummy! We did stop in at their bar one afternoon for a cocktail, I had one, okay two, Clementine Crush cocktails made with orange vodka and fresh juices, delish!!

S"The Grand Lux Cafe is located in The Venetian Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas. The Venetian for those of you who may not know, is a very beautiful resort. There are beautiful interior features and rooms, a fabulous casino and a lot of places to dine at. There is something for everyone, from high end restaurants to snack bars. To each his own and I'm sure that even the most demanding diner will enjoy one of the restaurants. For me, I love coming to the Grand Lux Cafe because it has an upscale feel to it without the pricey menus. The fare is reasonable for resort dining and it's a very comfy atmosphere. \n\nI came here for dinner on this particular evening and we were seated promptly. Upon being seated, the waitress took our drink orders, customary green bottle and water with a lemon wedge. A basket with fresh baked bread was also served. Next we proceeded to decide on what appetizer to have. We agreed on this creation called a Double Stuffed Potato Spring Roll. Let me tell you, it's awesome! Imagine a lumpia wrapper with mashed potatoes in it, served halved, crispy with melted cheese and topped with green onions, applewood bacon and a sour cream dipping sauce... I was absolutely in appetizer heaven! Probably not something you can partake in everyday, but a must when you are on vacay and enjoying dining out!  For dinner, I settled on the Ribeye and my dining companion had the Shrimp Scampi served on a bed of Pasta... I ordered the Ribeye medium rare, and that's the way I got it! Now that made me a happy diner. Now, it's not easy to prepare a Ribeye because you can't see it cooking inside, but they do a great job here. I was impressed because it wasn't a thick piece and the thinner they are, the harder they are to prepare. I glanced over at my dining companion and saw that she was happily enjoying her Scampi. There were lot's of generous sized shrimp and the pasta looked delicious! We enjoyed our dinner here and as for dessert, well, there wasn't any room left! Definitely a favorite whenever in Vegas, I shall return next trip!"

And you know what? The garlic- bleu cheese burger and fries were amazing.....even my slow braised short rib grilled cheese sandwich hit the spot. \n\nI have overloaded on bad white carbs yesterday and today but this was one of the times it was more worth it...and I'll do it again! =) service was wonderful and woohoo for 24hr restaurants that are GOOD!  It's far from our hotel but well the walk was worth it =D definitely recommend this place for some late night munchies and dining. =D I just wish had a bigger appetite to try their other dishes...which I heard everything on their menu is pretty good.

Instead, they came up with a concept for a new restaurant, and bam, you've got Grand Lux Cafe.\n\nThe menu is similar to Cheesecake Factory's, better actually, so if you like CF, you'll love Grand Lux Cafe. I've never ordered anything here that I've disliked. It's definitely the best 24 hour restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nThe food is delicious, the prices are right, the service is always great, and I love the ambiance. Take my advice, if you're going to eat at a hotel and you're on a budget, eat here! Our group ate at the Caesars Palace food court (Cypress Street, check out my review), and we ended up paying the same, if not more than Grand Lux Cafe, and the food at GLC, is 10 times better!"

The menu has a large variety- burgers, salads, pasta, steak, Chinese, Mexican etc.- it would be a safe bet for diverse palates. The prices are medium, what you would expect at a diner-ish restaurant at Vegas.  The service is pretty decent too, but it's definitely a hit or miss.  I've came here at 3am before and my server took FOREVER doing everything or is no where to be found.

Anyway, his attitude from that point was to ignore us throughout our entire meal. \n\nWaiter didn't serve us our food, and someone else refilled our waters. The place wasn't busy, so I don't know where he was the whole time. \n\nI ordered the Grand Lux Burger Melt which was awesome. It was a spin on a regular patty melt, but was on parmesan bread instead of rye and had lots of melty cheddar. It was delicious. \n\nMy man ordered the spicy chcken on flat bread. It was ok, but not spicy at all and it didn't hold together well. \n\nStll no waiter. \n\nWaiting. Getting pissed. Oh, here he is filling  our waters. Not looking at us, but instead scanning the rest of the place. What's he looking for? Someone to come pull up his sagging pants and comb ihis ridiculous hair? Gone again. \n\nComes back with the check. No talking, just drops it on the table. Meanwhile, I'm looking with envy at another table that has a good, attentive waiter. \n\nI scratched out the tip section and was going to write a note telling him that if he wants tips he ought to engage his customers in small talk or at least be polite. \n\nI almost complained at the hostess desk, but thought better of it.

S"i love grand lux.  it's the type of place where you and all your friends can go and everyone will find something they like on the menu.  everything i've ever ordered has been great.  it's usually crowded, so try to go early mornings or late nights.  \n\nthe cocktails are sooo good.  some of my favorite menu items are the bbq chicken pizza, greek salad (ask for some grilled chicken on top), and the ahi tuna salad.  i think it's funny that this place is owned by the cheesecake factory.  they have similiar menu items, but the food is soooo much better!  and they serve their bread warm unlike cheesecake factory."

S"I was surprised to find out the Grand Luxe was a chain restaurant tied with Cheesecake Factory.  I personally don't care for Cheesecake Factory so this was a pleasant surprise that their menu vastly differs from their counterpart.  Their menu was pages and pages in length.  I wanted to order so many items!\n\nStaying at the Palazzo in December had led us (6 girls) not want to venture out much in the cold and just dine in primarily The Palazzo or the Venetian.  It so happened that we ended up here for both breakfast/lunch and dinner this past trip.  For breakfast/lunch they offer lunch specials for a reasonable price and from the looks of what my friends ordered, the portions seem filling to the point of having leftovers.  After a night of drinking, I always crave soup.  My friend mentioned pho earlier and we read the zen noodles description which sounded like pho so I thought to give it a try.  It tasted similar to pho, but lacking flavor.  It did come with chili, basil, and bean sprouts.  It did the job and hit te spot- and was enjoyable.  For dinner, I had an ahi appetizer which was fantastic.  It tasted very fresh and was accompanied by 3 types of salad: carrot, cucumber, and bean sprouts.  The cucumber and bean sprout salads were delish but the carrot salad really didn't have much flavor.  I could say that I enjoyed both my meals and that I wouldn't mind coming back.\n\nOn the other hand, some of my friends cared to disagree.  For lunch, my friend wanted a pickle to add to her sandwich but they said they didn't have pickles.  Not a big thing to me, but this displeased my friend.  For dinner when we came back, they had 2 soups of the day: cream of chicken and clam chowder.  3 of my friends ordered the clam chowder and maybe 20 minutes into waiting, the manager had to come up to our table to apologize and say they ran out of clam chowder.  What a disappointment to hear that the chowder was the special but they didn't have any left because they ran out of clams.  On both lunch and dinner meals, service was lacking.  It took at least 20-30 minutes+ wait for food.  Water was scarce and so was the waiter.  \n\nFood was good but questionable if worth the service/wait...."

That's just ridiculous. Why not charge $20 while you're at it? \n\nThe service was fine. I'm sure there are better items on the menu, but to have the balls to charge me half my meal for a few ounces of liquid and not show anywhere the prices, you guys get a rare 2 stars from me."

S"Honestly, The Grand Lux Cafe is one of my top five favorite restaurants and has held this prestigious honor since it opened up.\n\nHere is my top 10 list as to why The Grand Lux Cafe deserves the honor:\n\n10. The menu is huge. If you can't find something that you utterly enjoy on it, go back to McDonald's.\n\n9. The wait staff is always accommodating. You can substitute things and it will still come out the exact way you asked, on the first try. ( I have a picky mother-in-law and there are ALWAYS substitutions when she orders her meals)\n\n8. If you are lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar and want to eat there, they set you up right with all serving utensils and place mat. Plus, you get your drinks faster, score!\n\n7.Seating. We never have a bad table, and comfy seats.\n\n6. Plenty of tables. When a restaurant is as popular as this one, they need lots of tables and The Grand Lux Cafe has plenty. I have yet to wait over 10 minutes  for a seat, even on a holiday weekend.\n\n5. Artichoke Dip. This is my favorite appetizer ever and the Factory does it well. Spinach, artichokes, cheese=Heaven.\n\n4. Avocado Egg rolls. Really, I have no need to say more.\n\n3. Cheesecakes! In every flavor imaginable. And they all rule! They even have sugar-free ones for those of us that can't have sugar. Yes!\n\n2. Blue-cheese stuffed olive martinis! These little morsels rock and The Grand Lux Cafe hand-stuffs them. Mmm...\n\n1. And Finally, Miso Salmon. I can't even find the words as to how great this dish is. The fish, the sauce, it is so freakin' good. I have been to the restaurant when they were all out of it (it has to marinade over night and they only make a certain amount) and I think I cried. Thank goodness there are so many other delicious dishes but the Miso Salmon, just might be my request for a last meal."

The portions are so ridonkulously huge, you could easily feed a herd of elephants with one dish.\n\nI had the Zen Noodles and they were so much better than I expected. The broth was light, chicken stock and lemongrass goodness, accompanied by a grocery store of choices like basil leaves, bean sprouts and jalapeno pepper. It was soupy wonderland. I wanted to bathe in it.\n\nService was fantastic too. Definitely come here for an affordable meal on the Strip."

S"I was hesitant to be the asshole with the one-star review but as I recall more and more of my visit here, I feel the Grand Lux Cafe truly deserves a big ZERO.\n\nLet me preface that my nine friends and I came to this hole as a collectively quiet and borderline hungover group at around 5AM after a looong night. That is to say, we weren't even close to our usual rowdy level, but actually resembled a group of elderly men and women who were REALLY, REALLY SORE AND HUNGRY.\n\nWe stumbled to the front desk to ask for seating for nine. There was no one there. We waiting for another couple minutes, searching for someone to help us and found a couple of the wait staff helping other tables (there were probably a total of five occupied in the whole place) and a few people chatting near the back. Once someone noticed the huge scattered group, they ambled over to ask what they could do for us. As if it wasn't obvious already, we asked for a table for nine. The hostess told us to wait while they could find an open table and the wait would be around 10-15 minutes. Seriously? As we waited patiently yet astounded, we saw her and a few people walking around... I assumed they were setting up a table large enough for us but wondered why it could possibly take so long with no one else waiting and hardly anyone dining. \n\nAfter what felt like an eternity in Vegas time, we were sat at a banquet-style table (how hard could that have been to put together if it took any time at all?) with menus dropped off at the edge of the table for us to pass down to each other. The waiter left. He came back to ask what we wanted to drink. We said, waters, please. The waiter left. When he came back, he sloppily poured us all waters and left some of us with half-empty glasses. After asking us if we were ready to order five times in just as many minutes, he didn't come back at all. We had to flag down a DIFFERENT waiter to take down our simple-as-it-gets breakfast orders. Once that was all situated, it was purely a waiting game. \n\n10 minutes went by... 20... 30... by 40, everyone had forgotten why we were even there and I was straining to find ANYONE who worked in the place to ask where the F our food was. As if they decided it was long enough, by 50 or 60 minutes, our food showed up. Eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. You'd think with that kind of preparation time they could also get these beginner dishes right. Some dishes came with extra sides of meats that were never ordered but would later be charged e$$$tra; some came without the sides they were promised; and one or two dishes were forgotten altogether.\n\nWhen the bill came just as late as the food, we realized we had been had. The cheap dishes were almost doubled the cost on the menu bc the waiter never informed us of how much a side of three slices of bacon would cost, and some extras were brought out even without our consent. But we were over it. So, so over it. We paid the bill and left just as quietly as we came. Though I really wish we would have just dined and dashed (which is something my friends and I do not have the heart to do but it seemed so appropriate at the time).\n\nNever again."

Even if the line is long the wait is usually less than 15 minutes.  The menu is huge and there should be something for everybody.  The portions are big and the food served pretty quickly.

S"Like most people have described, it is like the cheesecake factory. I would also give the cheesecake factory 3 stars for these same reasons (to help you gauge my scale here). I place a lot of weight on the food quality and taste at a restaurant (go figure). Unless the server were to throw food on me and break the plate over my head I wouldn't take away more than a star for service. That being said, the service was good, food presentation was attractive, and the place was clean. No points given up there. It's just that the food tasted like chain restaurant food to me. Maybe some folks like that, but when I eat out I want fresh tasting ingredients and quality foods. It is very hard to find that these days though.\n\nIf you are out for a meal with huge portions and a good palatable dining experience, then this place will be fine. The price is right too. If you want a place that has ingredients that were never frozen and prefer a more natural and fresh taste, I think you will have to look elsewhere."

My favorite is the Sunday night pasta, where they take short rib bits, sausage, steak, and other "leftovers" and mix it into their sauce.

S"Put me in Grand Lux Cafe or a Cheesecake Factory location and slight decor differences aside, they are pretty much identical. Whether it's the atmosphere, the decor, the staff and the menu, these two are pretty much identical. \n\nIt's weird too, because as I entered the Venetian and was seeking for a place to eat that was affordable and quick (I had to head to the Blue Man Group show and only had one hour to eat), everyone told me that this Cheesecake Factory-like restaurant was around the corner. When they said that it was similar, I had no idea what I was in for and how much of a clone it really was. Stunning but neat.\n\nSo we proceeded to walk in and get seated and a very friendly waiter took care of us. We ordered some stiff drinks, 2 Scotchs, on the rocks. Then while my grandfather 'carbed up' with a clam pasta dish, I went for one of their big salads; in this case it was their Chopped salad - grilled chicken, bacon, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, egg and mixed greens. The whole thing was tossed in a vinaigrette. \n\nThe food came out from the kitchen in under fifteen minutes. The clam pasta dish according to my grandfather was very tasty and the clams very fresh. The salad was large and despite my best attempts, I could not finish it. The dressing complimented the rest of the ingredients well and I didn't feel heavy from eating it. The service was great and the prices were great as well.\n\nOverall this place is a nice addition to the Venetian. It provides reasonably good food at good prices and with good service. It's reliable and their menu is varied enough to satisfy all kinds of appetite. I didn't however find it to be as good as any Cheesecake Factory location I've been to. It's less tacky though which is a good thing."

We were able to put in our order by 11:55, but the food did not arrive until 1:20.  Our table was not served bread.  We had to flag the server down for drink and water refills.  We watched entire tables of people sit down, order, eat, and leave in time while we were waiting for our food.\n\nOur server repeatedly assured us that the food would be served soon, and a manager named Lisa even came by (after about an hour) to tell us that our orders would be up soon.  When the food finally did come, it was cold, had clearly been sitting, and was damn near inedible.\n\nI had Zen Noodles - described as pho on the menu, but in reality it was canned chicken broth (cold by the time it was served) poured over a clump of rice noodles with sliced chicken.  I was so disappointed - no seasoning, no flavor...just a lot of bland, cold, blech.\n\nNo one else in my group even came close to finishing or even enjoying their meal.  The "extensive menu" is full of previously frozen/processed/reconstituted crap.  The food was below Denny\'s in terms of quality or tastiness.  \n\nI think the icing on the cake was when we let our server know that we\'d like the check.  20 minutes later, she delivers the check.  One in our group was leaving from the restaurant to the airport for her 3:30pm flight, so she asked if she could close out first.  The server said yes, grabbed the check, and we watched her go EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE POS TO CLOSE OUT THE CHECK...checking on other customers, talking to another server...it was almost like she was wandering around looking for something else to do just so that my friend would miss her plane.  When we asked the manager, Lisa, for help, she walked away from me and told me that they were really busy and the server would take care it when she could.\n\nWould never come back.  Hope this tourist trap hellhole gets converted into a roller skating rink or a dog salon or something useful.'

Pastries, omelet bar, waffles, fresh delicious fruit, potatoes, more eggs, sausage, bacon, oatmeal, and even cereal. Too much. And all for 20 buckaroos.

It's not the healthiest restaurant choice, but damn is their food good....\n\nI've always like the Cheesecake Factory for really one dish (Shrimp Scampi yay!) and one dish alone, and my initial impression of the Grand Lux Cafe was that they were a bit similar to Cheesecake Factory.  I didn't realize then, that they are owned by the same company...but I digress....\n\nAt the Grand Lux though, I found more dishes that I like (Ahi Tuna burger, Double Stuff Potato Spring Rolls, to name a few).\n\nThis particular location was located right at the base of the set of elevators to the Venetian hotel rooms.  And at the time, being a Venetian guest, it was just way too easy to keep coming back.  Was I mad about that?  Of course not, how can you be mad at good food within walking distance to your elevator bank?\n\nI also appreciated their long hours.  I guess being a Vegas location and all, it was easy for them to open early (early enough for me) and stay open later.\n\nBut I guess do to the close proximity to the elevators and their long hours, they do get full fast.  Full enough to cause 2 long lines...which I never quite understood why there were 2 lines to begin with.  If you don't mind taking the food to go (which is the easiest thing to do when the line is too long) head over to the left area which kind of looks like a cafe.

So we ventured to the one in the Venetian that is 24/7.\n\nValerie G. and I were craving some carbs, so we decided to share the "Pasta With Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella". I\'m sooo glad we shared because the portion size is gigantic. We don\'t remember much (in fact it took about 10 minutes for us to correctly remember what we ordered) but what we do remember is that the pasta was amazing and totally hit the spot. Also the waitress was super nice and non-judging. Definitely a great (and possibly only) place to get some late night food especially after a night of BUR and pineapples...;)'

Food was 4 stars.\nCaucasian guy with red hair. Worst waiter I've ever had. He wasn't attentive. When we would ask for things...he didn't even let us finish our sentence but walked away already -_- I understand that he can hear us while walking, but at least make eye contact & let us finish our sentence!! Rude. And we felt he was kind of racist. What, just cause we're Asians you treat us differently? He was soo nice & attentive to the table behind us, they were Caucasian... Good food tho. The chicken on our pasta was very tender. They cooked it perfectly, but bad service by Paul. It was my first time there, I didn't want to come back.\n\n\nBut we gave it another try tonight... (03/24/13)\n\nThis time, we had Judith as our waitress.\nAnd let me tell ya, she's the best ever!! Most adorable & sweet lady we've ever had ^_^ she smiles a lot, very friendly, and most of all very attentive! We're soo glad we got her as our waitress. Ended our Vegas trip with a smile :)\n5 stars for her, 4 stars for food.\nThe clam pasta we got was a little salty. Probably cause of the clams. Other than that, my pasta pomodoro with chicken was delicious!! :D\n\nDefinitely coming back for Judith :)"

This restaurant is spacious and nicely appointed.    \n\nMy wife, I, and another couple stopped there after an evening show to have something light to eat.  My wife and I split a BLT sandwich accompanied by French fries.  The food was delicious and the amount was just right.  The bacon was very savory with a good texture, the toasted Italian-style sliced bread was crunchy and flavorful, and the fries crisp and tasty.  \n\nOne person in our group had dietary restrictions.  Although our waitress was very helpful, she could not answer all of that person's questions so she brought the manager to our table.

The server never introduced himself (we later found out his name was Joseph from our tab), we had to ask about 3 times to receive the beverages we ordered (a beer, water and an iced tea), his table side manner was just..plainly put, rude..he wasn't attentive, I felt like we were an inconvenience for him by being there.

Out of curiosity, noted this to the staff and they acknowledged that it was a problem. Dinner - nothing to write home about. It was OK. Not very flavorful - bland. As were leaving, we made a friendly and light-hearted comment to a gentleman, who appeared to be the manager, regarding the slippery and greasy floors. The irate and condescending response was not something I was expecting. Apparently the grease makes it way from the kitchen on the serves shoes. I have NEVER seen this before.

Our server took forever to get us our food (despite the fact that it was 2am and the tables were mostly empty... he could have at least come to us to apologize), he didn't once stop by to check on how our meal was going, and we sat there for 15 or 20 minutes with empty plates before he brought our check.  In fact, he only brought the check because my boyfriend yelled and got his attention.  THEN, it took a while for him to bring us the check and return credit cards.  We were all pretty irritated.\n\nVARIETY: 5/5.  Lots of late-night options, which we appreciated.  Everything from burgers to omelets to desserts.\n\nFLAVOR: 4/5.  Pretty good.  I enjoyed my winter vegetable soup, the beignets were deliciously fluffy (though I thought the sauces were unnaturally sugary and preservative-laden), and the burger was flavorful and well-cooked.\n\nVALUE: 4/5.  Considering it's Vegas, not too bad.  My soup was around $5, burger around $13.\n\nIt's a good thing I waited 2 days to cool off before writing this review... I had originally been considering giving it 1 star!  But in retrospect, the food really was pretty good.\n\nSo if you're ready to face the prospect of unapologetically slow service, I'd recommend coming here."

I have scars in my mouth to prove it. \n\nThere are two redeeming qualities for this location only: 1) It is in Vegas, so at least that means I am there and that always puts a smile on my face & B) One trip we were fortunate enough to observe a drunken woman get into an argument with another table from outside the restaurant.

At that point, we were not being picky, but boy were we in for a surprise!  First of all, the menu has everything!  A huge selection, and definitely something for everyone.  Secondly, the most amazing part was the fresh bread.  It was SOOO good, one of the best breads that I have ever eaten.  In fact, I almost wanted to cancel my order just so I could stuff my face with it.  It was warm, chewy, crusty on the outside, with the butter melted... ahh!  I wish I had some now.  But on to the main food...I got a chicken sandwich, but the portion was humongous, and it was really good.  The fries were delicious too.

O. or family to know it\n3. You are broke, but you don\'t want to eat Mall food in either of the 2 food courts\n4. The dinner show was sold out\n5. Cheesecake Factory is your favorite restaurant\n6. You want to stay close to the "Wizard of Oz" slot machines in hopes of getting one when it opens up\n7. You are tired of walking from the Sands Convention center all the way to your room, so you stop here to rest and eat\n\nThe Grand Lux Cafe is a moderately priced, large and usually noisy restaurant at the hub of activity in the Venetian. It is between the room elevators, the escalators to the self-park parking garage, some shops, an information and ticket buying booth for shows, and the casino floor, and near the grand walkway to the lobby.\n\nIt has a large menu with something for everyone, with most entrees around $15 - $25.  Very much like the Cheesecake Factory, since this restaurant was designed by the creators of the Cheesecake Factory, that ubiquitous faux fine dining restaurant so popular with the suburban mall rat crowd.\n\nActually, I had a pretty good salmon entree here, well presented and not too expensive. The two Gin and Tonics helped my enjoyment. \n\nService is slower, though, but you should be able to find something reasonably tasty to satisfy your poor, tired soul here in the town that wasn\'t built on winners.\n\nI forgot to see what Cheesecakes they offer here.'

S"Yes, I'm admitting it, I'm a cliche. \n\nI had a date to meet my guy at the Grand Lux. I didn't think I'd need to specify which one, although I did (which he denies). Haha. As you can imagine, the obvious error occurred. I was sitting outside the Grand Lux at Venetian (with no cell service, go figure) and I couldn't locate him. After 30 minutes I was finally able to locate a spot on the casino floor where I could get service. I called my man and tried to describe where I was in relation to him as he said he had been sitting inside the restaurant all this time. This being his first time inside either the Venetian or the Palazzo, was easier said than done. I finally convinced him to head to the other Grand Lux, which is where I thought I was. 10 minutes later, still no sign of him. Seriously? I was getting agitated. I finally got service again and was able to contact him. He described where he was and I was able to ascertain that he was actually at the Grand Lux opposite from me. Ooops, we were both at the same location from the beginning. I'll own it, that was my mistake. How he walked passed me without me noticing him on his way to the other Grand Lux, I'll never understand. As there are two locations at adjoining casinos, I have to hope that I'm not the only one this has happened to, or are we just that dumb? \n\nFinally, we're seated and ready to eat. I've been here a number of times before. Usually for some late night grub. The food isn't spectacular. I had a very regular omelette with no bells or whistles and my guy had a very regular sandwich. The food is standard cafe fair. I like the food ok, it's just nothing amazing. If I'm in the area, I'd probably prefer to go to First Food & Bar for their amazing strip views and fun bar foods, but this is a good alternative as well.

Not to mention the outside diners food goes right past everyone standing waiting for a table. So, if you sit outside know that I might have sneezed on your food. (I didn't really, but it's a possibility) after the long wait, takin to a table, tell the waitress you have a groupon and get ready to be treated like garbage and slowly! When we finally got our burgers, after being brought a water and not asked it we'd like something to drink, we were asked if we wanted our frozen hot chocolate then. Since we waited over 20 minutes for burgers I thought I better answer yes. It was brought in about two minutes. Great.

S'If you are seeking a pseudo-NY, carefully crafted WHIMSICAL experience on the Vegas strip, check this place out. \n\nTHE WAIT: It was kind of confusing. I understand waiting in line to get in (small space by the way).  But why did we have to wait once we were notified that our table was ready? We waited with five other families for another 5 minutes after being texted that our table was ready. Is that bad planning, or careful design? It was hard to tell. \n\nTHE SERVICE: The hostess and wait staff were strong. They were attentive and polite in spite of being incredibly busy. BUT I don\'t understand why a hostess would be tasked with busing tables. I am hoping they were short-handed and need to "make it work." That doesn\'t explain why she kept leaving the cleaning rag behind the podium. If you can, avoid being seated by the hostess stand. It seemed uncomfortable for the two groups forced to sit there. There was a food expediter in full view making sure the dishes looked good (correct, clean plates). It was nice to see his process as he carefully attended to each plate.  \n\nAMBIANCE: Serendipity 3 is serving visual "CHARM" and "WHIMSY" in droves. From the decor to the menus to the food. While it\'s gimmicky, it works. It looks like a young girl\'s tea party fantasy.  \n\nSAVORY DISHES: They were tasty. Everything was visually appealing and massive. We had the grilled  cheese with soup, the potato bites, the chicken satay wraps, and the Ahi salad.  It wasn\'t earth shattering, but we didn\'t expect it to be. We all liked our food well enough, but I would have been happy with a regular portion that had better flavor. I suppose the super-sized portions were a nod to the aforementioned WHIMSY.  \n\nBut no one goes to Serendipity 3 for the savory dishes, right? \n\nDESSERT: Among us we had the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, Red Velvet Sundae, and a Black and White Sundae.  Everything was good. It was sweet, and gooey (when appropriate), and rich. And massive.  \n\nI have no complaints about Serendipity 3. But I also have no compliments. I don\'t think it\'s fair to compare the Vegas location to the one in NY.  The purpose here is to have a tasty meal to accompany a decadent dessert in a carefully planned "WHIMSICAL" location. This place is about creating a feeling through decor, location (on strip), lovely food, and massive desserts. And to Serendipity 3\'s credit, they are successful.'

S"I've wanted to try this place for a long time now, every time I go to Vegas I see it and the building draws me towards it. Finally got to try it during my last trip out there. \nThe wait was ridiculous for inside seating (2 hours +) so we decided to grab some food inside of the Ceasar's food court then later go back to their outside window to order some frozen hot chocolates. \nThe line was pretty long still for the outside and we figured out why when we got up to the window FINALLY.. the guy who was working was all by himself struggling to juggle everything all at once, poor guy.\nWe had 7 girls so we shared two large frozen hot chocolates which are made for two people but it was just enough, just get extra straws if you're going to do so. It was really good but truthfully tasted like a typical chocolate milkshake but more chocolate flavorings which was good, I also actually liked the grittiness from the mixture.\nIt was good to try but not worth the $8.00"

S'This restaurant is located directly on the strip. It has an upscale Applebees feel. The desserts looked so good, lots of sundaes, I wanted to skip dinner.\n\nOur waiter was pleasant, but seemed too busy. It took him a very long time to bring drinks. \n\nThe food was good, not phenomenal, but not at all bad. I had the house made veggie burger. It was made of mostly grains (rather than beans). The sweet potato fries were good, not greasy, but could have been warmer. The steak fries were awesome.\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared a frozen hot chocolate. It was good, but I am not sure it really warranted the $11 price tag (no alcohol) for a regular size. \n\nI would go back here intentionally for a sundae.'

S"Came in on a Sunday afternoon for a late brunch without a reservation, and my party and I were debating whether or not we should take the 30-45 minute wait for a table, or just go to the walk-up counter for something quick. One hostess was on an iPad organizing the reservation list, and the other was greeting at the door. The one on the iPad was very nice and the other greeter was the rudest hostess I've ever seen. While we were quickly discussing our options, she continued to raise her voice and interrupt us in an effort to get our attention and see what we decided. She rolled her eyes at us, shook her head and sighed heavily and dramatically, as if we made her wait hours rather than thirty seconds.  There wasn't a line behind us, so I wasn't sure why she could act so impatient since she was just standing there with no other customers in sight. She looked me right in the eye as she behaved this way, appallingly unapologetic. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and I've never given attitude to a guest. Especially when they're deciding whether or not to give you business! That alone made the decision easy, we walked away!

I must confess I first heard of it on Oprah (their Frozen Hot Chocolate is her fav). \n\nThe building was very easy to find since it was hot pink in front of Ceaser's Palace. My friends and I sat at the bar because it was packed for lunch. The bartender was very friendly and recommended a Strawberries and Cream Mojito. So naturally, I had to try it. Yes it was expensive ($14 I think), but it was very big and absolutely yummy! We ordered a cheese pizza and finished it off with a Frozen Hot Chocolate for 2 (we shared it with FOUR people and still couldn't finish it!) \n\nOh if you order a salad...make sure to SHARE it, they're HUGE!\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant.

S"My review is solely for the desserts at Serendipity (I can't even remember the last time I ordered real food here)!\n\nWe mostly come here for the frozen hot chocolate, which is a steal if you check in on foursquare - free frozen hot chocolate with any purchase of $10!  So last time, we decided that our $10 purchase would be a cheesecake - I know, a $12 cheesecake?? We were pretty skeptical too, but we really weren't in the mood for much else. So lo and behold, our cheesecake comes out, and it is LITERALLY the HUGEST cheesecake I have ever seen. It could feed a family of 6. At least. There were 3 of us that day and we took over half of it home. And cheesecake is my forte too.  It was seriously incredible, I still rave about it. Not just for its size either.  The cheesecake itself was a lighter/fluffier consistency than most, which normally would bother me, but it made it much more doable to eat a LOT of it. It also wasn't too sweet, which was perfect for me. The crust is a mac nut crust and though I prefer graham crackers, the nuts were pretty good too.  Like I said though, expect to be taking most of it home or back to your hotel (:\n\nOh, and the frozen hot chocolate!  That's always a must if you come to Serendipity, isn't it??  Be sure you're sharing! Delicious and refreshing, chocolatey, just go try it, you'll see what I mean (:"

The reason I give it 2 stars is b/c of their poor service. It's a horrible place. It took us 10 minutes to get seated for 2 people, 10 minutes to even order, and they GAVE US THE CHECK 5 minutes into the dessert. What the heck is that service? It's common courtesy to give the check when requested, unless it's a fast food place I can understand. Overall, I'm not going back. Nor should you."

S"I went to Serendipity 3 to have a frozen hot chocolate.  I'd had one about 10 years ago in New York.  Honestly, I don't remember a thing about how it tasted but I figured it must have been good if there is now one in Vegas!\n\nThe place was crazy busy when we arrived but luckily I spotted a 'takeout' window on the side.  No biggie since I only wanted the frozen hot chocolate anyway.  Looking at the menu while waiting in line, I was shocked at the price for the frozen hot chocolate.  Most flavors were $11.  Flavors like 'peanut butter, mint or vanilla'.  No hint of fancy chocolate like Lindt or Ghirardelli flakes that might make the price worth it.  I bought anyway, the mochachino flavor, I wanted peanut butter but they were out and $12.97 later, ($1 for a plastic glass of tap water) I stood by the window and waited for my frozen hot chocolate.  They are fast, I will give them that, but what passed from the window into my hand was basically a grande frappucino at three times the price.  I'm not sure what others were raving about because nothing in that glass could come close to being worth the $11 price tag for the drink.  \n\nAs my friend and I wondered exactly why there are so many people at Serendipity we could only guess that 1 -they'd never been there before or 2- like me they couldn't remember having it the first time.  Apparently, if you actually sit down in the restaurant, the frozen hot chocolate is much larger which might have made me feel a tiny bit better.  However, either way, the melted milkshake with a load of whipped cream that is the frozen hot chocolate is not worth your time or money.  Go somewhere else.  There are plenty of gelato places in Vegas where you can get your ice cream fix if that is what you desire for 1/3 of the price."

S"Three stars only because the Crab Cake Sandwich was delicious. The fries met expectations, though the tartar sauce (?), I assume, had an aftertaste because of the metallic containment it was in. \n\nEven though the food was good and the prices were cheaper than I had expected since it is on the strip, my server wasn't up to par. If you sit inside, depending on where they seat you, you could possibly see the kitchen. I was disappointed that my server was touching her hair and face in the back of house area without washing her hands before handling our food. Though hair wasn't found on our plates, The lack of cleanliness was disappointing. Being in the f&b industry, and super anal about maintaining my professional, cleanly appearance, this was a definite turn-off. She wasn't personable at all, and treated my friend and I as if we were just young girls, as is familiar. She brought us water with apparent melted ice that indicated it was sitting there for a while. We asked for ice in the water for both of us, she brought us two new cups with ice filled to the rim. As I finished my food, she took away my plate and presented us with a check when my friend wasn't even half-way done with the meal; we might as well have ordered to-go! I still tipped her 20% just because I know tips are what we work for, but she definitely didn't deserve it. A meal is less appreciated when the service sucks.\n\nAlso, by all the other reviews I get from this place, by Yelpers, friends and family alike, I expected a better surrounding. The decor didn't live up Caesars palace. It was confusing figuring out whether the hostess was outside or inside. It was very awkward.\n\nI would still eat here again.

I didn't see much variety for food on the menu so just opted for an omelette. It came with a few pieces of potatoes...Anyway, the omelette was not good at all. It had no flavor, it was bland, and was just underwhelming. I guess it's not really their fault though, 'cause who goes to Serendipity 3 for food? Onto the frozen hot chocolate. IT WAS SO SWEET. Some people like that but for me, it was like drinking corn syrup by the gallon. I mean, it did satisfy my chocolate craving but only for the first three sips.

S'My friends have always talked about the frozen hot chocoloate at Serendipity in Vegas, but I\'m not much of a sweets person so always just thought "meh." However, while in vegas the past couple of visits, my sweet tooth kicked in and I decided to see what the hype was about\n\nNormally it gets packed late night and the hostess will get your # down on an ipad which will text you when your table is ready. You can always to-go your stuff at the window next door, but my friends have told me the frozen hot chocolate tastes better ordering it in the restaurant.\n\nEverything seems to be in big portions here & the HUGE menu (literally) is cute.\n\nFrozen hot chocolate for 2 - For my first visit my bf & I shared this. It was DELICIOUS! I was really mind blown that it wasn\'t overly sweet. The drink does is supposed to be 17 oz when you order the "for 2 size" the for 1 is 10 oz. I think it\'s cheaper to order frozen hot choco for 1 b/c the rest of the 5 oz in the for 2 seemed like it was just extra whipped cream. I love the chocolate shavings topped on the drink. It\'s fun to scoop and sip at the same time. Definite must try! Hard to describe the consistency, but it\'s icy and not too thick (for those that think it\'s a milkshake)\n\nHangover omelette - This is the perfect omelette that sounds delicious when you have a hangover so the name suits the food. Bacon, fries, mushrooms, and cheese inside an omelette yumm. My friend ordered this and it looked really good, I took a bite and it was a great combo of all the ingredients.\n\nCrab Cake Sandwich - I got this protein style. The nice crab cakes are wrapped in soft butter lettuce. I liked the crab cakes, it wasn\'t too oily and stuffed with a good amount of crab.The beefsteak tomatoes, bacon, and spinach accompanied the sandwich well. \n\nMint frozen hot chocolate - On my recent vegas trip 10/18/13, we decided to order this \'cause I\'m a big mint chip ice cream fan. My bf & I agreed this was a lot better than their original frozen hot chocolate and usually he\'s not a big fan of mint chip. Basically it\'s their original frozen hot chocolate, but they blend it w/ a scoop of mint ice cream! I guess it sort of tasted like the Andes mint candy\n\nMake sure you get a total rewards card at one of the casinos (Caesar, PH) so that you can get the total rewards discount pricing on the food & Points! A lot of the reviews here say the service isn\'t good, but we\'ve always had great friendly service the past couple times we\'ve been here. Food comes out pretty quick. One day I hope I hit the jackpot to try the Golden Opulence Sundae here ($1000 sundae!?)\n\nBTW if it\'s your first time I suggest you check around what other tables are ordering to see what you\'d like. I saw a couple of tables get the can\'t say no sundae and other sundaes that looked sooo good!!! Will be back to try their other menu items. I swear you can get fat just looking with your eyes'

S"The line to get into Serendipity 3 is usually pretty crazy, so I try to bypass that with the To-Go line outside.\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate (and it's cousins in different flavors) are ok. They really aren't that amazing. So if there is a really long line, move on, you aren't missing that much. Plus it doesn't really taste the same as the one you would get at the original Serendipity in New York.\n\nAnd for some odd reason it took a good 15 minutes for them to make my Classic Sundae. Scooping some ice cream into a cup and pouring some hot fudge on top really should not take that long. And to make matters worse, the $10 dessert was 2/3 whipped cream. I thought I paid for a sundae not a freaking can of shaving cream.\n\nOh and if you were eyeing the sliders, you might want to squint a little bit because those things are teeny tiny."

Though I thought it was good and the restaurant had a nice staff in the side snack bar and had a cute, kitschy look overall, I still think it is a little silly to pay $9 or whatever it is for a beverage that some might view as a cousin of the mocha frappucino. The chocolate used is yummy, the whipped cream is fresh, and the cool contrast of a rich drink you'd expect to have warm is appealing, but it's hard not to overlook this place as just an overpriced Vegas tourist trap. Not to mention you're gonna need a fat water to actually quench your thirst after slamming down one of these.

We strolled in a little after 1p on weekday and there wasn't a line.  Now, I'm sure if you wanted to sit outside (in the LV summer heat? you're nuts!) then you'll have a bit of a wait, but that's to be expected. One negative was the hostess who seated us, she didn't greet us nor said much. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and chock it up to her having an off day.\n\nOn a better note, our server was awesome! He was friendly and attentive. He even told us how they made the grilled cheese sandwich, ha. He was also on top of everything, refiling our drinks, making sure we got our Groupon and Total Rewards credit/discounts. No issues here.\n\nFood was good (we loved the fries!). It wasn't amazing, but it was good. We saved room for the Frozen Hot Chocolate because every table was getting one or two. It was good and the regular size is more than enough for two people to share. \n\nVerdict? Yum! Sure this place may be a bit overrated, but so what?

A very expensive milkshake at that. \nThey have decent service though, and a very efficient wait system going on now. The hostesses use ipads, and text you when your table is ready! Technology these days! I can\'t keep up. \nI have never used their to go service, so I can\'t rate them on that, but judging from how long the line is every time I pass by, it seems like it takes just as long. \nThis place reminds me nothing of the movie Serendipity. Kate Beckinsale (GIRL CRUSH!) and John Cusack share an ice cream at the Serendipity 3 in NYC right before Christmas, and it looks so romantic and peaceful. This Serendipity is loud and always crowded. Bah. \n2 1/2 stars.'

S"LOVE how there's an outdoor ordering window AND an actual sit down restaurant. I've ordered the frozen hot chocolate through the window numerous times and was amaaazing. I also ordered the sliders to go, and they were pretty filling and juicy for being small. \n\nWhen I finally came back when I was 21 to sit and eat at the actual restaurant with my girls, we sat in the outside terrace during Spring Break. It felt good to finally sit down and eat somewhere nice and yummy! Luckily we went during the late afternoon, so the wait was only 15 minutes. Usually when I stop by to get frozen hot chocolate at the outdoor window I see a bunch of people waiting outside to be seated. The service was really good, and our waiter was informative with what was popular items on the menu.\n\nI, of course ordered an omelet and was humongous! Really filling and definitely had to bring it back to the hotel to eat! It's the closest thing to the actual Serendipity that they have in NY, and really lives up to it's name."

S'*** REVIEW FOR THE DESSERTS ONLY ***\n\nMy older sister raved about this place for days, and I couldn\'t understand why until I actually had the chance to visit. I\'m usually not a fan of ice cream, but Serendipity\'s sundaes got me hooked! I definitely left the place feeling a few pounds heavier, but it was well worth the price.\n\nMy friends and I ventured to Vegas and decided to come here since it was 100+ degrees outside. We ordered:\n\nFrrrozen Hot Chocolate (~$10): Awesome. It really does taste like hot chocolate, albeit cold. This is probably the best dessert to get if you\'re really watching your budget but still want a taste of Serendipity\'s goodness. My friends finished this super quick, and they don\'t normally have sweet tooths.\n\nAudrey\'s "Can\'t Say No" Sundae (~$14): Oh, my gosh. I think I had a heart attack while eating this since there was so much sweetness, but it was super tasty! It includes humble pie with peanut butter cream on graham cracker crust. I tried super hard to finish this, but the sizes for all the sundaes are gigantic. It\'s got enough ice cream to feed 3 people, but you may not want to share after having a bite.\n\nStrawberry Fields Sundae (~$14): Wow, I don\'t think any other strawberry dessert I\'ve had hits the spot as much as this one. The cheesecake definitely compliments the strawberry ice cream, and overall it just works. Definitely flavorful and a great option if you like fruity flavors.\n\nBlack and White Sundae (~$14): Chocolate and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream, topped with a tuxedo chocolate-covered strawberry. Super delicious, too. The flavors are basic, but it\'s a great classical twist nonetheless!\n\nI can understand why people would complain about the price, but this place is the home of the freaking $1000 dessert! Why expect anything less than expensive from here? Plus, it\'s on The Strip! It\'s a well-known fact that restaurants in Vegas, let alone on The Strip, are pretty costly.\n\nAnyways, I will definitely come here again when I\'m in Vegas. But, if you plan on eating sundaes, be sure to have a group of hungry people to share it with! Trust me, there\'s enough for everyone.'

S"I'm definitely a fan! It is always crowded  here, so I do recommend making reservations, if you do plan on dropping in spontaneously, expect to have AT LEAST a 30 minute wait. The atmosphere is loud and upbeat on the inside, but out on the patio things do sort of calm down (as long as they have the misters and fans/heaters on) As far as the food goes, I've pretty much had everything on their menu by now, everything is delicious! Of course, like any restaurant on the strip it is pricy, so if you're planning to stop by on a budget, make sure to put your pretty penny towards dessert! They are expensive, but the portions are huge, I'd say able to feed 3-4 people."

Not only was she MIA, she was rude slamming our frozen hot chocolate and to-go box on the table. We spoke to the manager who was nice enough to give us a 25% discount. Maybe she was having a bad day, but deal it with lady, you're in the service industry!! Bad day or not, put a freakin smile on your face and do your freakin job. R-U-D-E!

S"Here at Serendipity 3, you have the option of sitting outside or inside. Since I do not like Las Vegas's hot or cold weather, I would suggest to request to sit inside. They usually overshoot the estimated time that they would tell you you would have to wait, and fifteen minutes was actually just five minutes. \n\nFronting the restaurant is a Thai Buddhist shrine. It was unusual as I was in the mood of the Caesar's Palace hotel and did not expect to see that.\n\nIf you are commuting there by car and not walking there, there are many parking - valet and/or self-park - option as Serendipity 3 is at the corner of a street on the Vegas Strip. \n\nNow, for the most important part... The FOOD! \n\nThe Yums:\n- Fries: They were surprisingly amazing! It's normal fries, but it was salted well and had a great enough crunch and my friends and I ordered it after we ate our food and ended up eating it all.\n- Crab Cake Salad: I did not to expect to see seafood at Serendipity 3. What a surprise it was. It was so good that my best friend who ordered it did not speak a single word from the time she got her food until she finished it whole\n- Foot Long Chili Hot Dog: I felt like a mother who made enough food to portion with her children and herself. I was able to fill my tummy up and giving three parts of my foot long hot dog to three friends. It wasn't too thick too eat, which was good. Add a bit of hot sauce, and it's perfect!\n- Nachos (appetizer): I would not have mind if the nachos were my meal. It was so yummy! It looked a bit sparse in the chip count, but it was big enough to satisfy eight tummies.\n- Frozen Hot Chocolate: The Frozen Hot Chocolates that we got were Oreo, Regular, and Mocchachino. All were yummy, but the best was the Mocchacino, hands down.\n\nAll in all, I wish I had the Frozen Hot Chocolate first - or that was the only thing we ate - because we were too too full. We couldn't make it into Caesar's Palace for five minutes until have to go to the restroom. Oops TMI? :P"

S"I went New Years Day in a party of four, and signed in for an hour wait (11 parties ahead of me.  Awesome.).  We thought we'd grow old and die before being seated, so we checked out their other options: 1) the to-go line outside of the restaurant and 2) order to-go at the bar.\n\nIf you order to-go outside, you use a menu with limited options (but some of the same items are slightly cheaper than on the regular menu).  We don't go to Vegas often, so we decided to order at the bar and to just take our food to the tables outside of the hotel.  It was a nice option since the line was considerably shorter.\n\nWe ordered the black and white sundae ($15ish), a frozen hot chocolate ($9ish), and a grilled cheese sandwich ($15ish).  The prices were a bit of a kick in the pocketbook, but it all tasted great.  The grilled cheese sandwich had swiss, american, cheddar (I think?), and brie, and it was AMAZING.  It also came with yummy tomato soup.  I know they're famous for their frozen hot chocolate (which tastes exactly like how it sounds), but I actually enjoyed the black and white sundae more.\n\nThe seating sucked though. I know the area doesn't belong specifically to Serendipity 3, but c'mon, Ceasar's Palace!  Invest in a bus boy to clean up the tables at least once a century!  Especially if those tables sit right between your glitzy hotel and an expensive eatery!  It kind of ruined the ambiance eating our expensive, delicious food while sitting at sticky, filthy tables.  Gross."

But we got our pager and\nWe were sat in 10 minutes. \n\nThe d\xc3\xa9cor is adorable and we sat on the outside patio. My friend and I ordered waters, a root beer float and strawberry shake both were TO DIE FOR. And unlike someone else stated we weren't charged $1 for water. \n\nI ordered the Hangover omelet. As weird as it sounds it could use less egg. But it was good and bacon was a little peppery. \n\nMy friend had a cheeseburger. She loved it!! And the best thing of all were the waffle cut fries!!!!\n\nBill was about $42 which is not bad! And our waiter was pretty attentive and nice. Didn't take much waiting at all. Will def go again!\n\n\n\nOH and we decided to go back that night for dessert!!\nit was fantastic!!!!!!  we had the Strawberry Fields and the one with Chocolate cake\nit was heaven!!!"

S"The atmosphere here is awkward for some reason, can't put my finger on it... but it reminds of me a cafeteria with an alice-in-wonderland kinda vibe. nevertheless if you're in vegas and you want a spot to take the cutie that you met in da club the night prior (I could tell there were several of you around when I was there ;)), this is the spot. Here's my suggestion. Pretend that this is impromptu, come here without a reservation, wait the 15-20 min, get seated away from the doors if it's cold as hell outside, get their fun appetizers, and scope your lady out for less than 20 bucks. Don't get the green tea shake, it tasted like ass. They should seriously put 2 cups of sugar in that shit.\n\nYour lady will like this place better than the Denny's that you had in mind, it's sensible on your budget, and just unique enough to sorta make you seem interesting.

S'My husband and our friends came to Serendipity 3 twice while we were in Vegas in July 2012. The first time was for dinner, which was very good but typical American type sandwiches and burgers. Huge sizes! We sat outside due to the long wait inside and even though it was over 100 degrees outside the fans kept us cool. Our waitress was not friendly at all and had zero personality. The second time we came was just for the frozen hot chocolate (which was SO good!) and we sat at the bar but again the staff was not friendly at all. The restaurant is adorable and has a very whimsical, fun feel to it but the staff really does not give the same vibe.'

S"I've been to Serendipity several times during my various trips to Vegas. Its a great casual restaurant located right on the strip. It has a cute little whimsical vibe that simply makes me happy every time I come here. \n\nSerendipity is known for desserts, including frozen hot chocolate and the $1,000 golden opulence sundae. (Yes, $1,000... don't think I'll ever try that one unless I hit it big in the casino.) The frozen hot chocolate is very rich and tasty, and definitely a good thing to try while in the hot desert. During my most recent trip, my husband and I spilt the cookie sundae. The two of us together couldn't even finish it! Cookie dough ice cream mixed with three fresh baked cookies and topped with whipped cream and hot fudge... yum!\n\nAll of the food I've ever had here has been pretty solid as well. The triple decker grilled cheese is my favorite. It's so flippin' cheesy and gooey! I love it! The portions are all very large and can easily be split between two... especially if you're planning on dessert. \n\nI always look forward to my next trip to Vegas, and Serendipity has become one of those staples for me that make the trip so great and fun."

S'I\'m sorry but I was not impressed with this place. Maybe it was because we were here during memorial day weekend and it was packed like a Lady Gaga concert at an L.G.B.T event, or people read the reviews about their frozen hot chocolates and just had to come try one on such a nice cold and windy day, but either way we had to wait 2 hours before being seated. What really annoyed me was that I had called before we got there to make reservations and was told that they don\'t make reservations unless it is two hours in advance of you arriving. Um, hello?! We had to wait two hours to be seated!! She could have told me that the wait was that long and worked something out. \n\nAnyway, after waiting so long I wasn\'t even hungry anymore. I was going to get breakfast but by that time it was already like one o\'clock so I decided to get lunch. I order the Cheddar Burger and fries and I was not impressed at all. My fries were soggy and cold and my burger was mediocre at best. I\'ve had better at McDonald\'s. I was hoping after waiting so long to be seated I would be blown away by the food and in the end say "it was worth the wait." Yeah, that\'s a big soggy NO! The minute I put one fry in my mouth my attitude went from bad to worse because I love me some good fries and when my fries are sucking, I start to hate you. \n\n We didn\'t order the frozen hot chocolate because by the time we were done with our food, we were all over it and just wanted to leave. \n\nAll in all I was not impressed by the Vegas location. I\'m sure the Manhattan one is by far better but then again, everything is better in New York....'

I had a coupon for a free frozen hot chocolate.\n\nOur waitress was okay. We also had a male server who took our actual food order. I had the french toast log. A HUGE piece of french toast (log shape lol)... two eggs over medium, too many strips of bacon lol, fresh fruit with whipped cream (raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries), and potatoes. It was HUGE. Who eats that much?!?!?!! I ate a couple bites of everything and it was okay, nothing special... but the potatoes I really liked. It had a little kick to it, as if it was tossed in pepper or something?? I dunno it was good. Everything else was regular breakfast food. $18 for that plate! The frozen hot chocolate was YUMMY!!! Kinda reminded me of a blended milkshake with ice. Good though. \n\nService was super slow and it wasn't even that busy. It started to pick up after we arrived.

With all the hype surrounding it  I thought they might have used some crazy liquid nitrogen machine to give it some crazy textures and bring out different flavors in the chocolate.\n\nNo, it's just a very sweet milkshake which is dressed up with whip cream and chocolate shavings. It tastes good, very sweet and basically is what you expect after reading the ingredients and the preparation process.\n\nI'd give it a 2.5 after all is said and done, and bump it to a 3 for location.

S'I\'ve worked at Caesars Palace for 18 months but I am not biased.  Let me just set the record straight.  I had ABSOLUTELY NO, ZERO, ZIP, NADA interest in eating here due to my total reliance upon my fellow Yelpers POV...until my Boss, who is a Foodie, invited me to have lunch with him.  \n\nHonestly, when he asked, I had thoughts of Bobby Flay\'s Mesa Grill, Bradley Ogden, or even the Munch Bar, but he said "Trip S".  Out of respect for those readers with more conservative morals, I will refrain from what truly emanated from my under my breath, but let\'s just say I would not normally use this kind of language but sometimes the autonomic response elicits more idiomatic expressions you would typically follow up with an immediate "Sorry!"\n\nOkay, with that loquacious preamble let me speak to the BEST !$#@%!$^%$# thing I\'ve ate so far in 2011!!!  Whoa man!  I ordered the Las Vegas Strip Sandwich (pics 9 and 11).  10 ounces of prime medium rare NY Strip beef on a toasted French roll around 18 inches long; slathered with garlic butter, covered with three over easy eggs and six crisscrossed thick cut smoky, sweet, salty, crispy bacon.  BACON!!! \n\nLet\'s back up minute.  When we arrived at "Trip S" it was packed. The very nice hostess with the great smile sat us at the one of the two available seats.  Our Server, another lady with an easy manner and great smile, got us drinks immediately...well, within 2 minutes anyway and she followed up with us a few minutes later to let us know that our food was coming eminently.  I noticed other guests were signaling for her attention and she seemed to have a very good awareness of her area and appeared to notice the polite hand waving in her periphery without losing connection with us.  Once she was done with us, she moved on to the neighboring guests, flashed her award winning great smile and they were putty in her hands.  Actually, she had me at "Hello".\n\nThe food arrives!!!  First my Boss\'s Ruben arrives.  I love a good Ruben and when I saw his, I thought I should have ordered one, but didn\'t want to make anyone uncomfortable.  You know what I mean...next, my Las Vegas Strip Sandwich arrives and WHOA MAN, I am so glad I didn\'t get the Ruben now...next visit.   This is a hefty piece of carnivores delight.   If I were at home I would have thrown it on a plate, plop down on the couch, put on some football and gone to town, but being in coat and tie and in public that whole egg yolk dribbling down the chin would not fly so I did the right thing and cut it into thirds.  About a pound each I swear to goodness.  I took the first bite...how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...It was almost as good a lingering first kiss.  Hot, salty, crunchy, savory, smoky, my ...WAIT! BACK THE TRUCK UP!!!!...that is not a good example of a great lingering first kiss, but just work with me.  The synchronization of flavors, textures, body responses, was almost overwhelming.  Yes, I was totally satisfied.  \n\nPlease note that this sandwich is not for the faint of heart.  You need to get your grub on to finish it but alas, that how I roll.  It\'s just one of those things you want to continue masticating until it\'s no more no matter how full the hypothalamus screams. \n\nBon appetite!'

However, since most of it was left after we were finished the waitress decided to take it off our tab.  That was considerate.  \n\nThe wait is pretty insane though.  And, I wish they would just serve desserts instead of a full menu.  They do have this neat "text you when your table is ready" though.  However, after a 45 minute wait or so is it really worth it?

In order to cut costs (we are all poor students!), we decided to split everything. It worked out perfectly! We had appetizer, entree, and two desserts! I paid about $18, which included tax and gratuity. I was full, but not overstuffed and I thought it was well worth it. We didn't try their famous frozen hot chocolate, but did have the banana split and got a red velvet chocolate sundae on the house. Both were delicious and totally satisfied my chocolate craving! Yummy yum yum.\n\nThe onion rings weren't bad either. They were nice and crunchy. A friend and I shared the pesto italian pizza. It's a flatbread style pizza that's a decent size.

A few of my friends spoke quite positively about the NY Serendipity location, so we thought we would give this one (located across from Caesars) a shot. \n\nWe first went to their outside service window, to purchase a sundae and a few margaritas. The person at the outside window was able to sell us a sundae, but we were informed we had to go inside to get our drinks. This made sense to me and was really no big deal at all. \n\nHowever, once I went inside, the bartender oddly pretended that the 2 for one (Margarita) coupon I had, wasn\'t good for this location. Since I had just picked them up from a girl (hired by serendipity to bring in customers) right in front of this location, that didn\'t make much sense to me. After I pushed the issue, he accepted them. I\'m usually pretty easy going, but that just didn\'t sit well with me. \n\nAll in all, this location was sub-par and overpriced.

The burger was very well grilled the bun was nice and fresh and the blue cheese was the perfect complement with the bacon and beef.\n\nHowever the frozen hot chocolate was really good the first two times the third time its not as great (maybe because it was winter and cold as crap) but it was still good.\n\nYou should for sure come through to try it out for yourself if your in Vegas!"

S"This restaurant is a cute place. The food was decent, but nothing unique and it not really worth my stomach real estate. Especially when there are so many other places to go for the same price point in Vegas. Beware if you sit outside because the fountain nearby or something nearby smells like sewage. The waiter was very nice and accomodating. So overall, it was okay, but I won't be revisiting."

S"OHHHH the hype. I fell for it! I've been wanting to try it for a while and finally made it a point to visit the last time I was in Vegas. \n\nWe arrived there pretty late and was expecting to get seated right away because it was 4:30pm, too late for lunch and too early for dinner. Boy were we wrong! Wait was 20-25 mins for OUTDOOR tables in 109 degree weather. UGH. Outdoor seating has misters, but don't expect that to help you cool off. Bad misting/fan system they set up back there. It's just for looks...\n\nFood\n- BBQ Chicken Sandwich - very flavorful and the chicken wasn't dry. I liked it a lot\n- Onion rings - sooo bad. The batter was way too thick and they dunked it in parmesan. Gross...\n- steak fries - seasoned with kosher salt. and was very good! \n- sweet potato fries - a little bland, but not bad. \n- Frozen Hot Chocolate - this was hyped up way too much for me. I could do without. \n\nI really wanted to get the steak sandwich but it was a little too expensive for waaay too big for me to finish. It looks amazing though!!\n\nOur server was a little spacey and couldn't remember a thing we asked her. Kinda annoying, but she was very nice. \n\nOverall, an overpriced place that is super hyped up. Ehh..I'll pass for now since I'm on a budget."

Held food in my mouth for a minute because I couldn't believe a grilled cheese could taste so good.  Chewed.  Smiled.  Polished off entire sandwich in record time.  The tomato soup that came with it rocked as well, but it was a little too salty.  Had to unbutton my jeans when the hot chocolate arrived.  It came with 2 straws, but I wasn't about to share with the vultures at my table.  Drank the entire thing while everyone looked at me with hope in their eyes.  Denied, bitches.  My meal cost me like 20 bucks, but it was worth it.  I'd eat here again next time I'm in Vegas."

It was definitely very delicious and refreshing on such a hot day, but it was definitely not worth the price or wait. It tasted a lot like a Coffee Bean Pure Chocolate Ice Blended.

However the fact that the hostess snatched my fork and didn't apologize for the dirty silverware kinda pissed me off.  I decided to complain to the manager. He did everything in his power to try nd turn my experience around but I was completely turned off. I would not recommend or ever go back because of this experience"

S'This popular facsimile of the iconic New York outpost is a tourist trap, no doubt about it. But it\'s a trap that is still fun to take the kids. Desserts are the main draw here, with plenty of frozen hot chocolate and sundae options available. Portion sizes for desserts and all other food are huge, so sharing is the best option.\n\nDessert was the main reason my son and I stopped by, but we knew we had to eat some real food for dinner before indulging in sweets. The crab cake sandwich ($19) was massive.  A jumbo lump crab cake with a tolerable amount of filler was topped with beefsteak tomatoes, avocado, and an orange aioli. Those savory items with hints of sweetness sat in between an unusually large bun. The only ways to eat it are to smash it down to fit in your mouth or grab a knife and fork and eat it one small piece at a time. An order of the kid\'s chicken strips ($8.95) come 3 per order with a honey mustard sauce and ranch, along with carrot and celery sticks that my son avoided like the plague. He wasn\'t crazy about the chicken either. Suffering from a hard breading covering dry meat, he barely finished half his meal. \n\nMoving on to what we both viewed as the "main course" we quickly agreed on the red velvet sundae ($14). Substituting chocolate for the vanilla ice cream listed on the menu, the massive dessert served in a goblet had a large chunk of moist and dense cake stuck to one side with hot fudge, whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles topping it all. It was plenty satisfying, but far from refined. The quality doesn\'t warrant the hefty price tag as it\'s a dessert that one can replicate at home for far less.\n\n2.5 Stars'

S"After finding out that the buffet at Caesars was raised to $50/person for the holidays, my family and I decided to eat breakfast here instead. We walked in with no reservations and were able to be seated immediately.\n\nI ordered the LEO Omelet, which wasn't bad but I wasn't a fan of the way they cooked the eggs. Other dishes my family ordered were the Corned Beef Hash & Eggs, Mushroom Quiche, Eastside Western Omelet, and Breakfast Burger. Even though I love prosciutto, I wasn't a fan of the Eastside Western Omelet. The best dish I tried was probably the Mushroom Quiche. It was tasty with a buttery crust, and the salad was fresh.\n\nWe ordered one Frozen Hot Chocolate to share. It was my first time trying this after hearing about it for so many years, and I don't think it lived up to the hype. It was sweet and tasty, and definitely a perfect treat for the summer. However, I don't see it being worth $11. Luckily, we had a coupon for a free Frozen Hot Chocolate with the purchase of an entree.\n\nService was pretty good. Our waitress was busy, but still very friendly and refilled our coffees and waters promptly\n\nOverall, the food was decent, with some good dishes and some subpar ones. Considering the quality of the food, the price seemed a bit high for me (TIP: use your Total Rewards card to save $1-2 on each dish). There is a fairly large selection of dishes available, so it's not a bad place to go to if you run out of other options."

S'We had to wait over 30 minutes for a table and there were several empty tables.  The food portions are huge.  We ordered the Summer Bries and the LV Dog.  The Summer Bries was very delicious and we recommend trying it.  The LV Dog, although not a high quality hot dog was very good.  We went with another couple and among the three orders of fries at our table only one was fresh warm and delicious.  Two of us had to suffer with old, room temperature French Fries.\n\nThe desserts on the other hand are out of this world and should be shared given their size.  We had the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate and it was HEAVENLY!  We highly recommend going to Serendipity for the dessert.  The dessert alone makes the wait well worth it!\n\nThe wait staff- not overly friendly and lacking in enthusiasm.  We had to ask for our drinks to be refilled on several occasions.  Moderately priced, we spent about $50 before tip.\n\nHonestly, the dessert is carrying this rating!'

S'Came here for a birthday. We were seated right away and given a giant menu. Its cute, nothing fancy, i had actually expected more modern. \n\nWe were a bit thrown off by the reviews about the food and ordered the foot long chili dog with sweet potato fries and the nachos. \n\nThe food didnt take too long but our waiter was pretty shitty. \nWe had a group of four seated next to us and one of the ladies was a bit tipsy. He was pretty rude to her and she ended up telling him that it was my friends birthday. \n\nThe waiter said "then he gets water for his birthday" which was pretty silly. \n\nAnyways i didnt even ask if the hot dog was pork (which i don\'t eat) stupid of me not too but we asked later and they dont serve any beef hotdogs. Woops! So i didnt get to try it but my friend said it was okay. \n\nThe nachos were great except the taco meat (beef) on them. Its cheap and gross tasting. \nBesides that it was a large portion and pretty good. \n\nOur waiter barely came around and was more concerned with the table next to us than he was with us. Thank god the table next to us was talking to us the entire time. Great crowd in from South Carolina for a convention for State Farm\n\nThen we ordered the cookie cookie something ice cream sundae. \nThat was the best item. The chocolate chip cookie in it was nasty and hard but the sugar cookies were soft and the ice cream was great. \n\nThe best part of our experience here was our neighbors from State Farm :) pun intended. \n\nNote:\nIf youre looking for a romantic night out this is not the place to go. Its busy and loud. \n\nPros\nSweet potato fries were pretty good\nSundae was good :) \n\nCons\nBad service\nRude waiter (ours was.

S"Ok. So this place I kinda have a lot to say about..\n\nThe wait- First off we had reservations to which we had a credit card on hold for at 11:45am. We were there early and still weren't seated until about 30 minutes later o Ly to be informed they had a table ready the entire time but never sent anyone to get us....\n\nThe food- the food selection looked really good on the menu. Everything is a tad on the pricey side, but oh well, this place is famous right? It kind of took a while to bring our food out and I have some gripes about that. They forgot one meal, one breakfast came out super cold like it's been sitting for a whiiiile, and my omelet was like super-cooked hard and dry. So 3 misses out of about 14 people, I guess I'll let it slide?\n\nBUT, and this is a big but. They quickly resolved this issue by comping the meal they forgot and the meal that came out cold (and brought out a brand new one) (I didn't complain about my meal bc I don't like complaining at restaurants), and on top of that, gave us 2 frrrozen hot chocolates and a bloody Mary for our meal that was cold. \n\nSo all in all, the food was ok, the desserts and sweets are yummy, and the service ended up being great since they fixed everything they messed up. \n\nI will come here again and update my review and hopefully I'll have a 5-star experience next time!"

S'I really had never even considered eating here, but the group I was eating with chose it because they were able to accommodate a table of 30. That actually was impressive since it was Friday night of a fight weekend. \n\nI ordered the hangover omelet. It is made with bacon, fries and mushrooms. I substituted ham for the mushrooms. I hate mushrooms. The food was rather bland. I quickly asked for hot sauce. Even Cholula could not save it. It was not bad. It just liked any significant flavor. The portion was significant and it comes with your choice of fries. I chose the waffle fries. They were OK. \n\nOur service was as good as can be expected for a group of this size. They were all friendly, and did their best to keep up.  This is the reason they are getting three stars instead of two.\n\nThey would not divide up the bill at all. Only one bill per table. That was a giant pain. It took forever to work through a bill for over 30 people. I hate all the excuses restaurants use to justify not dividing bills. You are in a service industry. Figure it out.'

S"A hot day with a group of girls craving for some chocolate led us to Serendipity. We just wanted dessert so we ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate - one regular and one with a Mint Chip flavor.\n\nWe also ordered a slice of the cheesecake creme de la creme.\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate was good - it didn't blow my mind but it was packed with chocolate flavor and had a slushy milk chocolate feel. The four of us shared one and that was enough for all of us. Four huge straws and a mound of whipped cream and chocolate chips on top. Nothing fancy, just a large quantity.\n\nThe slice of Cheesecake was HUGE. The cake wasn't overly sweet and had a wonderful cream cheese whipped cream on top that complimented everything pretty well. We worked our way eating around the cheesecake but could hardly make a dent in it! There is a raspberry jam at the bottom tjat also gave you a different take on the flavors. The cheesecake was my favorite.\n\nI'm docking off a star because of the price. It came out to be a nearly $50 check for hot chcocolate and cheesecake....the food was good but not that good. You could be paying for the ambiance, but it isn't to the level of 4 Stars like some other dessert places on the strip.\n\nBottom line: you can do it for the experience, but I'm sure there are better dessert places. What does the word serendipity mean anyway???"

S'It was alright, but overpriced. Ordered the chili cheese dog with avocado, and they seriously gave me 3-4 slices of THINLY sliced avocado... WTF? \n\nThe service sucked, it was cold as fuck outside and they sat us by the door... which was fine until they decided to keep the door open because "it smells like food, so we are going to keep it open". We asked if we could move to another table because we were cold (it was low 40\'s) and the waitress gave us shit attitude about it and, the manager I believe, had to check if we could. I didn\'t really see why since there were 3-4 open tables and maybe 2 parties waiting to be seated.\n\nThe waitress didn\'t even bother helping us move our drinks to the other table, not that I couldn\'t pick up my cup and move it, but they had already brought plates and utensils out. But we seriously had to move the stuff ourselves... so I left a shit tip.\n\nWould have received a 3, but the service dragged it down.'

S"We like Serendipity. Yes it is overpriced, I mean $11 for a frozen hot chocolate but it is soo good. This is my 2nd time dining at this location and it wasn't that great, we ended up with food poisoning. We ordered the nachos as a appetizer. It came with black beans,  crusty old looking ground beef that must have been sitting somewhere for hours and cheese. The small amount of meat on the nachos had that dark crusted over color on the top and we should have known from that point on but they were $14 so we ate about 1/3 of the order. We both ordered the up the skirt steak, it was pretty good but again we both ended up with food poisoning -though I can't say if it was the steak or the nachos that got us. I tried the green tea frozen drink and it was way too sweet for me but they were kind and switched it out for me.  Our server was nice, he was really busy so another guy (mgr?) took our order for us and brought us water which was nice. I don't know, our bill was about $90 with tax and tip for 2 entree's, 1 appetizer and 2 hot chocolates and that was with their TR's discount. I would only come back for the frozen hot chocolate, after the night my bf and I spent in the restroom we will stay far away from the food. I will say that last year we had the white pineapple sangria and it was the best I've had, so I guess I only like their beverages.\n\n**update - ok after looking at the pictures of other peoples nachos ours looked nothing like that, I am convinced it was the nachos that got us sick. Maybe they gave us a old order that had gotten returned or cancelled or that was sitting because ours certainly didn't look anything like other peoples pictures. Ugh :("

I'm always up for anything new to experience (eat). \n\nIt was pretty crowded which is imeediately a downer for me. But we managed to snag three spots at the bar just as a couple was leaving so we didn't have to wait for a table. The decor is really cute in a sugary, Alice in Candyland sort of way. I was told they are known for their frrrozen hot chocolates, but I needed actual food first, so I settled on a brie cheese sandwich minus the raisin pumpernickel bread. They switched out my bread with batting an eye.  \n\nWhile we waited for food, the bartender entertained me in the best way possible. With alcohol. And I got to watch everybody elses alcohol and hot chocolate creations being made. I tried a cotton candy martini just because it sounds cute and he said there is actual cotton candy in it. Cool! I picked the apple flavor and He shoved a big chunk of cotton candy in the glass. Cute! But it just melt away as soon as the alcohol hits it and it tasted just like an oversweet apple martini. Meh. I guess I thought it would be pink, have cotton candy magically floating in it and taste like cotton candy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=SDqnof-g7auFCdvv4TzNPg\n\nI then proceeded onto mojitos and belvedere martinis. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=u49kgihuTOVAORu-j4bakw\n\nFood arrives and friend #2 is disappointed with her Margharita pizza because it wasnt really like a Margharita.

Nothing special, but good. Could have used more cranberry flavor or more cheese. The sweet potato fries were good because they were nice and crispy. I often get soggy sweet potato fries. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=exjNtQdkh8ziQj4-3c0IDQ\n\nSweet Potato Fries: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=dHlXKJT13yfGjWVJRaquqg\n\nThe best was the High Heel Prosciutto sandwich. THis really WAS good. Prosciutto, tomatoes, buffalo mozz, balsamic and pesto on a toasted garlic bread roll.  Definitely the best of our bunch. Worth $17? No.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=B-xHxG4KOPyuGfB477u8dA\n\nNow we are too full of food and alcohol to even think about the damn desserts. So we did not partake.

S'This was the last place that I ate at in Las Vegas before my flight home. After a weekend of endless walking, buffets, and sight-seeing, I was ready to end my Vegas trip with a simple, light lunch. Even though this place was probably one of the cheapest places that I ate at in Vegas, the experience wasn\'t worth this price.\n\nWe arrived at Serendipity 3 around noon and it was packed outside and inside. Choosing to sit inside, we got immediate seating. However, no server came to us at all for the first 15 minutes. Needing to catch a flight within 2 hours, I flagged down any random waitress nearby to take down our orders. She was incredibly polite and apologetic for our long wait (it took 30 minutes for our food to come out). I appreciated that she made a great effort to make sure we were satisfied with our experience. My boyfriend and I had a coupon that allowed us to get a free frozen hot chocolate as long as we ordered an entree. He ordered an "A.B.C." burger (avocado, brie, and caramelized onions) with steak as the meat (the other option is chicken) and his choice of steak fries for the side; I ordered a mac and cheese. Our total came out to be roughly $33 (without tip), which is unfortunately as cheap as it\'s going to get for a simple meal in Vegas (unless you choose something from Chinatown or McDonalds).\n\nA.B.C. Burger + Steak Fries\nI normally would never touch steak or any other beef item, but wow this burger was delicious. I had a nibble of my boyfriend\'s medium rare steak topped with melted brie and fresh avocado and loved the combination of A, B, & C in this burger. However, I\'d say the BEST thing I ate for this lunch was the steak fries. They were meaty yet crunchy and salty but not thirst-inducing. I don\'t even know how to describe how wonderful the steak fries were. My boyfriend describes these fries as the best he ever had (next to the fries that he ate on one of his Celebrity cruise line cruises, which tasted incredibly similar). \n\nMac & Cheese\nI don\'t know how or why Las Vegas activated my cheese addiction, but I couldn\'t resist ordering this simple comfort-food staple. The macaroni used for this dish was perfect: large tender shells that held the fluid, creamy cheese and slightly crusted on top. The metal pot that the mac and cheese was served in looked small, but, to my own surprise, this was the first time I didn\'t finish a cheese dish! I wish i had though (just writing about it right now is making my mouth water)! \n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate\nI was somewhat amused by the oxymoron in the name when I first heard about Serendipity\'s famous trademarked dessert. Contrary to its name, this dessert isn\'t actually frozen. But it truly is somewhat of a contradiction. It\'s frozen enough to be eaten with a spoon but melted enough to be drunk with a straw; it\'s cold enough to enjoy as a dessert but warm enough to enjoy as a sweet, creamy smoothie. My boyfriend claimed this dessert for himself, and even though it couldn\'t beat out the steak fries for best part of our meal, it came incredibly close. It\'s definitely a must-try if you\'re anywhere near Caesar\'s Palace and crave a unique dessert!'

I'm so happy it wasn't over-hyped. Tasted like ... creamy, slushy Ovaltine. With real whip cream. If I had enough room, I would've wanted another one. \n\nIt's way expensive ($16.50 for a burger!), but it's Vegas. At least the portions are HUGE. The boy ordered the steak sandwich and it was as long as his arm (it was really good, too). I had the uber juicy burger with avocado, brie (my favorite cheese on a burger - you don't see it often as an option), and caramelized onions. The onion rings were crispy and the batter was tasty, but I didn't think it went with the parmesan that was dusted on top. Big con was that the french fries were OVERLY salted. AND because it was sea salt there were huge chunks of salt everywhere. \n\nThe outdoor area is nice, the indoors is fun and flirty, and the fried oreos are ... sin. Try one.

That was pretty good.  \n\nThen for entrees my girl had the Jumbo lump crab cakes (way to salty) with a whole grain mustard sauce and whole grain mustard Cole slaw.  \n\nI had the "Full Monty" Chicken, arugula, grilled red onions, bacon, and cheese on a ciabiatta roll.  \n\n***The Bad***\nChicken grilled to saw dust stage way to dry.  This chicken was so over cooked that it took me a good minute to saw through it after I took it off the sandwich so I could eat it.  The bacon was old and stale. The BBQ and the ciabitta was a little over board.   \n\n\nThe only thing that made me give them 2 stars was the onion rings.   Even then ranch and BBQ with Parmesan Cheese dusted onions rings is a pretty lame excuse for not being creative.  This is a dessert only place so don\'t get your hopes up for anything more.'

Music was loud and the place was pretty pretentious. I hated the gum ball fish tank that was outside in the heat. There didn't seem to be any bubbles/filter thing going on and the fish was slowly being simmered. \n\nThings are already overpriced on the strip but this menu is ridiculous, just like the menu on 59th."

We were seated right away.  We order 3 frozen hot chocolate and a bowl of chili.  About 15 minutes later the frozen hot chocolate came out.  It looked good and tasted good.  However, after a few sips it was gone.  I think there was more whip cream than there was frozen hot chocolate.  By the time they were almost done drinking their drinks, my bowl of chili finally comes out.  It was so spicy that I couldn't eat more than 1 bite. :(  I wished it was noted on the menu that it was super spicy.\n\noverall i was disappointed in the service and the drink portion.  I think that if we are paying $11.00 then it should come with more frozen hot chocolate instead of whip cream.

S'My bridal party and their dates made a special trip out to Serendipity 3 the night before my Mandalay Bay wedding and had, quite possibly, the worst experience I\'ve had at any restaurant ever.  Their staff was rude and inattentive.  Our server, who ignored us most of the time we were there, spilled some kind of disgusting cream all over me (in my bride shirt and sash) and offered no apology or even extra napkins.  All we got was an, "oops" and smile.  Absolute garbage.  The manager, who was slovenly in his appearance, and couldn\'t be bothered when there were pretty girls in his view, ignored our request for more napkins and neglected to say a word to the server who spilled all over me.  We paid a total of $70 for flat and warm beer (which took 25 minutes to get to our table) and a couple of alcoholic frozen hot chocolates that were so full of flavored syrup, you couldn\'t taste anything else and a disgusting cream shower from an inattentive, rude service staff.  After our check arrived, we tried to speak to the manager again about our ruined visit (we ended up just leaving our drinks and dessert because I had to go clean up), he offered us no break in the check, an apology from our server or anything else. Oh, he did offer us something...one shot for one person in our table of 6 to make up for it.  Definitely disappointed.  This was one thing I had on my "must-see" list and made a special trip out on my last night out before my wedding to be there...and it was ruined by a rude staff, flat beer and an oblivious manager.  Save your money and get a milkshake from McDonald\'s.  This place is not worth the wait, cost and disappointment that is sure to follow.  Two thumbs way down.'

I went to this one in Vegas to take my daughter and friend for a birthday lunch a little bit ago.  The food is ok, nothing special, but it isn't bad either.  Of course the main reason to go to Serendipity 3 is for the desserts!  When the dessert menu is just as long as the food menu, you know you are in for a treat!   \n\nJust a warning, there is almost always a wait, so be prepared for that.  It also can be cramped once you are seated, so keep that in mind as well.  A good note would be if you have a Caesars players card.  If you do, show them and you will get a couple dollars taken off of your bill.  Never hurts to save a few bucks, especially on the Strip where everything is overpriced to begin with!"

Loved loved loved the frozen hot chocolate, and the ambience of the NYC Serendipity was cozy and charming.  Haven't been to NY in a while, so I was excited to see that they opened a Serendipity in Las Vegas!!   You know... it's just not the same. Everything is Vegas is BIG... every one does everything BIG... Serendipity 3 just felt like a big, regular restaurant on the strip.  Nothing charming... just a restaurant.  I can't complain about the food.  We went for lunch.  Two of us had an omelette, another the Nachos.  The food was good, the portions were nice (and FYI... their breakfast potatoes that come with the omelettes are AWESOME!!!!).   What I didn't like is the crazy wait.  We checked in at 12:30pm.  Yeah, sure, it's peak lunch time.  It took us about an hour and a half to be seated.  Not the most pleasant experience.  And it was a bit frustrating cause I could see them calling and taking people behind us on the list... not sure what type of system they use.  Our waitress though was fab!  Great service!  But if you're looking for that same NY experience, and wanting to re-live that Serendipity movie scene.... aside from the gigantic frozen hot chocolate... that's where the similarity ends."

It was quite tasty and I feel guilty admitting it, but the marshmallow was my favorite part of the whole thing.  I'm certainly glad that we split it because it was HUGE (no complaints here!).\n\nThis location is not nearly as charming as the location in NYC, but we did not have high expectations of that since this is a second location, aimed at tourists on the stip.  \n\nWe showed up around 4 pm on Saturday, thinking we would be seated quickly since it wasn't a prime dining hour.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Not bad, but there were plenty of empty tables around.  Perhaps they were short staffed.  We did find it strange that the hostess did not give us the option to sit inside or outside.  They just give you  the first table that is ready.

The cafe is located just outside of Caesar's Palace and we took the tram to Excalibur, hopped over a few bridges, and arrived to discover there's a 30 minute wait.  Boo!\n\nIt was cold so we stayed inside and took in the decor.  It's a candy striped wall, plenty of pinks and girly stuff.  The girl inside of you will squeal in delight or be annoyed by all the pink stuff.  I didn't mind it too much.  \n\nWe got the pasta dish and the bacon cheeseburger. Our food wasn't bad but the pasta was overwhelming.  Having pasta the night before and having it again probably wasn't such a good idea.  It tastes good at first when it's nice and hot but as it starts to cool and the cheese starts to congeal, it gets boring and overwhelming.  I don't think I'll eat pasta again until another race.  \n\nWe didn't have room for dessert but we did order the hot chocolate.  This is a yummy, rich, and delicious drink with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and orange zest.  It was the perfect drink for a cold day in Vegas."

Do yourself a favor and make a reservation.\n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate is something your should definitely try if you this is your first time here. Its what everyone comes here for. It's essentially a hot chocolate frappacino. I really liked it the first time I tried it.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate is not the only thing they serve, oh no, the actually have a very large menu of other delectable goodies. Our server, Karen mad cool and told us she had tried everything on the menu at least twice and here favorites were the 4 cheese mac & cheese with chicken and japalenos added and the crab cake salad. How could we not take the advice of someone that had tried the gigantic menu more than twice over? \n\n4 Cheese Mac & Cheese + chicken and Japalenos - WOW! Superbly well made Mac & Cheese, but adding the chicken and jalapenos, send it to another level. I dare say its one of the best Mac & Cheeses I have ever had and I get that dish almost everywhere I go.\n\nCrab Cake Salad - Excellent hot crab cakes served of a mixed green salad. The heat from the crab cakes slightly wilts the greens and makes for a very pleasing blend of textures and temperatures.\n\nDeep Fried Oreo Sundae - What! Deep Fried Oreos! In a Sundae! Yes please! I don't think I really have to say any more since these items by themselves would be pretty good. Put them together and you have a winner! Also, another recommendation from Karen. Haha, she is totally awesome! \n\nSince the menu has so much on it, its tough to say anything in general, but if you get what I got, I don't think you will be disappointed."

Me and hubby shared the footlong chili cheese dog, steak fries, and Mac and cheese. The dog was huge! I feel like it was more like 18\' plus 1 1/4 inches in diameter. But at $16, it better be! It was served on a full baguette in lieu of a bun. The chili was a bit sweet and there was shredded cheddar sprinkled on top. I thought more cheese was in order; plus I would have like it melted and not as an afterthought garnish. The steak fries were surprisingly good. The Mac and cheese was delectable. Truffley and cheesy yum. $14. \n\nWarning: they charge you for sharing but you get an additional side. So, not a bad way to go. Portions are large. \n\n6 of us shared one "can\'t so no sundae." Even with 6 people,  no contest. It was man vs. food and food won! The sundae was incredibly rich and sweet. Legit fudge and whipped cream. \n\nFood was good.  No dissapointments there.

We sat at the bar and the bartender was cool. It's definitely a bit pricy, but hey if you're wanting some awesome desserts it's worth it. The sundaes they were bringing out to other customers looked awesome. They also have sandwiches and omelettes and other real food which I would not have expected, but I have heard it is good so might have to check that out.

S"I felt the frozen hot chocolate was a little hyped up.  It's just an iced version of hot chocolate.  I thought it was gonna be spectacular too.  By the way, you'd want to order the small since the order for 2 is large enough to feed 4 adults unless you want a sugar high.  My recommendation is a 3/5.\n\nThe entrees sampled are the crispy chicken salad and the crab cake sandwiches.  The crispy chicken salad is your regular old green salad with dressing of your choice.  What's different about it is the large fried chicken pieces that comes with it.  If you want to order a salad just to be conservative on the calories, you might want to eat less of the chicken and more of the greens.  Overall, the crispy chicken salad is 3/5 but the chicken gives it a +1 so it turns out to be 4/5.  The crab cake sandwich is just a plain old crab cake sandwich with an inflated price.  That's a 3/5.\n\nOverall, this place is between 3 and 4 stars with more leaning towards 3 stars.  Still, it's a nice place to go for a cold dessert on a hot desert summer day."

Yes, it was a heart attack on a plate but because of the name of the meal and the combination meat, cheese bread combination.  The sandwich it self was just ok, not super delicious as I was hoping but still good.  I think the presentation is what made me order this heart clogging meal.  it was served with sweet potato fries.  I was not able to finish this sandwich as it was too damn big!  Easily could fee three people.\n\nMy wife had the chicken pot pie.  Now that dish was delicious.  Blows Marie Callendars and Claim Jumper pot pies out of the water hands down.  What I like about this pot pie is that there is a crust through out the pie where as most place only put a crust over the pie and chicken and gravy is place directly into the bowl.  Not here.  There is a thick and flaky crust under there and goes really well with the chicken.  If found chunks of chicken, peas, carrots and potatoes and was very tastey.

However, the waffles were good.  Big, thick, crunchy on the outside pieces.  My husband had the Chicken Strips.  Nothing spectacular.  Tasted the same as something you could get at a place like TGIFs but the dipping sauces were good.  I was a little disappointed that the lunch menu isn't as good as the dinner menu.

All of the Walgreens i went to in Vegas were selling the same size water bottles for about $2.29.  I don\'t see why they feel the need to rip people off when it comes to water, their ice cream is already over-priced and it was just OK.

S"Good service starts out a great evening at any restaurant and this is exactly what you'll first experience at Serendipity 3 beside Caesar's Palace. I say beside Caesar's Palace because it is on the same property as the resort but is located right on the strip. The service here has always been friendly and warm.\n\nI have met several servers and each time I have gone back, and if they're working, they remember me. This is amazing as many thousands of people go through weekly. If the manager is there, she'll come around and say hi and be sure the meal or drinks are what you're expecting. The temperature on the food is always hot. This is difficult for large kitchens at any restaurant but they seem to pull it off.\n\nI have brought in many sets of friends, recommended it to people on social services and all of them have had an excellent time. How do I know this you may ask. They send me tweets or Facebook status wall postings about their experiences. I took my parents here during one of their trips to visit and they both thoroughly enjoyed their lunch, they have asked to go back.\n\nI have had many desserts here, including the Golden Opulence Sundae, which was presented to me, without my prior knowledge, when I hit a certain follower count on Twitter. Sharing it with the 20+ other people at the party was a good time. They brought it out in a Baccarat Crystal bowl with a golden spoon via white gloved private butler. The almonds were covered in golf leaf and there were giant chocolate pieces all over it. People ask if the taste of the Sundae is worth the price. First, you get to keep the golden spoon and the crystal bowl, so half of the price of the dessert is just in those two items. Secondly, you shouldn't have this dessert by yourself. You could end up spending several thousand dollars on bottle service at a club, this is more fun. The taste is unlike anything I've ever had in a Sundae. There are some exotic ingredients in this sundae that I have yet to taste in another deluxe sundae. Some of the food I have received at this restaurant have been comped. In no way has any of the staff asked me to review this restaurant. I did not keep the bowl or the spoon, those were returned to the restaurant."

S"Such a touristy place go to in Vegas, but when in Rome...\n\nMet up w/some friends here for lunch.  Sat outside, nice view of Caesar's Palace's front gardens.  \n\nSince I was very budget conscious that day (although it's almost impossible to be on that part of the strip) I opted to try their famous frozen hot chocolate and just a side dish.  While the frozen hot chocolate is good, it wasn't anything astonishing.. you could basically imagine what it would taste like.. cold chocolate drink.. the side i got was a side of ham, at $7, I thought I'd get a little more than three small circles of ham, but I guess it is a side.. Some dishes proved to be a true value.  The chicken n waffles was a massive portion that looked to have been cooked very well.  \n\nService was a little slow and had to remind our waitress a few times about condiments.\n\nIf you're going to spend in Vegas, might as well be somewhere that'll give you some bragging rights and a nice view.  This place would be it."

The pizza my friend ordered (BBQ Chicken) is probably more worth your money but still not amazing either. And no free tap water, really? Oh Vegas, how you dehydrate us. \n\nI feel like my experience might have been better if I did sit down inside the restaurant rather than taking togo.

This was the best part.\n\nThe hostess wasn't rude, but not really friendly, all the servers actually looked mad. We ordered the nachos and their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. The whole reason we came here was because we're fans of that. That was fine, but really not much better than making it at home from their packets.

My group of friends wanted to go really badly, and at the end of the day, I ended up going with 3 guys-- all of whom were super stoked to go. Unfortunately it was a disappointing experience for everyone. \n\nATMOSPHERE\nSame decor as the one in NYC but not as cramped. The music made it less cute (they were blasting hip hop) and service sucked.\n\nThere weren't any tables available so we sat at the bar. Bad idea... (explanation below)\n\nFOOD\nWe came here for the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE, which was way more magical in our heads. Most people got their own, but my boyfriend and I decided to share because I knew how big the portions were. It's honestly enough for 2 people to share and the bartender even asked my 2 guy friends if they were going to share one, haha.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was good, but it wasn't anything special. What totally broke our spirits was seeing them make it. Since we sat at the bar, we discovered that the coveted HC was POWDER MIXED WITH ICE... it pretty much shattered our hopes and dreams, making the experience way less enjoyable.\n\nOverall, this place is TOO overrated and overpriced. There are better places to blow your money in Vegas!"

French Toast sticks with three kinds of dipping sauces. Then a banana split. Done right. The banana split was a big as a football. And I ate easily; three-quarters of it. After the french toast slicks. My friend has a slice of cake that was easily 8" tall x 4" wide" 12" long. The iced tea was the size of a milk container.  We were the biggest pigs that day.

(anyways, that\'s another review)\n\nSerendipity is a cool, hip spot with a menu 3 times the size of my head and trust me, i got a big head! LOL\n\nWe opted for the kobe beef sliders, french fries and of course the Frozen Hot Chocolate.  As for drinks, I only had a beer and my friend had a blueberry peach mojito and a cran/vodka.  The kobe beef sliders we so tasty and cooked/seasoned very well.  It was so melt in your mouth and after having 4 of them along with their tasty crisp fries, it was quite enough!\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was ridiculous! I\'ve always heard of this but never experienced what others have.  Truly one of the best desserts i\'ve had in my life.

S"Eating at Serendipity 3 is like winning a race that you're the only participant in. Sure you win, but it definitely leaves you with an empty feeling inside. \nMy girlfriend and I checked out Serendipity 3 for dinner on a busy Sat night in Sin City. The location is out of the way, so you either have to walk though Ceaser's or the Bellagio to get there because there is no direct parking. \nWe first encountered a girl outside at the check in booth after a short wait. We told her we were just a party of 2 and she said it would be 20-35mins for seating indoors, and about 20mins for outdoor seating. We took the buzzer thing to wait for indoor seating and I asked if there was a bar inside we could wait at, and she told us it was right inside. As we walked up to the bar, I noticed napkins, silverware, and condiments strewn across the bar, inclining me to ask the bartender if we could eat at the bar (which was empty with 8 stools!), he told us definitely. So proceeded to return to the booth girl and hand her back the buzzer and told her she should let people know that bar seating is an option with no wait.\nOnce seated, we took a look at the eclectic menu and decided on the Dino Ribs for me, and the Chicken Alfredo for my girl. As we were waiting for our food, two more couples came to the bar with their buzzers and realized there was seating and returned the buzzer, lol. \nIt took about 20 mins for our food to arrive, a lil too long I think for what we ordered. As we waited, the bartender basically had zero personality and only asked for our drink orders and then pretty much ignored us until we had to pay. \nThe Dino Ribs were three huge ribs that was a good portion size for the $20 price tag, and the Chicken Alfredo was probably 3lbs of pasta! The only real problem with the food though, is that it's not knock your socks off good. For the prices they charge for simple items, I expected to be blown away, and that definitely was not the case. It seemed to me, the real reason to visit Serendipity 3 is for the desserts, they're huge and extravagant, they even have a $1,000 dish! We actually didn't opt for dessert because of our lackluster experience. If I ever go back, it'll be strictly to try the dessert, maybe they can wow me then, otherwise, there are much better options on the Strip than Serendipity 3."

But I think they ruined the east coast theme of this place. It's also overcrowded and over hyped to the point where you can't get seats if you wanted to. \n\nThe frozen hot chocolate is a must when you come here, but I felt like due to our wait and waiting for a seat, our frozen hot chocolate was just cold chocolate. Their pastries were underwhelming and I love desserts! So for me to not be impressed is saying a lot! \n\nTo end my eh experience, walking out to smell people smoking just added to it."

That's all I had there so I can't really judge the other stuff, but just based on that, it was alright!  Maybe it was just too hyped up for me.  Or maybe it was due to the fact that I was tired, sticky and sweaty from the Vegas heat, and just kind of exhausted from the day (it was late).  Perhaps the OG New York location would be more exciting... I would try it there.  The atmosphere/ambiance is probably different there."

They had it rated with Bouchons in the Venetian which is an absolutely great place to dine.  Serendipity was horrible..overpriced very basic root beer floats and shakes that cost half the total bill.  I've had much better in Johnny Rockets or McDonalds(seriously) for shakes. Service was bad.  It took about 30 min for those basic root beer floats and shakes.  Then the food was bland with no taste..I had chicken pot pie, my wife had the don't be afraid of my alfredo....be afraid of the Alfredo.  Olive Garden is better.

S'I would have to give this only two stars. If t weren\'t for the manager to be apologetic then this would have been a 1star. \n\nSo I at here with a couple of friends and we got seated immediately since we has reservations. So that was fine. HEIDI was our waitress and lemme say... Not the sweetest thing at all... For someone who had been there for 3 years and helps train other waiters/waitresses I would love to question her skills. If someone asks for suggestions about a specific plate u think they would try to figure out what kind of taste ur lookin for and have some kind of suggestions. But her comment was "the hangover omelet is the popular one" that really didn\'t help me decide on the dish. And since it was popular the. Y not try it. I should have stuck to my first choice and ordered the corned beef and hash. Don\'t think that could ever get messed up. Other than getting burnt potatoes. \n\nYou think paying 15 for an omelet it would be spectacular. But it wasn\'t. I satisfied my craving with a nations hotdog... Well worth my $12. I don\'t think I would ever eat here again. Maybe try the one in New York. Service may be a lot more better there. Over it was a good experience but worse service possible.

I like that they can text you that your table is ready, so I really don't have to hang out in front of the restaurant in the heat if I don't want to. We decided to sit inside since it was so hot out.\nOur waitress was Tina, she could've been friendlier, but she did an adequate job waiting on us.\nI hate the huge menu's, it was difficult to peruse their offerings at our small table of 4. The plates were also too big for our table. The music inside the restaurant was way too loud for the tiny space, people would like to talk...not lose their hearing!\nThe prices were a bit high but it helps if you have a Total Rewards card, the prices are slightly cheaper if you present this to your waitress upon ordering.\nI got the Chicken Strip appetizer so I could save room for dessert. They were good, nice and crispy on the outside, moist warm white meat chicken on the inside. The dipping sauces were good too, I liked the Honey Mustard best, my husband liked the BBQ sauce. My husband got the Cheeseburger with Brie Cheese and Fries, it was an okay burger, not a lot of flavor, but it was cooked correctly. The fries were not fresh or hot, we had to others at our table who got fries and only one of us got fresh fries. We had a view of the kitchen from our table and noticed that they make tons of fry orders and let them sit there til someone orders them.\nFor dessert we decided to split the Black and White Sundae, it was delicious.

S'Went here for desert only, and Serendipity 3 did not disappoint. \n\nI walked in thinking I wanted a cookies and cream milkshake, which they did have on the menu. However, the ice cream sundaes looked so good, I had to reconsider my choice. \n\nI ended up ordering the deep-friend Oreo extravaganza, which included cookies and cream ice cream, whip cream, and that marshmelo sauce. My server wisely advised me to order the marshmello sauce on the side, because it is way to sweet in any sort of normal dose. The deep-friend Oreos were awesome, the seemed to be breaded in corn flakes. Seriously, it put the OC Fair to shame, and that is not easy to do in the deep frying department. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the "Can\'t Say No" sundae, which included humble pie (peanut butter on a graham cracker crust), peanut butter ice cream, coffee ice cream, and a banana. It was freaking awesome, and that humble pie stuff was great. \n\nI must say, the decor was a bit weird. It had sort of an Alice In Wonderland thing going on, including a clock painted on the wall the showed three-o-clock at all times. I suppose that is because this is Serendipity "3," but I am such a stickler about time that it annoyed me. They also had like signs on the wall from old gas stations and stuff. It just didn\'t match, and it didn\'t work. Maybe there was a point to it all, but if there was I missed it. \n\nSo, this place is close to five stars (for desert anyway, we didn\'t order any other food) but not quite there.

S"If I was reviewing ONLY the Frozen Hot Chocolate (Fro Ho), then it would be a 5 Star review all the way!  However, since I am doing the whole Serendipity experience I have to knock off a few stars.  \n\nThis location sits in front of Caesar's right off the Strip.  It is not very big inside and there are limited seats (inside and out) and that translates to long lines.  It is cute - all white with pink and orange accents.  However, the way around the lines are just heading to the window outside the sit down restaurant to get your sweet treats.  This too can result in a long line, but it moves!  \n\nMy hubby and I ordered a couple 16oz Fro Ho's and found a ledge to sit to drink them, since the limited outside seating was all full!  It is a huge outside space and they fill less than half of it with seating, which results in people plunking themselves everywhere!?  Duh, put out more seats!  You have the room!!!  Anyways, we sampled out Fro Hos and enjoyed the people watching opportunity that this section of Caesar's gives us.  \n\nThe Fro Ho tasted exactly how you would expect - an icy version of the winter treat.  It was yummy and just as good in the sun on a ledge as it would be inside - maybe not as pretty, but I loved it all the same.  \n\nIt is a fun stop.  Next time I am getting the donut that is as big as my head.  It is calling to me!!!"

S"High heel pump was really good.  We were here for a bachelorette party dinner for 16 girls.  I was really irritated they seated us outside in the heat but they reminded me that the contract stated that it would be manager's discretion to be inside or out.  My reservation was for 6 pm and I told them how important it was to start on time because we needed to head off to Chippendales by 8 pm.  We didn't get seated until 620.  So we were rushing through the food.  \n\nI really really like the one in NYC better.  It's got character and is whimsical.  Las Vegas' version is whatever.  If you don't make it to NYC, then I guess you can settle for Vegas."

S'My co-worker has been talking about how good Serendipity\'s " Frozen Hot Chocolate" it was from her last visit. So, on Saturday night after the CES show we decided to go to Serendipity for dinner and frozen hot chocolate. \nI have to agree with with my co-worker, the foods at Serendipity were delicious specially the Mocha frozen hot chocolate. I had the crab cake salad and my co-worker had the Thai beef salad. Both salads were good and right portion size that save us enough stomach space to enjoy our frozen hot chocolate. \nHowever, the service was sorta slow, it took then 30 min to serve us the salad that\'s why I took off one star from the rating. Otherwise, this a good place to eat at Vegas where they serve" normal" food beside steaks and expensive food I believe. I will definitely go back again to try the frozen hot chocolate =)'

S'The only thing I give this place is for the location it\'s a nice place to visit. But the service and food was horrible. I would rather spend the money at a nicer place with better customer service. The waitress her name started with a "p" she was dismissive and she didn\'t really have a lot of tables (I\'ve been a waitress before). It looked like everyone else was serving her food, she forgot things we ordered and bad customer service. At the end of lunch we decided to have dessert- but she ignored us and gave us the bill. I guess we won\'t stay dessert- both worth eating here. Please try to visit tatorria bakery service is fantastic and food is great!'

I decided to go to the to go window instead of waiting (even though, there were open tables when i got there but a 25 minute wait...) uhhhh okay? The 32oz frozzen hot chocolate was 14 bucks. Yeah. A bit on the pricey side! It was certainly delicious but obviously, this was a splurge.... I had an overpriced hot dog because it was probably the only thing cheapest. At least the bun was toasted. Eh. I'd rather get a hot dog and a soda from Costco. At least that one is better tasting and save myself 4 bucks! Oh another thing, they charge a dollar for water which isn't much of a cup. You are better off pretending to gamble and getting a free bottle of water at Caesar's Palace! \n\nSo in essence, go here cuz you need a quick bite and you can't wait (to go window). But it is not worth the price."

S"So FINALLY I got to eat here and I can give a legitimate review. We mentioned we were Diamond Club members and supposedly our wait was reduced to half the time but we still waited a good 30-40 minutes for our party of 4 to be seated for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Still, I will take that compared to the hour and half plus waits I've seen here in the past. I gotta say being hungry and watching the other parties food come out as we were waiting for a table was a really big tease. \nOf course, I had to try their world famous frozen hot chocolate. It was about 105 outside the day we were there so I was especially looking forward to it. I didn't realize that it came in 2 sizes, one a smaller one seemingly meant for one person and a larger one to be shared with several people. Good to know you don't have to get the gigantic one if you just want to try it. I gotta say my expectations were pretty low on it. I just expected a slightly sweeter than normal frappucino. Perhaps because my expectations were so low, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Sweet chocolaty goodness but doesn't quite cross the threshold of too sweet. I wouldn't say its one my favorite desserts ever but definitely worth trying if you are a chocolate lover like me. \nAs far as the rest of the food, we all had a hard time deciding since everything on the menu sounded really good and looked really good as it was being brought out to the other tables. I was surprised that the menu did look that good since as I had mentioned in a previous review, all I saw people eating before was prepackaged salads. Well that must have been from the takeout menu because the restaurant food looked much more desirable. I ended up getting the summer brie turkey sandwich and everyone else got burgers. I thought my sandwich as well as the accompanying sweet potato fries (again...they are everywhere now!) were really good. But melted brie on almost anything is bound to be good. Everyone was pretty happy with their burgers as well. \nWhy the 3 star rating then? First, the service was pretty bad. Very slow and almost rude at times. Unfortunately, I can't remember any specific incidents but I know all of us were pretty unhappy with the service we received. \nSecond, this spot has arguably the best location on the Vegas strip. Unfortunately, the facilities are not built to accommodate the traffic it receives. The location the way its set up would be prefect if perhaps it was tucked away in the back of a casino. But being right on the center of the strip at one of the busiest hotels- no way! The small and quaint feel as well as the always ridiculous wait just doesn't work for me. It just seems too contrived. Too bad they don't have another more low key location in Vegas. The food was good enough for me to go again. Too  bad the rest of the experience didn't make up for it."

S'I fell in love with this place when I watched John Cusack & Kate Beckinsale in fall in love over a cup of frozen hot chocolate. I was only 11 when I watched the movie but I vowed to travel to New York one day just to try it! So when I heard Serendipity was on The Strip, I knew I just had to stop by.\n\nThe wait would have been about 15-30 minutes but the hostess claimed that we "missed" our call, even though our party walked right over when she called my name. Not only did she make us wait an additional 15 minutes while she let two parties walk up without a wait and were seated right away, GREAT. So I sucked it up and put a smile on my face and continued to wait.\n\nFrom the over-sized menus, I ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two and the onion rings (they\'re ginormous!) My boyfriend got the high heel pumps, an Italian style sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. The food wasn\'t anything special but we had a nice lunch.\n\nOur hostess was very friendly and we enjoyed her until she had taken away our onion rings without asking. Of course, I complained and they were quite accommodating to the matter. \n\nOverall, I wasn\'t happy with my experience here. I\'m disappointed that they did not live up to my childhood dreams. I probably wouldn\'t come back unless I have a hankering for frozen hot chocolate, which btw was guilty delicious! And even at that, I\'d probably just head to the to-go window'

We were #27 and ice ream orders in the high 30's were being Called while we were still waiting. Worst thing is when I saw our food up and they still didn't call our #. Stay away.

S"Service is an epic fail one after the other starting from the hostess, to the servers and all the way down to the kitchen.\n\nWe came on a monday around noon. We were four people sitting outside while we waited for about 20-25 mins. Not bad..that's what we were told how long in the beginning. We were texted that our table was ready so went inside. We were taken in by the hostess all the way around the restaurant and back outside....just so she can seat us right behind the table we were sitting on while waiting! Thought that was kinda funny but whatever. Waiter came and took our orders....and so it began...\n\nFood took about 30-40 mins to come out. I got the shrimp pesto pasta. It was kinda bland so I generously poured salt and pepper all over it. My 2 friends got the pizza (I forgot what kind) and my bf got the steak standwich. I didnt try the pizza but it seemed mediocre from my friends' reaction. The steak sandwich was pretty good except my bf ordered medium well but the steak was red. He still ate it bec he likes rare also. Before this, I forgot to mention the waiter forgot to give us napkins and utensils. My friend had to go up to him to get his attention so we can ask for some. We also asked for parmesan cheese and red pepper for the pizza and we never got them. After a while you just get tired of waiting for the server or asking for things you will never get. They (2 different servers) also refilled our glasses with the wrong drinks. They tell you what they were gonna pour but before you can even say no, they've already poured the wrong thing or they tell you the right drink, but the wrong drink comes out of the pitcher. I didnt know whether to laugh or get mad. We were just bewildered by this catastrophic lunch. Customer next to us who was there before us didnt get her order until we were already done eating! As soon as her food came out, she also stormed right out just to prove a point. The main server said the kitchen is backed up. I wanted to tell him that I've been to plenty of really busy restaurants but their service remains excellent. Here, everything just seemed to have all gone wrong!\n\nThe 1 star is for the frozen hot chocolate...that will be the only thing I will ever order from here (if I ever come back) and will order it to-go."

S'I took my first trip to Vegas and was so- excited to try this restaurant out.  I have always wanted one of their frozen hot chocolates.  I luckily found a groupon which was even better.  First the service was sub par.  They had 3 hostesses that stand around. They also do not have bathrooms in the restaurant.  You have to go outside walk around and then go down into this "cave".   Then the public restroom was gross and reminded me of nasty public park toilets (they are metal toilets). It took about 20-30 minutes once seated just to get our water! The house salad was mediocre.  Their balsamic was ok.  My friend and I both got burgers.  I got the ABC burger because that is what the waiter said was their good one and it was the blandest thing ever.  I didn\'t even eat half of it.  The burger had no seasoning, the had no seasoning, and they didn\'t put condiments on it.   They have a lot of fries already made up so they were not the best and luke warm.  We did have their romano cheese onion rings.  Those were WONDERFUL.  I would totally eat those again.  My friend and I also shared a frozen hot chocolate.  It was ok.  I make them at home with real chocolate but the one here tasted like it had a slight powder taste.  I probably would have liked it better if I never had made my own to get that true delicious chocolate taste.  All in all I will not be back to eat, but maybe grab the onion rings to go.'

You can't reserve in advance so you make your reservation when you get there, and the typical wait is about 30 minutes to an hour! I recommend NOT going during lunch hours. It's pretty small inside."

S"When I first heard about Serendipity 3 in New York, I saw it in a movie and read about their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate online. When I found out that they were opening one in Las Vegas, I really wanted to try it. So the next trip I took to Las Vegas, I wanted to make sure I went to Serendipity 3.\n\nMy boyfriend and I took a spontaneuos trip to Las Vegas sometime last August. We just got out of Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and we walked towards Caesar's Palace where Serendipity 3 was. Yay!! When we arrived it was around lunchtime and it was very busy. We asked how long it would be to get a table. The hostess said about half an hour to 45 minutes. We didn't want to wait that long just to get their Frozen Hot Chocolate, so the hostess suggested that we order from their take out window, which was near by. So we ordered the dessert from the window and got our treat in a large take out cup. I was actually looking forward to getting it in their glass cup.. oh well. Took our first sip and it was yummy.\n\nThe next day, we came back to dine in. We weren't that hungry, but we wanted something small to eat, so we ordered their Safe at Home Kobe Beef Sliders. 4 small tiny burgers with American Cheese and a smear of Bacon Aioli on the plate. They're much smaller than your average slider and at $12 a plate, I don't think I'll be ordering that again if I decide to come back to Serendipity 3. We also ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate after, of course. The cup makes it look like you're getting a lot, but don't let it fool you. It's really not that much. But, boy did it look good. A mountain of whipped cream with chocolate shavings on top. A little bit expensive for hot chocolate blended with ice, but what can you do."

S'one word - OVERRATED!\n\nThe fam bamz decided to come here for an afternoon snack.  We heard about the rave of the "Frozen Hot Chocolate" and wanted to find out what the hype was all about.\n\nIt was around 3pm and to be expected, the place was mad busy.  There was an hour and 1/2 wait for a party of 8.  There was plenty of outdoor tables and the weather was absolutely phenomenal during the month of March. We decided to try out their take out orders.  It\'s a limited menu but again, we were there strictly for dessert.\n\nWe were in line for 45 minutes.  I don\'t understand why there was a long wait when the orders consisted of ice cream.  I passed on the frozen hot chocolate - why do I need to spend $15 on a milkshake?  I went with the huge chocolate donut and the Forbidden Sundae which consisted of chocolate cake, chocolate and vanilla cream, whip cream, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.  I waited another 15 minutes for my order to be prepared.  I saw my sundae sitting on the counter underneath an air vent that was melting my ice cream. It took another 10 minutes for the server to grab my donut.  By the time I was handed my sundae, the whip cream turned into milk and spilled over the cheesy cup.  The cake was hard and chewy.  The ice cream underneath and had already turned into mush.  It was the MESSIEST sundae I have ever dealt with.  It was sooo messy, that it got me angry and I just wanted to throw it away! The donut was nothing special....just  big.\n\nThis was the worst experience ever! Everyone wants to eat here because of the movie; well, I\'m hear to tell you that the service and food is below standard!  WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!  If you want real ice cream, come over to the bay area and hit up MITCHELL\'S!  Mitchell\'s is worth standing in line for!'

S"Ahhh the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate debate rages on with all these reviews. Can't read 1450 reviews, but i have never encountered a breakfast dish as tasty and unusual as the Frrrrrozen Hot Chocolate....wait for it......French Toast. It was actually triple stacked and the bread must have been dipped in the stuff and grilled which killed the grainy flavor that is found in the drink (I tried a shot of the stuff which was included in my Restaurant week 3 course breakfast). Ok back to this breakfast masterpiece which was topped with some chocolate syrup, whipped cream, a load of fresh strawberries and the pista resistance - whole pistachio nuts. I sent a photo of this thing to people and some thought it looked like a giant hamburger. You barely will need the maple syrup and this is just clearly something you can't find anywhere else. For rest. week, it was packaged with an outstanding triple berry smoothie ($6 normally) and then the third couse was mini-chocolate chip cookies filled with cookie dough ice cream (solid). Tourists don't care what they pay for food, but this is worthy for a locals investment also and the calories are worth skipping a few meals after (i finally had another snack 10 hours later is how full I was!). Outside dining is the way too go and service was friendly as well."

My other two girlfriends waited outside for their to go orders they already placed, which ended up taking half an hour for them to get their crappy salad and ice cream sundae. \n\nTHIS ONE STAR IS MEANT FOR THE GUY AT THE BAR. He was really cool and gave us what we wanted the entire time. Thank you.\n\nSerendipity owners, if you want to keep your establishment in the long run, you might want to hire more servers, shape up your takeout cashiers, and stop raising already steep prices."

S"So many visits to Vegas and never had a chance to try Serendipity 3 until my last vacation there. You walk in to this awesome colorful room filled with a ton of people trying all of Serendipity's creations. After about a 10 minute wait we were escorted to the patio overlooking the strip. Although it was freezing they have fire heaters which helped.\n\nThey handed us this huge menu and gave us the challenge of picking just a few items (when really I wanted to try it all!) I ordered the obvious frozen hot chocolate, thanks to some show on the Food Network or Travel Channel. My husband got a chocolate cake sundae, which could have fed at least two people. We also ordered crab spinach dip which was alright. Just when I thought I had enough the waiter brought out cotton candy martini's for another table. After starring down the martini hoping it would levitate to my table, I ordered one as well. I think the fun of seeing the puffy sugar turn into liquid was more entertaining then drinking it, but maybe mine was made a little strong. \n\nOverall we had an awesome experience. Thanks to Deon, our waiter. He did a great job! I almost didn't want to leave! That was until we saw the check. The place is not cheap! Cant wait for our next trip!"

S'This is my second time here because my first experience was amazing. The service I received, the food, and atmosphere were wonderful and I wanted to share that with some friends. It is Restaurant Week until September 5 and I was excited to see Serendipity on the list. Sad to say, I was devastated and disappointed by tonight\'s experience.\n\nAfter being seated, our server immediately asks us what we\'d like to order. We weren\'t greeted or welcomed and he didn\'t even give us his name. Not even a smile and barely any eye contact whatsoever during the entire night. We tell him we were here for Restaurant Week (because there is a separate menu) and he had no idea what we were talking about and made that very clear in a rude manner. We were somewhat familiar with the menu items from viewing it online and asked if this or that was part of it and he would just reply "yes" or "no" and finally brought out the different menu.\n\nOur server never asked for our drink orders and had us choose all three courses right away and just brought out water afterwards. We only saw our server when he brought out the food or there were plates to be cleared. Getting a refill was nearly impossible. I had to get the attention of a hostess. I watched the server\'s interaction with his other tables and they were just as poor. We were hesitant to speak with a manager because we didn\'t want to risk our food being tampered with and waited until the end of our meal.\n\nThe manager was great and showed appreciation of the feedback but replied that our specific server had received numerous complaints. My concern then is why is this server still doing a bad job and why is he still employed? It looked as if he was angry or having a bad day but once you come to work, you leave that at the door. If it wasn\'t for the manager handling the situation the way he did, I would have never thought of coming back.'

I'm guessing that sitting outside in 115 degree weather last weekend (in the dead zone between misting fans, no less) didn't help very much, but while chocolate-y, it kind of felt like something i could make at home with ice and a blender.  Also had a root beer float (which was actually really good), reuben, and sweet potato fries.   It is on the pricey side, but then again, so is the rest of Vegas.   I'd probably go back to try some of the other desserts or cocktails, but the food is probably a pass."

We asked a hostess two times for our waitress & she was rude and never got her or asked if she could help us.. Then the manager came out to deal with another table & we had to get up & go to HER to voice out complaint... we told her we wanted our food put in all together including dessert & wanted our checks done within the hour as we had a show to be at......

S"I'm going to start out by saying that I was a little disappointed with this place. The outdoor appeal and girly decor drew me in for lunch. \n\nIt was around 4 PM and it was super busy. It took a while for our waitress to finally reach us to take our order. For an appetizer, we ordered the Grilled Globe Artichokes, which was a big mistake. The artichokes we were served were quite small, dry and burnt, and we could barely salvage anything from them. We only got a couple leaves from each piece (three in total) and for $15, it wasn't worth it. We asked if we could order something else. The waitress let us know that the artichoke is suppose to be like that, but will gladly give us something different. We ordered chicken quesadillas. They were very average. Almost microwave quality.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Chop Chop salad, which is basically like a garbage salad (not literally) and I didn't care for it at all. The chicken quality wasn't good and the salad was overall very bland. It reminded me of a cafeteria salad. My friend ordered The Full Monty Chicken Sandwich and she didn't care for hers either. \n\nAt this point we came to the conclusion that this place is probably better known for their sundaes and not their food, as just about every table was enjoying a big sundae. I'm a sucker for Red Velvet Cake, so when I spotted Red Velvet Sundae on the menu, I didn't have to do any other reading. The sundae was huge and contained loads of chocolate ice cream, a slice of red velvet cake and whipped cream and sprinkles. The cake was mediocre and frankly didn't have much flavor. The chocolate ice cream was super good and creamy - almost like a rich, chocolate frozen custard or gelato. The mix of red velvet doesn't go smoothly with chocolate ice cream (yes I know Red Velvet Cake is technically chocolate cake).. it's a bit overpowering to where you can't taste the cake. It'd probably be better with vanilla ice cream. It was good, but not good enough to OD on. \n\nUnfortunately not impressed and probably wouldn't recommend. Also, no restrooms in the restaurant. Thankfully, there is one nearby."

I had the frozen hot chocolate because I saw it on Food Network and it did live up to its reputation.  It was rich, perfect chocolate taste, and heaven.  I have also had their sundae which has creamy ice cream, rich chocolate, nuts and whatever you want.  Their fried Oreos are wonderful!  I would recommend that you go there at night and sit outside near the street where you can people watch and just enjoy the view.  Very nice place to go on a date.'

To be honest, the frozen hot chocolate was SUPER overrated--it tasted to me like the gloopy soft serve ice cream with icy bits in it that they have at Hometown Buffet or whatever. We didn't finish it cuz it was huge and we wanted to fit into our clubbing gear later.\n\nThe prices are on average 12- 14 bucks per entree i think, and while the food was alright, it didn't blow me away or leave me salivating to come back. While some of the food was good, I would not pay that much, esp for an omelette I could easily make myself or a chopped up sweet potato. Service also was slow. Sooo, would not come back."

The boyfriend and I shared the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate and I found it quite refreshing and large enough to share for two (or maybe 3 even). Great for a cool down but I was expecting a little more because it tastes as it is named. Frozen Hot Chocolate = ice blended hot cocoa mix topped with a whole lotta whip cream and chocolate shavings.

S'The joys of Pho (pronounced "ph-uh") are fairly straightforward.  Take a tasty broth, add some expertly-sliced thin meat, scallions and rice noodles are offer the ingredients in a bowl.  Add some basil, bean sprouts and spicy peppers on the side (with an optional side of rooster sauce and other spicy, sweet and/or sour sauces).\n\nSimple enough, but get the right bowl of pho and your view of the world drastically improves.  Call it stomach psychiatry--a really tasty bowl of pho can directly stimulate serotonin levels in the brain (more serotonin = more happy).  \n\nBut all of that just speaks to the genius that is pho.  Here\'s why you should head to Pho Kim Long for your pho fix.  When I was there, I ordered the rare steak and brisket pho.  The beef broth was well-prepared and pretty rich.  Other reviewers seem to have complained about the quality of the broth, but during my lunch there it was spot on.  It was a very solid offering.  The side veggies were crisp and fresh and delicious.  \n\nAnd Pho Kim Long offers a well-stocked selection of sauces if you like to tinker with your food--making it spicier, sweeter, a dash of sour, etc.  It all made for the perfect pho lunch.  The other folks at my table had the beef vermicelli ("bun" in Vietnamese) and were very pleased, reporting that the bun was better than most.  All of which earns it about 3.5 stars (rounded up because of how popular the place seemed--gotta give some credence to the will of the people).\n\nGood enough that Pho Kim Long has become a standard in my list of Vietnamese places in town.  And the crowd there at lunch suggests that this place has become a go to lunch destination in Chinatown.  It has a big dining space and every table was packed when we were there.  That might explain why service was a little slow when we were there.  But, to the wait staff\'s credit, they didn\'t seem to mind when we stepped over to the cashier without a bill in order to settle up.  \n\nI haven\'t tried it late night, but the place is open 24 hrs so it might be worth a visit after a night out on the strip (put down the Jack in the Box, pick up the chopsticks).'

Broth was superb but the noodles were a bit off for me. Not horrible though. Can be fixed with the right ratio of siracha, limes, cilantro, bean sprouts, and jalapenos.

My guess is they took out whatever business was next door.\n\nSince this place IS open 24/7, it's the perfect spot when you are craving Pho after a big night out.\n\nFunny side note....at 3:30am, the guy that seats you, is a cop. Badge and all. Pretty awesome."

I recommend. \n\nService was just alright, not that memorable. I remember it took forever for the food to come out. We were a party of about 10, but they just kept us waiting forever while I was famished. I just wanted me some good Vietnamese food in my tummy.. :("

S'Ate there last night and they treated us sooo poorly. I have never experienced such poor service. The waiters did NOT acknowledge us and kept ignoring us if we needed something... Even after eye contact. Multiple waiters were doing the same to us. At check out, we got DISRESPECTED by the so called restaurant owner... He refused to help us figure out our bill as it was being split into two orders. We asked if we could barrow their calculator and he says we have to use our own and figure it ourselves and then he answers the phone and completely ignores us. We got upset at him, and he CAUSED us out! Of course we were causing back to depend ourselves but then he called security like we were some animals. This was the worse place I have ever been too.'

S"Best Pho I've found in Vegas so far!\n\nThe broth was superb, although their selection of Pho isn't as big as most other places. I usually get the Pho Dac Biet anywhere I go, I love the tendon and tripe but this place only had rare steak, brisket, and flank. They put a lot of meat in it too which was a + in my book, but the noodles and broth are what made it for me. \n\nEspecially being in Vegas, this might save  your life the morning after a long night. After leaving Pho Kim Long I felt like new, ready to take on whatever vegas had left to throw at me. I WILL be back to this place again, thats for sure."

My bf n I always give more than 18% tip however not today. \nI always order number 13 which is combination pho. there were no meats today. I wanted to say something but I was so upset already I did not want to say another word. \nI know this place is always crowded so the service isnt so good but i ate around 3pm.

S"Want an idea of how popular this place is? After a night of clubbing, Kalila and I went to Pho Kim Long to eat quickly before going home. We had left our friends behind at the club. As soon as we finished eating, who strolls in? The rest of our friends that we had been with just about 30-40 mins earlier. We hadn't told them where we were going. Watch out Jack in the crack, people just LOVE pho when they're drunk.\n\nPho or vermicelli always hits the spot. Everyone has their own way of eating pho. Some people prefer lots of bean sprouts & chili paste or sriracha in it. It's all about preference. The last time I ate it, I was a little bummed that I ran out of noodles.\n\nA good thing to take note of, is that you can order pho in a small or large size. Kalila is little and she actually finished her small bowl.\n\nThe location is rather large with lots of tables from wall to wall. They do accommodate to bigger parties, putting multiple tables together if need be."

S'"what?!", "where did you want to eat?!", "HAHA! huh?!" Those are just some of the weird reactions I get when I say I want to eat here. I guess you can say it doesn\'t sound very nice to say, but the food here is my favorite Vietnamese cuisine. I\'m not a huge fan of the pho but I\'m a very big fan of their vermicelli noodle bowls! It\'s the perfect amount of food for someone with a middle sized appetite. They\'re open late night so if you\'re out on the strip with your friends or are looking for a late night snack (hardly the size for a snack), Mr. Pho Kim Long is your best bet to satisfy your Vietnamese craving.\n\nThe service isn\'t super because of the lack of personality their staff has but they bring your food out fairly quick. Does one base service on how quick you get to eat or how pleasant they make your visit? I say it depends on both but lucky for Pho Kim Long, their service is very fast and consistent.  It wouldn\'t hurt the staff to crack a smile or two, crack a joke, or laugh even. They don\'t have a problem splitting your checks as long as they get their money.  The atmosphere is very traditionally Asian and being of Asian descent, it doesn\'t do much for me.  In other words, you wont catch me with my iPhone in hand snapping shots like some tourist or something. Maybe, the food for Yelp but that\'s all ;)\n\nNever had a problem customer service-wise, always accommodated the big groups of friends I go everywhere with, and doesn\'t take log to bring what you ask for. That\'s a big thing for me when the server takes the detour to bring you something you\'ve asked for. And having to ask for it twice really peeves me but as busy and as impersonable as their staff is, they go and get what you ask for right away. Maybe to get you to go faster? If I wanted to be In -n- Out of a joint, I\'d go get a burger! Hahaha! Go for the pork vermicelli, add the sauce they give you with some of the oyster (brown) sauce and a bit of the hot sauce and you\'ll be good! Have some fun saying the restaurant when suggesting to eat here! Happy eating! :)'

S"If it was possible to rate this place a -1, I would. My boyfriend and I always liked coming here until our last visit. We noticed over time the food hasn't been as good, and the service is probably the worst I've ever had. But this visit was the last straw. A friend and I got to the restaurant to grab a table for our party of 7. The wait wasn't long at all. We were seated immediately, but it took our server 18 minutes before I could flag him down just for a drink order. I even timed it because the service there the last few times hasn't been its best. Mind you it wasn't busy compared to its usual hectic environment. We got our drinks and our friends arrived, we were finally ready to order and no one came back to our table for another 20 mins. We had to stop another server and ask him to take our order because apparently our server decided to clock out and was hanging out in the back of the restaurant in his wife beater watching everyone eat like a damn creep. Everyone ordered either an app or just an entree. Not too much food like we usually do. I ordered the chicken pad thai. Everyone got their food except for me. After everyone else got their food, no one else stopped by our table. I got up to tell someone to take what I ordered off the bill because I no longer wanted it. He said ok and walked to the back. A few mins later he came out with my order in a to go box. I told him AGAIN that I no longer wanted it because it took too long. We had to ask 3 different people for our check and that took over 10 mins to get. I honestly don't understand how management can allow such horrible service to their customers. We're no longer coming to this restaurant for any reason what so ever."

S'It\'s the wee hours post-partying in Vegas + we were hungry... I busted out my phone, opened the Yelp app + in no time Pho Kim Long popped onto my screen. About 300 reviews, 2.5 stars average, one $ sign, + the words "late-night" as one of the highlights... Good enough for me! \n\nNo need to detail my visits to the curiously-named hot spot as all it comes down to is needing a place to fill the stomach + to sober up whether it\'s the wee hours or late morning. It\'s in a strip mall right along Spring Mountain Rd so parking is not a problem... just expect it to be a bit crowded during late hours. The selection on the menu is a decent variety of Vietnamese dishes, but the pho options are pretty limited. Regardless, somehow I find myself ordering a bowl of Pho Tai (rare beef) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=_jQ4QD84l_CUpsLD8L9LSg or something similar every time. A bowl of pho is about $7-8, which is on the pricey side compared to what I\'m used to both in Northern or Southern California, but the portion size is good enough. Quality is okay... soup is filled nearly to the brim, but the broth could be more flavorful + the noodles/beef are whatever. Average at best. We got spring rolls once, which were equally not noteworthy in any way other than that they actually gave us 2 peanut sauce dipping bowls... for the 3 of us. o_O http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=n7M27mi6yD0uqDjCHP6VPw  Perhaps next time I\'ll try something other than pho since most of the more positive reviews here seem to be for other items on the menu. \n\nIn retrospect, I\'m sure there\'s better late night eats of the soupy-noodley sort in the Chinatown area or elsewhere off the Strip, but Pho Kim Long does its job. I\'d give 2.5 stars if I could... but I\'m rounding up. 3 stars for a convenience of this 24-hour, clean place to chow down because sometimes there\'s just nothing more satisfying than a steaming bowl of noodles.'

S'"CRAWFISH" is a new addition to Pho Kim Long, and that\'s what brought me here in the first place.  They only started offering this shellfish in June, weekends only.\n\nMy luck that the Sunday I choose to come in, they weren\'t offering it. We still sat down for dinner and this is what we got: \n\n* Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho (Beef Stew Egg Noodle) - $7.95: The Big F enjoyed his noodle soup.  I was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.\n\n* Dau Dua Xao XO Sauce (Stir fried String Beans with XO Sauce) - $9.95: Tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  A nice spice kick as well.\n\n* Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam Style Chicken with Seasoned Rice) $8.50: I\'ve always liked Hainamese chicken since my friend\'s mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  It\'s good here, but definitely not as good as my friend\'s mom\'s version.\n\nPho Kim Long II is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  A great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  Their menu is pretty extensive so there\'s plenty of choices for everyone.  And portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (I wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)\n\nFrom this experience, I give it a FOUR stars.\n\nI love Hot N Juicy Crawfish up the road, and I definitely believe in some healthy competition.  So, last Friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it\'s worthy.\n\nWe decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     We noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  It came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  They also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  The Big F requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.\n\nI dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  It was old or way overcooked.  The tail meat didn\'t come off the shell easily and was broken up.  I thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  Unfortunately, this wasn\'t the case.  There was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  The Big F was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (We usually go for two pounds each!)  The corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn\'t make up for the bad crawfish.  Since it comes in a bowl, there\'s no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  No bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.\n\nWhen I\'m craving crawfish, I\'ll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at Hot N Juicy.\n\nFor this experience, I give it a TWO stars.\n\nOverall, a four stars for their Vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  I\'m giving Pho Kim Long II a THREE star.\n\n(Pics are posted!)'

S'BEST PHO AROUND. \nBest broth, best ingredients, standard price, and did I mention best broth??\n\nAnyway this places other food is decent, spring rolls are the only thing that Id say are subpar, but really, its all about the PHO PHO PHO. \n\nIm from SF, lived in LA and now Vegas, and this place is it. Everyone has heard of it. Its like an Asian mecca, every girl I meet goes here and late night its a stripper haven. One time I was waiting on Pho to go and a girl dropped a dub in front of me. My girl was sitting on my lap and she saw it first. Shes from Vegas so instead of doing something kind, she tapped me and let me be the moral judge (sorry XTI but we all know u aint readin this...) anyway, I grabbed it  and tapped the girl. She turned around and it was a stripper from my work in SF. (I actually got fired because of her and her amazing butt) We laughed embarassingly and said hi. After exchanging pleasantries I mentioned my life and nodded at the guamanian in my lap and the convo halted (still kicking myself for thatttt) Point is, this place holds it down and word spreads. Good, late, cheap., clean granite tables, huge fishtanks...great place to have a mellow meal. Just wash your hands after that Jalepeno.'

S"I am a fan. and this is why. The Pho may not be the best you've ever tasted, but Its pretty damn good. I mean really how many ways is there to make Pho? Had the Beef tendon pho, it hit the spot. Aside from the pho, they're ong choy (water spinach) was sauteed well, great sauce. Fried Calamari, was probably the best i have had, I couldnt stop eating it. and the roast duck had a lot of flavor, and you could tell it was made fresh, not re-heated. I can't seem to get a grasp on what type of sauce it was. the salted fish fried rice was also flavor, and you could actually taste the salted fish unlike other places (sam woo). these items are some of the same dishes I get at several asian restaurants just to compare, and the version here are right up there to one of the best i have had. \n\nJust to comment on people talking about service and such, I don't mean to be harsh, or offend the asian culture, because I consider myself asian myself. But the bad service? first these types of places is not a pf changs or a pei wei. they're not here to ask you how your day is going. they're just not, some of them don't even speak english. yes when they bring out the food to you, sometimes they rush, or kind of pack all the dishes on the table, looking like they slam the plates on it., theyre a little rough and maybe your oolong tea spills a little from your cup. you know what thats a sign of? that it's authentic. Some of the best places I have eaten at in California were like this. actually my favorite place back home, was like this, won't exactly strike you as fine dining and not the most polite servers but best food hands down. I once went to a place in San Francisco, where you had to go down they're basement to go to the bathroom, a little scary, but what shocked me more was how good they're food was"

Prices are reasonable unlike the Pho places inside the casinos where they charge $10 plus for pho !

I see a sign that says they were voted best pho in LV and there is a wait. Yes, a 20 minute wait at 2am. It must be decent. BOY WAS I WRONG!\n\nWe were told it'd be a 20 minute wait so we just took a quick walk down the strip mall. We came back not 5 minutes later and waited another 20 minutes. I eventually go up and ask him when our table will be ready and he said that our names were called like 20 minutes ago. Say what? So apparently a 20 minute wait means 5 minutes now? Get your timing right! So i asked to be put back on the list and there was probably another 4-5 groups that came after me. Well, he sat all of them first. We  only needed a 3-top and all those other groups were pretty much the same size if not larger. I reminded him and he barely even gave me any attention. Eventually we got seated. The service sucked, the food was horrid (none of us finished), and we definitely didn't tip. I know the table next to us was also very unhappy and also didn't tip. You'd be lucky to get anyone's attention since they zip by you at warp speed. \n\nIt was past 3am and I was unfulfilled. I will NEVER be back here. Yelpers, this is fair warning."

A little on the salty side but the meat was freshly pink and the noodles was yummmmy. \n\nThe fried rice was kinda gross though. It was pretty bland and tasteless. I felt like I was just eating it just to eat it. My gf got the drunken noodles, which are the wide flat rice noodles. Kind of too oily for me but it was really good. Tons of basil flavor in it too! \n\nEven though the rice was bad, I give this place 4 stars because it is cheap, open late, and fun place to go to after you club."

Add to that the hilarity of the restaurant name itself, and you'll know how I ended up there with a snickering group of dudes with a late night appetite.\n\nOur table shared the Vietnamese spring rolls as an appetizer, along with a bowl of pho, the pan fried noodle, and the chicken wraps, all of which were really good. The panfried noodle was a good amount, but I would personally have preferred more veggies and the inclusion of something other than the baby bok choy, such as mushrooms and broccoli. The chicken lettuce wraps were good- more chicken than lettuce, but tasty enough that we didn't mind and much better than the other way around.\n\nService was a little slow but was efficient. Menu is large, and it took a while to make up our minds- unfortunately my first choice order was the crepe, and I was told they were out. I'm not sure how they'd be out of eggs or how that works, but I guess it just means I'll have to come back another time to have it."

I'd have to say that's the only negative thing I encountered.\n\nSo for starters I ordered the Fried Potstickers and the Crispy Calamari. The potstickers were just perfect and full of flavor. The calamari I absolutely fell in love with! Fried to a perfect golden brown crisp, on a bed of cabbage and peppers with a cocktail sauce on the side. All the flavors were right and it made me want another order soon as I was done!\n\nFor entree I had the Roasted Duck with Peanuts and a sweet and sour sauce. The duck was seasoned and roasted to a tee and the sauce along with the peanuts and cilantro really connected all of the flavors as one. One of the best plates of duck I've had in a while! I wasn't full although I was indeed satisfied. This is a nice place to go after a night of clubbing or even for a date. I will definitely be back again!"

I know we came here ages ago (my family and I) and I was sorely disappointed back then. This time around it wasn't too bad and it was actually quite good. The only problem was it was quite pricy for a bowl of Pho. I think it was 7 or 8 dollars for a average sized bowl. Trust me, coming from San Jose, CA you have places with an XL bowl costing you only 4 to 5 bucks. \n\nOverall, I give them 3/3.5 out of 5.

S"I rated this 3.5 stars and only rounded down since I did realize I don't usually go to have pho here, or anywhere, on my own usually. Only when friends want to go. It's not that I don't think pho is good food. It's just that I have so many other favorites that rank above it, so sue me hehe. That said, I have tried pho at alot of places but I've been here the most. That partly is due to its proximity to the Strip and being open 24hrs. Who am I kidding, those ARE the main reasons I've patronized this pho establishment more than any other pho spot. Friends visiting out of town, want late night eats nearby after gambling and/or partying all day/night. \nI remember when it wasn't open late. Then it seemed like every year or 2 the closing time became 1hr later, next thing I know it's 24hrs! Pho spots are notorious for their horrible service. Although the last time I went recently the service was horrible. The pho came with a lemon wedge instead of limes and I got exactly one basil thai stem. And we could never find our waiter and ended up having 3 separate waiters help us. Besides that, the service has been pretty decent here. The broth doesn't taste noticeably better or worse than any of the other pho's I've had. I do get a little annoyed everytime I get my pho, the rare steak on top is already fully cooked from the heat of the broth. I should probably follow my one friend's lead and ask for the meat on the side so that doesn't happen but I always forget.\nIf you eat at the hours I do, there probably is not many other options but during normal times when people eat, there are alot of pho choices scattered along Spring Mountain Road in Chinatown. I think it's a decent place for pho and it helps that you never have to worry if it's closed."

It wasn't the best ive had since i'm spoiled with good viet food at home but it sure hit the spot.\n\nThe service was attentive and the place was clean.

A bit of hot sauces mixed up for dipping the meat, and I'm happy.\n\nThe egg rolls are served nuclear hot, and unlike a lot of other places, appear to be home-made... at least ours always appear that way, from their non-uniform shapes and funky bulges.  Oh, and they're tasty, too.\n\nA bowl of pho runs you around $7 with a large being $1 more.  This is expensive for pho compared to places in L.A., but is about the norm for Pho here in Vegas.

S"Originally, we wanted to eat some Thai Style Noodle House.  To our dismay, they were closing in 10 minutes when we arrived.  So, off we trecked to the next Asian restaurant and landed in Pho Kim Long.\n\nOne thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours a day and I was informed that they are the only pho place that has these hours.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  It was my bf, and two of our friends who shared this experience with us.  I never really know what to order from here so I had our friend order for  me.  \n \nWhen the bowl came my way, I was very excited as I'd never had it before.  I believe it was pho with some kind of beef balls.  There were other meats in there but I forgot to ask what type it was.  The broth was good without the extra sauces that people normally put in there.  When adding the bean sprouts, mint, and jalapeno's the kick it gives is a whirlwind of pleasures in your tongue.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the fried rice.  The color was somewhat orangey-yellow.  We've never had anything like it.  Per our friend, the way it's made is the cook adds just the yolk to give it that sunshine color.  It's definitely different but I can't say I'd order it for myself in the future.  The other dish we had was a spicy tofu.  That was really addicting.  Normally, tofu doesn't blend well with anything because of how bland it is.  But, they added the right amount of spice to give it a pleasing taste.\n\nThe atmosphere of the whole restaurant was very relaxed.

S"First off - awesome name! haha! Now that we got that out of the way, one of my friends (who is a Vegas regular) recommended this place after a long night of eating, drinking, debating about politics, thinking about going clubbing, not going clubbing, getting old, and then getting hungry again!  I was excited, not becuase of the name, but because this place was supposed to have some really good PHO!\n\nSad to say, I was very disappointed!  The pho looked good, but didn't measure up to its good looks.  My pho had rare beef and beef balls, both of which were dry and flavorless.  I added my normal squeeze of lime and tons of sriracha but the broth was just not doing it for me.  I took a few sips/bites and I was done!  Finished up my beer and left quite unsatisfied.  Maybe it was just an off night or maybe because it was 3 in the morning?!!"

They do offer a lot more different kinds of food other than Vietnamese food though.\n\nHowever, their service is HORRIBLE. People always say, oh yeah you shouldn't expect good services from Asian restaurants , or oh yeah the worse the service is, the better the food is! No, just no. We had to ask them so many times for them to bring up waters, they came to us with the wrong food, server was very impatient when we ordered, and when the food came, they just quickly put the food down anywhere on our table, we had to move the food ourselves. \n\nMeh. Also there's always a long line. Unless I really want Pho and I can't wait till I get back to LA, I probably won't come here again."

A pair of Asian men sat at the table next to us ten minutes later and so the waiter HAD to show up.  Of course he took their order first and our food made it out eventually.  I paid with my credit card and went out to my car where I was chased down by the manager who asked me if I had paid!

Some other restaurants serve really bad pieces of meat that are almost inedible or have too much fat on them.  \n\nWhy 2 stars?

My friend and I were immediately sat and 2 seconds later water was being dropped off and a little lady came over to our table and took our order, I stated I needed a few minutes.\n\nWe ordered spring rolls and two differnt kinds of pho, beef and vegan.\n\nThe food came out quickly. The spring rolls seemed as if they had been sitting around because they were all different colors and some of the innards of the roll were mushy. The peanut sauce was also a little off.\n\nOur pho came out a few minutes later. (The food came out so quickly) My pho was okay, but not great. Definitely disappointed. \n\nAlthough it satiated my Pho-fix. It wasn't that good. I wasn't impressed. I don't get what the hype is about...

On Mother's day I went there with 10 friends at night and, mind you, the servers and all were great.. when we went to pay for our checks, they let us split our check! They ALWAYS let us split our checks EVERYTIME I GO. \n\nThe first time they didn't split my check was a couple months ago, it was my friend and her boyfriend, myself, and my boyfriend. We wanted to split the check in two. The man wouldn't let us do it! He said they never do which is an outright LIE. He kept walking around in his register area not listening to me so I got mad, but my friend paid for us all. \n\nThe next time we went, it was myself and another two people, again, they let us split our checks.\n\nThe time after that, it was myself, and four other people, and again they WOULD NOT split our checks. SAME GUY. Wish I remembered his name.. He just told us to pay some amount on our cards and pay that way but that he wouldn't ever split our checks.\n\nPersonally, I love eating there, the servers are nice.

We had our fried rice brought out to us like 10 min before the rest of our dishes.  What good is that?  Good thing it was yummy.  We then had to get white rice which they now charge for, to have with our entrees.  We had the honey walnut shrimp, salt and pepper pork chops, and crispy noodles with beef and brocolli.  Everything was great!  I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for something comforting to eat off the strip.

S"During my Vegas weekend, the GF actually got some crazy sickness and had to be bedridden (which totally sucked). Especially on the strip, trying to get some good, hot soup on the go is nearly impossible (especially since it was President's weekend) so we went off strip to this Pho restaurant. \n\nWhen you come in, you know it's a good Pho restaurant when 100% of their clients are Vietnamese and they're all here to eat pho. As we were immediately seated, they took our order of pho and egg rolls. Like any pho restaurant, their food came out almost as soon as we ordered. The pho broth was light and flavorful. Even the GF that was dying said that there was so much different types of flavor going on in the broth. They also gave generous portions of meat in the pho as well. I would say that their meat to noodle ratio was almost 1:1 unlike the other Pho restaurants that I go to in L.A. \n\nThe price here isn't that inflated as well. A bowl of Pho ran 7-8$ depending on which one you got and the egg rolls were 6$. The egg rolls weren't anything special but they were skinnier than the ones I usually get. \n\nIf you're looking for some good pho (especially after those crazy nights), get off the strip (don't go to the one in TI) and come here. It's cheaper and better quality and bigger portions."

S"Some of my brother's Vietnamese friends eat pho for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  There are lots of pho places around Vegas where he lives, So when he wants  this even at midnight, Pho Kim Long is his go to place. They also make some decent Chinese food. Some of the tables around us had your usual pan fried noodles, whole fried fish, and sweet and sour pork.  But most people had pho. \n\nAlthough more salty than I personally like, the simple broth and noodles has a light, nice aroma served in a large bowl.  Add meat, like rare steak slices, along with some condiments, like basil, bean sprouts, and onions ($7), it was an awesome meal in itself.  I was going to order the same thing, but for the same price, you can get a half rotisserie small chicken with rice.  It was crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside ($7). So simple, yet so good.\n\nCustomers are mostly families during the day till early evening.  After that, they're the winners and mostly losers from the casinos, and sobering drunken clubbers and night shift workers. The inside is comofrtable and nicely appointed with ample booths or tables. During lunch dinner. no matter what day, it is crowded.  Finding a parking spot, however, is a war of patience and luck.  Fortunately, a guy was pulling out just as we walked inside, so we didn't have to exhibit our Type A parking lot Ninja tactics. While waiting to be seated, I enjoyed their relaxing goldfish tanks. \n\nThis place is so typical Vegas with a Vietnamese and Chinese twist. I'd go back to try a few more dishes.  Service was good, prompt with the soda ($2) refills and special requests, and making sure all was OK."

It is very large, and at lunch there are at least 10 people working here, doing a brisk business. The food is solid but not spectacular. The menu is very extensive, the ambiance clean, upscale and modern, and the service is very good. Prices are a little more than you are used to in California\'s Viet hot spots. \n\nThey do have a lounge adjacent to it now, which I haven\'t tried yet. Maybe it is a Viet Cafe or classic Viet men\'s lounge? It might be closer to the sound of the name sake, Pho Kim Long, at least in some parton\'s minds.'

Well, I haven't had pho in many years, it was cold, so sure, why not?!\n\nIt was very tasty.  I tend to get the same things with each visit. Egg rolls, chicken wings, and small #15.  All very satisfying and hits the spot each time a craving sneaks up on me.  I do have to say, I now find myself craving the wings (with TONS of fried garlic on top) more then the pho. My mouth is starting water just thinking about those crispy, juicy little things.\n\nThe baby decided she doesn't like the noodles, so I always get a bowl with a little bit of rice and add the soup for her.  She also, recently, decided she likes the egg rolls too.  \n\nI haven't really tried any place else for pho, but I know I should, to see if I really do like it as much as I do.

S"My wife and I are huge fans of the original NYC branch, and were not as impressed with the Vegas branch initially.  After a few visits they've polished it up a bit and got their service and food spot on.  It's our favorite restaurant in Vegas (much the same as it's our favorite restaurant in NYC).\n\nThe first couple of times here, when the restaurant was first opened, the service was a bit off, or perhaps we were unlucky and got a newby waiter.  The margaritas seemed to be watered down too.  Thankfully, the good food kept us coming back.  The last couple of visits have been great, and they have their timing and attentiveness dialed-in, and have perfected their margaritas.  They check on you enough without getting in your face every two minutes, and the food is paced well so that you don't have overlapping dishes.\n\nWe love the margaritas here, and like to come a bit early and have one or two before the meal.  I like getting the smoky floaters (aged tequila) on top as well.  \n\nA few notable items from our last visit:\n-Tuna nachos.  This is tuna tartare with avocado and chips (and some kind of caper dressing).  This was and is one of our favorite dishes at either Mesa.  Alas, as of our last visit it's been hit by the recession shrink ray.  We used to get one order to share, but its now too small for that and they don't give you enough chips.  It still tastes great though.\n-Crispy calamari salad.  Basically classed-up fried calamari, but really, really crispy and with a variety of sauces, and called a salad to make you feel better about yourself.  There's a vinagrette, some kind of sundried tomato sauce, and some kind of avocado sauce.  I liked the vinagrette best.\n-Veal chop with wild rice tamale.  I think this dish has the signature Mesa Grill tastes.  It's basically a really good cut of meat that has been perfectly grilled, with a very nice and slightly spicy sauce on it (some kind of pepper/chipotle sauce) and some demiglace.  Very tender and flavorful on its own with a little zing from the sauce, but not overpowered by the sauce.  The tamale is a nice side.\n-Green chile ciopinno.  Fish, shrimp, scallops, mussels, and lobster in an excellent green chile broth.  This one is hard to describe; the flavors are pretty unique.  Just try it yourself, it's excellent.\n-Corn flan with caramel.  I'm not a huge fan of flan, but this is the best flan I've ever had.  Very creamy, and despite being covered in caramel it's not too sweet.\n\nOverall, we love this place and definitely will be back."

S'By far the worst meal we had in Vegas.\n\nWhen we arrived to place our reservation in person (after no one answered the phone) we were ignored for several minutes by two hosts who were having a personal conversation. \nOur waiter took the rude to a whole new level. He didn\'t even acknowledge my wife for close to ten minutes, speaking solely to and making eye contact only with me. He actually dropped his "game face" before out of eyesight after leaving the table and rolled his eyes.\n\nThe meal started off well with decent margaritas (although the bar only accepts cash or room-charges). The meal then quickly deteriorated. After enjoying some good bread and muffin (one muffin for two people) we had a chicken quesadilla for an appetizer, which was tasty, but overly salty. I ordered the lamb medium rare and it came raw and purple. My wife ordered the sixteen spice chicken which was sickly sweet. Tried the cioppino...it was edible at best. Overly fishy smelling in general with mussels that were certainly past their prime. Overall, the food was overly sweet and generally bad.\n\nIf you want to experience a good $100 plus meal in vegas don\'t eat here. There are much better places worth your time and money.

Small portions but just enough and delicious to pique our appetite. The sauces are a tad too sweet. The tamale was very good, with fluffy texture and not seasoned to overwhelm the maiz. The squid was cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too chewy.\n\nI had the veal chop which was recommended medium. I usually take my steak medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly at medium. It was juicy, and I loved the sauce - a little sweet like the other dishes, but the subtle horseradish really gave it a kick. The wild rice tamale was tasty, too, not too sweet.\n\nOthers in my party had the rib eye and the filet, both of which I sampled and found the sauce too sweet that it was hard to taste the meat. But my friends loved their dishes.\n\nDouble baked potatoes - delicious! Again with a hint of horseradish, it was a great combination of flavors. Brussel sprouts - way too sweet like candy and I didn't care for them. But that's my palate, and I'm sure some people like the sweet taste more than spicy.\n\nOur waiter was attentive, and our water glasses were never empty.\nBetween the 4 of us, the bill was $300 including tax & tip, with no drinks or dessert. It was a tasty meal and we enjoyed the restaurant. But some of us were still hungry after the meal -- we could do with more filler food."

S"Based on yelp reviews, I planned out my meal based on what I read that people had success with at Mesa Grill.   I didn't want to eat a very heavy meal so I had the following: a margarita on the rocks with salt, roasted corn soup, smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla, and strawberry and gooseberry shortcake for desert.  The food was excellent, and so was the service.  I would highly recommend eating here when you visit Ceasars."

The appetizer was Blue Corn Pancake with Duck. Wow, this was fabulous!  The spices were right on and the texture was perfect.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the meal wasn't as great. My entree was the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  The waiter mentioned that it came cold and I was fine with that.  But I wasn't fine with how tough the meet was.  I could barely chew it.\n\nThe dessert of the day was panna cotta.

I mean I probably would try it again but not during a busy weekend.  Not 5 Star at all.'

S"My bf and his friends decided that we come here for dinner while visiting Vegas.  I was a little reluctant to try because these celebrity-chef-inspired restaurants can be a hit or miss.  I have to say that it was a excellent choice tho!\n\nWe were running late to our reservation because our show ran a little later than we thought, and so we called to inform the restaurant we would be a little late - the lady was so nice and said that it's fine.  We get seated immediately when we arrive and are greeted very promptly with the BEST server (although I forgot her name because I went here a few months ago).  Everyone in our table ordered a beverage, but one guy decided not to, but she gave him half a glass of wine just because she didn't want him to feel left out. =]  \n\nI ordered the mahi mahi but it was ok... BUT, my bf's pork tenderloin was so good it made up for it!  Our server recommended it to be cooked medium for the best outcome, and it really was perfect!  The portions are pretty generous and definitely satisfying.  After our delicious meal, we decided to splurge and order dessert.  We were all full so we decided to share one dessert among the 4 of us. We decided that our server was pretty on-point with everything we ordered, so we decided to have her choose our dessert.  She recommended the coconut cake (which none of us really looked at) but it was the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Even my bf's friend who doesn't even like coconut devoured that.  \n\nExcellent service, excellent food, and excellent dessert!"

S'Stumbled upon this place while in Vegas, wandering aimlessly through the casino.  We thought "hmmm...Bobby Flay?  OK I guess we will check it out."  \n\nAt the time, we did consider the fact that neither my companion nor myself particularly cared for Bobby Flay, but we ignored that fact because, hey, he must be famous for a reason...his charm can get him only so far.  Perhaps the man can cook.  Plus, we were in the mood for mexican-like food.\n\nLesson learned: go with your first instinct.\n\nWe were there for brunch, and my date got a Mesa burger which was small but presented very nicely.  The flavor was just OK and the burger itself was mediocre, but the grilled onion and horseradish mustard on the burger were very tasty.  Southwestern fries were a bit firey and a little on the greasy side, but were an OK complement to an OK burger.\n\nI ordered Sophie\'s chopped salad and asked the waiter to give me a quick run-down of the veggies in it.  However, when it came, i found out that it had olives, which he failed to mention.  Because the olive-flavor was so overpowering (and i dislike olives), i had to send it back.  My date dug into his sandwich, and my replacement salad did not come until he was nearly done the meal.  Check minus on service.  \n\nI wouldn\'t be upset about the delay-time in getting my meal had this been my fault...however when you put something like olives (same goes for mushrooms or onions) in a chopped salad and the diner inquires , you should be sure to remember to list the components that have strong or polarizing flavors.  He may have just forgotten but it was not busy at that hour, so I was a bit ticked (and hungry).\n\nSide note - the bread basket had some decent items.  The blue corn cornbread muffins were really dry, the jalapeno bites were hit-or-miss on the "heat" factor depending on which you ate (perhaps some were mild and others spicy?), and the mini breakfast pastries were very good on sweetness and consistency.  Stick to those for your pre-brunch-calorie-consumption.  \n\nThe only redeeming part of the meal were the cocktails.  I had a tequila/Fresca cocktail that was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. it was delicious.  My date had a margarita which he claimed to be one of the best he\'s had...don\'t know how helpful that is, though, as he\'s generally not a margarita-guy.\n\nOverall, food was mediocre at the high points and awful at the low points, service was spotty, drinks were great.  I would say I expected more from Bobby Flay, but as I said above, he was just never really my style, so what I really expected was mediocre - and it delivered just that.  Expectations met.'

S"We went here a couple of days ago for our 11th anniversary. We had planned to go last year for our anniversary but had to cancel as my wife was found out she had to have surgery and wasn't supposed to eat red meat in the meantime. Now that she's all better, we decided to give it a try this year.\n\nI ordered a Mesa margarita, and my wife ordered a prickly pear margarita. Both were very good. I liked the taste of mine a little better, but the prickly pear was prettier. It had a pretty magenta color.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our appetizer, we were given a bread basket with three types of bread: corn bread muffin, jalapeno bread, and a nut bread. They were all very good. The corn bread was half regular corn and half blue corn which gave it an appealing appearance. My favorite was the jalapeno bread. It had a nice consistent flavoring of jalapeno without being overwhelming.\n\nFor appetizer we split the tiger shrimp tamale. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. It was like a deconstructed tamale. The shrimp was laid on top of the cornmeal. The sauce was very flavorful, and the dish was well-balanced.\n\nFor our entrees we had the pork tenderloin and the veal chop. The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and tender. The sauce wasn't quite as flavorful as I had hoped for, but it was still delicious.\n\nThe veal chop was also perfectly cooked and tender. The seasoning was spot on.\n\nBoth entrees were served with a cornmeal tamale thingy that was presented like a baked potato. It was very good and was an interesting presentation. \n\nFor our side, we split the Brussels sprouts with pomegranate seeds and pecans. It was an interesting mix of flavors and colors. I never would have thought of combining Brussels sprouts and pomegranate seeds, but it definitely worked.\n\nWe took half of our meals to go and were too stuffed to order dessert, though there were definitely some appealing selections on the dessert menu. Maybe next time.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our entree my wife asked if there was a celebrity behind her. I thought that was an odd question and asked her why she asked. We were sitting near the kitchen and she said all of the kitchen workers were looking at someone behind her. I glanced over and saw Tyra Banks sitting a few tables over. Apparently she was at Caesar's for Celine Dion's rehearsal show as we later saw her in line to get into the show.\n\nThe service was a little slow, and even though we got there before the evening rush, we had a lengthy wait between our appetizer and our main course. Because of this, I'd give Mesa 4.5 stars. As we can't pick half stars, I'm gonna round-up and pick 5 stars."

S"Best bread basket ever.  I'm not a bread person at all, and I tend to ignore the rolls that restaurants usually put out with meals, but I would go back to Mesa just for the bread.  There was an herb and asiago and a corn and chile muffin that were just incredible.  The herb and asiago was subtle but not overly so, with just the right amount of cheesiness, and the corn muffin - oh my goodness.  First of all, beautiful - the color of the chiles comes through in a red swirl that makes an appetizing contrast with the dark gold of the muffin.  Texture is spot on - soft and warm and crumbly but not dry, and when you bite into it you find whole kernels of corn tucked inside that really add a little extra.  And of course, it tastes wonderful.  The chiles really give it the perfect kick - I cannot imagine a better corn muffin.  Needless to say, but my friend and I polished off our bread basket in no time and the thoughtful waiter noticed us picking at crumbs and brought us a second.\n\nUh...so I just spent a significant fraction of my life talking about the BREAD at this place.  It was just so impressive, and I had high expectations for the rest of the meal.  Amazingly, they were not disappointed!  After devouring the second bread basket sans mercy, we ordered a ceviche sampler to start.  The sampler was very pretty, with four square plates each holding spoons topped with tiny tiny tiny little mounds of various ceviches.  Each ceviche had a different flavor to it, and they were all quite good, and we managed to share through some surgical utensil usage.  This was probably the least memorable course, if only because there just wasn't enough tasting to get acquainted, but still superb.\n\nFor our entrees I ordered the pan-seared halibut and my friend ordered the chile relleno.  I think I had the better entree, but both were fantastic.  The chile was a thing of beauty, huge and crusted in cornmeal, sitting on a little pool of colorful sauces.  I tried a few bites and it was goooood.  My halibut was heavenly.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was incredible!  The flavor was really deep and rich, almost like a zesty barbecue, and it worked magically with the mild fish.  Sweet red onions were also a nice touch.\n\nThis being our last night in Vegas, we weren't about to skip dessert, and we ordered a fresh berry tart with strawberry creme fraiche ice cream and an empanada with peach, mango, and cream cheese filling with a white peach tequila sorbet.  (Seriously, how do you see that described on the menu and not order it?)  Both were exceptional.  The tart was one of the best fruit tarts I've ever had.  It came on a gorgeous puff pastry that was perfect with the fruit and the custard filling.  The strawberry creme fraiche ice cream was light and delicious.  The empanada was like nothing else I've ever eaten, and all those components actually work together like a dream.\n\nAnd yeah, the place is pretty.  I especially appreciate the colorful decor because of how well it reflects the beautiful colors in the food.  Service is also fabulous.  Pricing - it's expensive, but not overly so.  I'd say the value is great.  And it's Vegas!  I would much rather drop $70 on a meal like this than on a few bad blackjack hands.  To wrap up a rather lengthy and worshipful review - I would go back to Mesa faster than you can say corn muffin."

S'This was my first visit to Mesa Grill Las Vegas. Always been a BIG fan of the NYC location. Everything seemed quite similar to the Manhattan version, but on a grander scale, as expected - exceptional decor, trendy crowd and solid menu. Quite overpriced (well above NYC prices), but I hear all the nice spots in Vegas are like this so that when the high rollers get comped they feel like they got a great value haha.\n\nFood maintains the highest standard, starting with the awesome jalape\xc3\xb1o bread and cornbread. I got the grouper topped with crab meat and cherry tomatoes, simply phenomenal. Chorizo/goat cheese tamale was a nice side.\n\nMy boss and a co-worker enjoyed the tuna immensely (medium rare).

S'We ate dinner at Bobby Flay\'s Mesa Grill. What a disappointment! To begin with, the walls are not complete (I don\'t mean "finished") and there are purposeful gaps which let a lot of the Casino smoke smell into the dining area. I was seated with my back against a wall and it really put a damper on my food to have the smell of smoke accompany it. The food? Plain bad. Every dish that we ordered was saturated in a strong sauce, rendering the actual "food" (duck, calamari, chicken) tasteless. The diners to the right of us were overheard voicing the same complaint. My husband Jon\'s Venison was overcooked and dry. He complained and we received a coconut layer cake free of charge for dessert. Ironically, this cake was the reason that I had booked a dinner at this restaurant in the first place, and it too was dry and disappointing. I much prefer the European way - where a restaurant IS the chef, and the chef is actually in the kitchen overseeing/cooking and being an active part. Bobby Flay owns and operates this restaurant. Sure, he probably cooks there also, from time to time. But given all that we know he does (Food Network, Cookbooks, other restaurants...) he\'s a business man, not a chef. And the food reflected that.'

S"Caveat - This review is for brunch only.  We were pleased to see that we gained some comps at Ceasar's and headed over to Mesa Grill for some free brunch.  The decor is modern and bright with primary colors decorating the bar and more subtle hues throughout the dining room.  Our waitress was prompt in every way.  She brought us the delicious bread basket, which included a piece of Mesa Grill's cinammon roll, some jalapeno biscuits, and yellow and blue cornbread muffins.  \n\nMy hubby and I ordered the same dish - the spicy scrambled eggs.  The fluffy eggs came mixed with jalapenos, goat cheese, and green onions, and were topped with apricot glazed ham.  They were served with two wonderful buttermilk biscuits.  The goat cheese and jalapenos combined for the perfect explosion of flavor without either flavor overwhelming the dish.  I am not usually a ham person, but this ham was top notch.  I think we will add Mesa Grill's brunch to our regular stops when we are in LV.  It was really that good."

S"Several years ago I went to the Mesa Grill for Lunch. It was OK, but nothing special. I went again the other day for Dinner and was blown away. We were shown to our table by the very courteous staff. Then our server came over and answered all the questions we had about the menu. We asked a lot of questions, and she had answers for all of them and never seemed in a hurry to move away from us.\n\nAs an appetizer I had the roasted corn soup. It was so wonderfully creamy and tasty that I would have been happy with two more bowls as my entree and desert. It was that good. For my main course I ordered the New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This had a nice spice rub that had a bit of heat to it. If you don't care for spicy foods you need to stay away from this one. But, if you enjoy a bit of heat then this dish will give you a taste sensation you have probably never had before. The meet was tender and cooked to perfection. The Bourbon and Ancho Chile Sauce complemented it very well and gave it more depth. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes with a Green Chile Queso sauce. This was tasty as well and complemented the pork very nicely. My wife had the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chop and loved it.\n\nFor desert my wife and I shared the Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. This was a little slice of heaven. The coconut was a nice brown and not heavily caked on the outside. It was just lightly applied. The cake to frosting ratio was nice. There were four layers of cake and the total frosting was about the same as one of the layers. It was nice and thin.\n\nWe both enjoyed ourselves very much. I know we will be going back again."

The menu prices were to be expected, after all we were @ Ceasar's Palace. The service was impecable.\n\nThe bread was fabulous, but don't fill up on it. We ordered a shrimp tamale as an appetizer. It was so good, I needed to be home to eat it. The masa was so flavorful that you would want to eat the husk. The only problem was that you get just one @ a cost of about $16., let's not forget it was GREAT!! \n\nI ordered the lobster, it was better than I ever expected. I simply melted in my mouth. I was happy to see that it was a whole lobster & not the tail weighing in @ about 1.5lbs., cooked to perfection. The sides are ordered ala cart & they are large enough to share,. \n\nMy cousin's ordered The bone-in steak & the other the salmon. They stated it was very good & I'm sure it was but I know it couldn;t be as good as my lobster.\n\nFor dessert, I had the creme brule. Anytime I see it on the menu, I feel it my duty to order. It was also great. beverages were fantastic, top shelf all the way.\n\nIf you want a 5 Star meal @ a reasonable price. This is the place"

S'I have dined at MESA in Caesar\'s Palace three times and always try to make it there every time I\'m in Vegas. \n\nReservations:\nYou definitely should try to call ahead for dinner reservations, as we are all aware that Flay\'s a genious and thus walking in to his restaurant is virtually impossible during the dinner hour, especially on a weekend. Note: a credit card is required to hold a reservation, and if you miss your time slot, they *will* charge it. \n\nAppetizers I\'ve had:\nGOAT CHEESE "QUESO FUNDIDO" - sinful and delicious. Warm goat cheese dip accompanied by a carb of sorts.\nSMOKED CHICKEN + BLACK BEAN QUESADILLA - like Taco Bell on steroids. Bursting with flavor, sets the tone for what is bound to be an incredible dining experience.\nTIGER SHRIMP+ ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE - delicious, but some entrees are served with a tamale, so make sure you don\'t overload yourself on this app/side.\n\nEntrees I\'ve had:\nNEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN - served with a sweet potatoe tamale. It was great, but with each bite of pork, I wished I was eating a steak. \nBLACK ANGUS NEW YORK STRIP STEAK - that\'s the goodness right there. It\'s nothing like a steakhouse flavor-wise; quality-wise, sure. But this is a steak prepared in a way you\'ve never experienced, totally mindblowing flavor palette. Order medium rare for the optimal texture.\n\nSides I\'ve had:\nMASHED POTATOES: a must with steak/meat dishes\nCREAMED CORN: amazing flavor, but not seeing it on their menu online. Hope they didn\'t get rid of it.\n\nDesserts I\'ve had:\nCHURROS - traditional cinnamon, warm churro served with hot chocolate dipping sauce. So authentic and fun to eat. It\'s nice to know they don\'t just slap "Chocolate Lava Cake" on the dessert list like everyone else and call it a day.\n\nService:\nIt\'s what you\'d expect from a restaurant of its calibur, but it\'s nothing super noteworthy, unfortunately - but what is in Vegas? The hostesses are Vegas snobs for the most part, sorry to say. And even if you have a reservation, you will likely find your party waiting at least 10 minutes to be sat. \n\nEnjoy!!'

Lettuce and grilled onions on the bottom of the burger ??  That caused all sorts of slippery problems.  Lol!   The mustard was actually horseradish with a teaspoon of Dijon in it. Made the eyes water....  I had much higher expectations from BF. $51.00 for 2 burgers and an appetizer and 1 Tea.  Glad we tried it out but won't be back."

S"Went with a group of friends.  We're on a celebrity chef kick and were looking forward to trying Bobby Flay's food.  Also, been wanting to trying it as I wanted to take my mom who I suspect is in love with Bobby Flay.\n\n#1, even with reservations, you cannot be seated unless your whole party is there.  We were never instructed/given the suggestion of having drinks at the bar.  Though bar was quite crowded anyway.  The result was a very number of us, maybe 20 or so, standing in the reception area.  A bit of a crowd and much jostling about as people were coming and going and waiters/waitresses were trying to pass by.\n\nWait staff seated us and gave menus promptly.  No specials mentioned and they seemed frazzled, Sunday night over Memorial Day.  Had the cactus pear margarita.  Very good.  Had asked if bartender could make a jalapeno mojito but apparently he didn't know how (don't have a fancy smartphone to google recipe?).  Bartender was kind enough to get us the recipe for the drink though.  Wait staff continued to underimpress us as a fine dining experience but were adequate if we pretended we were at Outbacks.\n\nSo the night before we watched a rerun of best things I ever ate Vegas.  Mentioned was the shrimp tamale.  Wow, it certainly was pretty mediocre.  Sauce and shrimp was cooked well but that was one dry tamale.  We ate the shrimp and left the rest of tamale.  Also had the duck tacos.  The duck was a bit overcooked but the sauce was good.\n\nOnto food, pork tenderloin was tasty, chicken was dry and husband's rib eye steak was mediocre.  I ordered the tuna steak.  I ordered it rare and it came out medium well, there was a light pink center with canned tuna tasting outer layer.  Promptly sent back.  They redid and it was OK but it was obvious the grill master did not have the grill high enough for sufficient crisping of the outer layer. We ordered some corn tamales and corn pudding.  The tamale went mostly uneaten after the first bite and the corn pudding was salty.  We were so disappointed we decided to head elsewhere for dessert.  Total bill was $450+tip for 4 people and drinks.  \n\nHaving eaten at Rick Bayless's restaurant Topo in Chicago, the difference between having the chef on site vs only their name plastered on the door is remarkable.  On a Wed, Bayless was there with a stained apron, sweating away in the kitchen.  It's been 2 years and I still remember that remarkable restaurant.  I will remember this restaurant only in terms of it's disappointments.  All hype and no substance.  May try his flagship in NYC, hopefully will be better but not much inspired to do so after this flop."

S"After hearing friends rave about this place, I had very high expectations.  I love southwest flavors, so I was really looking forward to trying out Mesa Grill for myself.  I'd also heard good things about their margaritas.\n\nThe restaurants sits right up against the casino floor in Caesar's.  The atmosphere inside was okay, but I still felt very aware that I was in a casino.  The bread was really delicious - in particular I was a big fan of the spicy southwest cornbread.  The service was also good - our water glasses didn't remain empty for long.\n\nThe margarita list was shorter than I expected.  There were only a few specialty margaritas listed.  I asked the server if they could make any spicy margaritas, and she said she'd bring out some chopped serranos that I could put in a standard margarita.  It was tasty, and I appreciated her accommodating my request, but I was a bit disappointed they couldn't do something a little fancier than giving me a side of peppers to spice up my margarita given that margaritas are supposedly one of their specialties.\n\nI started off with the black bean soup, and boyfriend had the lobster tacos.  He was a huge fan of his tacos, and I'd give my soup a thumbs-up (though I think it may be hard to really mess up black bean soup).   For our mains, he had the swordfish, and I had the scallops.  This is where we were kind of disappointed.  While the accompanying sauces were delicious (mine came with some wild mushroom grits that were awesome), the scallops and swordfish were both overcooked.  They ended up being kind of tough and rubbery.  Kind of a shame because if they had been properly cooked I think we would've had a 4 star experience.  But, given that both of our entrees were overcooked, and we didn't arrive at a busy time, I have to demote to 3 stars."

S'First off, the service was great.  Absolutely zero problems there.  But the reason I am writing this review is because the food ended up waking me up this morning, not in a good way.  I ordered the fish and it was good while in the restaurant.  I did not have any alcohol or dessert or anything else after dinner, since I have an early flight out and wanted a light dinner.  So much for my uneventful night.  It is a real disappointment, especially since I really enjoy southwest cuisine.'

S"Right off the bat, I have to warn my fellow Yelpers who might be thinking of dining here: Make reservations. Alright, on to the review. The decor of the place is vibrant and feels youthful. There was no prix fixe menu at the moment, bummer. The bread basket was nice and tasty (I think they had 3 variety of breads). Heck I even asked for 2nd batch and took it home.\n\n1. For appetizers, I ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido w/ Rajas and Ha had the Tiger Shrimp Tamale with roasted garlic cream sauce. Both appetizers were great. I love goat cheese, so using that kind of cheese for a queso fundido was great, but the rajas really added nice flavor. The Tiger Shrimp Tamale was incredible. The masa was nice and light, and the shrimp were seasoned nicely. You need to soak up as much of the sauce as possible. I know its fatty, but who counts calories these days?\n\n2. For Entrees, I ordered the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin w/ Sweet Potato Tamale and she ordered The Fire Roasted Veal Chop w/ Wild Rice Tamale. Again, both dishes were superb. My Pork tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium and the sauces that accompanied the dish were delicious, but spicy (which is good for me). That Sweet Potato Tamale aided with the bold flavors. The Veal Chop was velvety, spicy, and absolutely great. \n\n3. Sorry, we were too full and did not order desert.\n\nOverall the total was around $120, but hey its Vegas and you expect to spend that amount for a nice dinner! Worth every penny. I'm coming back here and would recommend it!"

S"After reading all the reviews and hearing nothing but good things about this place a friend and I decided to check it out and see what all the fuss was about.  Overall the food was decent but nothing really amazing, although the tamale that came with the meal was out of this world.  But to have something like a tamale be the thing that I remember the most is a bit disappointing.  While the pork tenderloin was good, it wasn't super special, or at least to me it wasn't.  Maybe because I am not a huge fan of pork in general but I expected more from it because of all the reviews about how amazing it was.  The filet was decent as well but not too memorable either.  Overall if you have the money to spend this place is worth a shot, you make enjoy it better than I did."

If you like fine food and want a twist on the Southwestern genre, don't miss Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.\n\nIf I could give 4.5 stars I would only because I think it's a bit on the expensive side but that's because Flay's gotta maintain his status and really I can't blame him since the food is a cut above the rest."

S"Mesa Grill is a Bobby Flay owned restaurant- cool! The restaurant seems big, but I didn't get a good look around. We sat in a corner booth, which allowed for privacy. \n\nThe waitress brought out a breadbasket, which had a variety of bread. We also got two free appetizers, because they sent it to the wrong table. Luck was on our side.\n\nI went with the signature dish for my entree- New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. I never had pork that tasted so good! It was melt in your mouth tender. I also loved the little bit of kick it had to it and the sauces. The dish also came with sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. Both spicy and sweet represented on the plate. I liked the tamale but it wasn't on the same level as the pork. \n\nI left with a full stomach and a great impression of Bobby Flay. In the future, I'll seek out his other restaurants."

S"I chose Mesa Grill after hearing Delmonico's is way overrated. Having eaten at the Bahamas location, and despite my aversion to Bobby Flay, I decided to give the Las Vegas MG a try.\n\n1. Awkward seating arrangement: We had a table of six, and it seemed like they had to put a table in the middle of a seating arrangement in order to fit us. We would've been perfectly fine if the wait staff wasn't continually bumping into my friends' chairs and then asking them to move out the way. That was uncool.\n\n2. Food was great. Everyone was really happy with their dishes. Amongst the six of us, we ordered the duck, ribeye and pork tenderloins. For sides, pesto mashed potatoes, baby carrots, tiger shrimp tamale and sauteed spinach. We had to wait a bit for a couple of the sides because the waitress forgot them, but it wasn't too bad. Food came out hot and tasty.\n\n3. Desserts were okay. I enjoyed my spicy chocolate creme brulee in the Bahamas more than the profiteroles I had. I thought they were really stingy with the iced cream which put me off a bit.\n\n4. Service was alright. Our waitress was chatty and came around a few times to check on us.\n\nMesa Grill Las Vegas didn't disappoint and I wouldn't be against visiting BF's other restaurants."

S'I know it may be hard to combine 5 star and southwest cuisine, but Mesa Grill has it all. Upscale decor, good staff, great ambiance, and a taste to die for (if you like gourmet flavorful southwestern foods). Had the wild mushroom appetizer - great. If you like grits the blue corn grits is to die for. We had the halibut - great; the wild and farm raised salmon - just as great; 16 spiceed chicken - great; and a fall back of steak with green and red pepper sauce - great; and the pork tenderloin - also great. The red and green southwest peppers sauces were fantastic. Las Vegas can buy anything and they spent their money wisely to bring Bobby Flay to Caesers.'

S"I went here a few years ago with my mom, and while it was nothing to write home about I will say it is at least 3-and-a-half star worthy.  I know for sure both of us had the filet with the coffee rub, and I remember thinking it was good but I wish it wasn't coffee.  Don't get me wrong, it was good quality cow, and it was cooked well, I just personally thought the flavor combo was a little strange (but I'm not a coffee drinker either).  And unfortunately mom won't try anything even resembling seafood and I'm not into mexican/tex-mex/southwestern much, so that doesn't help.  Other than that, I like the overall layout of the restaurant, though it was MUCH smaller than I thought it would be.  It was a good thing we opted for an early dinner that night, because they had a line all the way out the slot machines by the time we left.  I liked how you could see the action of the kitchen, but we weren't close enough for me to get a detailed view.  And it was a pleasant place to dine with good service.  So I'd go back and give it another shot, maybe try some of the grilled seafood or yummy sounding appetizers"

S'As I write this, I can hardly move.  I blame Bobby Flay.  Last night we dined at Mesa Grill and the food was amazing.  \n\nI\'d planned for this meal all day - akin to preparing for the civilized version of Nathan\'s hotdog eating contest.  A small breakfast of oatmeal, half a sandwich for lunch, plenty of water.  (Yeah, this is probably how I should eat every day...but we\'ll avoid that topic for now).  \n\nI\'ve had lunch at Mesa Grill before, and that meal had me excited for the dinner.  Back then I had the Southwestern Spice Chicken Skewers.  Think of it as a build your own taco.  The chicken is traditionally grilled on wood skewers (hence the name).  You build it yourself with "special lettuce" (a blend of mint, butter lettuce, and cilantro.  Genius.) and a New Mexico Chile Sauce that tastes more like a mole sauce that a chile sauce.  I love good food, especially good Mexican (excuse me, Southwestern Cuisine), and I was clearly really looking forward to another opportunity to dine at Mesa Grill.  \n\nNo surprise to anyone who knows me, I arrived on time for dinner.  My guests did not.  But the staff was pleasant and courteous none the less, even though they had to refer several people to the "first come, first served" bar area as they were booked for the evening.\n\nWhen my guests finally arrived (OK, they were only 15 minutes late.  \'Traffic"), we started with mojitos (five stars), and the self explanatory Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale (a little dry, but tasty none the less).\n\nFor dinner we had:\n\nCornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno with eggplant, manchego cheese, and sweet red pepper sauce.  I love the presentation on this dish.\n\nNew Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with bourbon - ancho chile sauce, sweet potato tamale, and crushed pecan butter.  It was really spicy.  I mean REALLY spicy.  I had this medium - pink in the center, delicious.  And the tamale (yeah, another one.  let\'s not count the calories) had chunks of pecan in the pecan butter.  Happiness.\n\nFinally the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops with blackberry - cascabel barbecue sauce (brilliant!), and collard greens with smoked chiles.  It didn\'t disappoint. \n\nThe meal took us an hour and a half.  It felt like 15 minutes.  It was a great experience and time literally flew by (mainly because there are no clocks in the casinos).  If you\'re planning on seeing a show after dinner, give yourself an extra hour or so.  You\'ll probably need it. \n\nThe meal was a bit pricey ($200+ for three), but well worth it.  I\'ve noticed that the lunch menu had many of the same items as the dinner menu - just smaller portions and priced accordingly.'

S'Overall: Hit or miss, but the hits are fantabulamazing!\nVisits: one, lunch\n\nBreads - They give you a basket with a couple different types of bread. Nice! Something for everyone. The best of the bunch was the jalapeno cheese bread. LOVED it. Cornbread really was very crumbly, and it was also slightly salty, which was odd. I like my cornbread sweet, thanks.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake - Eh. Thought the sauce was a little weird....\n\nTiger Prawn Tamale - Oh man was that delicious. And the corn was so yummy, but it\'s really filling so be careful with that one as an appetizer.\n\nSophie\'s salad - Great! I love fruity dressings and cheese.\n\nCrab pancakes - You certainly do get a lot of crab, but I wasn\'t wowed by it. Very filling.\n\nPork tenderloin - I don\'t know if it was supposed to be cold, but I don\'t like my meat cold unless it is sandwich "meat". Had an interesting flavor, but eh.\n\nCuban burger - SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD. I don\'t even like mustard (I told the waiter no dijon, and he said that was the one thing they couldn\'t take out...) but man was that burger good. I didn\'t even really taste the dijon.\n\nSpicy chicken and sweet potato hash - Okay, so I don\'t know if it\'s just me, but when I see "hash" I think like hash browns or maybe some sort of sweet potato fries... What we got was more like "mash," and it was actually mixed in with the chicken.  Kind of gross in my opinion.  Really sweet, not spicy at all.\n\nCoconut layer cake - TO DIE FOR. So moist and delicious. And you get a gigantic slice. Enough for two or more people depending on how full you are.\n\nChocolate creme brulee with blueberry compote - OMNOMNOMNOM.  The chocolate at the bottom of the creme brulee really makes it even better.'

Of course, the traffic was horrible, so I called back and asked if we could change our reservation.  They informed me that since I didn\'t secure our reservation with a credit card that we, in fact, didn\'t have one.  The person I spoke with on the phone was not helpful and very rude. She proceeded to argue with me about whether or not I had a reservation till finally I asked if I could just, please, make one.  I made the new reservation for 6:30 and she let me off the phone without a credit card.  Then when we arrived at the restaurant the Hostess, rudely, told me that we didn\'t have a reservation, she was adamant about this, till I pointed at my name, written down on her sheet next to "6:30".\n\nI had a beer (corona or tecate?), the Lobster Tacos (appetizer), and the sesame crusted ahi.  It was alright.  The portions were very small.  My daughter had a cheese quesadilla and milk.

Three adults for dinner and the tab was $220 (w/o tip).  The food was not special enough for me to go back at that price.

Nicely toasted and the beef came out that perfect pink. \n\nDoes it really set itself far ahead of other burger places... eh well no it is a burger so I guess I should have expected that. I planned to try other items however, looking around it seemed as though everyone within our vicinity was having the burger. I've had this happen way too many times where I stray away from what other people are getting to try something new, but it always happens that I try their dish and wish I hadn't. \n\nAnyhow, I would come back if it was convenient. I would not go out of my way to try the burger, maybe other items on the menu?

This time, I ordered the following - duck crepe (SOOOO good!), shrimp tamale (very flavorful and fresh), salmon (mediocre, at best... and our waiter even told us not to order it... but my friend didn't listen), and halibut (tender, flaky, not fishy at all... and so flavorful!).  The halibut and appetizers were my favorites and I would definitely go and order those again.  We also ordered 3 desserts, which were totally worth it!

I have never tasted anything like it or even heard or anything like it. I was pleasantly surprised by its taste, which was a little sweet with the tamale and savory because of the taste of the shrimp. Perfect flavor and unique combination. \n\nOrdered the lamb porterhouse chops. The flavor of the lamb was also a little sweet but over all delicious. This is where I had to take a star off though - the lamb was over cooked. I had asked for medium and received medium well. I didn't complain because the seasoning was delicious, but I would hope that a place that capitalizes on grilling would grill meat how they said they would. We spoke with the waitress afterward and she said that some of the cooks in the back were getting orders that were either overcooked or undercooked. I don't care how amazing the flavors are...that isn't cool. \n\nThe service here was exceptional, I came here with a large group and there were no mix ups with our orders and they knew exactly what they were doing. Friendly staff who were willing to listen to us and really cared if we liked the food. One person in our party had a steak that was very overcooked and before he mentioned anything the waitress saw his disappointment and had a new dish made up for him. My dish wasn't bad enough to send back and I was starving by that time so not too much complaining about my lamb."

The chef prepared three bites for us which included a surf and turf and a tartar. Wish it would've been more than a bite each!\nI ordered their classic Margarita, which is made so so well. They have a ton of different Margaritas on their menu, but I always get the classic as it is always good.\nOur appetizers were lobster tacos and another Mesa favorite, the duck pancake. The lobster tacos were a bit spicy, so I got to eat them all as the Boy doesn't do super spicy foods. The duck pancake was exquisite as always. \nFor entrees, the Boy ordered scallops, which I had more than one bite of. I don't like scallops, but these were good. I ordered the rabbit which came with a bone in leg and some additional meat. So so yummy. I don't like bone in food, but I made an exception.\nFor dessert we ordered the coconut cake to go (which didn't last into the morning). We ordered it last year so we knew it was good. It is very moist and the icing is not super sweet, but it is such a great compliment to the cake. We also ordered the banana pie for dining in which was splendid. Lots of bananas and great flavor. \nI cannot wait to go back and I am always looking for excuses to go back to Vegas."

S"3.5 stars\n\n There are some really great things happening at this restaurant and I recommend it to those who want a unique culinary experience with a slightly inflated price. The food is lovely, but I think you can find better food for the cost.\n\n Some large positives are that the depth of flavor is great, unexpected and enjoyable ( I had queso fundido and a pink and green peppercorn crusted filet). Also, I couldn't decide what to order for a cocktail and the waitress promptly told me that their bartender was experimenting with some new drinks and that she would be happy to surprise me.  The two that I had were excellent, some of the best cocktails I have had in Vegas (one tasted like a green tea lemon drop and the other a martini with tasty but unidentifiable herbs).\n\n  The things I find lacking are: 1) Portion size. I can handle small portions if the food is exquisitely rich and exotic, but its fancy Mexican food, so small wasn't cuttin' it; 2) The restaurant seemed ridiculously small, which made the seating a little crowded and reservations extremely difficult; 3) If you are a Food Network star then you should be wowing me with your amazing cuisine- I am under-wowed.\n\n All in all, a great place to try and definitely get a cocktail, but don't expect your mind to be blown."

S'I am not a guy who likes trendy restaurants. So, I was apprehensive when our group of 6 selected Mesa Grill for a celebration dinner. Let me just say that everything was as it should be.\n\nReservations: on time\nService: The best\nStarters: The shrimp tamales are incredible\nMain Dish: Fillets, Pork Tenderloin, Tuna were all excellent\nPrice: Reasonable\n\nI know this is a Tex Mex restaurant and the food is spiced. My comment to our group was that my fillet was such a great cut of meat and so perfectly grilled that next time I would request no spice rub on it. It would have been perfect on its own.'

S'Move out of the way Gordon Ramsey,  Bobby Flay is now in the palace.\n I was in love with the decor of the place and the atmosphere of when I stepped into this place.\n\nSpicy chicken with sweet potato hash: it was so good and the spicy level was on point. There were two big about one cup size of sweet potato hash with poached eggs on top. The entree presentation was amazing and I feel all presentation really brings out my appetite. I highly recommend this dish. \n\nPulled pork sandwich: The sandwich was made perfectly and had just the right amount of crunch from the bread. This meal came with seasoned fries and it was quite delicious \n\nSalmon Entree: The piece of salmon was just simply amazing. It had the right amount of sauce and seasoning that the fish just melts in your mouth. I chose to have it well done and it was just the perfect salmon. \n\nAlso, for starters they provided free bread and it was not just cheap white bread. It was home made muffins, mini corn muffins, and different type of bread. This place really does set a high standard because food presentation and quality. \n\nI was fortunate to try this place for free but with the prices it is a pricy place to eat. For vegas, I think its definitely a place to try especially since it from one of the chefs I enjoy watching on the food channel.'

S"Dined at Mesa Grill before Christmas.  The server was helpful and provided good suggestions on dishes.  We ordered the following items:\n\n1. Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale (4 Stars)\nGood flavor and nice texture.  Just simply delicious.  \n\n2. Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon (3 Stars)\nNicely cooked medium rare.  Didn't quite get the coffee taste.  The rubbed crust didn't do much for the dish in my opinion\n\n3. Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin (4 Stars)\nThe dish was nicely cooked with big flavors.  The spiciness wasn't overpowering, and you can taste the layering of flavors.  The sweet potato tamale was wonderful.  This is the signature dish that everyone should try at Mesa Grill.\n\n4. Churros (2 Stars)\nThe chocolate dip provided good flavor, but the churros were fried for a little too long.  The center became too dry.  I still think Rick Bayless' XOCO in Chicago has the best churros."

I loved their roasted corn soup, smoked chicken & black bean quesadilla, and the dish that has rabbit meat in it ( I forgot what it called).  I think that the ancho chile -honey glazed salmon was just average.   So, if you have a chance to dine there, don't order the salmon dish.  \n\nOverall, the ambiance is nice, the price is on a higher side, and the waiter is helpful and attentive."

S'My buddy and I were looking for lunch and chose MESA over Gordon Ramsey Burger. We were not disappointed. The service was great. All servers answered all of our questions and catered to our requests (IE. sauce on the side) with a smile. Both the agave margarita and the ice tea were great. Being from Texas I expected a bigger margarita, but it was very good. The ICED TEA IS VERY GOOD TEXANS.\n     Free bread basket 2 different breads and a blue corn muffin. That was an unexpected bonus.\n     For entrees we ordered a green chile cheeseburger and a regular burger, both with fries. Perfect medium, great buns, well seasoned, juicy. These burgers were big enough that no dessert was needed.\n     If you are looking to try out an "iron chef\'s" restaurant, at a good price, YOU CANT GO WRONG HERE @ LUNCH.'

S'I had the most random experience here, but I really liked it.  The decor is really bright, colorful, and fun but in a sophisticated way.  The bottle of wine my boyfriend and I shared was moderately priced and delicious.  The goat cheese fundido was large and yummy, and was a nice change from the usual "queso" you can get at TexMex restaurants.  And the halibut we shared was large and spicy with really great, complex flavors.  The chopped salad was meh- small with typical ingredients and flavors.  I wouldn\'t get this here, get something more exotic.  The ceviche trio looked amazing, fyi.  Overall, the meal was a great success and I would go back in a heartbeat.\n\nThe odd thing were the tables around us, which prevented us from getting really good service.  The table to our right waited thirty minutes for their appetizer to be delivered, were angry, and were comped on the dish.  The table to our left were hicks (seriously) and were demanding, loud and obnoxious.  The worst part is that they were convinced they had *JIZZ* on their beer glass and were making a big scene about it.  The manager tried to explain to them that the lime on the side of the glass was dripping down and created the liquid on the glass, to which the wife said, "no thats not lime, I\'m a mother" (wtf?) and the husband yelled, "if you think it\'s lime, then lick it!"  They were given a new beer, and the husband once again complained there was jizz on the glass.  And yes, I mean jizz.  So retarded.  I thought our server (who was their server as well) handled the situation very calmly and rationally, but it was very distracting (and funny, I\'ll admit, I was laughing my a** off listening to them).\n\nWith all the drama, we saw our waiter very rarely, hence the one star reduction (along with the unmemorable chopped salad).  However, in any other circumstance I\'m sure he would have been better.  And the busboys made up for our server, as they refilled my flipping camel of a boyfriend\'s glass at least twelve times.  \n\nThat couple to our left though... man, I thought LA had all the crazy people.'

He was extremely attentive and suggested Margaritas which we both found to be on the tart side.  We had him sweeten them with Agave.\n\nFor a Tuesday night the place was packed for dinner despite the poor reviews.\n\nI ordered the Pork tenderlon which was a little dry.  It came with a sauce that was tasty.  My girlfriend ordered the Ribeye which was HUGE.  I was extremely impressed by how much of dent she made in it.  It seemed to be cooked to order.  As per Joel's suggestion we ordered the corn as a side dish.  It was super tasty.  The highlight of the meal for me.\n\nAll in all it was one of the better meals that we had in Vegas but I would search a few other places for the overall experience."

S'Celeb-chef Bobby Flay\'s Mesa Grill lives up to the hype! \n\nParking: Located in Caesar\'s Palace, if you have trouble finding parking you need to be slapped! \n\nAtmosphere: Dressy and very contemporary. An open floor means you will be seen, or for a show, check out the open-kitchen, a sight to see if you enjoy watching the intricacies of a gourmet kitchen! \n\nService: Prompt, courteous, knowledgeable, and very attentive. \n\nFood: First course: Goat cheese "Queso Fundido", this gourmet spin on the classic nacho cheese dip was an excellent starter to the Southwest-themed main course. Excellent flavor and spice and just the right amount of tang from the goat cheese. For the main course I selected the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, these medallions were cooked medium rare and had a melt in your mouth taste that are too numerous for words. The sauce added just the right amount of heat, for a side I selected the roasted corn that had all the right combination of sweet, spicy, and a creamy texture that was good to the last bite and worth the visit alone!'

I got their house margarita. It was the best margarita I have ever had! The tequila was amazing, and the tequila mixer was fresh and not too sweet.\n\nFor my entree I had the pork tenderloin, which was fantastic. I usually don't order pork tenderloin because it is too dry and tasteless. This one was actually tender and juicy! The sauce was not too overpowering and blended great with the rest of the dish. \n\nThis was worth every penny.

S"After witnessing one of the top musical acts of all time, we walked into Bobby Flay's upscale, modern Mexican restaurant, Mesa Grill. While we were ravenous, it was also quite late for dinner so we hesitatingly opted for a few small plates to share. Being the mad foodie that I am, I had already studied the menu and knew that the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos were an absolute must. We also chose the Crispy Squash Blossoms and the Smoked Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla.\n\nStuffed with ricotta, corn, and basil, the fried squash blossoms were also sitting in a pool of sweet pepper sauce. My goodness, these unique fried treats were righteous as ever. After devouring a blossom, I snatched one of the most miniature tacos I've ever seen. The Blue Corn Lobster Tacos were insanely luscious. Filled with delicate lobster, pickled onions, avocado, and topped with a fennel and habanero relish, I was licking my chops with every bite. Let's just say if I was into cursing on my blog, there'd be a few choice words written in all-caps to describe my love for these tacos. I'm just sad I didn't catch a good photo of the beauties. \n\nFor the rest of my review, visit: http://dashofles.com/blog/west-coast-road-trip/"

S'Gorgeous place of course. Very modern, bright and open, it\'s Caesar\'s Palace and they really wanted Bobby Flay; as tasteful and modern as Southwestern can git.\n\nWe went for lunch late on a Wed afternoon during a conference break and it was surprisingly slow there at 1:45. Breadbasket is delicious of course with those Jalapeno corn muffins, beautiful works of art at half yellow and blue corn swirl. We started by splitting the Blue Corn pancake BBQ Duck which was smoky with low heat and just yummy.\nFor our entrees we had a Lamb chopped salad and a Chili Releno that looked even better than it tasted, and it tasted fantastic. They manage to get a very light batter on the chili and then somehow seal it with the cheese inside so that it \'blows up", really impressive. The lamb was a perfect medium rare and the salad good sized for what are generally small portions here. Presentation all Bobby Flay.\n\nService from Michael was attentive, even relaxed considering there wasn\'t a dozen people in the restaurant, so come late our usual plan. They are definitely pushing drinks like most Vegas restaurants and you can see the disappointment in their faces when we order our usual lunch time iced tea and a water with lemon, no ice.\n\nHighly recommended and not crazy pricey, but still a $75 lunch with one appetizer and two entrees and one ice tea. Do it.'

S'The only reason this place gets business is because it is a Bobby Flay restaurant.  I was not impressed with the food at all.  \n\nI had a prickly cactus margarita (it was a delicious reddish pink color and was amazing) and Hubs tried a mezcal (which is like tequila but isn\'t).  For starters, we went with the server\'s recommendation. She said it is the most "popular" appetizer - Tiger Shrimp with Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale and cilantro sauce.  This was SMALL.  There were four medium sized (I think they were smaller than they should have been) shrimp with a tamale on the side. It really looked like the tamale was the main part of the dish and the shrimp were the side garnish.  There was nothing special about the shrimp. They looked like four cooked and peeled shrimp. I was pretty disappointed.\n\nFor the mains, Hubs had the rabbit  - Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbit with toasted chile cous cous, almonds, currants in a smoked red pepper sauce and I had the Halibut with green chile curry sauce and corn and cactus salsa. Originally, this was supposed to be Wild Stripe Bass, but there were some weather issues back East so they didn\'t get their fish shipment in that day.\n\nMy halibut was good. Nice crunch on the top of the fish and the green chile curry sauce was mild.  I liked it. It was a huge portion of fish.  Hubs\' rabbit was just ok - most people don\'t like the gamey flavor of rabbit, but that is what the rabbit lacked. It tasted more like chicken than rabbit.  \n\nFor dessert, we had the banana cream pie.  It was pretty light and a good way to end the meal.\n\nThe service was ok. At first, the server was very attentive and quick but after we got our appetizers, she was quite slow. Having experience in the food industry, I did notice that her section filled up quickly and she had small tables like us but also parties of 6 or more. She was friendly enough though.\n\nI believe there are better Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  Mesa Grill is known for grilling so maybe the steaks are better?'

It was cooked to perfection and had a really nice pepper rub that must have left a crust an inch thick.  If you're not into peppery crusts, then you might find the cow at this place not to your liking.  Anyway, the steak was great, the desserts were yummy, the side dishes were  average (as all sides seem to be in Vegas), the ambiance was not bad, and I can't remember what I had to drink during the meal.  As for the service, we had to wait a bit past our reserved time but the waitstaff performed in a prompt and satisfactory manner.  (That sounds kinda dirty, doesn't it?)

(The waiter offered me something to drink, but I'm not yet 21...meep). The best appetizer is easily the queso fundido, although the wild mushroom quesadillas and the pumpkin soup (I'm not sure if it's a seasonal addition or not) are amazing as well.\n\n I always get the chile relleno, because it's the only vegetarian main dish. However, it's soooo good that I don't care that I don't have any other option. It's filled with manchego cheese and eggplant, which is awesome because I absolutely love manchego cheese, but I kind of liked the dish better when it was filled with goat cheese and zucchini. Oh yeah, and I've heard great things about the steak.\n\nDesserts are good, as well, however not nearly as good as the main courses and appetizers. The last time I was here, I had the apple cider cake. The vanilla creme fraiche ice cream it came with was very good, but sadly, the cake was a little on the dry side. \n\nI also love that there's a cookbook with all the recipes for this restaurant.

S'One Star for the service....We didn\'t dine here.... Read on: \n\nWe decided to go to Bobby Flay\'s Mesa Grill to celebrate my wife\'s birthday. I\'ve dined and lunched there many times with excellent experiences with both dining and service....except this time. \n\nUsing the contact number on the MG website, I called to make reservations for a Wednesday dinner. Once connected, the operator connects me to the restaurant and I request to make reservations for two at 630pm for the following evening. I am now directed to another operator (not Mesa Grill\'s maybe hotel?) starts with the "interview": Are you a hotel guest, do you have a Rewards card, blah, blah, blah. Then the operator asks for my address and Credit Card number!!!! I was informed that I would be charged $50 if I was late or absent for my reservation. When I asked "what is late?", the operator\'s response was," if you do not show up at 6pm and they give away your table- one minute or 20 minutes late." Are you f*cking kidding me? Before I had to submit my W2 form and personal references, I declined to continue with the reservation process. \n\nAgain, I\'ve dined here so many times and enjoyed every visit but this was enough. Mesa Grill is awesome for the food, but this "leave a deposit for your reservation" is ridiculous. We dined at another celebrity chef\'s restaurant without the hassle. Thanks, Bobby, Caesar\'s LV, and/or Harrah\'s Entertainment for screwing up the initial contact process for your Diners.'

Not worth the price -- Todd English's Olives is SSOOOO much better. Save your money and go there for a nice night."

S"I came here for lunch and ordered a very satisfying burger.  It was fresh, juicy and absolutely tasty.  BUT the blue duck pancake appetizer was a total bust.  It was covered in a sweet sauce (similiar to the one on asian salads) that overwhelmed the entire dish.  YUCK!  My friend ordered the salmon and it was not spectacular nor despicable...just ok. \nWe didn't have to wait long for a seat since it was a slow Monday afternoon. The service was professionaly great.  The bright colored southern modern decor was very Bobby Flay and it was priced like Bobbly Flay too (meaning it was expensive). \nI would come back here for burger and nothing else...and get it to go too."

S"This place never disappoints.  We started with fried squash blossoms that included red and yellow pepper sauces.  I had a cioppino with green chile sauce.  Wow, that was an amazing dish.  I usually shy away from cioppino because I'm not that big on tomato broth.  Green chile sauce makes it more than worthwhile.  My wife had a grilled chicken that had mango salsa and 12 spices (that's one more than you get at KFC).  Dessert was another great creation.  We split an order of the churros that came with a chocolate sauce that was flavored with star anise.  The waiter recommended it.  It often pays to listen to what dishes they recommend.\n\nAnother standout dish I had on a past visit was the pork tenderloin.  Absolutely amazing chile sauces with that one, also.  The strawberry shortcake that time was good, but not nearly as good as the churros.\n\nAlso, I have to give kudos to the service.  The staff was more than friendly throughout the evening.\n\nThis restaurant is a must, whether in Vegas or New York (though Vegas is much easier to get into than NYC)."

S"We came here for dinner and were looking for something light to eat since we'd be meeting up with other friends later.  So we ordered two appetizers (the shrimp with garlic tamale and the rough cut tuna nacho), an entree (chile relleno), and a dessert (the banana creme pie).  These along with the bread basket was more than enough food for the three of us.  \nI can't tell you which was was my favorite, b/c really they were all good.  The garlic corn tamale hit just the right notes of sweet and savory and paired really well with the shrimp.  Def a must order.  I think I like the tuna more though, b/c generally I like my seafood raw.  My husband loved the chile relleno, and said that it was the best he's ever had.  He's eaten a ton of this stuff, so that's saying a lot.  The dessert was a good finisher...it was more like a deconstructed banana cream pie.  i thought that the candied hazelnut at the bottom really added to the dish.  \nI will be returning for brunch, since this is what Flay is really known for.  Can't wait."

S"Yum Mesa Grill is a really upscale restaurant located at the Caesar's Palace in LV. I ordered their Venisen off the regular menu, medium rare and it was super, super delicious!  Now i never tried venisen before and was told the meat was simliar to lamb and it was quite a good description.  My dish came out on 2 chops, kinda stingy but it was filling to say the least.  The order comes with a mini corn cake on the side, VERY VERY small, a dark brown sauce that is pretty good...a little bit sweat and tangy , but basically the dish is served a la carte.  I would recommend ordering a side of something... my friends got mashed potatoes, some got fries, and another ordered a blue-corn pancake thing that was $14 and not very good..haha.  I had an opportunity to try their NY-Steak $40 on their menu and it was probably the best tasting meats I've ever had.  It was really full of flavor and not blood or running in any way.  I'm sure they let it sit out after cooking to hold in the juices or it was frozen before grilling.  The meat was pretty rare even though it was supposed to be cooked medium.  \n\nOverall this place is good, very good, but very expensive.  Be prepared to shell around at least $50 per person.  Like the other reviews, this place is GREAT to bring your girl friend, wife, husband, parents, in-laws....very impressive."

The location is also great for the boys when theres a big game -- grab a good seat in the middle of the main glass dining area and they can view and cheer along to all the TV's in the surrounding Caesars Sports Book.\n\nMenu is a bit small/limited and mimosas add up at a pricey $12 a flute, but their tiger shrimp tamale and spicy chicken sweet potato hash has me looking forward to coming back to give their full dinner menu a try. Bobby Flay's flavors are spot-on and worth a visit/return; plus the complimentary varietal bread basket is also a lovely touch."

S"When I heard Bobby Flay owned this joint, I knew I had to try.... i watch Iron Chef religiously and I believe it caused my expectations to be alittle too high. \n\nBread basket: (yes, I consider this a course) disappointing. I like my bread warm and fresh from the oven. These offerings were too cold to enjoy. \n\nAppetizers: got the romaine salad, gala apple salad, and the tiger shrimp tamale. I could have skipped all these dishes and saved more room for dessert. The tamale was good, but the flavors didn't have me singing to the high heavens... And the salads left much to be desired. The romaine salad lacked dressing and the croutons were way too soggy. The apple salad was mostly just chopped apple so it got too filling. \n\nMain course: definitely get the lamb chops or the glazed salmon. Both were perfectly cooked and I licked my plates clean. Delish!! However, skip the collard greens. They weren't worth the stomach room. But the table next to ours were raving about the Brussels sprouts, so I wish I gave those a try. \n\nDessert: you can not leave the Mesa Grill without trying the Sticky Toffee Pudding. When i took my first bite the clouds parted, angels were singing, and all the stars aligned. This dessert will go down in the books! Yum, yum! \n\nBottom line: it was a good date night. More misses than hits for me. Will I return? Maybe if I'm craving some sticky toffee pudding."

S'I have to say that when someone gets a little "too much" fame like Bobby Flay, I\'m extra critical when it comes to anything associated with them.  I know it\'s not fair, but when there\'s a lot of hype, there\'s also a lot of hope that there\'s an amazing experience to back it all up!\n\nI went into Mesa Grill with ridiculously high expectations (hello Iron Chef!) and WOW.. I didn\'t think they could be exceeded, but the food was a total oralgasm.  The skilled craftsmanship of bold flavors balanced against subtle undertones and lingering aftertastes is absolutely incomparable to anything else I\'ve ever experienced in food.  Damn this man knows how to make an amazing flavor combination!!\n\nNeedless to say- the food was absolutely amazing.  The service was even quite impeccable on the day that we went.  The food, while crafty and artistic, was highly understandable and accessible since it played off of American classics.\n\nLast but not least, the decor was crafted just as carefully as the food, blending natural woods and metals into a textural and visual gestalt of sensory pleasure.  I make it a point to visit this restaurant almost every time I\'m in Vegas... I can never get enough and I dream about the next time I get to enjoy it again!'

S"Very good.  \n\nCame here because I love the grill, the Southwest, AND Bobby Flay, although I'd never been to one of his restaurants and I'm a little skeptical of whether celebrity chefs' places can live up to what they do in person.\n\nIn any case, we missed lunch on Friday, so came here Saturday.  I was a little bummer that they were only serving brunch (I'm not a breakfast person at ALL, save for my love for bacon).  I got the burger, which was very go and the meat quality was high.  But my girl got the chicken with sweet potato hash and poached eggs.  This was really different, delicious, and had a nice kick.  Flavors were bangin'.  Also the iced tea was good.\n\nOverall I felt like I as paying for Flay's name, which is a little silly.  I mean, $60 for brunch is a little outrageous, but it was good.  WOuld I go back?  Eh, not before going elsewhere, but the food WAS good and the whole things was enjoyable."

S"Date: June 2007\nWho: 1 adult\nBill: ~$85\n\nI realized that I was subconsciously avoiding all Bobby Flay restaurants up till now. Dunno why, maybe the whole looking like a dork in the first Iron Chef deal vs. Morimoto thing but I had no desire to eat at his joints.\n\nThe wife suggested I try during my last trip it so I gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I went in without any expectations and came out a happy camper.\n\nEverything here as flavor. Big flavor. The caesar salad has sausage bits, the creamed cauliflower is loaded with tasty, creamy, delicious cheese, and the ribeye is served with a nice spicy sauce. The duck pancake was surprisingly good. A bit heavy on the bbq sauce but the habinero gave it a nice kick. \n\nThe ribeye was also perfectly cooked. I get annoyed these days because everyone always seems to overcook my beef but they did it just right. That being said, I don't necessarily think the cut of meat or preparation was all that great. Did that make sense? They cooked it great, the sauce was great, but it didn't seem like they started with something all that great or aged it at all so the meat wasn't as tender as I would have expected. It was really good but I've had better.\n\nI enjoyed everything and would probably take the wife here if she ever stepped foot in this land of debauchery. I thought the price was in line with other restaurants in the same class."

S'Popular spot for good reason. I have now eaten there twice over a 3 year span once for lunch, once for dinner. Both times I was impressed with the flavors. Not too much, but definitely different. Bobby Flay is an iron chef for a good reason. I feel he could make any dish great (as witnessed on Throwdown program) so whenever the menu veers off course, I recommend trying that dish. For me it was the sweet potato hash with poached eggs and green tomatillo salsa. I thought the tamales were the best app, but I also tried the shrimp, queso, and duck. My brothers split a steak sandwich and burger and seemed to like the steak but love the burger. Everything tasted good at Mesa grill.'

The food was good and everything was great but it just wasn\'t what I thought it could of been. \n\nThe food itself was pretty normal nothing really "in your face" or "has haves". The sauce in itself was just to die for but than Bobby is a master saucer.\n\nThe pricing was normal not too bad for vegas.\n\nService was nice and friendly but could be a little more personal.\n\nnote: mean reason I put 4 star is b/c of Booby.

The server was very friendly and attentive, so I have no complaints about that.  \n\nWe ordered a few appetizers to start:\n\n1. Goat Cheese Queso fundido: Delicious!! \n2. Wild Mushroom Quesadilla: easily  my favorite appetizer of the night.\n3. Spicy Tuna & Salmon Tartares: This was somewhat bland.  I really expected more flavor from a Bobby Flay recipe.\n4. Corn soup: my friend ordered this and it was FABULOUS.  It tasted like fresh, sweet corn, with a little kick.  Loved it.\n\nHere's where things got a little shaky.  Entrees:\n\n1. Coffee rubbed filet mignon:  This was so boring.  I can't believe I'm saying this because I LOVE steak.  But it was not at all what I expected.  I should have gone with something more inventive and left the steak for a good steakhouse.\n\n2. Mango & Spice Crusted Tuna: My sister had this and it was extremely bland.  Again, I was surprised because I expected everything here to have good flavor.  \n\n3. Black Angus New York Strip Steak: 2 in our party ordered this.  It was a GREAT STEAK.\n\nTo sum it up, I may have ordered the wrong entree, but I will come back and stick to appetizers and drinks."

S'First time back to Vegas in a couple of years. Before seeing "O" on Friday night (which was awesome), we decided to do Mesa Grill (mostly because we love Bobby Flay). We were so pleased with our meal!\n\nThe roasted corn side dish was our favorite part of the entire meal! Maybe my favorite side dish ever. Not sure why I love it so much, but I wolfed it down! The pork tenderloin main dish was also tremendous. \n\nWe also tried the house Cabernet and were fairly please. \n\nOverall, a tremendous meal with good service at reasonable prices.

We had started out with calamari and a salad which i thought was average and for my entree, i ordered the grilled mahi mahi and I was disappointed. Being Bobby Flay's restaurant maybe I had high expectations, but even so I wouldn't expect my fish to be dry and overcooked. Yeah it was busy that night, but my boyfriends sixteen spiced chicken was very tender and juicy.

S"Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill is exceptional and unpretentious.  I've had lunch there twice, and been extremely pleased each time.  The prices are very reasonable (for a Las Vegas celebrity restaurant), and flavors jump off of the plate.\n\nMy most recent meal there was a corn and shrimp tamale appetizer and a chicken and sweet potato hash topped with poached eggs.  The tamale was the best I've ever had.  If you're there, you have to get a margarita or two; they're incredibly fresh tasting, and really make the tequila shine.\n\nI will eat at Mesa Grill each time I'm in Las Vegas."

S"Mesa Grill was extremely overpriced and the service was annoying. I understand it's Vegas, but for the prices, I expected better, quieter service. Our waiter came up every five minutes trying to take our plates, pouring water in between us and our conversations, asking questions... I understand being diligent but this was annoying. \n\nThe pork loin was the best thing any of us got. It was definitely very good. So was the shrimp tamale. I think that's actually the best thing on the menu, but quite rich so you can split that and the pork with someone and be totally satisfied as the portions are huge.\n\nOne of us had the coffee crusted steak, and the rub was just too spicy to really enjoy the meat. The fish was bland and slightly overcooked. Desserts were awful. Seriously, how hard is it to make good churros? The donuts at a fast food restaurant are better!\n\nIf you are a fan of Bobby Flay's other restaurants -- Bar Americain is one of my favorites -- you will be very disappointed here. The quality, service and atmosphere are just so mediocre it really disappoints. Oh, and the price - I think it's more expensive than eating in his restaurant in Manhattan, which is just mind-boggling because this is Vegas, for God's sake."

S"One of the better meals I've had in Vegas.  I love Bobby Flay, even though he's kind of pretentious, but he definitely has a right to be.  He's a genius.  From the quesadillas to the tuna steak, all of the flavors were interesting and worked well.  The mango rice on the side of my dish had almost gummy pieces of mango in it, which did not impress me texturally.  My boyfriend wasn't as impressed with the food.  He's not a huge southwestern cooking fan, and Bobby Flay's menu is chock full of southwestern choices.  \n\nSome other positives:  I had perhaps the best dirty martini I've ever had and the server was spectacular.  He asked if we wanted dessert but was not pushy in any way when we declined which I love.  \n\nNegatives:  I didn't love the atmosphere.  It kind of felt like another cheesy restaurant right in the middle of a hotel.  And the really drunk guy that puked all over his coworkers next to us really put a damper on my evening."

S"Went with 3 friends and shared a taste of 4 different dishes and several appetizers. We were all wowed by the experience. The appetizers were the real highlight: the shrimp tamale, chicken quesidilla, and chicken taco, and blue corn pancake were all one of a kind taste experiences with so many amazing flavors. The bread basket was also great with three unique flavorful varities. On to the entrees the Chile Relleno was admittedly forgettable. The New York Strip Steak was excellent quality but not uniquely flavored more than other excellent steaks at Morton's, etc so if you are going for the unique experience you should not just get the steak, though perhaps you can split it like we did. The Grouper and Cioppino were both excellent and the sauce in the latter was so good we were all dipping our bread in it at the end of the meal. I tried the Mashed Potatoes with white queso sauce and they were good too, but you can only do so much with mashed potatoes and the appetizers were better I think. We had a great dining experience here and so can you, just be sure to try a few different appetizers, share your entrees to get all the flavors, and trust the chefs with all the intriguing combinations offered on the menu. The margaritas and the service are great too and it was well worth the experience to go. I can't wait to go again and try more of the items on the menu, as everything was a new experience."

No drinks were unattended for long.  Excellent experience from that standpoint.\n\nAlso, the bread basket was excellent too, except for the too crumbly corn bread (?).\n\nHere's what I sampled:\n\n- Gala Apple Salad (Baby spinach, maytag blue cheese, toasted pecans, & a spicy orange vinaigrette - I really enjoyed the salad, I just cannot understand the fascination with some of the cheeses.  I would of loved it sans the blue cheese).\n\n- Blue Corn Pancake (Barbecued Duck & Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce - the sauce was nice, but you could seriously have changed the meat to pork and I wouldn't have noticed any difference.  Would have really liked to have tasted the duck).\n\n- Creamy Wild Mushroom Grits (Poached Egg, Charred Serrano Sauce, Cotija Cheese, & Blue Corn Tortilla Crisps - the waitress warned us that these were different grits and they were, but really egg makes a whole lot of stuff better)\n\n- Wild Mushroom Quesadilla (White bean Hummus & White Truffle Oil - I thought it was good, but not great).\n\nFor dinner, I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin (Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce, Sweet Potato Tamale, & Crushed Pecan Butter).  I thought the tenderloin was very well cooked and was pretty tasty.  The Tamale was on the dry side for me, but I'm no tamale aficionado, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nI also sampled the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops and thought it was good, although it seemed slightly undercooked for medium rare.\n\nI also tried the Brussels Sprouts which were okay.\n\nTo finish, I rushed through the Pineapple Buttermilk Upside Down Cake which was just okay for me.

S"We were looking for a place to have lunch and using my handy dandy yelp app we noticed that we were feet's away from Mesa Grill. We made an open table resie and found a table to gamble while we waited for lunch.\n\nOnce seated we checked out the menu and since we weren't blown away by the appetizers we started with a yummy margarita. The drink was fabulous and a great start to our ladies lunch. I was torn between the Mesa Burger and the grilled swordfish club. After talking to our server he highly recommended trying the burger since it was my first time at Mesa Grill.\n\nMy burger was tasty but nothing amazing, the southwestern fries on the other hand were a mouth-watering surprise to my meal. Then came dessert, I was torn between the deep dish banana cream pie and the toasted coconut layer cake. We ended up sharing the banana cream pie, the hazelnut Brittle made the entire dessert come together and I proudly licked my spoon clean.\n\nService was fantastic; our server was knowledgeable and had helpful tips for our Vegas vacation throughout our lunch. All in all I can't wait to come back and try the dinner menu."

S'I came here for dinner and the food was delicious! Everything was very flavorful. I had mushroom grits and the spice rubbed pork tenderloin. The grits were SO good with a variety of sauces that all came together. The pork was perfectly cooked, well spiced, and came with a sweet potato tamale with pecan butter. It was a tad sweet, but very interesting. They also provided an assortment of free bread which included corn muffins!'

S'I\'ll offer Mesa 3.25 stars... \n\nAtmosphere: While the space is open, colorful and lively, the tables are so close together that you can  hear your neighbor\'s every word. \nService: A little lackluster. Long waits between refills, no second cocktails offered, etc. Friendly and knowledgable, but lacking those extras that I expect from upscale dining. \n\nApps:  Blue corn duck pancake and the smoked chicken quesadilla. The pancake seemed to be an after-thought to the duck, which was the main event. Tender and smoky, cooked really well. Unfortunately, the sauce was overwhelmingly sweet and we couldn\'t detect many other flavors. The quesadilla was just that- the quality was good, but the flavors a bit bland.  \n\nMains:  Filet Mignon rubbed with special seasoning was spicy and cooked to perfection. "Like buttah," in the words of my date, and a ridiculously large portion size. Chili Relano was divine! Oozing, melting Oaxacan cheese with a biting, peppery and cornmeal finish. \n\nOverall, the entrees were, on there own 5 stars. \nCocktails: Only tried one each due to aforementioned service issue, but black widow mojito was excellent. Mildly sweet, with a distinctive taste of anise- perfect amount of alcohol.'

S"I recently had brunch at Mesa Grill, with three girlfriends (four moms with college age kids).  We had a reservation for 11:30 and arrived a bit early, no problem we were seated early at a lovely table.  Now, we knew the food was going to be great...but what struck me most was the attention to detail and the impeccable service.   For example, one of my friends does not like ice in her water, the server noticed and every time her glass was refilled they used a pitcher of water with no ice.  We all shared the shrimp tamale as an appetizer, we were each brought a nice plate and after we finished, we all received clean silverware.  Another item, some of the party sitting next to us were wearing black pants and the server switched out their white linen napkins for black ones.  Now you may not think that is such a big deal until you get up from the table with white lint sticking to your black pants.\n\nAs for the food, everything we ordered was perfectly prepared, flavorful and beautiful.  The shrimp,tamale is not to be missed, the shrimp was perfectly cooked, moist with a nice snap to it.  I had the spicy scrambled eggs served with apricot glazed ham.  The eggs were fluffy, the goat cheese tart and let's not even talk about how good the ham was.\n\nI was impressed both with the quality of the food and the quality of the service.  My view is that you can have a great meal, but if the service is sub par, the entire dining experience is diminished.  But if get the combo of great food and great service,you have the recipe for a meal to be remembered for a very long tome."

Devoured that completely.  We each shared a bit of our own plate.\n\n1.  Sweet Potato soup - creamy, sweet, with a kick of spice\n2.  Shrimp tamale - shrimp was cooked perfectly; very tender; sauce was smooth and paired well with the dish\n3.  Honey Glazed salmon - ordered it medium; also tender, flaky and soft, greens melted in my mouth\n4.  Corn crusted Chile Relleno - absolutely phenomenal!  Crunchy outside, creamy and flavorful inside.  Kicks in a bit of spice, too!\n5.  Burger - It was good, pretty juicy\n6.  Pork sandwhich - I don't know what they put in this but it was great!\n7.  Dessert - buttermilk spice upside down cake, sweet, warm, soft, incredibly well spiced.  Mouth watering just thinking of it.  \n\nI would definitely go back again.  And if you are considering lunch or dinner there, expect to pay a pocket full of change.  You really do get what you pay for... great food at a great cost."

S"We kicked off Restaurant Week 2010 at Mesa Grill. When we arrived at 5 o'clock there were very few diners, I'm pretty sure it was just us and two other couples. But as our meal went on the dining room quickly filled. We noshed on the bread basket while we waited for our appetizers, the blue corn muffin wasn't too appealing the bottom looked moldy. The fruit bread was the favorite, and I expected to like it least.\n\nThen, we got started on our first course: Roasted Corn Soup Smoked Tomato Salsa and Blue Corn Pancake Barbecued Duck + Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce. The soup was decent it had an unusual hint of flavor, I thought squash maybe, but my husband thought it tasted more like seafood. Obviously, we weren't on the same page. The blue corn pancake and duck were very tasty. Again, the blue corn does nothing for its appearance.\n\nFor the main course we had Blue Corn Crusted Halibut with Salsa Cruda, Sweet 100 tomatoes, capers, jalapeno, Fresh Oregano, Basil and New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon -Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale Crushed Pecan Butter. The fish was nicely prepared, the presentation was different - thanks to the blue corn it looked liked it had asphalt glistening off the filet. The pork was flavorful as long as you had the crust in every bite. The tamale was unlike your traditional tamale, still tasty, however.\n\nLastly we finished with Coconut Layer Cake and Banana Cream Pie. Both were good, but nothing particularly memorable.\n\nService was very good throughout the meal. All in all, it was a fine meal, it's just that nothing was particularly notable. I can't say I'd return, but I'm happy we took the opportunity to finally give it a try."

S"Soooo good.   Went here with some friends that recommended it.  My wife and I split some items.  First, we had the blue corn duck appetizer.  Really well done.  I have seen something similar on other menus, but this was perfect.  After this, we tasted our friends pumpkin soup and fell in love.  So, we had to order a bowl of this.  \n  Then we split the veal steak.  The steak was cooked perfect and the sauce was to die for.  \n\n   I am not a fan of too spicy, nor do I typically enjoy southwestern flavors, but the spice was just right...and bobby's menu may have changed my mind about southwestern flavors.   \n\nI also took a bite of the lobster my friends ordered and that too was top notch, the sauce was amazing.\n\n    Well done Bobby."

I got 2 drinks and 2 apps, cost me $100 big ones.... I would much rather lose that in craps in 5 minutes then eat there again...\n\nBUT! The food \'looked\' really pretty....... good job on the presentation not so much on the execution.... What are these?

S"Just like everyone else, I came here cause hey, it's a Bobby Flay restaurant.  And well, I'm a big fan of Iron Chef and Throwdown.  So I had high expectations and Mesa Grill did not disappoint.\nFirst of all, our waiter was excellent, although I forgot his name otherwise i would've gave him a shoutout on here.  He gave us some good recommendations and he really knew the menu.  Based upon his recommendation we ordered the duck pancake.  I've only had duck at Chinese and French restaurants, never at an American restaurant. The duck pancake was WOW!  It was in some type of BBQ sauce and the flavors just exploded in my mouth!  Thank you waiter!\nFor the entree, I ordered the Mesa burger.  I figured Bobby Flay has a whole book on grilling, so he must make a mean burger!  My burger was succulent, juicy, huge, and oh so flavorful.  This could be one of the best burgers in Vegas?!  For $16 it was a deal!!  They are served with Southwestern fries, probably the best seasoned fries I ever had.\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate bread pudding.  I'm a big fan of bread pudding regardless so it was a perfect way to end a perfect meal.  Thanks Bobby Flay for the keeping my taste buds satisfied."

S'While dining in Vegas for work, Mesa Grill was definitely the highlight (in terms of dining). The Mesa Grill is located in the Caesers Palace. Since I was by myself, I decided to sit at the bar and order appetizers. Thankfully there was no wait. \n\nBread Basket -- complimentary warm bread basket while you wait. The corn muffin is to die for!\n\nShrimp Tamale -- One of their signature dishes, and its a must. I love tamales, and Bobby Flay has definitely raised the bar with this appetizer. I can see why it was listed on Food Networks "Best Thing I\'ve Ever Eaten"\n\nTuna Nachos -- Thankfully there is no cheese on these nachos. It is sashimi served with a couple different sauce with chips to scoop. Good light appetizer with a lot of flavor. \n\nWhite Peach Margarita -- Excellent margarita with high quality alcohol. No syrups were used while making this cocktail, and it gave me a good buzz just after one cocktail.\n\nOverall it was an awesome dining experience -- job well done Bobby Flay!'

S'My 200th review! Wow, who knew I ate out so much!! For #200 I have chosen Mesa Grill. I am torn on giving 4 stars...but I don\'t want to give 3 either...let\'s say 3 1/2 stars for Mesa. \n\nThe service was definitely 5 stars. We had an awesome, attentive, friendly, sweet waiter who really did an awesome job. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The table was large and the seating was comfortable. \n\nWhen it comes to the food though...I just wasn\'t that impressed :( I had really high hopes for Mesa...I have heard so many people tell me how much they love it and how it will be some of the best food I will ever eat. I beg to differ.\n\nLet me break it down, we had a LOT of food, so I feel like me giving 3 stars for food is justified:\n\nAppetizers - Goat Cheese "Queso Fundido", Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Corn Tamale, Blue Corn Pancake with Duck, Yucatan Chicken Tacos. \n\nWe ordered four appetizers for five people. That should be enough, right? Wrong. These appetizers are tiny. And expensive for the portion you receive! The total for just the appetizers was $60. Yes, 6-0 dollars. One appetizer was barely enough for two people. And let me state for the record, I have no problem throwing down money for good food, but I thought it was absolutely ridiculous the amount charged for tiny little bites of food.\n\nBut how did it taste, you ask? Okay. The cheese dip was awesome. I will give Mr. Flay that - he can make a mean cheese dip. But, if you didn\'t eat it fast enough, it hardened. So, eat quickly when you order the queso! The shrimp tamale was also pretty good. The shrimp were large and juicy, the corn filling was nice and flavorful, which a yummy cilantro cream sauce. The blue pancake with duck was alright...I wouldn\'t eat it again. It was shredded duck in a super rich BBQ sauce, just okay. The chicken tacos were served with red onions and "chile BBQ sauce" that tasted just like Thai food...pad thai to be exact. \n\nSides - Glazed Baby Carrots with brown sugar, Roasted Corn with smoked chile\'s and Cotija cheese, Saut\xc3\xa9ed Spinach, Sweet Potato Tamale with Pecan Butter.\n\nI tried all of these sides. This place is like Ruth\'s Chris where you order your meat, and everything else on the side, your entree doesn\'t come with anything.\n\nThe baby carrots had a nice flavor, but they were a little undercooked for my taste. I prefer softer carrots. The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter - sounds awesome right? Sounds sweet and delicious, right? Well, it tastes like Masa. The saut\xc3\xa9ed spinach was literally just that. Spinach. Now, I love spinach, and I can eat it plain or dressed up, but when I pay $8 for spinach, I would expect some garlic, or salt...or anything...nope. This was seriously cooked spinach with no other flavors. \n\nThe Roasted Corn was the star of the sides. It was absolutely delicious. The corn kernels were crisp and fresh, served in an awesome creamy, cheesy sauce that was spicy, but not too overpowering. Just awesome. \n\nEntrees - Coffee Rubbed Filet MIgnon, Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.\n\nThree of us had the filet, the other two had the pork. Since I can\'t eat pork, I don\'t want to say much about it, but I will say BF said it was good, but not the best ever. Maybe if he ever gets on the ball and starts Yelping again, he can tell you about it himself.\n\nThe filet...very large cut of meat, too much to finish. It was soft, it was coffee rubbed, it didn\'t really taste like anything. The coffee rub was more of a burnt crust. I got a hint of coffee, but mostly I just tasted burn. \n\nIt was served on some mushroom, ancho chile sauce. The mushrooms were very good. Spicy and caramelized. I loved the sauce...but the filet? I would rather go to Ruth\'s Chris. honestly.\n\nAfter dinner our friends ordered dessert and coffee. I tried the coffee, good flavor. I took a bite of their Pineapple Buttermilk Upside Down Cake - it was very good, rich, sweet, served with a caramelized rum sauce. \n\nOverall, this place was just alright. There were a few things that hit high notes with me, but they were appetizers and sides, and I don\'t think I would come back just for those items. The majority of the food was just okay, not amazing, not the best I have ever had. \n\nI think I will just stick to making my Bobby Flay recipes at home, they taste better and they are cheaper!'

S"We decided to try Mesa Grill for lunch. It was a Sunday so we had the brunch menu. It was a little disappointing since I would have preferred the lunch menu. The brunch menu is mostly several variations on scrambled eggs. It did not have any of the tamales that Bobby Flay is know for. We had to wait a little bit for a table since we had a large group and they had to push some tables together for us. The place has a nice feel with an open kitchen, although the set up made it a little hard to see the kitchen. The guy at the grill seemed to like that we were paying attention to him and kept looking up and smiling at us. In fact, everyone at the restaurant was friendly. The service was really good. At one point, one of the bussers dropped a fork and all three employees in the area went over to pick it up.\n\nI went with their version of steak and eggs. Actually half our group had that and the other half had the Mesa Burger. One person had scrambled egg enchiladas. The steak and eggs and burgers were a decent sized portion and we felt pretty full after, however I think my friend that got the enchiladas was a little disappointed as it cost as much as the burger, but you only got two small enchiladas.  You do get a basket of delicious bread with your meal.\n\nI'd like to try Mesa Grill again, but next time for lunch or dinner. A few notes: the dress code is relaxed in the day. There were several people in tshirt and shorts, myself included. However, they won't let you wear a hat. The table next to us had a very young child with them who was a picky eater and they were happy to make something special for him."

S"Wow, to get a 5th star from me on a 2nd visit means it's pretty good! I can be on the picky side.  What I am trying to understand is how the casino cafes can get away with charging more than Bobby Flay for a burger that doesn't even come close to what you get at Mesa Grill.  If you look at the guides, Mesa Grill is listed as semi pricey - well in comparison to the mediocre food at many of the casino restaurants, this should be listed as inexpensive!  A burger costs $16 and it's worth every penny for the way the cheese is perfectly melted into the meat and the onions are caramelized to perfection.  Fries are seasoned really well too.  \n\nThe barbecued lamb salad was delicious and not gamey.  They know how to make a pretty good Bloody Mary - but not as good as Old Ebbitt Grill in DC - Bobby ... go check it out and you'll see what I mean! \n\nService is always great.  Thanks for another delicious meal."

We were staying at Caesars for only a night and this was a perfect time to try it out!  I got the tuna nachos appetizer and it was very spicy and great!  I got the salmon with black bean sauce which was also great.  Very odd that the waiter asked how I wanted my salmon cooked - always a first time for everything!  My only complaint is the drinks are too expensive - no real choice for white wines and $13 a glass for an ok glass of white.  My boyfriend loved his margaritas which were also $13.

The best part is being able to look inside the kitchen...we searched madly for Bobby as my friend was insistent that she was going to marry him that night.\n\nWe never saw him.\n\nThe menu has a wonderful array of options with a southwestern flair.  It was so difficult to make my selection!  I could've chosen anything on there and had been happy!\n\nI wound up choosing the Mahi Mahi that had a tangy pineapple salsa....nice tender kick to the salsa too!  Plus I ordered a side dish...this wonderful corn tamale with chizoro and goat cheese.  \n\nI took a bite of the tamale...and was speechless.  \n\nI usually don't have a problem overeating...I stop when I'm full. \n\nHowever, this was one night that I completely indulged myself.\n\nAnd it was well worth it. \n\n:)"

S"Like many Las Vegas restaurants whose homes are inside the luxury hotels along the strip, Mesa Grill has an impressive space decked out in top-of-the line furniture and decor complete with a seating lounge area and full bar. Our group of 8 made a reservation here for brunch on a Saturday. We waited around 10 minutes in the lounge before getting seated. The menu for brunch had great variety ranging from your typical breakfast items with eggs, to lunch items like hamburger and dinner-like items like salmon and roasted chicken but of course each choice is riddled with Bobby Flay flair. I'm not a big fan of tex mex, so I opted for the Hamburger. LIke my review, this burger was A-OK. I didn't favor the ciabatta bread and there really wasn't anything too special about the meat or fixings. The fries on the other hand was a nice change. It had a chipotle dusting over it and what impressed me most was the horseradish mustard. I've never had anything quite like it before. Other than the food and decor, our service was top-notch. Out main waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and always there to bring us everything we needed. The busboys were attentive with the drinks/water and clearing out the food. I probably wouldn't go here again just because I was not that impressed with the food but it was more due to my own taste. I'd recommend it for others to try though."

S'I\'m not the biggest Bobby Flay fan... not especially on American Iron Chef but I figured I would give his food a chance after my third time in Vegas this summer.\n\nWe couldn\'t get dinner reservations on our first night so we went there for lunch yesterday.  Service was good from the moment we stepped into the restaurant.  It\'s not such a fancy shmancy restaurant actually.  It\'s decent... but nothing that\'ll make you go \'wow!\'.  Maybe a little dated?  I don\'t know.... can\'t put my finger on one specific thing.\n\nWe got a couple of magaritas which were ok... my white peach one was well... peachy and a little like... ummm... cough syrupy lol but I don\'t think that\'s the fault of the bartender... \n\nFor appetizers, I got the blue corn pancake with duck (probably my first time ordering duck prepared non-Chinese way) and my husband got the rough chopped raw tuna taco.  Yes we had to admit, we were impressed!  They said the tuna would be VERY spicy and while it didn\'t turn out to be super spicy (we are serious spicy food eating folks) it did have a very nice kick.  My duck was tasty and the combination of the flavors came together very nicely.\n\nI\'d initially intended to order the pork tenderloin sandwich but the waitress swayed me to order Flay\'s signature dish the cuban burger sandwich... plus it came with fries so i relented very easily :)  The husband got the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash (not spicy at all).  Well, they were good but it was kind of disappointing... sort of blah... after the two great appetizers.  Both servings were also very big... so make sure you are ready to share :)  If you like thin crispy fries like me, they have good fries here.  Not the best (Shultzy\'s Seattle) I\'ve had but good.\n\nIt was a good experience.  We left happy but decided it was not a place that left us planning to come back soon.  If it was a group of people and suggested this place, we would come back but we wouldn\'t suggest it.  ...it is a good menu to please a large audience :)\n\nBTW, if you can\'t get reservations and they offer you to walk-in and try a table at the "lounge area"... DON\'T!  It\'s merely a bunch of low narrow chairs around two low tables... not a place I would have a meal!'

I really wish I could have that for brunch every weekend.  Atmosphere and decor were nice.  Service was great.  \n\nThe only reason why I'm giving four stars is because... After the waiter brought out a dish of sugar packets, we found an empty one in there that had obviously been torn open and used by another customer and stuffed back into the dish.  Yes, it could have easily been looked over, but it just shows a little carelessness when checking over their things."

We also tried some of their specialty margaritas which were great with the appetizers.  I ordered the Duck breast and I would like to be more descriptive, but it was so good, I ate it so fast, it is just a pleasant memory now.  My boyfriend had the lamp chops, with a peanut/cilatro pesto which was amazing also.  \n\nApril, our server was great.  Women, you will appreciate this;  I was wearing a black dress and was a little apprehensive about putting a white napkin in my lap for fear of walking around with white lint on my dress all night.  She must have seen the look on my face when I put the napkin aside instead of in my lap.  We got our margaritas and then noticed that I now had a black napkin!

S'I freakin love tamales and this place has some amaaazing shrimp tamales!\n\nWe ordered the Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Corn Tamale - the shrimp were perfectly cooked, super tender and the tamales were made with a mixture of masa AND fresh corn kernels. I have had my fair share of tamales and this is by far my favorite.\n\n We also received complimentary breads that included a Blue Corn Cornbread. This had awesome flavor but was really dry. It crumbled every time I stuck my fork in it..\n\nMy BF ordered the Green Chile Burger... the burger was cooked perfectly. The meat was well seasoned and really juicy but the green chile didnt really add anything to the burger...\n\nEveryone talks about Mesa Grill\'s Churros... I knew I wanted these but I wanted to check out the rest of the dessert menu too. I guess it bothered the server that I wanted to see the dessert menu before we finished our dinner because he kind of gave me an asshole look and said "well we usually give those to you after you\'ve finished your meal". Listen jerk, I\'m on vacation and if I wanted to eat dessert as my meal, with my meal or in lieu of my meal THEN I CAN! \n\nAnyhoo they didnt even have the damn churros so everyone lost...\n\nOverall, I was expecting more from this place. Dishes are hit or miss - some were awesome, some not so much.'

S'\xc2\xa1Buen provecho! \n\nSUMMARY: The food here was very tasty. Theirs is a modern, elegant take on Southwestern fare. There was a splash of sweet and a kick of spice in each dish. The meat was tender and the service was excellent. Our server, Joel, was attentive and informative.  He made a lovely meal all the more enjoyable. \n\nEXPECTATION OF THE FAMOUS:  Emily Dickenson lamented, "How dreary - to be - Somebody!" I don\'t know how "dreary" fame is nowadays, but there are drawbacks.  Clearly Bobby Flay\'s Mesa Grill both suffers and benefits from his fame. My advice? Let go of whatever you think of Bobby Flay when you sit down to eat. Don\'t allow preconceived notions fed by reality television shows to color your expectation.  Many fabulous restaurants on the strip are owned/led by accomplished, talented, and (when we are lucky) creative chefs. At Mesa Grill (MG) the owner/executive chef also happens to be famous.  That fact should be the least important part of your experience with this place.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nTIGER SHRIMP: This delectable bite was my favorite of the night. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and like many dishes at Mesa Grill, comes with corn.  This appetizer was creamy and sweet. It was a gentle start to the meal.\n\nBLUE CORN PANCAKE: Served with barbequed duck, this dish was a tad sweet for my taste. But the tender meat and complex sauce compensated for the overly sweet bite.\n\nNEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS: Both dishes packed a (now familiar) sweet and spicy punch. By the time the grilled lamb came out, I was a bit tired of the sweet dishes. But in fairness the "sweet + meat" combo works. For spice reluctant palates, the sweet provides a gentle method for accepting the kick in many of the dishes.  There is a purpose behind the flavor selections. I appreciate the thoughtfulness behind the dishes.  What more could I ask?\n\nCHURROS: Warm, sweet, and light.\n\nPRICKLY PEAR MARGHARITA: Sweet and expected.\n\nVERDICT: This was a lovely meal. The food was well prepared and the overall experience was enjoyable. While I\'m not putting Mesa Grill on my rotation, I would certainly visit with a friend from out of town. There is a slight.... artificiality to the place that I can\'t pin down. It\'s a slick establishment.  They are looking to leave you feeling something. I may not have been as moved as MG management would have liked, but I appreciate the professionalism and the effort.   There is nothing "dreary" about doing something well. And Mesa Grill does high-end, delicious Southwestern food very well.'

S'I wish I could give this restaurant a higher rating - as many have already said, a very mixed experience. The overall experience is best described as "Southwestern Light" several of us kept yearning for more spice and most of the food frankly was fairly bland. We came as a party of 5 - the waiter was very attentive however our entrees took forever and just as another reviewer has mentioned the table next to us sat down and seemed to have theirs immediately. My margarita was alright, nothing special and a bit on the weak side for a "high end" restaurant I could have probably gotten the same right outside in the casino. We chose appetizers based on previous reviews and these were delicious as were most of our desserts. Our entrees however when finally delivered were a huge disappointment - my chili relleno was awful - it practically oozed with so much cheese I couldn\'t find the chili in there and the chicken was basically no better than business class airplane food. Entrees were so terrible I don\'t think any of us will be back. If you are just going for the name then you probably won\'t care otherwise I would save your money and go a few doors down to the cafe at Spago.'

S"Surprisingly good for a tourist trap. We popped in for lunch with no reservations and took advantage of a special anniversary special...three courses for $25. Considering all the meals we have had in Vegas, this was a relative bargain. Standouts included Sophie's Chopped Salad, the Mesa Burger, BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad, and Steak Sandwich. All of these dishes shared Bobby Flay's signature sensibilities...a bit of heat, a touch of sweetness, maybe a bit of tang, and a mixture of textures. While service was attentive and efficient, we felt somewhat rushed. And while we found lunch to be a bargain at these prices, I don't know if I would feel the same way about these entrees at the much higher dinner prices. Nevertheless, Mesa Grill was a pleasant surprise."

S'First of I do know Bobby Flay does not chef/cook here. However, I had the pleasure of eating here recently and have to say it was excellent from finish to start. We came for weekend brunch and found the service, food quality and ambiance to be great. The appetizer of Tuna Nachos consisted of really good quality fish and was robust in flavor. The bread basket ( complimentary) was amazing from scones to cornbread. Have never been to a restaurant with such an amazing bread basket. Add to that the final courses of Ancho Salmon & Scrambled eggs with biscuits and the restaurant hit a home run. Margaritas were also tasty and unique ( pear cactus marg?! Wow!)....lastly service was great with staff who followed up consistently and were friendly. Highly recommend for anyone coming to Vegas!'

Cooked perfectly and accompanied by a sweet potato tamale that was a perfect compliment of sweetness to go with the ancho chile drizzle that was on the pork.  Service was spectacular, attentive, and always ready to give an excellent advice on drinks and desserts.  This is the only place in Vegas that I will make plans to stop off in every time I go."

S'I wish I would\'ve written this review straight after I finished my meal, but I"ll try my best to accurately describe the joy I felt after each bite. \n\nI will have to preface this review by saying that I never had the urge to try any of Bobby Flay\'s restaurant b/c I thought "how can you turn Southwestern food and flavors into fine dining" especially being that I\'m from Texas. Boy was I wrong.\n\nWe started with the Shrimp with Blue Corn Tamale, Chicken tacos, and the quesadilla. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, the tamale-delicious. My fave appetizer is the Quesadilla. I love goat cheese, I love truffle oil. The combination is electrifying. This is a must try. \n\nI had the veal chop, and let me tell you that each bite sent shivers down my spine. I let out a slight moan every time I would put a piece of meat in my mouth. The veal was so tender, and the flavoring. Succulent. Each bite sent me closer and closer to nirvana. \n\nMy friend had the duck, which I asked her to order. OMFG, Excellent. Divine. Fantabulous. I could go on and on. The duck was perfect. It was tender but had just the right amount of gamey-ness to it. When I go back again, I don\'t know if I\'ll have the veal or duck. Both were excellent. \n\nBobby Flay has always been known for his robust flavors and I have to say that I"m hitting myself in the head for not trying his restaurants before. Every dish I tried was just amazing. Each bite is like fireworks in your mouth.'

S'Ive dined at Mesa Grill before and I have to say it is one of my fav restaurants. I am a fan of Bobby Flay and his style of cooking. I took my friend here who I have to say is a very "plain" eater - think cereal & turkey sandwiches. So to come here was a big stretch for her. We both ordered margaritas - one original & one white peach - both were delicious & strong :) She had the chicken taco appetizer (which I tried) and it was nicely presented, well seasoned and I loved the peanut bbq sauce - yum. I ordred the blue corn duck pancake (basically a duck taco) - the duck was fantastic. I ordered an entree (which I sort of split with my friend) which was the ancho chili rubbed pork tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale - excellent. My pork was cooked perfected - the rub and the sauce was delicious. This certainly will not be my last visit to Mesa Grill. I\'ve never been disappointed.'

S"Normally, I'd order steak, but our waiter told us the signature dish was the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, so out of six people, 4 of us ordered the pork, and the other two had the rib-eye.\n\nWhen they brought out the dinners, I thouht they brought us steak in error.  The tenderloins were very thick cut, like a filet.  This was the best pork tenderloin I've had in my life!  Both guys that ordered the ribeye's tried the tenderloins and agreed.  They said their ribeyes were good, but in hindsight would have ordered the pork!\n\nThe Sweet Potato Tamale that came with the tenderloin was a bit overcooked and dry, but still tasty.\n\nI'd give Mesa Grill 5 stars, but this was the one in Vegas.  I'm just not a fan of Vegas, but with all the celebrity chef places popping up, my point of view may change..."

My girlfriend had the salmon, which was cooked absolutely perfectly and seasoned amazingly. It was stunning. \n\nI had the Mesa burger, which is easily the best burger I have ever had in my life. Cooked medium, it was amazingly perfect. Seasoning, bun, the sear; I still think about it often. I wanted to hug the guy on the grill. \n\nOn top of that, great beer selection, and the service was really magnificent. Pretty reasonably priced too.

S"I was excited to try my first Bobby Flay Restaurant. When I walked in, I was very surprised by the casual environment. I was under the impression that it was going to be a little more formal than it was. There wasn't anything extravagant about the interior, very simple. Sadly, we have been drinking the whole day and wasn't really hungry from the really late lunch we had.\n\nWe ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla and wasn't too amazed. You can definitely skip this appetizer. We then got the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos which was full of flavor and very good! A definite appetizer to get.\n\nDue to us not being too hungry we ordered the crusted Tuna Steak. The tuna was delicious but it too wasn't something we would order again. I think we might of just ordered the wrong plates because a 9 year old boy ordered the rib eye and his dad got the NY strip steak and it looked AMAZING. The lady to my left ordered the cioppino and that too looked AMAZING.\n\nI definitely want to check out the NY location for their brunch menu that they are well known for and try out Bobby Flay's food again... when I am not so full.

Also important, your whole party has to be there or you won't be seated.\n\nAnd yes, yet again the tonkotsu impressed.  I love it!  And this time I ordered the extra chashu.  That meat in that delicious broth is just perfect.  Maybe one day I'll be compelled enough to order at refill for less than two bucks, but trust me when I say that one bowl is perfect and hits me in the right spot.

Husband and I ordered and it took a much longer time to prepare than should have been for the type of food we had.  I had Tonkatsu ramen with extra chasu (bad move) green onions and corn.  The green onions were finely shredded and placed on top like a haystack, and the corn just piled on top.  The chasu was thin and soft and fell apart when picked up.  The broth did not have much flavor.\n\nI couldn't understand why this place did such a wonderful business when right across the street at Hue Thai you can get a wonderful bowl of pho for the same price, and don't have to pay for any extras.  They also have bahn mi (sandwiches) for which they bake their own wonderful bread.  \n\nSkip Monta Noodles and get your noodles at Hue Thai!

There were condiments on the table and I put some of that pureed garlic into my soup to give it an extra garlic kick!  \n\nWe also ordered one fried rice and a gyoza appetizer.  Yummy!

Perfectly done noodles in a rich, perfectly seasoned broth, served with a few slices of pork and some vegetables mixed in...  and the egg... AMAZING.  They have somehow figured out how to boil an egg so that the white is fully cooked, yet the center is slightly thinkened yet runny, and served it on top of my noodle soup, cut in half like a hard boiled egg.

S"Gone are the days of associating ramen with my poor college days. Sad to admit but I have only had the processed packaged type of ramen until my friend turned me on to Monta Noodle House. To even mention Monta's ramen in the same sentence as Top Ramen or Cup O' Noodles is blasphemous. \n\nI ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen which I believe is their most popular dish. The broth is thick, cloudy, and jam packed with flavor. The noodles were perfectly cooked and tasted like they were made fresh onsite. There were a few slivers of pork and I added a soft boiled egg. My husband got the combination Tonkatsu and Shoya and it was just as yummy as my dish. It is interesting how many variations there are of ramen and how adding one ingredient changes the whole dish. \n\nMonta really is a hole in the wall restaurant because it could easily be missed in the shopping center. The restaurant is tiny so it is not recommended for large groups. This is a sit down, order, slurp up, and leave type of joint. I'm not sure if I'd frequent this place in the hot summer months but it definitely hits the spot when you want some warmth in your tummy."

S"Omg, what a great idea to come after a night of hard partying at EDC. My friend found Monta Ramen on Yelp, and once our whole crew woke up from drunken slumber, we hopped in our car and headed straight for ramen!!\n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen which is the most popular and also the Takana friend rice. The soup for the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen was a little bit salty, but the pork was the best thing ever. Wow, it is so tender and tasty, totally worth it- just don't finish the soup. I wish there were more pieces in my ramen, but you can always add more! Also, as recommended by our waitress, the Takana friend rice is a must. It was really delicious and I wish my stomach would have let me eat more. \n\nOverall, Monta Ramen is a cute little ramen place in the Chinatown/ asia food area off the strip. The food is decent, great for hangovers and the service is also really friendly. Although where we sat is spacious, this place gets super packed. Prepare yourself for a wait because the restaurant is small and can only accommodate a few tables / seating at the bar at a time."

S"Wow Wow Wow. \n\nI have tried a few authentic places for Ramen before, but this place takes the cake :)\n\nI had the Tonkotsu Ramen (which is pork for us Gaijins) and it was very tasty! The best part is that the broth wasn't overly salty, as most places that I have tried. The broth was delicious and the meat itself was very tender! I would definitely go here weekly if I lived close by. Prices are good too. \n\nThe space is a bit small and we did have a little wait before we were seated. This place gets busy! Don't worry though, because it's worth it!\n\nI also heard that the Shoyo Ramen is very good as well!\n\nI rarely give 5's. And the funny thing is that I had to get dragged to go here. Go figure. Apparently, this place has won a lot of awards in several big local magazines (how we found out about it, lol)  :)"

S"Last week I ate at Monta four nights out of seven. I don't think I'll ever get tired of their delicious ramen - only three different options, but with many toppings available. And if I do, I'll move onto the kimchi fried rice or pork bowl. The gyoza are pretty meh though. I won't get those again. \n\nI'm so glad there's finally a simple, authentic Japanese ramen spot in Vegas. It's small, it's hot and it's usually crowded. Like the best ramen places in L.A. I used to drive the five hours just to get a bowl, now I can hit up this place between trips. Huzzah."

Broth is always on point, and the chasu is bomb.  plus you can add/edit the toppings on your ramen. I like mine with nitamago (egg), and some shredded green onions (for texture) always, but there's plenty of options. \n\nThe awesomeness doesn't stop with their ramen. The best dish ever is their pork belly bowl!!!!! It's super rich, with lots of heavenly pork. Garnish it with some ginger and sesame seeds. Yum! \n\nService is always good. It's a pretty small place though. They tend to get really busy, and wait time can be long, but it is for sure worth the wait :)"

S"Best Ramen in Vegas?  Only true Ramen House in Vegas?  Yes and Yes... Monta's Simple.  Hot.  Tasty.  Highly recommend to anyone in Vegas or visiting Vegas and wants to try something off the strip.  \n\nThe mister and eldest son had the Miso and I had the Tonkatsu Shoyu (less salty than the Miso).  I had mine plain while extra chashu was added to one of the Miso's.  All of them were SO GOOD. The younger son had a small pork belly rice bowl but we had to spoon away all the vegetables that decorated it (green onions, pickled ginger shreds...).  He liked it.\n\nI only gave 4 stars because I'm not much of a Ramen eater because of all the MSG.  And Unfortunately, I did end up with a migraine :(.  It's a super small joint and soda's are served in a can... I don't think they have hot drinks... yet."

S"Finally got to go to Monta after hearing about it for so long and dying to go. It was good! Pretty much what you would expect from a ramen place... quick and easy. It is very small and you'll probably have to wait for sure. \n\nI have to say I enjoy different ramen styles better, though, like what they have at Ramen Sora. Monta has thinner noodles, and their broth is very good but doesn't have the umami punch that makes ramen so delicious. I prefer thicker, chewier wavy noodles than thin noodles that they had. They also do not have curry like many ramen places unfortunately, but that is okay, because they make up for it with their variety of fried rices. \n\nI sat at a stool at the bar, and it is pretty uncomfortable, but adds to the ramen-ya feel that they are going for. I wouldn't mind going back, it definitely satisfies the ramen craving, but I think if I had to pick one place it would be Ramen Sora for sure. \n\nCheck it out!"

Despite this, I still believe its one of the better ramen establishments for Las Vegas"

S"I have been going to a lot of ramen places lately, looking for the best ones.  Some have been amazing, some not so much.  This place was sort of in the middle.  It's very small, which is appropriate for a ramen shop.  Our party of three waited for about half an hour for a table on a Friday around noon, which was to be expected.  We were seated at the bar, which has a nice little shelf underneath to put your purses on.  =)  I ordered the miso ramen and added boiled egg (nitamago).  The first few bites I thought were delicious.  Then the saltiness became a little too much for me.  I couldn't eat it all, and took about half of it home in a to-go container.  I had the rest the next day, and again, it was tasty but way too salty.  And I usually love salt.  I still ate it though.  Someone else in my party ordered the kuro ramen and loved it.  I'd go back, but maybe try a different flavor."

I honestly could not say enough good things about this place.\n\nI've taken numerous people to this place, and will continue to do so. I've told out of town friends, and anyone that has mentioned a hankering for ramen, or food in general, to come here, because they have not lived until they've eaten the best ramen in town. \n\nI wish there were more space for seating, but it's not really a problem if I have to wait.

S'Finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in Vegas - Monta Noodle House.  Conveniently located on Spring Mountain, right next to the super busy Raku.  (Smart business choice I would say.)\n\nThis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don\'t come with a large group.  Their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (A couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\nI went for their most popular dish - Tonkotsu Ramen ($6.95).  The main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  This results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  It automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and green onions.  Their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn\'t like the Chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nThe Husband went for the Miso Ramen ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  This was also good, and quite filling.\n\nWe also shared a regular order of the Pork Belly Bowl ($5.75).  It sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  I adore pork belly and the next time I come here, I\'m going to order a dish of this all to myself.  It\'s fatty and good.  \n\nA side dish we added on was the Takana Mustard Leaf ($1.50).  You can have this on the side or in your broth.  It\'s pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  It\'s adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  Other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or green onions.\n\nThere\'s only one other kind of ramen they offer here - Shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  You can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for "Kaedama."  Other dishes available are gyoza, fried rice, kim chee fried rice, takana fried rice, cha siu bowl, and mini mentaiko (marinated polluck roe).\n\nService was good.  With two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  It\'s not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nUpdate!  \nI returned the following month for my own bowl of the Pork Belly Bowl.  This time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn\'t to my personal preference.  Guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.'

If you come hungry,  you'll be starving by the time your get food. Guaranteed. Hmm maybe that's why its so good? The ramen broth is delicious, I know you can choose between a few, but you can't really go wrong with anything you order. As appetizers, the goyza is a nice touch, as well as the kimchi fried rice. I love how you can see into the kitchen from the dining area. Makes me feel just a bit better that my food is being cooked properly. I would like to give it a half star less for being such a small place, but I guess you can't blame them for being so popular. I hope they expand!"

Sadly someone took my spot but whatever lol \n\nI usually order tonkatsu shoyu with chashu,nitamago & corn..\nThe broth is just sooooooo gooood! I've been to so many ramen places here in Vegas and none of them can compare to this! \nThe broth is like creamy pork flavor with shoyu (soy sauce), the chashu pork is very tender and thin which is perfect for me it's so so so good! The noodles are firm and not too soggy which I love as well ^__^ \nFor side dishes I usually get takana fried rice and gyoza :) so yummy \n\nAs for the people that work there, they already know that I'm a regular so they usually give us good seats and we also tip them really good lol\nJust don't go there during the weekends or around 7pm so many people waiting in line.

It reminded me very well of the corner noodles houses they have in Japan. Stepping into Monta reminded me of the times I stayed in Japan during hot summers and cold autumns. \n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen. Dericious aromatic smell, and served hot.

S"What a great find in Las Vegas! Initially, I didn't come here with much expectations because no other ramen places I've been to have impressed me as much as Ramen Dojo in NorCal. Knowing that the capacity of Monta Noodle House fit around 20 or so customers, I anticipated a wait so arrived 30 minutes before opening on a Friday afternoon. Arriving early got me a table right at opening...yay to that! so COME EARLY to avoid waiting. \n\nMonta Noodle House offers three different kinds of broth but I got a recommendation from one of their regular customers to order the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth! The standard bowl comes with noodles, bamboo shoots, onions, and two pieces of pork. I wanted the ultimate ramen experience so I added on some extra stuff to spice up my bowl - I added the soft boiled egg (a must for every ramen bowl!), sweet yellow corn and shredded green onions (MUST add - gives great flavoring to the whole bowl). I also garnished my ramen bowl with the togarashi chili powder and sesame seeds! The addition of sesame seeds in the bowl was just perfect =) I have to say the best part about this place is the ramen that they used - the noodles were so soft & the thickness was about the size of egg noodles but with a softer texture. I definitely enjoyed this.They also give you plenty of noodles to fill you up real GOOD! \n\nIf you're ever craving ramen in Las Vegas and can wake up early enough after a night of partying..remember to check this place out! It's located in Chinatown so having a rental car is convenient. Solid 4 stars for satisfaction and it's location in VEGAS!!\n\nFYI: I also heard that the kimchee fried rice was also good to try. \n\nHappy Eating =)"

I work in the Westside, so I eat at Tsujita a couple of times a month.  Monta gave them a run for their money with fine, al dente noodles, half a perfectly cooked onsen tamago, and an unctuous broth that was rich and flavorful without being too heavy.\n\nMonta easily beat the two heavy hitters from Japan - Mattou Seimen, three time Tokyo Ramen Festival champion, and Tatsu No Ya, the #1 ramen shop in Kyushu.\n\nMonta also took out a personal favorite, Shalala Ramen from my native NorCal, and a Googler staple.  (Shalala's Mountain View shop is 5 minutes from the Googleplex.)\n\nShinsengumi Hakata Ramen?

The broth was not salty, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the corn and egg complimented the dish.  My companions ordered Kimchi and I've only had Kimchi once before and did not like it; however, the Kimchi at this place was quite yummy. We also ordered the Pork Belly Bowl - also wonderful.  The only complaint I have about Monta Ramen is that it's is a small restaurant.  I think there were only 7 tables and then the space at the bar.

There is no place to wait, and apparently the wait to even eat lunch here is a struggle. I felt like I could hear what the other diners were thinking when I was crammed in next to them. Aside from that, the food itself was absolutely delicious, and it tasted authentic. This certainly isn't your college ramen experience."

S"Me and my friends actually ended up here because the line at Oyster Bar was too long and we were starving. I personally am a ramen fan in general so I like trying new places, my other friend and her hubby are not big ramen fans, but luckily, after coming to Monta they have found a renewed interest in ramen.\n\nWe all started with a glass of beer, pretty cheap at about $3 but they are not pints, I think more like 10oz-ers? Still it was a refreshing way to start the meal. \nShared the pickled greens fried rice and the pork belly rice bowl. Fried rice was cooked well and flavorful, the pork belly bowl was even better. The fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly tender with their greasy goodness seaping into the rice underneath. \n\nFor ramen I got the half pork half chicken broth and added an egg. The chicken broth is supposed to be a little less rich but mine was still a pretty thick broth. Not that that's a bad thing, thick as in thick with flavor but sometimes I prefer a less rich broth because it can get very filling. So depending on what you like, the full tonkatsu broth would be richest and most flavorful and a the half and half would be a lighter version. Noodles were cooked perfectly. \n\nThe place is typical small Japanese style shop, they have a list for you to write your name on and wait. The waitresses do a nice job of clearing the tables and getting everyone seated as soon as possible so even though we had a few parties ahead of us the wait wasn't too bad for lunch hour. It does get a little hot inside though, so be warned for those coming in the summer months."

At that place I was able to customize it to the skies: choice of the regular pork broth, or chicken, or even vegetable.  Too salty?  "No prob, we can do low sodium." And I was able to have chicken or shrimp (can\'t remember which) instead of some fatty pork.\n\nIt wasn\'t that way at Monta.  What you see is what you get, complete with photos.  And since even as a kid I was nauseated by even the tiniest bit of fat on any meat or poultry, I couldn\'t stand the pork that was in the bowl and had to remove it.  I\'ll take a nice, lean piece of pork loin any time, but not the stuff that makes up the choices at Monta.  The broth was pretty decent, and I\'m a sucker for noodles of any kind, but the ramen here will never be my comfort food.\n\nWhile service was quick, the tiny and cramped space does not lend itself to comfort or relaxation, so fast service was definitely welcome.  \n\nI don\'t disagree with all of those who love this place.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess.'

Small cozy seating area, bar counter searing, usual garnishes.

I wanted to see what all the hoopla was.\nI got the Tonkotsu which was good but not much different from when I bust out my package of Nissin Top Ramen and add a slice of american cheese to create a creamy broth. The slices of roasted pork made the dish better but my meat had a lot of fat on it, I was glad I got extra, 2 slices was not enough for that huge bowl of noodles.

S"I went here on a recommendation from a work friend.  I am blown away by this place.  It is like the holy grail from Tanpopo.  This movie is amazing and it's about foodie ramen culture in Japan.  They are as authentic as it comes.  Just like the movie, the ramen is cooked al dente, the pork slices are placed carefully, the soup is hot and the broth is flavorful.  All the toppings are there and we were so excited we replicated a part of Tanpopo when the zen ramen master mindfully eats his ramen.  \n\nI knew this place was it when I ate everything and drank the broth to the bottom of the bowl.  The soft boiled eggs are a must.\n\nThis place is amazing and the menu is simple and they just added the shoyu ramen which is by far my favorite.\n\nthe shoyu ramen is light broth not overly salty, the tonkatsu is very meaty and flavorful and they use a different noodle.  I prefer the ramen noodles that come with the miso ramen though.  The miso ramen is delicious but, a little to salty (but, authentic for japanese taste)\n\nI wouldn't get their gyoza again.  pretty generic and expensive.\n\nthe ramen is cheap coming in at under $7 for the tonkatsu and $8 for the miso.\n\nThis place is damn good.  I went their for dinner and was so impressed I went back for lunch again the next day driving all the way from Henderson.  \n\nMonta is pretty authentic looking and I hope it does well because I love little hole in the wall gems."

S"Service here is hit or miss. Sometimes excellent, sometimes not so attentive. I've eaten here about 9 or 10 times, and I noticed that it is server dependent. There are 2 servers that seem to consistently let me down, where as the other 2 are always great and work together well to make sure they always check up on us.\n\nThe Chasu (bbq pork) here is quite good, IMO it is better than the chasu at the well known Daikokuya in Los Angeles. Oddly, they have 2 different types of ramen noodles here that are ASSIGNED to the type of broth you choose and they will NOT let you choose the other noodles with a different broth. I prefer the noodles they use in the miso ramen, but normally prefer a combination of tonkatsu and shoyu broth. The lack of flexibility is a bit upsetting and leaves the foodie in me yearning for food MY WAY. \n\nFortunately, I tried all of their fried rices and rice bowls and have been pretty happy with all of them. My favorite is the pork belly bowl. YUM!!! I add a bit of the crushed garlic, chili oil, and japanese chili flakes to make it absolutely scrumptious. If you like pork (who doesn't), you MUST try this."

S"Coming from the Venetian, I was blissfully leaving the tourist sin otherwise known as Grand Lux Cafe to stumble into the gritty strip mall that houses Monta, just right down the street.  In my love-hate relationship with Vegas, things like this definitely belonged to the first category.  \n\nTwo groups of very jovial Japanese business men occupied the cozy joint when we walked in.  They seemed right at home, joyfully exchanging conversations from across the restaurants to each other as well as the waitresses.  From the smiling eyes to the careless laughter, I make the speculation that they were tourists happy to have found Monta.  I've been there, that rare delight from finding a great Vietnamese restaurant somewhere completely unexpected.  \n\nIt was a frigid night.  Lips cracked from the desert air, my mouth greedily welcomed the steaming broth of the Tonkatsu Ramen, rich with pork bone flavor and complimented with smooth strings of fresh noodles.  Had it been warmer weather, I'd have opted for the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen, a bit lighter with the mix-in of chicken-flavored Shoyu broth.  \n\nI could do without the pricey upsell of add-ons, but I still highly recommend them, especially the soft-boiled egg, corn, and seaweed.  You may end up spending nearly 10 bucks on ramen, but it's still a better choice than anything at Grand Lux"

So for our last meal in Vegas before heading back to LA, I wanted to come here!\n\nWe arrived at 11:40 AM on a Sunday, the place was full and there were 4 groups ahead of us. Monta opens at 11:30!! Insane. We waited about 35-40minutes before getting seated at the counter. \n\nFOOD: Ramen was yum as I remembered! Base price is pretty cheap $6.95 but when you add the egg, it brings it up to a regular bowl of ramen.  I had the tonkotsu ramen (my fave) Really rich and good flavor with a PERFECT soft boiled egg! Chasiu was also super tender and falling apart. HUGE portions!! I didn't finish my noodles :( \n\nVENUE: Small, as usual and single unisex bathroom.

It is a really small place, so keep that in mind, people were definitely waiting outside to get in.  But the food comes out fast, in fact, our dinner came out before our appetizer, which wasn't optimal but was OK.\n\nService was meh in my opinion which is why it was 4 stars instead of 5.  It was FREEZING in here, they have the fans on blast, way too cold for both of us.  But once they serve you the steaming goodness in a bowl it does warm up a bit, but not that much. Tip-move the fans to the kitchen to help the workers out but it was too cold for us.\n\nI ordered my Pork Ramen w/out mushrooms and they placed the wrong bowls in front of us, my dinner companion was about to take a bite and the waitress like snagged it out from under him to swap ours around.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing. It has to be at least 3 cups of liquid, plus noodles and some very small bits of pork.  Get yours with the hard boiled egg.

Pretty much everything in this plaza is amazing. But Monta is The. Best. Ramen. In. Vegas.\n\nI always get the half tonkatsu half shoyu ramen because I like a little more salt, and think the tonkatsu is just a tad too porky for me. I also get the thicker noodle because I like a little more chew. They offer various additional toppings here including green onion, butter (!), corn, nitamago, pickled mustard greens and the very very necessary extra order of chashu. Not necessary because the regular order comes with a stingy amount.. extra because you will never, ever have enough chashu.\n\nAt other ramen places I usually pick around the roasted pork, just not that into the flavor. But here, it melts away in your mouth. It's so tender it's hard to grab with your chopsticks sometimes because it'll just fall apart.\n\nThe kim chee fried rice here is solid, but nothing I'd go out of my way for.

During those three years i've had the opportunity to eat sushi, ramen, bento bowls, curries, udon, miso soups, and other foods of Japanese origins they way they make it and the way they eat it.\n\nThe ramen that is offered here is a step above instant ramen but is FAR from authentic. \n\nThe broths are noticeably lighter and less flavorful from authentic, the noodles are in the middle, they're close but dont have the right texture, sides such as meats are too fatty but seasoned better then authentic ramen.\n\nThe biggest difference is the price. Here a bowl of ramen runs from 6.25 to 7.something which isnt bad but it's the sides that get you back. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg? 1.50 for a spoon full of pickled mustard greens? 2.50 for extra noodles?\n\nBack in downtown Iwakuni a bowl of ramen, a side of goyza, and a plate of kimchi fried rice was only about 700ish yen back in 2006ish. Who would have figured five years later i'd pay double the cash to have a sixteenth a meal..."

S'I was really excited to try this place when my wife said she heard about a new ramen joint that serves Hakata tonkotsu ramen.\n\nThe restaurant is minimalist with very little seating and is located next door to Raku. We generally don\'t sweat the decor, or lack thereof, as long as the food is good.\n\nThey offer shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu ramen and several other items on their menu. We ordered the tonkotsu, of course, which was $7 for a small-medium sized bowl. They used the thin white classic tonkotsu ramen noodles which were decent but lacked the elasticity or chewy "freshness factor" of other places we\'ve tried. As my wife will attest to, I like my food salty and flavorful, but their broth was a bit too salty, even for me. It had an earthy shiitake mushroom flavor but was lacking in the porky flavor and richness of a good tonkotsu broth. Neither of us cared to slurp up any of the broth once we were done with the noodles. I found the two pieces of chashu were mediocre at best. They were somewhat tough and fatty and had this unusual ring of gelatin around the edges.\n\nThis place is arguably the best ramen place in Vegas that we have found so far. Unfortunately that also isn\'t saying very much. A mere year ago, both of us would probably have been more than satisfied with Monta. Damn you Ichiran for making ramen snobs out of us and forever raising our ramen bar! The search continues for better ramen in Vegas...'

They\'d have to if you wanted a fried egg, right?\n\nFood came- eggs were good, while they were luke-warm(they got cold very fast so I don\'t think they were too hot to begin with).  They were also runny, which I do not like, so I only ate a few bites.  They were a little runny for all of us.   Pancakes were yummy and so were the potatoes.  Everyone liked their food.  It was good.  Was it worth $100 for 5 people.......not so sure about that.  I\'m pretty sure we will not return for breakfast.  My husband would like to try their dinner though, so maybe we\'d go back for that.\n\nThe waitress also go quite snooty when we asked her to split the bill.  Prior to being seated I asked if it was okay to split the bill and we were told yes, so I didn\'t think it would be a problem.  I guess it was for the waitress.\n\nOverall I was not as pleased as I thought I\'d be.  \n\nWe eat at Egg Works a lot on Sunset and Eastern.  They have pretty big portions and they are cheaper, and very good.'

S"I went here with my GF for some breakfast on a slow monday morning. \n\nInterior: Clean, quaint, country/diner like feel.\n\nService: Our waitress was awesome. She was attentive, down to earth, and gave us great suggestions. \n\nFood: HUGE portions. I ordered the HH meatloaf House Hash. I was a great mix of meatloaf, potatoes, eggs, spinach, cheese, etc. I really enjoyed this dish. The meatloaf was well prepared and seasoned perfectly. The biscuits were creamy and fluffy. I couldn't finish the damn thing, so i spent the rest of the day and parts of the next morning eating it. The GF got the sage chicken, which was awesome as well. Juicy and moist. We also tried to share a blue berry walnut pancake, but failed miserably. We finished about 1/3 and gave up. It was very good though. \n\nOverall, it was a great dining experience. The prices were very reasonable, the service was great, and the food was good. I'll be back, but probably only once every 3 months. I don't think my body can handle all the stomach stretching calories. LOL."

S'I have tried both locations in Las Vegas, and to me the Sahara takes it. The strip on seems to be always full and the wait gets to be 30min. or more. If you are on the strip side of town and you want gargantuan meal portions than HHAGG is your place. I tried a few of their meal options like, Andy\'s Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower, which was pretty delicious but it is so huge that the same taste can get a little boring on the taste buds. I\'ve tried the Famous Meatloaf I was not that impressed, I guess you just have to love meatloaf. Indiana Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin, this half a pig steak is a delicious, many flavors that work together defiantly a must try. I also tried a dish with duck breast I don\'t recall the name of it but I was disappointed the flavors did not work for me. The best and ultimate favorite of mine(and Adam Richman Man v Food) is Andy\'s sage fried chicken benedict. The perfect juicy crispy fried chicken and is covered by this "chipotle crack cream" that I can eat a bucket of. Also all the other food groups are present like spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella and scrambled eggs, and a biscuit, all you need after this meal is a bed. Yes you will keep your cardiologist at his job but once in a while you have to experience a breakfast with a twist and HHAGG is the place for that.'

Finally we were seated and ordered the chicken and waffles and Andy's Benedict. I really loved the chicken and waffles, the Benedict was good but not as great as I would've liked. My favorite was the biscuit and the mashed potatoes but I wasn't too crazy about the sauce that was all over it (a little spicy). Presentation and portions are definitely impressive. I was happy to take huge leftovers for later in the day. Overall I think I would come back if I come to vegas with friends that haven't been here before.  Decently priced for vegas as well."

I\'ve seen it on Food TV, I heard about the "twisted farm food," I was alll read to fall in love with it and tell all my friends "I found this great place!"\n\nDidn\'t happen. \n\nI went there for breakfast with a colleague. We were seated side-by-side facing a giant TV set playing Food TV scenes I had seen already. I ordered a ham-spinach-and-cheese scramble with crispy fried potatoes.\n\nThe scramble was mediocre, the "crispy" potatoes had a hard shell, and the biscuit was dry and had some kind of herb sprig incongruously shoved in it.\n\nIt wasn\'t bad, really, it just wasn\'t very good. The biggest disappointment was the next day, when I was short on time and grabbed myself a McDonald\'s biscuit sandwich. The McDonald\'s biscuit was moist, fluffy and tasty -- more so than the one I had had for a higher price the day before.\n\nDisappointing.'

I witnessed one couple grow very unhappy with the waitress over this fact.\n\nAt the very least I can recommend it because of how amazing the overall experience is.

S"MOTHER. OF. GOD. THE PORTIONS HERE ARE FREAKING MONSTROUS. \n\nThe prices here are very fair for the amount of food you're getting. The food itself is a three to four stars at most. But be prepared to get full and have a whole bunch of extra food to take bring back to your jealous siblings. \n\nAlthough the food is three-four stars, what really makes this place a five star is the staff. Immediately as I walked in with my brother, and friend we were greeted with a genuine good afternoon. The staff is very lively, bright, and great. Their customer service was unbelievable, one of the best I had ever seen. The table next to us were a couple of kids complaining about their waffle, one of the girls said it tasted funny and would like the waffle to be free. Without any hesitation the waiter immediately offered her new waffle and for it to . Now that's some good customer service right there. The waiter that served us was also no exception. From the time that we ordered he was very polite and humble. We had trouble deciding what drinks we wanted to get and he gave his own personal opinion on which tasted better. And every time we needed a refill he was very prompt about refilling. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is very chill, and the parking was very easy. If I had the time to sit down and eat I would go back to this place for sure."

S"This review update is not for the actual restaurant, but for their Thanksgiving Dinner To-Go.\n\nThanksgiving was held at my house this year.  Instead of spending X amount of hours preparing, cooking, and stressing, I chose to order my turkey from Hash House.  The food here is good so picking the Hash House was a no brainer. \n\nHash House Thanksgiving Dinner (To-Go):  Cost $98.99.  \n-Deep Fried Turkey (8-10 lb):  My first deep fried turkey.  Initially thought it was small since I'm use to a 15+ pounder for Thanksgiving.  When it came down to it, it was enough to feed 9.  Turkey was good and surprisingly juicy.  Only issue, no leftovers.\n\n-Garlic Mashed Potatoes (32 oz):  Real stuff, non of that powder Idaho Spuds that you get in the box.  \n\n-Pumpkin Mashed Potatoes (32 oz):  Tested by most of us, but we didn't enjoy it as much as the Garlic Mashed Potatoes. My opinion, pumpkin dosen't mix well with traditional mashed potatoes. \n\n-Cornmeal Stuffing (40 oz):  My favorite during Thanksgiving has always been the stuffing.  Throw some gravy on it and it's perfect.  Huge servings. \n\n-Fresh Creamed Corn (16 oz):  So good and wish this was bigger.  Family killed it on the first round. \n\n-Buttermilk Biscuits:  6 huge pcs and I mean huge.  Biscuits on Steroids!!  \n\n-Snickers or Pumpkin Pie (6 pcs):  I chose the Snickers, which was a mistake.  Don't get me wrong, it was sweet and delish.  But pumpkin pie shouldn't be replaced during Thanksgiving.  My bad and ended up going to Smiths to get one.  \n\nOther trimmings that I didn't include was their baby carrots, cranberry sauce, strawberry jam, and gravy.  \n\nObviously, there's some prep and cook time needed on Thanksgiving day.  Along with the meal comes detailed instructions.  When I say detailed, I mean detailed to the time it takes and what you should cook in order.  If I can follow the instructions, anybody can. \n\nNothing beats a home cooked meal and I know this.  This year I wanted a stress free Thanksgiving.  You get a lot for $98.99, but most importantly you will be able to spend more time relaxing with family over cooking all night. \n\nOverall, I give Hash House 5 stars for making me look like the Master Chef this Thanksgiving Day."

Many doggie bags were assembled last night. \n\nChicken n waffles are excellent! (Chicken is bone in). The waffles have big pieces of bacon inside!\n\nThe fu fu looking Kiwi watermelon lemonade is delicious. (I went with the adult version -a shot of vodka)\n\nRound the table there was meatloaf pasta - delicious...the hammered pork loin - Amazing!....the stuffed meatloaf -awesome!...and finally the breakfast crab cakes ...best crab cakes I've tasted!  \n\nAfter our order was taken a plate of huge glazed biscuits arrived with a delicious peach preserve and honey butter.  \n\nI'm here for a couple more days, I be back for breakfast later and then await my next trip to start working my way thru the balance of the menu. \n\nGreat service, delicious food, priced right, huge portions...do it!"

S"This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. Their choices are so fun and flavorful. I like their chicken and waffles! The waffle they have with this meal has bacon in it. Everybody knows that waffles and bacon has got to be the most amazing combination ever haha! The waffles were fluffy and moist. Their chicken was fried but not greasy. It was tender on the inside and it goes great with the whole meal. Definitely a sweet & savory meal for sure!\n\nThey don't take reservations during the weekends so there is typically a 10-20 min wait around breakfast time which is not bad at all. It's definitely worth the short wait. The servers get pretty busy so you might not get your drink refill instantaneously. Parking is also a pain sometimes. I suggest one person to get out of the car and put your name on the list while somebody finds parking ;)\n\nOh their watermelon lemonade is pretty good but I don't think it's worth the $5 honestly. It's not refillable and there's more lemonade taste than watermelon so just a heads up."

S'yup, like most people who reviewed this place, we also came here because of man vs. food.  we enjoyed this place so much, we came 2 mornings in a row last week.\n\nmorning 1 - got here a little before 8am. didnt have to wait, got seated right away.  our waitress was cindy, super pleasant and nice.  i ordered one of the house favorite scrambles with roasted chicken, corn, roasted peppers, and mozzarella cheese. it also came with a biscuit, fruit (which was melon and pineapple), and your choice of griddled mashed potatoes or crispy potatoes (i got the griddled mashed potatoes).  my wife ordered the tractor driver combo with 2 eggs, bacon (extra crispy), and the vanilla waffle.  we both enjoyed our meals and really wanted to try other dishes which is why we came back for.....\n\n....morning 2 - got here a little later today. around 830.  and boy what a difference that made. it was a lot more crowded and we had to wait 10 minutes to get seated.  altho nothing compared to the hours that some other yelpers had to wait!  today i ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles.  this thing was HUGE.  my wife ordered 2 breakfasts today because she could not make up her mind and it was our last day in vegas so we were not gonna be back here for a while.  she got the farm scramble with hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, and onions (it came with swiss cheese but she ordered it without).  AND she also ordered the granola waffle.  that did not stop her from eating part of my breakfast.  she was gonna order the bacon waffle but since she saw my breakfast came with it, she decided to do the granola waffle and just help herself to my bacon waffle.  fed wife = happy wife.\n\neverything we had at hashouse was good. the portions were huge tho so you gotta come hungry.  we ended up taking home part of her granola waffle which she did eat later on in the day.  yes, according to her, it still tastes good hours later.'

S"It was nice to get away from the bustle of the Vegas strip to come try Hash House a Go Go for brunch. The wait took around an hour for the 5 of us since it was pretty darn busy on a Saturday afternoon. We just sat around and admired all the autographed menus lining the entry way. Their menu had an incredible selection too! I think I would have had trouble deciding if my friend Marti L. hadn't already suggested a dish that sounded delish.\n\nAndy's sage fried chicken meal ($13.95 and $2.50 extra to split the dish) - OMG!! The portions were humongous! No wonder HH was featured on Man vs. Food before. haha The prices are totally worth it if you share the dish with one or 2 other people. My faves were the bacon mashed potatoes and fresh baked biscuit. The chicken didn't taste of sage at all to me and a was a little dry...there wasn't enough maple reduction but was fried to perfection! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=rOcMiMAsg_K3yC-aOPggPA)\n\nI sampled the kiwi/watermelon lemonade (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=AvvDoT4CdKsnfcCSUuy5vg) which looked pretty and was really tart just the way I like it. I also tried the bacon waffles which were to die for! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=AvvDoT4CdKsnfcCSUuy5vg) The batter was soft/chewy and the bacon complimented it very well.

S"Let me preface this review by saying, I've been to both this hash house and the one at Imperial Palace and this by far is a shitton better in terms of wait time, service, and dare I say even the food. \n\nI had a large group of famished, sunday-after-vegas-weekend-exhausted friends. All of them more than ready to show hash's infamously large plates what was up. Okay well maybe that could've just been my thoughts, really.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have an eating partner willing to partake in my fatty adventure. The original request of a not so detrimental eggs benedict had been replaced by the andy's sage fried chicken benedict and a chorizo hash. Mind you, two very gargantuan orders. What a good sport, I almost kind of felt bad. Almost. \n\nEveryone got a variety of things which was of course, more food than anyone should ever force to digest in one sitting. We really enjoyed the sage fried chicken and chorizo orders --and were also the only two who finished all of our food. \n\nSide note, the fried chicken in and of itself was a bit dry. Luckily there was enough fat off the bacon, and the fried cheese to keep it moist. LOL. \n\nMy friend got the kiwi watermelon drink thing which she seemed to have liked. No one else bothered with drinks. \n\nBellies full, albeit painfully. Back on the road for a very long comatose drive home."

S'Adam Richman you are an idiot for recommending this place.\n\nI went in with high hopes as I like places with big portions and creative food. We were seated right away on a Friday night, but then sat for the next 20 minutes watching servers walk by when someone finally noticed us. I could tell the server knew we had been waiting a while when she noticed that we didn\'t even have water. She asked if we wanted to just order as no one had bothered to see if we wanted drinks. I ordered a coke and the chicken and waffles. After another 10 minutes we finally got our drinks. Another 5 minutes later they brought us biscuits which were big and looked good, but ended up being dry and kind of tasteless. They did bring the equivalent of about 1 pat of butter and a tiny bit of honey (imagine a McDonald\'s honey "spread" container). It just wasn\'t enough for four adults. Then after another pretty decent wait (our server came and reassured us twice that our food was coming up), the food came. I have to say that everyone\'s entree looked awesome. After we took photos, something I have never done at a restaurant, we dug in.....\n\nMy first bite made me gag a little bit. Imagine as a kid experimenting with the food in the door of the refrigerator: maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic powder, green onion? No matter how you combine these things they are not going to mesh well on a waffle with bacon. Ok, I understand the spin on chicken and waffles, but when this is your signature dish and it tastes like shit-something is wrong. The waffles were inedible-thick and doughy. The bacon was limp. The chicken was cold and dry. I basically just picked at the deep fried green onions and spaghetti noodles and took the 1/4" thick breading off of the chicken and had some protein. \n\nThe other diners in our party didn\'t like their dish either; the pork cutlets. The bastards at HH even charged them $2.50 for splitting a meal that could have fed eight people. Needless to say, we didn\'t take any leftovers home.\n\nOne last warning for good measure: if you are sensitive to MSG, don\'t order the waffles. The soy sauce in the dish contains MSG. I get a huge headache when I have even little bit and this must have had lots. \n\nI was totally disappointed with the whole experience. I would like to go back and try breakfast, but it was so bad I just can\'t stomach it.'

S"I actually like it here, but I'm not going crazy on the stars because I agree with the gist of some other reviews: the food is big, and the menu is interesting, but the food just doesn't taste as good as it sounds. There is always a long list of ingredients in the description, and while you are promised what sounds like an orgy of chipotle cream, smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, basil pesto, and other tastebud stimulators that sound great on paper, what you get seems a little more like a pile of somewhat dry mashed potatoes, tasting more like the paper than what you imagined. There are dishes I enjoy- the sage fried chicken is consistently good, though the waffles are not crispy and deteriorate too fast, and, number one complaint, the huge portion is accompanied by a thimble-sized pitcher of syrup. What the hell? Same for those hubcap-sized pancakes(which come in various flavor combos but with very little flavor, and with insufficient syrup to wet them down, it's like trying to eat a blanket). And how about those giant biscuits they serve before dinner? I'm a fan, but they went from supplying one Barbie-sized pitcher of honey to the whole table, to skipping that entirely and just drizzling on a little (very little) before serving them. For a place that's so generous with the portions, and that must plow through a field of rosemary daily, garnishing even the plates that have nothing to do with said herb, why are they so reluctant to part with the condiments? Maybe they could save a couple of bucks by ditching their other inexplicable practice of adding what can only be described as french-fried broom straws to all their dishes. You spend the first few minutes just picking weeds from your plate.  The meatloaf is quite good, as is the grilled cheese, and Baby girl loves the salmon. The side vegetables are usually well cooked and seasoned. I've never tried dessert, because I can't fathom ever getting that far, and I've been tempted to try  one of those giant burgers, but never do because I know I can't finish it and re-heated burgers are just not good. Strangely, though, the leftovers we do bring home (which is always), seem to taste better than the original did. Who can explain it? But the HH brown bags are always seized upon by the family vultures with midnight munchies. Yes, I'll keep coming here to dine, but I will never again make the mistake of ordering the Thanksgiving dinner to go. The fried turkey was ok, the veggies were raw, the dressing was dry and flavored only with salt, the portions of potatoes were shockingly small- less than they serve on a single dinner in the restaurant, and the Snickers bread pudding dessert wound up in the trash. Unprecedented. Oh, and the number one reason I will keep coming back? You can almost always get your hands on a half off coupon. Then it's REALLY a bargain!"

S"my boyfriend ordered some bbq ribs and everyone at the table were drooling over it. unfortunately he didnt share it with anyone else cuz he felt that if he did let someone try it then he'll have to let everyone else try it. there were about 4 ribs and some cole slaw. the ribs was literally falling off the bones when you eat it. it was pretty damn good! and we each ordered the pancake tractor combo i think. its literally a big ass pancake that covers the whole plate (btw the plate is really really really big) and it comes with maybe 2 eggs and your choice of sausage, bacon, or potatoes. i could barely finish the pancake. i only had maybe 1/6 of it. i should've just shared with my boyfriend. haha"

S"We went here on a Saturday at 11:15am. Was told it would be 45 minutes to an hour wait. That hurt but there were 5 of us and only 2 of us were there so we didn't mind getting a head start before they arrived. They called us after 45 minutes. \n\nThe novelty wore off when the food didn't deliver. Extra large portions of mediocre food. \n\n*Chicken Salad Sandwich - 3 inch bread with a huge scoop of chicken salad (average) and two huge tomato slices and 2 strips of bacon with a knife and 2 huge sprigs of rosemary sticking out.  It would have been about 7 inches thick if I ate it like a regular sandwich.  The side salad that came with it (or you can get fries) had a really good dressing and after adding salt it was pretty good. \n\nWe had people visiting from out of town and thought they would like it because it was on Man vs. Food. But besides oversized portions this place is all hype. The staff is dressed in tin foil and have tin colored paint on some of their faces. That didn't make any sense to me but someone at the table thought maybe because the place had a lot of metal and tin in the decor? \n\nI probably won't return and will NEVER wait 45 minutes (or any time at all) to be seated there."

S"This was the location I first experienced Hash House after watching Man vs. Food.  Very happy I came. The food is basically on steroids. A plate can feed at least 2 adults. The food is super sized but it doesn't lose it's quality. Amazingly delicious!!! \n\nThis last time that I was there. I ordered the chorizo hash and griddled French toast with a refreshing kiwi watermelon lemonade. \n\nWhat I've had:\nAndy's sage fried chicken benedict-I've had it several times and I could only eat 1/4 of the dish. It was certainly delicious. The chipotle cream made the dish even more special. \nFried chicken and waffles-it's a tower of chicken on top of a bed of waffles. \nchicken pot pie-ginormous like all the other plates. It's a deconstructed pot pie. \ncorned beef hash (my bf's favorite!!) \ncaramelized banana pancakes-this is heaven!!! It's the size of a large pizza so be prepare to share with 3 other ppl. \nAndy's famous bread pudding-very rich, chocolaty, fluffy and lovely!!! \n\nWon't disappoint!!! You will never walk away hungry. To top it off, every person in your party will walk out with left-overs/an actual meal."

S"I have never heard of this place before and this was definitely an unexpected, but pleasant, surprise during our Vegas trip.  One of my cousins had talked us into trying out Hash House because she saw a feature of it on one of Rachel Ray's shows on Food Network.  Never ones to pass up an opportunity to try something new, my husband and I went with our group of 9.  \n\nRight off the bat, I knew we were going to experience something special when I saw the huge portions the servers were carrying out.  Think of the silver trays at Chipotle and imagine that it was turned into an oval shape and made of china instead of aluminum.  That's how big these were.  Our lunch companions were smart and decided to share betweens the couples but wanting to try different things, my husband and I decided to order separately.  I had the sage fried chicken eggs benedict which was the size of my entire head and my husband ordered their famous chicken and waffles.  \n\nAlthough the portions were huge, my eggs were cooked perfectly so I was assured that quality was not overlooked for quantity.  My husband's bacon waffles were amazing.  And when I say bacon waffles, I mean bacon that is inside the waffles which has got to win some sort of award for just existing!\n\nI'm allergic to watermelon so I wasn't able to try the watermelon lemonades but everyone raved about theirs!  If I had remembered to bring along my EpiPen I would sipped some but I instead enjoyed a wonderful  pineapple champagne spritzer that was sweetly refreshing after our morning hiking around Hoover Dam in the desert heat.\n\nHash House is just the place to go when you're in the mood for a good and satisfying meal.  Just be ready for the cravings to set in once you leave Las Vegas like I've been having!"

S'3-18-09 around noon, my wife\'s birthday, she loves corned beef hash, I found your restaurant on restaurant.com and thought this would be perfect.\n\nWe went to the Las Vegas restaurant, and needless to say we were very  disappointed.\n\nMy food was cold\nMy mother asked for coffee, she was delivered coffee and creamer, no spoon\nI asked for butter for my wife and I, as the ran by she  waitress dropped a cup of butter that was almost empty, barely enough for a  1/2  of a biscuit.\n\nThen to top it off I had bought a coupon from Resraurant.com,  I failed to notice that that coupon said "Dinner" on it, the waitress said that she could not accept it.  She said that there was a different coupon for Breakfast and that I should have used that one.  I asked to talk to the manager, I explained the situation to the manager, she said sorry she could not honor the coupon that "we lose money on those anyway"  I found her response to be disturbing, you do not issue coupons to make money, you do it to draw new customers to your establishment.  Although the coupon error was my fault, I thought that maybe she would see fit to offer me some sort of discount, offer me the discount of the "Breakfast" coupon or something, you know the old "the customer is always right" adage, I have been to dozens of restaurants where they have taken expired coupons, etc, because they want to make the customer happy.  Apparently this manager did not see the need to make the customer feel better, just to make a buck.    I know that this customer will not be back and I will not recommend this place to anyone else either.'

S"Harsh. This is the best word we could come up with to describe Hash House. Just call it Harsh House.\n\nWe wandered here while waiting for our car to be serviced at AutoNation. 11am on a Saturday there was a line out the door. It smelled promising. We were seated in less than 10 and our waiter appeared in under a minute. Coffee and waters were back in less than 2 minutes. They place was packed so the service really is excellent. The food, eh. \n\nThe music is loud, and harsh and abrasive. The d\xc3\xa9cor is harsh; I get they're going for a certain look, but it's not very comfortable. The food is, well, harsh. The spices just a tad more than the tastebuds are comfortable with. It was weird. I wanted to say I liked my giant heaping portions of salmon eggs benedict with weird plastic cheese sauce, but I couldn't. They were too... harsh. \n\nIf I were a tourist completely hungover from a night of debauchery on the strip and my tastebuds were fried from cigarettes I might like this place.

S'I agree with the reviews that think this place is totally overrated. Having seen the San Diego version on the Food Network and hearing rave reviews from friends, I decided to finally give Hash House A-Go-Go on Sahara a try to have breakfast with my sister and her two little boys. If you are looking for a brunch place on Saturday where you can actually hear the person sitting next to you, not the place to go. \n\nFirst, being 10:30am on a Saturday, there was a 30 minute wait for first available (inside or outside). There\'s minimal spots to sit inside so we had to wait out in the chill. When finally seated inside, a DJ was blasting Lady Gaga so loud, I couldn\'t hear what my five year old nephew sitting right next to me wanted to order. This "club-esque" music lasted most of the breakfast and was a very irritating. Maybe I missed the "Saturday Brunch Party" memo.\n\nI split a decent $8.50 Bloody Mary with my sister that came with a green bean, stuffed olive, and sweet pickle. I ordered what I thought was the "Warsaw Hash" which was a Brunch special they had for $10.95. After waiting 25 minutes for our food, the portion was pretty sizeable and I ended up taking half of it home. The quality, however, was a little bland. There were big chunks of ground Turkey and pieces of bacon and melted cheese on potatoes. Nothing amazing. I did try my nephew\'s cinnamon french toast and that was pretty yummy.\n\nOverall I found the place a mix of hipsters, hipster wannabes, and trendy yuppies looking for a place "cool" to eat at. The wait was long to sit, get our food, and get boxes and have the check paid. It took us an hour and fifty minutes to eat and get out. Definitely not a place for a relaxing breakfast.'

It was a Friday around 11am so the restaurant was mostly full.  Even though the food was amazing (as usual) me and my friend visiting were mostly ignored.  We waited about 15 minutes to order and about 20 minutes to get our check, and another 10 to pay.  It wouldn't have been so bad but the waiter visited other tables in the area several times before coming to us.\n\nWith that being said, the food was great.

S"So you want breakfast do you? This contemporary southern cuisine is, hoe do you say, IN-CRED-IBLE.  It's mostly a breakfast spot but the lunch is worth it as well. Whenever I have people in town this place is on the to-do list. Be ready to share or for leftovers because the portions are Gi-normous. It's comfort food at it's best. They serve my absolute fav dish in this town, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Not your typical breakfast selection I know.  It's a piece of fried chicken on top of scrambled eggs and spinach on top of mashed potatoes and bacon on top of a huge biscuit cover with a chipotle cream sauce that is nothing short of heaven. The flapjack is the next on my list. Yeah that's singular. That's because it's pretty much the size of a medium pizza. The coffee is very strong which I like but I know I'm in the minority on that one.  \n\nThe staff is very nice but you have to remember that great food takes time so if you are in a hurry you might want to try somewhere else. Expect about a 10 - 30 minute wait here on the weekends but you golden on the weekdays. For the weekend warriors why not try the Beer-In-a-Bag special they have while you wait. It's a Bud tall can in a brown paper bag. A Nevada Classic!"

I also ordered the Kiwi watermelon lemonade, it tasted very out of season.  The kiwi was sour the watermelon wasn\'t sweet at all, I guess it was refreshing in the way of lemon in water but I don\'t think it was worth the price.  \nIt wasn\'t all bad though, my girlfriend got the Sage Chicken that was pretty tasty and large portions, and the food tasted pretty fresh.

S'Go to Hash House a Go Go if you crave enormous piles of low quality, deep-fried  ingredients served on huge plates.  The presentation of the food is ridiculous.  I believe the goal is to stack the food as high as possible and add a very large rosemary tree (not sprig, but tree) to the top for maximum height.  I saw many dishes being served to others.  If the entree didn\'t have a rosemary tree sticking out of the top, then it had a steak knife standing straight up from whatever it was stabbing.  Each entree measures about 8"-11" high.  I can\'t even begin to imagine what the calorie count is per dish.  Restaurants like this help me understand why we have an obesity problem in this country.\n\nWe ordered the salmon and chicken penne entrees.  The food was completely flavorless.  My salmon was served over a massive glob of potatoes (and adorned with a rosemary tree).  My husband\'s chicken was stacked on a skewer sticking into a half apple (and topped with a rosemary tree).  Our sodas had no bubbles.  They were like watery syrup.  We switched to water, which we have never done before.  The sodas were really that bad.\n\nThe music selection was odd and quite annoying - a slow, sad song, followed by a few head-banger tunes, back to slow, sad, then punk, and then a latin rhythm.  Just weird.\n\nService was fast but unfriendly.\n\n$66 for two disgusting dinners. \n\nWe picked this place because of all the great reviews on yelp.  What a disappointment!

Table next to mine was an Asian family talking a blue streak in their native tongue - until the food arrived, they went silent, and the elderly mom just said, "wow." That sums it up. Almost comically large portions of delicious, decadent southern breakfast and lunch ("twisted farm" as they call it) comfort food.  Hand-squeezed-to-order juices (tangerine is the bomb). Meatloaf to die for. And the fried chicken...whoa. In fact, the best bite of food I\'ve ever eaten may have been the following: at the end of trying (and failing) to finish my chicken and waffles, I scraped up from the plate bits of the sage buttermilk breading from the chicken, waffle scraps, and bacon shreds - all of which were sitting in a pool of maple syrup.

Nothing bad about 5 cent Stellas (okay they were 6 ounce cups but still) and $5 stuffed burgers (these were the same pound burgers that normally go for $12.95).\n\nStaff seemed to handle the pressure of MANY people swarming in all at once to be part of the celebration. And owner Jim was there to light the candles on the celebratory cake. Good vibes all around.'

S"First...know there are/were 3 locations. Not familiar with Vegas, we ended up at the M Hotel specifically to eat at the Hash House...of course it had closed 2 days prior...you'd think they'd update their website. So, we drive back 20 minutes to arrive at the one on the strip. Greeted (if you can call it that) by a young man, a host, who looked miserable to be there. Slumped over in a stool at the host stand. Not very welcoming and took our name. \n\nWe were seated after a 30 minute wait. Service was rather slow. My husband ordered the sage chicken Benedict which he said was ok. The potatoes on it were amazing. I ordered a bacon waffle which was a sad sad waffle indeed. Not very flavorful...compare to something you'd get at Denny's or norms. :-/ \n\nPortions are enormous. I'd rather have a smaller portion if higher quality food. Won't be back."

S"Having seen the restaurant on MVF, I knew I had to make it a stop if I ever got to Vegas.  I spent the last week there for a family gathering, and kept trying to find some time to break away to get there.  I told my wife that we WOULD be going on our way out of town.  We got there at about 10 am on a Thursday.  We walked right in and there was no wait to be seated.  The ambiance is cool, and everything seems like it was well thought out.  It was clean, and the staff was very friendly.\n\nI ordered the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict.  All I can really say is, do it.  Eat this magnificent blend of flavors and textures.  Come hungry, it's a beast... but you will leave with a smile.  The fried chicken is juicy, firm, and the breading is light and subtle.  The hint of sage really adds a lot.  It might be the best fried chicken I've ever eaten... but that's a tough call.  The griddle mashed potatoes are excellent.  They get the texture perfect, and they are just the right amount of salt.  The chipotle sauce on the top is great also.\n\nMy wife had the meatloaf and eggs breakfast.  The meatloaf was delicious.  It was not mushy or runny or falling apart.  It was a firm patty, neatly grilled to a delicious brown crust.  Served with the griddle mashed potatoes, she really enjoyed it.  (And I enjoyed the leftovers.)\n\nWhat really speaks to the level of service at this place is the experience my mother in law had.  She has celiac, and cannot eat any gluten.  She made her allergy known to our waiter, who took the time to double-check with the chef about what dishes had flour.  She settled on a scramble that had asparagus, pot roast, cheese, tomato, and obviously, egg.  She remarked that the vegetables were very fresh and everything was cooked to perfection.\n\nOther recommendation:  Get a S'Mores Mocha.  Wow.\n\nOverall - it was worth the wait.  And given that I paid with my craps winnings, it was the right price.  Stop by if you're in Vegas, San Diego, Chicago, or anywhere else they open one of these.  It's worth the time."

S"This was the only highlight of my stay in the hotel. On our last day we wanted to go out with a heavy breakfast before the long drive back to Los Angeles. \n\nOur wait was about 35 minutes but totally worth it.  Food portions are GIGANTIC! In order to really enjoy your food, you need a appetite.  The slogan does not lie in terms of a twist on farm food. The inside as well is very well set up in terms of feeling like you are in a upscale diner with farm twist to it.  This may have been the best breakfast experiance I have ever had, especially for the right price.\n\nMy girlfriend for starters got a S'Mores mocha that looked like a Frankenstein creation of a drink. Marshmallow was melted on top with chocolate and graham cracker mixed in it. The drink was huge and we did not want to touch it since it looked too good to drink. We started to actually sip it with a spoon like soup because of the sheer size and an inch deep layer of marshmallow on top. I highly, highly recommend the drink.\n\nIn terms of what I ate, I got the french toast which came with 3 giant slices of french toast, scrambled eggs, half a fried banana and two big strawberries. I could not finish my meal because I was so full.  No exaggerations here on size of food. \n\nWhenever a server walked by with someones food, people at other tables would be staring at the mere size and display of the food. When I was walking out, I saw some giant sandwich or sorts with a even larger knife sticking in the  middle of it. The displays of food sets this place apart from any other breakfast joint.\n\nI can't wait to come back here."

I had the chicken and waffles and yowza it was a tower of food. I have to say the waffles were good but you can tell that it was a bit on the heavy side making the waffles thick and slightly dry instead of light and airy. The chicken was delicious and crispy and not at all dry. Combined with the hot syrup it was yummy! \nThe bf had the fried chicken benedict which was also huge. The chipotle sauce drizzled on top gave it a nice little kick. \nWe thought we were going to some hole in the wall breakfast joint but turned out to be pretty nice. They had a whole menu specifically for their unique drinks in addition to their regular menu and a separate menu for specials of the day. My chicken and waffles were $18.95 but it's great bang for your buck if you wanna try it on a Friday when it's a special price of $12.95. Good price for lots of food."

S"Hash House a Go Go is not just a restaurant...  It's an experience!!  I was a Dealertainer at the Imperial Palace and we were asked to go to the Sahara location to promote them opening their new location at our casino.  The manager bought us breakfast after the photo shoot and I ordered my usual egg white omelette and saw all these amazing dishes go by our table.  I'm a foodie to the max and was very intrigued with these masterpieces being placed before other people...  I enjoyed my omelette but left feeling there was way more to experience..  Well as fate would have it, Hash House A Go Go was being featured on the food network that night when I went home.  They had this fried chicken/egg benedict  thing that I just HAD to try!  Well once they opened at the IP a bunch of us went in and did try it!  DEE to the LISH!!  BUT huge!!!  I'm an all day grazer so this baby would last me about a day...  If you like small portions, I suggest you split a dish with someone (although there is a fee for this), it might be worth it.

I really enjoyed this dish on every level.  The maple reduction was nice in that you got some sweetness in the dish but the waffles were still able to stay crispy by not being drenched in it.  In addition, the waffles are stuffed with bacon, how can you go wrong with that?!?!  The sage fried chicken had a crispy crust but was moist and tender inside and had very little fat and the fried leeks rounded out the dish nicely.\n\nMy wife had one of the scrambles with egg whites avocado and bacon and it was nice to see that a place that is known for unique dishes can execute something simple just as well.  The avocado was fresh and the bacon seemed to be at that perfect in-between state in that it was crispy yet had some chewy texture; not overly well-done that it looks burnt or under cooked and gummy.  The biscuit had a nice crumbly outer texture and the inside was fluffy and moist.\n\nWe'll definitely be coming back upon our next return to Vegas."

S'When you are in Vegas, you want to do things BIG.  Drink hard.  Play hard.  and of course, eat hard... but who really wants to eat hard \'everytime\' that they need to spend $40+ on a Vegas buffet?  Fear not- the locals know the best, and thank goodness for my awesome Vegas friends for taking Jaymie Lynn S. and I out for some good eats, because Hash House A Go Go is definitely a spot to remember.\n\nFirst of, this place was packed when we arrived during lunch hours on a Saturday.  Our wait was about half an hour, which is honestly not that bad if there is a delicious meal at the end of the rainbow.  So be prepared to wait a little.  In the meantime, I highly recommend looking over their menu because it is LONG and full of many options that are going to tease your every cravings.  From breakfast foods to a calamari steak, use your time wisely to choose.\n\nAmbience?  This joint was blasting remixes of Top 40 hits- I LIKE!  It made me wish I had that iPhone application that helps identify tunes you may be unfamiliar with.  We were seated on the right side of the restaurant which made for more room, but less air conditioning because the fans weren\'t blowing our way.\n\nOnto the menu!  I had a really hard time deciding what I actually wanted to eat here because there were so many.  I was looking favorably at the Chicken & Waffles options, when my friends recommended I try the "Andy\'s Sage Fried Chicken" because it had my name on it.  I figured- why not, and selected that for my lunch date.  I also ordered a lemonade, and was pleased to hear that drinks were bottomless here.  However, the lemonade proved to be a bit too sour, so maybe an iced tea would have been more appropriate.\n\nAfter waiting for what seemed forever (around thirty minutes... quite a bit of a wait IMO), our food came out.  Mine came out last, but what I saw on my friends\' plates was shocking.\n\nPORTIONS DO NOT LIE.  THEY ARE HUGE.\n\nMy Fried Chicken meal came with mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, medley of tomatoes and a side of fresh fruit.  It was big eats here.  The presentation of it was wonderful as well, and upon first glance, I knew I was going to have trouble finishing all of this food.  The chicken breast piece was juicy, and did not feel overwhelming being fried.  Everything on my plate was honestly very tasty... but to nobody\'s surprise, I could not finish this giant meal.  Check out the size of this plate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?action_user_photos=1\n\nIf you are a light eater, sharing one dish can be your life saver!\n\nJaymie Lynn S. let me have a taste of her calamari steak, and it was hella good!  It was an interesting take on the traditional calamari style meats, but I very much enjoyed it along with the condiments that came with it.\n\nThis was such a great eating experience, and I highly recommend it for any Vegas local or traveler wanting a great meal that is guaranteed to get you full.  Parking is available in a small lot outside of the restaurant, with more on the street once it gets packed.\n\nWith that... I\'ve completed the Las Vegas episode of Man v Food!'

Everything here was massive so I got a tad bit intimidated with the food. I decided to order the Crispy Cornmeal Salmon Sandwich (the healthiest food I can find in the menu) and was quite disappointed with it. The texture was weird. I felt like I was eating tiny rocks with my fish. It was just bad. I also tried my friend's meal which was the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower (most popular one!) and nothing too special about it. Overall, I wasn't satisfied with the meal.

The waitress was very nice took the order for our drinks. Mark and I have a fun thing we do..we each pick a drink for the other, not telling each other what the other will be drinking (generally an alcoholic beverage).  It just makes it fun!  Anyway, we also each had a biscuit with a honey butter glaze on it w/ sides of home made butter and strawberry jam. Very good.  \n\nWe then ordered our dinner.  Mark ordered the Blackened Chicken and I had the Chicken Pot Pie.  When the food came...OMG!! talk about a BIG portion!! My Chicken Pot Pie...it was enough to where it could feed me for 3-4 days...lol.  Marks dinner came and it was a good portion as well.  The only thing I didn't care for was that the crust was bland, had no real taste (otherwise it was great!!).  I tasted Mark's food and it was very good.  I ended up having the waitress box my left overs up (it took 2 box's)and Marks as well. \n\nThe check was about $63.00..(Oh and we also bought the glass's we drank out of that have the logo on them) not bad for the portions as I rather leave full and with doggy bags then still be hungry. All in all Id give it 4 stars. The service was great, the place was clean and everyone was nice and courteous which is always a plus!!\n\nWould I go back? yes...would I recommend it? yes.\n\nI enjoyed my experience there and you will to :)"

S"I had high expectations hence a one star rather than two. Our 25 minute wait did not effect my low rating. We should all expect a wait for breakfast on the weekend.\nI had the meatloaf, egg and potatoes meal.  The meatloaf was so dry I almost dosed it with ketchup and I hate ketchup. \nSome times it's the little things that set you off.  Biscuits.  We had a choice of rye or wheat bread a biscuit.  Being a die hard sourdough guy I took the biscuit.  Our server did not bring butter, jam or honey and did not ask if we would like any.  My brain usually kicks in about the time a server has just left, but on this occasion I asked after not being offered anything.  Butter and jam where brought back to the table.  No choice of what kind of jam I would prefer.  No mention of honey maybe being available.\nMy requested over medium eggs were of course over easy - nobody gets that right.  The potatoes not very memorable.\n\nSo high expectations added to by the crowd of people waiting for a table and a plate with awful meatloaf add up to a ONE STAR I don't know how anybody could call this amazing and I am not inclined to give them a second chance.

S"I love Hash House A Go Go.  LOVE IT.  But I can't give it 5 stars.  They have a great menu and super yummy specials, but you can't make any changes to what you order.  For example, I don't always want half a plate of potatoes with my breakfast but if you ask for fruit instead, even for an up charge, they won't change it.  They'll give you less food for the same price, but for an additional cost they still won't alter the dish.  Same with lunch and dinner.  It drives me crazy.  My husband and I still take out of town guests here and we think the food is very flavorful and well made, but we rarely go on our own anymore because as much as I can appreciate potatoes (originally a midwestern girl) every dinner and breakfast doesn't need 2-3 pounds of them fried or mashed to make a complete meal."

The service staff all looked like they came out of punk rock band or belong in West Hollyweird. Guess the freakier you are, the better, for this place. The food made us so sick that both my husband and I suffered from the worse case of heartburn that we had to cancel my romantic Birthday dinner that night. I ordered the eggs scrambled and I asked if they saut\xc3\xa9ed the onions and our server said they could not for us. I was shock that she could not accommodate my needs. So I had order it without the onion. The Biscuit was dry and tasted like chalk; the garnish honey dew melon was not ripe and should not have been on the plate. The potatoes were liked twice deep fried and they were not hot, my eggs were not so hot either. I got the feeling that my food sat for a while. My husband ordered the Chicken and waffles. Ok people but sticking a spring of Rosemary in everything does not classy things up. The service was lousy. Out server did not anticipate any of our needs. For example filling up our beverages and all the things that should have come with our meal like syrup, butter, and more napkins. We had to ask her for everything. She kept pulling disappearing acts as if she went out back to smoke a cigarette. \nThe music was so loud it made the whole experience even worse. \nI am thinking that the creator of this rock concept /artzy fartzy wannabe menu was on drugs while creating this.

S'This place is like the white guy in "The Great White Hope" all hype but it can\'t deliver.\n\nThe girl who seated us was friendly and the tables were a good size, but it pretty much went downhill from there.\n\nOur waitress was abrupt and they have a lot of hidden policies.  When I asked if I could make substitute the side on the dish I wanted from one potato product to another I was told "no substitutions."  This is crazy.  I know what the kitchen looks like, it has a bunch of containers full of potato products next to each other.  I was just asking them to scoop the potato from the container next to it, not rework the main part of the dish.  If no substitutions are allowed, you should put that on your  menu.\n\nSo, instead of the mix grill, I ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  One friend ordered their signature dish, the Fried Chicken Benedict, and another also got the Chicken and Waffles to split with his wife.  Then we were told that there is a $2.50 extra plate charge, unless we wanted to order another side for a few bucks, which just so happens to come with an extra plate.  Which would be fine, except they don\'t have this policy listed anywhere on the menu.  \n\nSo we wait and she plops some biscuits on the table, which were pretty good, but still just biscuits.  Then our main dishes arrive.\n\nDisgusting is the only word I can use to describe this meal.  Everything is coated in syrup, but not enough to taste any syrup, just enough to make everything sticky and they don\'t give you more syrup so you can add more if you wish.  The breading on the chicken is thick and completely flavourless (it took me quite a while to find even a hint of sage in the breading).  The waffles were alright, but tasted like they come from a box mix.  The worst part is not a single one of us got a dish that had any seasoning.  Out of three dishes and a side, not a single one had a speck of salt or pepper on it that we did not add ourselves with the shakers.  Not the chicken, not the potatoes, not the egg on the benedict.  \n\nFood NEEDS seasoning.  To completely leave it out of everything you make is an insult not only to your customers but the food itself.\n\nWord of advice, save your money and go to any one of the other, cheaper, breakfast places.  You\'ll be much happier.'

My last meal there was their corned beef and it was served with caramelized onions that were cooler than room temperature. It is a little thing, but it made the sandwich less appetizing. They have great coffee and breakfasts. They could just work a little on their execution.'

S'After a long night of taking part in the night life of las vegas, my roommate and i were about as hungry as two young men could be. That morning i could have ate a horse and then still had room for dessert. My roommate said "it\'s a bit of a drive from north las vegas, but lets go to Hash House a Go Go". i told him most breakfast places are the same but i\'ll try it out. after a 30 minute drive down to Sahara i saw the crowd at 1pm on a saturday....packed to the gills with college students, business people enjoying their day off, and everyone in between trying to recover from the night before. The wait for a larger party would have taken 30-45 minutes but my party was for two so our wait was about 5-10 minutes. \n\nOur waitress came promptly and we were checked on just frequently enough to get any refills or to-go boxes (trust me, you\'ll need them). \n\nLooking at the prices on the menu, it looks like a trendy breakfast/brunch was about to cost me a pretty penny (12-17 dollars was the range for a meal.)  so i placed my order and started a conversation with my friend. not more than a minute or two later i had to stop and gaze in amazement at the portions coming out of this kitchen! burgers the size of whole melons, stacks of waffles 8 inches high, just an incredible bang for your buck. and if the food tasted anything like it looked i was in for a real experience. the food took a good amount of time to get there. but with how busy it was i really wasn\'t about to complain as they are only human.  \n\nI can safely say that my chorizo hash with biscuit was THE BEST BREAKFAST i\'ve ever had in my life. i\'ve been all over the world and this blows any breakfast out of the water. i finished just over half my portion before i had to tap out. and the quality of everything was amazing. the rolls are massive and to die for.'

The Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles was 4x the size at other places and has BACON BAKED DIRECTLY INTO THE WAFFLES! That is amazing. 4 stars for sure and would have been 5 stars if not for the crazy long waits. \n\nWhile you are there try their huge Bloody Mary's - only $8.50 and 2x the normal size."

S"Well, I broke my own rule and tried this place again. I am so angry at myself for doing it. I could have gone to The Peppermill and really enjoyed the fantastic food and the whole Vegas feel of the place. But I didn't. I went here instead and got the same thing I got last time I was here. Pre-made warmed over tasteless mush. \n         It shocks me that they tell me i can't substitute anything because it will compromise there dishes. Now, how the hell do you tell someone that and then refuse to allow eggs over easy after 11am? Completely ruins some of the dishes that need the yoke to make the taste and keep it moist. Scrambled eggs in the salmon Benedict turns it to dried out crap. Just floors me every time i think about it.\n         I ordered what used to be my favorite, the Andy's sage fried chicken eggs Benedict. This is a rather complicated dish to make and it took them less than 5 minutes to bring it to my table. Can you say pre-made? No way are they cooking this to order. The chicken is a full breast of chicken with Corn flakes and a few other things on the outside then deep fried. This takes much longer to fully cook than about 3 minutes. \n         When I took the first bite it was just how I remembered it the last time I was there. Luke warm, mushy, rather tasteless crap. This place has literally dropped right off the scale as far as I'm concerned. It used to be absolutely fantastic and now I would rather microwave a frozen low cal dinner than to eat here. \n           I was with my mother and she ordered the biscuits and gravy. What the hell happened here? This used to be excellent and now it actually tastes synthetic and rubbery. My mom only finished about half of it and could not stand anymore. This WILL be my last time eating at Hash House. The Peppermill is absolutely fantastic every single time and they don't skimp on anything. That is where you will find me at breakfast time from now on. Really to bad how they ruined such a good thing."

I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit which was pretty good. The only reason I knocked off a star is because many of the menu items can be a bit pricey. Most of the plates range from $13-$17 each dish. I also like how many of the breakfast platters are served in the actual skillet that they used to cook the food in. It was a fun experience, but I do not think I will be coming back here for awhile."

But if your stomach is growling, then you'll find that their dishes are served in epic proportions to match that rumbly in your tummy. The sage fried chicken and waffles (which are stuffed with bacon) is my all time favorite dish, and every time I visit Las Vegas and Reno, my mouth waters just thinking about sitting down to order my food. One dish is definitely enough for two. My only complaint is that the bloody mary's don't have enough alcohol in them, but that's why you can go and fill up with spirits at the casinos later on."

S"My first visit to Hash House A Go Go was for a CMYE event, so I couldn't officially review it.  My second visit was a simple breakfast with The Better Half (TBH).\n\nI ordered the Chorizo Hash (Chorizo, Jalapeno, Cheddar Cheese, Potatoes, Eggs, Biscuit, Peppers & Onions).  TBH ordered the Salmon Benedict.  To wash it down, I had the Mango/Peach Iced Tea.\n\nAfter a short wait, the food came out.  Since we have been here before, we knew what was in store for us....a massive plate of food.  Adam Richman from Man vs Food picked a great spot to host his show.....portions are LARGE!  You have to bring your A-Game to finish your plate.\n\nMy strategy was simple....I will save the Biscuit for the end.  Biscuits are stomach busters.  I added some Tabasco and dove into the Chorizo Hash & Eggs.  It was very good!  The combination of ingredients had a good flavor to it.  The saltiness of the Chorizo combined with the gooey Cheddar Cheese and hot Potatoes made for a huge plate of Awesome!  I wish there were more Jalapenos on it though....it didn't seem to have enough of them.....kind of light.  The Eggs were prepared Over Easy just the way I like it....with the runny Egg Yolk covering the Hash when I broke the seal.  As I said, the Biscuit was last and I ate most of it with the final third of my dish....it was puffy & buttery....delicious and filling.\n\nTBH enjoyed her Salmon Benedict, but could only manage to finish 1/2 the plate.  I packed up the other half for later.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience, just like the first time.\n\nWill I return?  Soon....very soon!"

S'I don\'t like American comfort food or huge portions - here I got both. However, the quality of the food is good nevertheless. If you like American comfort food you will absolutely adore this place. The decor, ambience and service are great! I had a great time meeting a buddy of my BF here and tried some of his pasta dish. The pasta was very, very good. The fried chicken on top of it I avoided. They like to put branches of rosemary on top of their dishes here. We jokingly referred to them as trees. My BF and I shared some BBQ ribs which had a BBQ sauce that tasted more like teriyaki than anything. It would have been good if the meat was not so fall off the bones tender. Plus the meat didn\'t have a smoky flavor. They call their food "Twisted Farm Food" and indeed it is. There are many things you will notice about your plate that will give you that idea. Their biscuits are not bad. They have a sweet sauce drizzled on them but they are a bit too big for your mouth and a little too hard. I had a mango tea. Be warned - refills are $1. Prices are not bad considering they do give you huge portions.We got seated real quick. Parking is not an issue.'

S'After going to bed around 6am and getting up at noon, and before hitting the road for the long drive back to LA Sunday afternoon, we decided to come here for brunch since our friend that lives there raved about it.  We had to speed there from our friend\'s house since they stop serving on Sundays at 2:30pm, but thankfully we made it in time.  They serve "twisted farm food" and plenty of it.  Their menu is filled with plenty of heavy meat, eggs and potato dishes.  The kind of food you want to eat a lot of and then take a nap.  They have various brunch food including hash dishes, scrambles, flapjacks, French toast, waffles, stuffed burgers, sandwiches, salads and benedicts, as well as a section titled "Indiana Favorites".  Being from Indiana, I knew I\'d love this place once I saw that.\n\nI decided on the "Tractors Driver Combo", which includes 2 eggs with bacon, sausage or potatoes and flapjacks, waffle or griddled French toast.  Since half the items on the menu feature bacon, I decided to get that as the side.  I had to get the griddled French toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  The eggs and bacon were good, but the star of the dish was definitely the French toast.  2 pieces of fluffy French toast with pecan maple syrup, whole pecans and a cooked banana sliced in half lengthwise.  Amazing.  Possibly the best French toast I\'ve had.  Maybe not the best thing to eat before having to drive 5 hours since I just wanted to sleep afterwards, but worth it nonetheless.  \n\nA couple of interesting dishes on the brunch menu are the "O\'Hare of the dog", which is a 24 ounce Budweiser with a side of bacon and the chicken and waffles, which unfortunately didn\'t look as good as chicken and waffles from Roscoe\'s in LA, but did include a full piece of bacon cooked into each waffle.\n\nThe atmosphere was very cool, kind of hip and kind of country, and the service was adequate.  The prices were reasonable, given that you get big plates of food.  I think our bill for 4 people came out to around $80 or so.  In addition to the great food, they were playing a very interesting mix of music.  From REM to Notorious B.I.G. to Sting to the Beatles to Gwen Stefani to Justin Timberlake to Elvis Costello.  Something for everyone I guess, but thankfully no country music.'

Excellent drinks that match the size of their food - BIG.  Came here for brunch and it was fantastico!  \n\nI had the sage fried chicken and waffles with maple syrup reduction. My tastebuds were in overload my foodie friends. Imagine bacon strips cooked iNSIDE the waffles- yummy.  The the fried chicken was moist, flavorful and out of this world- and I'm not a fried chicken fan. Nevermind that I could not finish even half of it. My husband had the biscuits and sausage with gravy. That was heavenly with the sausage so tender and delish that you can't resist it. The biscuits did get a little hard after a bit but all is forgiven because of the gravy and eggs sitting in a beautiful cloudy fluff!  The drive off the strip for this place is worth while and the waiter/ bartender Randy is absolutly awesome!!  Place was packed but he made sure to check on us to see if we needed more drinks, update us on the wait for the food and if we needed anything else.

I had never heard of it, so I decided to do some research and check out their website online prior to going.  My mouth was watering even before ever going there!\n\nWe got there right as soon as the place opened.  We opted to not go to the one on the strip because we figured it would be much busier.  There were people waiting outside, and soon after we were seated, the rush began and didn't stop when we left.\n\nOur waitress was cute and dorky.  Actually, most of the staff seemed to be right up that alley, but it all had a very smooth way of working out in the best interest of the business and created a nice atmosphere.\n\nI decided to try the corned beef hash (obviously I am a huge fan) and my fiance had the sage fried chicken benedict.  HOLY CRAP.  I knew the pictures online made the food look big, but I never imagined that the portions would be like this.  YOU CAN EASILY SPLIT A MEAL WITH SOMEONE IF YOU WANTED TO AND STILL BE STUFFED.  My hash came out with CHUNKS of corned beef, not the crap from the can.  It seemed fresh like they just got it out of the crock pot and was piled with a mound of crispy potatoes and swiss cheese.  My fiance's food was AMAZING too!  I cannot even begin to describe the abundance of flavor in the sage chicken!\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and everyone who likes good food and a lot of it.  I would have taken my leftovers with us, but we were in a hotel that didn't have a mini-fridge or microwave for reheating.  They need to bring this out to the desert heat in AZ because I am sure there would be quite the crowd and appetite for it."

It's a nice drive off the strip.\n\n$5 for a kiwi watermelon lemonade. Pricey but it was well worth it. You get a nice wedge of watermelon with it. Perfect if you're a little parched from the previous crazy night.\n\nWarning! The portions here are massive. It's funny because when I first got seated, I walked by this huge table that were waiting for their tab. Two things I noticed was that everyone had a togo box in front of them. Second, everyone looked like they were sitting in that post-food coma stage mode (waiting to knock the f out!).\n\nI had the fried chicken and waffles of course. I barely put a dent in this plate. Had to box up at least half of it. I don't know if it beats Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles but the amount of food sure was over whelming. Actually, everyone on my table did not finish their food, not even close. I felt like we were wasting so much food and that some poor kid in Mogadishu could've been feasting on our leftovers.\n\nUnless you can chow down like no other, you might want to share a plate with someone rather than all order something individually. BTW, the flapjacks here are a size of an oldskool 99' Acura Integra GS-R stock rim.\n\nIt's a little pricey but you do get a lot.

The plates here can definitely feed 2, if not 3 or 4 people.  \n\nMy favorite thing to order here is the Griddled French toast.  They are 4 huge slices on this dish and it comes with fried Plantin bananas.  They already add the syrup for you and they actually put a good amount.  Of course they offer extra syrup and butter for your taste.  My cousins ordered the Chicken Eggs Benedict, and the BBBLT (bacon bacon bacon Lettuce Tomato sandwhich).  Again, portions huge!  \n\nWe were actually able to order all different things and share family style.  I think that's cool.  All the food was yummy! The benedict biscuit bread was a tad bit thick so it kind of took away flavor from all the other stacks on top of it.  I hate when I can't taste the egg!

S'6/11/2012 \nI just left hash house a go go and I will never go back. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken had no flavor except for the maple syrup poured all over it. Sweet sticky meat with beading that tasted like fried white flour. The waffles had bacon inside, again dessert meat. I ordered a side of sausage gravy to try to salvage the chicken, I ate about a teaspoon, it was the consistency of thick pudding. Again thick flour taste with a bit of sausage mixed in. So needless to say I wasn\'t crazy about the food. However my real problem was the service. Kelly was my waitress, and while not exactly rude, not very helpful when she realized I had a problem. I told her I needed the gravy because I wasn\'t crazy about the syrupy chicken, she said " yeah, some people don\'t like the sweet meat, I guess you learned!". When I didn\'t eat much even after she brought the gravy she said, "is it making you sick?, I\'ll get it out of your way". I didn\'t ask for a free meal, and I was not comfortable saying more because of her comments. But the thing is, that she offered no options to rectify the situation, she did not send a manager over to talk to us, and charged us for everything. Really disappointing experience.'

S"Come really, really hungry.\n\nThat's the best advice I can give to anyone that wants to visit Hash House a Go Go.  You will have more food on your plate than you can comprehend in a glance.  Galaxies have been known to be smaller.  The gravitational pull of the chicken and waffles may trap you in its orbit, forcing you to consume the chicken just to have a chance to escape intact... not that you'll mind doing so.\n\nWe've been to HHaGG multiple times for both breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and have never run into a meal we didn't like.  Their reliance on potatoes as a filler sometimes borders on the crazy however.  I'm tempted to ask for my next meal without any potatoes, if it's listed as an ingredient.\n\nThe meals we've experienced are the stuffed burgers, fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles (with strips of bacon through the waffles), the chicken pot pie, the home-made corn beef hash, and some of the specials.  The chicken soup was also very flavorful.\n\nI can't think of anything I'd improve on when it comes to the food.  Just remember that your eyes are larger than your stomach.  No one's going to think less of you if you suggest splitting an entree here!"

S"I don't understand what is the hype about this place. Based on the ratings, I decided to try it myself. I got the chicken and waffle breakfast and my husband got the man vs. food house special. \n\nI was surprised by the portion because their hella huge. Its like a meal for two. I am a big fan of chicken and waffle breakfast but I was not impressed with theirs. First the waffle was soggy so I asked for the waffle to be crispy. When it came back to me, it still wasn't crispy but the server said that's their crispy. I asked for it to be almost burned. I waited patience and started eating my chicken. It was actually good. But reminded me of southern style chicken. I don't care much for it. When the waffle came back, it still was not crispy. So I just gave up on it. \n\nI think my husband had the andy's sage fried chicken. It a bunch of stuff on a place. I don't even know where to explain. For me it was ALRIGHT. I would eat it but it was just too much to finish. On the other hand, my husband (who is a chef) did not care for it at all. So that was a total fail. \n\nWould I do back again? Probably not. We love good food and appreciate where what we spend our money on. This was just not one of them."

I will attach a picture to show the size of this monstrous thing. I ordered the burger but with one patty, since I hate wasting meat, with the bacon and mash potatoes. I didn't even attempt to eat the thing by hand so I simply cut it up with a knife and ate it with a fork. \n\nIt's a $20 taxi cab ride from the strip and the decor is great.

S'HUGE PORTIONS. HUGE. This place is inside the crappy Imperial Palace hotel on the strip (upstairs).  I was surprised at how big the place was, it is kind of sectioned off into two difference rooms. I had a simple breakfast with eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit and coffee to drink. The biscuit was so buttery and fresh and warm, and like everything here HUGE. I usually love me some carbs, but I could not finish the biscuit or the rest of the meal. The food was great the prices matched the huge portions, not overprices but accordingly to the amount of food you get. My entree was one of the simpler ones and it was 9 bucks, everything else was above that. Only bad experience was someone straight threw up in there. Was walking aND "bleeaaaaacgh!" *splaash*. I was confused as to what happened when I heard it and saw a guy running out, until I saw the horrified look on a puke-splattered woman. I am assuming the patron had a rough night of drinking in Vegas and that it wasn\'t the food there. Still pretty horrific to witness on your first meal of the day.\nFinal thought :This would be a good spot to pig out in...maybe wear rain gear...?'

S"We were very disappointed in our dining experience, looking forward to a nice dinner on Friday night. I've been to Hash House a Go Go previously for a business dinner, but it was my husband's first time(and last, unfortunately).  I had the Blue Crab Cakes(which were very good) and my husband ordered the swordfish.  His swordfish was horribly undercooked, it was so rubbery it could not be cut with a knife, so he sent it back.  The second  piece was still undercooked in the center, but by this point, we really just wanted to get our check and go.  Our server let us know the chef would be buying our dessert for the problem with the swordfish.  My husband ordered the cheesecake.  Ten minutes later, we were told they were out of cheesecake.  I don't know if it was an off night in the kitchen or what, so we ordered the cobbler and then 10 minutes later, told it was going to be another 10 minutes while it was heated in the oven. The cobbler was fine, but we felt our dinner out was a huge let down.  We were extremely disappointed, my husband certainly will not give them another try and it's going to be a long time before I will go back."

I just don't get up early enough on weekends to get out for breakfast too often. Anyway, if you're tired of the same old breakfast when you do get out, you need to check out this place. The menu is intimidating with loads of interesting choices but it almost seems as if you can't go wrong. Everything looked impressive as it was served to other tables. It took me quite some time to decide what I wanted to eat as everything sounded great but I wasn't disappointed with my choice. The only downfall is it's a bit pricey for breakfast but it is semi touristy and you do get A LOT of food. I felt more full than I normally do walking out of a breakfast buffet.

S"We saw this  place on Man vs. Food and decided to seek it out on our next LV trip.  Needless to say, we were NOT disappointed with Hash House A Go Go.  I understand that there are some hotel versions of this closer to the Strip, but we trekked out to the original on Sahara Blvd. and it was well worth the drive.  We were seated within 30 mins. on a Saturday, we expected to wait longer, as this place is a magnet for locals and visitors alike - perhaps the Casino versions of the restaurant keep it down to a decent wait if you drive out to the original HHAGG.  Service - probably the only thing that wasn't stellar here.  I won't take a star off for that, but it could have just been when we were there - the servers seemed a little green and the hostess had about as much class as what you might see in a local trailer park, but I digress.  \nNow, on to the reason to eat at Hash House A Go Go - the food - OMG - some of the biggest portions I've ever seen and not just big but good big food.  I had the Indiana Favorites - Andy's Sage Fried Chicken w/maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon, mashed potatoes & biscuit.  And I ate every single thing on that plate - come hungry.  It was magnificent!  The chicken was tender and crunchy, drizzled with just enough maple reduction (i.e. syrup) to give it such a nice sweet taste to the the coating on the chicken.  More potatoes than you probably eat for a Thanksgiving dinner including 2nds and 3rds but I kept that fork moving through everything, savoring each bite and not wanting this food to end.  The biscuit - oh man- the biscuit - you have to have a biscuit - take an order of those to go...they're that good.  And the whole thing was around $15.  This is now a must visit spot on any trip to Vegas.  We may try the Casino version to compare, but if you are in town and hungry - give the gaming tables and Cicque shows a rest and grab a fork and napkin and dig in - you will  NOT be disappointed.  Save your workout for the next day."

S'One of my favorite places to breakfast on the weekends in my hometown of San Diego is Hash House a Go-Go (or just plain Hash House to locals). Being in Las Vegas and knowing that Sin City has its very own Hash House (three in fact), there was no way I was going to miss a taste of home.\n\nArriving at a time that would cause a 45 to 90 minute wait at the San Diego location, I was surprised to be told that I would be seated in between 15 and 20 minutes. Happily taking my pager, I shuffled off to wait and in due course was buzzed.\n\nSetting my sights on a "Campfire s\'mores" mocha ($7) which arrived in an over-sized cup (visibly cracked as seen in the picture) topped with gooey, charred marshmallows, chocolate syrup and Graham crackers.\n\nThe first spoonful was thick with marshmallowy goodness and its smokey, crunchy crust brought me immediately back to childhood outings in the woods by the campfire, roasting s\'mores with family and friends. If the coffee itself had been better, this mocha would have been perfect but it falls just short of the mark.\n\nHaving had many of the offerings on the standard menu over the years, I decided I\'d order one of the brunch specials. The Nappanee hash ($14.95) with fresh tomatoes, green beans, marinated steak, smoked mozzarella and crispy potatoes was ordered and anticipated.\n\nThings began going pear shaped when I asked my server If I could add fresh roasted corn (available in the other brunch offering), to my hash and was told "the Chef can\'t guarantee the flavor profile if changes are made so we don\'t allow substitutions or additions." FAIL!\n\nIn due course my server arrived clutching a medium sized cast iron skillet in a heavy oven mitt. What a great idea, the cast iron would keep my food hot and steamy while I enjoyed it...WRONG! The skillet seems to have been used solely for presentation and not preparation, it was stone cold and after a bite, I realized temperature of my meal was not far off. FAIL!\n\nThe "marinated steak" was a perfectly cooked medium but lacked flavor. The green beans, which I felt were a strange choice for a breakfast dish, were a bit too al dente and the whole skillet lacked seasoning. \n\nCuriously, the server pointed out the days freshly made strawberry citrus jam and asked if I would like butter to go with it and my buttermilk biscuit to which I replied "yes," but somehow said butter never materialized. FAIL!\n\nIn all the meal was mediocre, there were several opportunities to meet or exceed expectations but none were taken advantage of.   The server could have noticed the large, clearly visible crack in my coffee mug,  If cast iron was to be used for presentation only, there\'s no reason it couldn\'t have been warmed so as to keep its contents at the desired temperature and  finally, when asked to add roasted corn to the dish, the server could have suggested i have it on the side instead of basically telling me the Chef understands my palate better than I do.\n\nI have a warm place in my heart for Hash House a Go Go and have recommended breakfast/brunch there to many friends and acquaintances alike, I can only hope that this particular meal was an aberration.'

S"I walked in today around 1pm as a solo diner and even though slightly larger parties of 2 or 3 were waiting I was seated immediately.   Service was fast, efficient and informative.   The menu is an interesting mix of fresh,  flavorful and a touch of hedonism.   The open ceiling combined with the wood floors and abundance of stainless steel can make it noisy but on this visit nit overly so.\nI had a fresh made cherry limeade that was the right combination of sweet and tart.  The waiter also informed me that refills were not free which I appreciated.  The chicken and waffles taste-wise were excellent.   The waffles had full strips of cooked bacon in them and coming out the edges.   The presentation was overwhelming and most likely needs to be served on a larger plate as there is no way to eat this dish without the garnish and chicken sliding off the plate but somehow I managed.   The rosemary sprig speared into both pieces of fried chicken gives the meat a subtle piney taste that complements the sage very well.\n\nLike all the other customers today I too walked out with my doggie bag as the quantity is just too much to eat in one sitting.   It is this last point that prevents me from giving 5 stars.  Please don't misunderstand.  I enjoyed my experience and will return.   I recommend you try this restaurant with a unique concept."

It\'s just a breakfast joint with feed sack sized portions.\n\nI prematurely ordered the chicken and eggs, and I should have read "Karen Y\'s" freak\'n review cuz she got it right about the chicken being dry which brought out my "O" face! "Ooooh, wtf! Why did I order the chicken because I can\'t stand dry overcooked chicken! The chicken was so dry I would have gladly taken some supermarket fried chicken over it any day. Even the side of chipotle sauce couldn\'t save this overcooked bird.\n\nMy other biggest pet peeve is to plate food with huge chunks of herbs if it\'s not intended to be eaten.

S'Great food, but terrible service! Called them to alert them that we would be arriving with a large group of 10 of us at 10 am on a Friday morning. Were told that they only take reservations with 24 hours notice. Got there around 9:45 and was told there would be a 40 min wait. No biggie, I thought. I noticed as we were standing outside, patiently waiting our 40 minutes, there was a large, empty table that was set for 12 out on the patio. I went in and asked the hostess if we could sit at this table outside and was told that there were 2 other large groups ahead of us. Again, not a big deal. At the 30 min mark, we were surprised when we were told our table was ready!  YEA! 10 minutes early.  My excitement faded when we were lead straight to the empty table outside we had been staring at for the past 30 minutes!  ARGH!  How frustrating!!  This was our second visit this year to this place and a similar situation happened on our first visit..they had half the place empty but a long wait time?  I don\'t think they know how to manage their staff very well.  \nWe waited for about 10 min before our waiter (who turned out to be the bartender from inside) came to get out order. He said he was there to take our drink order and I told him we were all ready to order food as well.  I was told "lets get the drinks out of the way and I will be back for the food orders after"  We all ordered our drink and I was impressed he didn\'t write a THING down! Needless to say, our drink order was screwed up. When he came back to take our food order, he wrote it all down this time, but was almost rude as he did so. After about 15 minutes our food arrived. One, plate,  and one person,at, a, time. First the bacon, then the eggs..etc.  it was painful to experience.  We of course waited until the last person was served to start eating and by then the first couple of people\'s food was cold. No one came to check on us during our breakfast and we had to hunt down our waiter to get the check which took another 10 minutes. Again, the food is awesome and the portions are ridiculously huge but the service is worse than anything.  PS: The "sound system" on the outdoor patio sounds like it was coming from a cell phone. TERRIBLE quality.'

It was a tough portion of meat (which for brisket means it needed a bit more slow cooking) with some decent potatoes that came on a cold skillet. With the biscuit and side of fruit, it felt like a lot of food but it was overall just....heavy and bland. \n\nAlso, will you people stop this bullsh*t of putting bacon into everything?! Bacon mixed into the waffle. Bacon in the mashed potatoes. I don't eat the stuff, but even if I did, bacon is not a cheap substitute for knowing how to season your food. \n\nOn the positive side, service was really nice and attentive, and we didn't have to wait too long before being seated. \n\nI don't know if I'd go back, honestly.

I have been here more than a handful of times and even though it's not my thing to try different menu items at places I go to, I almost always do here because you almost can't go wrong. \nOur favorites are\nSage chicken and waffles\nBacon waffle-personal favorite\nSkillets and scrambles-you can't go wrong!\nAnd don't forget to get a bite of someone's biscuit and fresh jam if yours doesn't come with one! \nOne thing to be said, while I see their pancakes are popular, I personally do not care for the very thick style pancakes. These pancakes are almost 3 times as thick as a regular pancake and about 4 times as large area wise. But again, that's more of a personal preference, not a negative review."

S"Hmm, I think the reason they are so high in rating is cuz of the GIGANTIC portion! Chicken and waffles consisted of 4 waffles and 2 huge fried chicken breast! Corned beef is special cuz they hand pulled the beef and it's tender. The reason I said it was over rated is bec I was dissapointed with the taste. Although presentation is 'WOW', the taste is kinda bland. Chicken was tasteless and waffles are not that great either, too much flour and not as fluffy as I like it to be. Another hassle is that every person needs to order soething - even my 1 year old?? Are you kidding me?! Good thing we can order sides for additional person..... Kiwi Lemonade is just so so. The reason many people likes it was bec of the nice color it was presented - green/ yellow/ pink color! Again, I would rather go to other place for breakfast next time."

S"So I was in Vegas this past weekend and my friend wanted to try out this place before heading out to OC. He saw this place from the show man vs food. I guess for what it's worth, I love american food and I love brunch.\n\nThe place is quiet far from the freeway (about 15 min local drive) and can be easily found from the street. The place has a rustic/barn feel from the outside. It was a bad idea to come during lunch time without any reservation (we had a party of 8) because the wait was about 1 hour.\n\nThe portion is ginormous!!! I ordered the Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped w/ scrambled eggs. The pork came out crispy and delicious. It's really a comfort food and it's highly recommended if you come with a big group. Don't try to eat everything alone because sharing is caring .... ^_^\n\nThis place redefine the word gluttony and I'd love to come back again to try out other food."

S"A go-to for huge family-outing breakfasts (or late breakfasts on weekends when we get up late and don't feel like cooking).  \n\nWithout fail, the wee one gets a ginormous chocolate chip pancake  (and manages to finish most of it).  The portions are huge and the food is good.  We've slowly been working our way through the menu, but anything with the sage fried chicken is really good.  The benedicts are good too, but on our last visit they were really busy and some of the food was near cold, which was a little disappointing but I'm not a huge fan of cold smashed taters.  \n\nThe drinks are good too, bloody marys are great!\n\nWe've been here for dinner before too and the meatloaf is pretty darn good (the hubs is not a huge meatloaf fan but enjoyed this one).  \n\nThey're usually pretty busy around brunch time on the weekends though, so go early if you can!"

S'At my house we have several names for this place:  Hash House a NO Go, Hash House a No No, and Hash House a No Mo\'.\n\nThe main problem is that Man vs. Food hyped the place as being excellent with humongous portions. We wanted to experience it just for the novelty.  Amongst the three of us we had the pancakes with hash browns, eggs over easy and chicken sausage; the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger with fries and watermelon lemonade, and the Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger with the same fries. We also tried the barbecued ribs appetizer.\n\nFirst, the lemonade, which was tasty, was $5.00, no refills. That\'s way overpriced for lemonade that isn\'t spectacular, but it was attractive looking. Next, we specifically asked for the appetizer to be brought out before the meal (sort of the definition of the term "appetizer," right? We shouldn\'t have had to say anything) but it came AFTER the meal was brought out. How ridiculous is that? So two disappointments.\n\nWhen the pancake came out it was large, but it was underwhelming compared to the hype it got on TV.  Yes it was really big- bigger than one outstretched medium sized female hand. It filled up maybe 2/3 of the oval plate it was served on, leaving room for maybe one cup of cubed potatoes (hashbrowns) and 2 eggs over easy. But check out this photo from Man vs. Food: http://yhoo.it/18O6aVt - this was CLEARLY nothing close to what we got, hence the disappointment.   The seasoned potatoes had no flavor, and the pancake tasted like flour.  No flavor at all.  We asked for chicken sausage and one link arrived, splayed open on a small dish. It was basically a hot dog, not sausage.\n\nOn to the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger. The teenager enjoyed it greatly, however, the teenager likes just about anything. The burger has one pound of meat divided into two pre-made, pre-seasoned patties that are cooked in a press of some kind so that both sides are cooked simultaneously. This means no way to request medium rare.  Sigh...\n\nThe Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger was tasty, although the meat flavor seemed to come from the grill without additional seasoning. Well, let\'s just say the seasoning was mild. I won\'t complain too much about the burger- it was satisfying.  The fries serving size was average. I think they were seasoned, and had a nice crunch. \n\nThe ribs came in what appeared to be an Asian-inspired sauce, which I liked. One of the  four ribs was perfect, with tender meat falling off the bone. The others were chewy and tough. Hate to speculate on the disparity- I\'ll leave that to you. They were artfully leaned against a pile of cold, nasty-tasting potatoes.  What a waste of potato. We got the impression that much of the food is pre-packaged, pre-seasoned, so not much creativity happens in the preparation.\n\nThe atmosphere was different from what I expected- the dark lighting made a nice ambience even though the food is Denny\'s quality.  I liked the distressed wood everywhere and the (very) heavy metal chairs.\n\nSo, we will chalk this up to experience and probably not come back as a family, although I\'d bring the teen here if he wanted the burger again. for $13 it wasn\'t so awful in my opinion. \n\nOh- the waitress was EXCELLENT- she got a full 20% tip.'

S"Quantity...not quality seems to be the mantra at Hash House A Go Go, and I really can't get on board with that. \n\nAfter a short wait of approximately 25 minutes, my wife and I were seated in the bar area. This location is HUGE with lots of space, and every inch is needed since it gets really busy. The bar area was fine for dining, but the music was a bit too loud for a Saturday morning; I'm usually not one to complain about loud music, but I honestly couldn't hear my wife who was sitting two feet away from me over the blaring music. \n\nThe service was pretty decent and our waitress was prompt and attentive considering how busy she was. The folks at Hash House A Go Go definitely have character (and dress up as various characters like Wonder Woman and Superman), but also do their jobs well. \n\nThe service gets 4 stars, but I cannot justify giving this place a thumbs up because their food is underwhelming. The food runner needed both arms and a lot of strength to deliver our meatloaf hash. The meatloaf hash along with the chicken and waffles were enough to feed to a family of four...but we both gave it the old college try and dug right in. The chicken and waffles were big, but only in quantity; they certainly were not big in either flavor or taste. Putting two whole chicken breasts and mixing bacon into the waffles sounds nice in theory, but the execution here is poor. The meatloaf hash didn't fare much better, as it tasted like what I would imagine soylent green to taste like; just a blob of flavorless food once you put together all the components. \n\nConsidering Vegas is a city with some of the world's finest dining, the food here is the exact opposite of that. Lacking in any sort of complexity, the only reason I would ever go back here is to load up on carbs and salty ass food after a hard night of drinking."

Of course, I love food, so what better way to put a smile on my face than bring me to a buffet!\n\nI went with my two friends who have been here before. As I walked in, I felt like a little girl on her first visit to Disneyland. Maybe I\'m exaggerating a little, but it was certainly a great place to eat with family and friends. They have everything for everyone from Chinese food to American food. \n\nI walked around to see all the selections before making my final choice for my first place. Yes, I said it..."my first plate," because you should not go to a buffet if you\'re only planning to eat one plate of food! Seriously, it\'s forbidden in my book! \n\nEverything here was amazing! I highly recommend to save room for dessert! They have delicious varieties of desserts that I cannot even begin to describe how I was having a hard time deciding what to eat! \n\nWe went here on a Saturday afternoon which we paid $43 each person.

S'Ok, some people think $39 is expensive for this buffet but they forget to tell you that the price includes all you can drink beer and wine.  I am not a drinker so I did not have any booze but let me tell you that I was still thrilled with the place. \n\nI try to stay away from the strip due to all the rude workers at the strip.  Some people are nice but there is so much cattle traveling through those places on the strip that some people naturally feel that they can lie and be rude to you.  That was my experience at Pampas on the strip.  After that experience I was a bit gun shy about another buffet.  My father took me to Studio B at M resort.\n\nLets put it this way, my father is a local and likes to go to the local places in Vegas because the crowds are smaller and the people are nicer.  I am not a local but after dining at Studio B I asked if there were any homes for sale within walking distance to this restaurant.  \n\nMy favorite buffet has always been Fugo De Chao but there is a new kid on the block!\nThis place is unbelievable.  Good thing I brought some digestive enzyme pills with me because the food was so great that I polished off 4 plates, 2 coffee drinks and many desserts.  I am not a big dessert guy but the quality of their food was so incredible I just had to keep going back for more. \n\nThis place is awesome.  It feels like you are entering an airport when you go back for food.  The place is so huge and they have so many selections it is nothing short of amazing.   One of the other reviewers said that they also have a breakfast buffet.  I will definitely want to try that next time, especially if it is only $10.99 as he said. \n\nThe only problem I can see that would have ruined the experience is that others have found out about this place and the lines can be long to get in.  Try to get there ahead of the crowd.  Do NOT rush yourself.  Take it all in and spend hours there enjoying it.  The food is worth the $39 which by the way also includes the tip so in reality it is only about $34 unless you are deadbeat that never tips.'

Just a heads up, a taxi ride from the strip will cost $40 each way, and weekend lunch prices are $33 a person. \n\nI've been here twice, and the first time, our taxi driver told us this buffet is catered towards the locals because it's near a big new housing community. The locals know good food! Food selection is decent. On the weekend, there's oysters (eh, nevada oysters..), fresh shrimp cocktails, a variety of hot foods, salads, fruits, and well made desserts (my favorite, is their creme brulee..you can never go wrong! and they have a gelato bar)\n\nOn top of a pretty well priced buffet, ALCOHOL is included!!! wine, beer, cider, and mimosas galore! This alone, is $13 extra at Spice Market inside Planet Hollywood, so it's a great deal if you have a car. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in vegas looking for a good buffet, with a car.

My 2 favorite points:\n\n-All you can drink beer and wine! \n\n-The price per quality is out of this world. $15 dollars for what I received was unreal\n(Lunch price).

The clam chowder was salty, the pad thai was lacking (my cousin who\'s been to this buffet numerous times says that it can range from amazing to ehhhh depending on who makes it in the kitchen), the bread pudding was a bit dry, and the MERINGUES were wrongly labeled as MACARONS! Don\'t be fooled!\n\nOf course, I also wish there was a bit more variety in the beer & wine offered. My cousin asked if they served Sauvignon Blanc to which the lady behind the bar answered, "I\'m sorry, we don\'t serve cocktails". When my cousin repeated her question, the lady told her "We only have wine here". HAHAHA yes, we experienced a bit of awkward communication there and to answer my cousin\'s question, no they did NOT offer it. I was looking forward to a mimosa but sadly, they also didn\'t offer any champagne :(\n\nI love how it\'s less crowded than the buffets found on the strip & the quality of most of their items are top notch. \n\nNote: For all those traveling from the strip, they offer a complimentary shuttle to the M Resort from the Fashion Show Mall.

There is zero doubt in my mind that the M Resort Buffet is the best value hands down.  The M, at weekday lunch, is $16,and  includes beer, wine and coffee liquors.  More importantly, the food is outstanding on every level - taste, preparation, variety.  A couple of things here and there that are just so-so, but overall, the food is remarkably good.  TIP:  Take tiny portions of everything that looks good.  Savor each bite.  Appreciate it.  Don't just woof it down like a seagull!  Take your time and enjoy.  There's plenty of time and food.

S'After checking into our hotel, we immediately went out for one of the main purposes of visiting Las Vegas: BUFFET!  I am a big fan of Bravo\'s Top Chef.  M Resort was the host of last season\'s production.  For some reason, that made me feel M Resort must have really good food.  When I went online to look up their restaurants, I found out they have a buffet that offers UNLIMITED wine and beer!  Seriously?  All you can drink booze?  We are so there!\n\nM Resort is not even in Las Vegas.  It\'s in the city of Henderson, which is about 15 minutes drive from Las Vegas.  The hotel was so new that I couldn\'t even find the location on my navigation system.  We actually had to call them for direction.  We got to the buffet around 8pm.  There was a pretty long line.\n\nAfter waiting in line for about 50 minutes, we were finally in!  Sunday night seafood dinner buffet is $31.95 per person.  If you have a M Resort card (those free member cards that accumulate points when you gamble there), I think you get like $2 or $3 off per person.  We were too hungry and tired to go get the cards though....\n\nThe buffet is an "open kitchen" style buffet.  We could see the chefs cooking at each station.  They have a circular seafood station in the middle of the room, as well as cuisines from around the world along the wall.\n\nWe didn\'t even sit down at our table, and just headed straight to the seafood station.  For my first plate, I got crab legs, oyster, shrimp, and a juicy piece of prime rib.  The prime rib was cooked perfectly.  It gotta be the best prime rib I\'ve ever had in a buffet.  The crab legs was meaty and delicious.  Oyster was super fresh.  I think it only took me 10 minutes to finish this plate because (1) I was really hungry, and (2) the food was that good!  Seriously, they have AMAZING seafood here.  Everything was just so fresh and good.  Did I mention we LOVE the crab and prime rib?\n\nOh wait!  We can\'t forget about the all you can drink alcohol.  You can\'t order alcohol from servers.  You have to bring your ID and go to the bar to get it.  They had red wine, white wine, rose wine, and beers.  You can only get 1 drink at a time, but more than welcome to go back as many times as you want to, as long as you can manage to walk to the bar still.  I don\'t really remember how many glasses I drank.... maybe 3 or 4?  Yeah I was pretty drunk that night, and totally got my money worth.\n\nTime for some cooked food.  Braised oxtail had meat that just fell off the bone.  So tender.  Sushi was probably the only disappointment that night.  They had a very small sushi station with just a few selections.  This was a plateful of Asian goodies.  Corn chowder was sweet and yummy.  Love the sauteed curry crab.  Clams were good, so was the kalbi.  Mussel wasn\'t so good.  It had a strange taste.  Like the spicy pad thai a lot.  And a bowl of clam chowder.  Of course, more crab and oyster.  I looked around the dining room, and saw all the Asian customers busy eating crab legs.  But the non-Asians were just eating noodle and pizza.  I wish I can teach them how to eat buffet "properly".  haha....\n\nDessert time!  There was a constant line at the dessert station. I wasn\'t too greedy and only grabbed a few desserts that I like.  The chocolate mousse was soft and creamy with a crispy base.  So good!  Creme brulee was yummy.  Couldn\'t get enough of the almond tiramisu.  Dr. P\'s favorite was the lemon ice cream.  Macaroon was the only one I didn\'t like.\n\nIn case you still don\'t know, I LOVE CRAB!  M Resort has the best seafood buffet in Las Vegas!  Totally worth the money.  I want to go to Vegas again just so I can eat at M Resort\'s buffet!'

S"Beautiful new buffet with lots of selections to nosh on. \n\nThe wait time is hefty for a weekend night, minimum 30 minutes but it is worth it. They offer free beer and wine which is pretty sweet if you are into that. I am not a huge drinker but I can definitely see the perks when you are paying $30/per person like all the other places. I guess that is their way of getting folks in off the strip. \n\nWe went on a seafood night (Friday). It was good, fresh cracked crab legs, oysters on the 1/2 shell, fresh chilled shrimp, fried clams (YUM) and salmon baked on bamboo (just to name a few items). \n\nI thought the selection was healthy in choices and quality was better than some of the other buffets I have had. Their desert selection was pretty incredible. I think desert is my favorite part of a buffet. When else can you bring 5 different selections to the table and just eat a bite of each with no guilt?! LOVE IT! I am kinda loving the fresh cotton candy too, can't beat it.\n\nOverall I think it is a worthy contender for one of the best buffets in Las Vegas."

S'Went solo for seafood night. There has been a change over time at the M and Studio B. Less tables, tables sit dirty for Long periods of time. You stand in line worse than any Disney line. Only 3 items seem to be added for seafood night. Oysters, crab legs and not King crab and shrimp. Everything else is their regular buffet. So for these items you pay a great deal more. My family refuses to stand in line which is a long time. Last night there were only 14 couples ahead of me. It took over an hour before I got a table. Do not think I will be back until something improves.'

Some meat dishes are slightly underflavored, but great seection. Deserts are awesome, especially gelato and creme brulee.  Just make sure to come with an empty stomach and plenty of time to try a bit of everything.'

S"Came on a Friday nite at 6 and we got in at 8, the line is huge! $37 per person, all you can eat, all you can drink, although I started tipping the lady who pours drinks after my 4th glass of champagne. Booze is cheap wine and champagne and some 4  beers on tap. All kinds of food you can think of and most people indulge in tons of crab legs. You can sense the smell of buffet, but that's almost every buffet and I would say that this one is one of the cleanest in Vegas. Also I'm not a big fan of buffets, the food is cheap meat and vegetables cooked with who knows what to make them taste good, but that's just me. We had fun with friends and enjoyed the drinks and 2 of the friends won big, big bucks gambling in the M Resort that night, so I would say that it was a good night!"

S"Decided to try this buffet out at the suggestion of a friend who lives in Vegas, and the multiple glowing reviews from Yelpers here.  Unfortunately, our experience was not as positive!\n\nWe came on Christmas night and the wait was a whopping 3.5 hours!  The line snaked around the casino and about 1.5 hours into the wait they began issuing times that you could come back and get into line.  The problem with this system is that they would give out the same times to 100 or so people in line, with no indicator of your original placement in line.  So then everyone just congregated around the entry waiting for the line to re-open. When the gate did open, everyone bum-rushed the line and cut in from every angle.  It was a MESS.  I'm really surprised they haven't formulated a better process yet!  Needless to say there were many upset customers and they definitely could have handled this in a more organized fashion.\n\nRegarding the food, there was definitely a wide variety of items, although the quality rather disappointing.  The prime rib was tough, the salmon (which we had to cut ourselves since the server wasn't there) was very dry and hard, and the pad thai was super dry as well.  Also, the cocktail shrimp were noticeably smaller than those at other top buffets.  I would've given up some of the variety for better quality items.\n\nThe highlights for me were definitely:\n- ice cream station (felt like a kid in a candy store)\n- coffee bar (espresso drinks served piping hot!)\n- alcohol station (the alcohol wasn't the best, but i did appreciate having the option to enjoy free drinks with my dinner!)\n- sweet potatoes (delicious!!)\n- crab legs (warning: hard to open, be sure to ask your server for a tool to use)\n- lower price point than bellagio, wynn\n\nAlso, definitely worth it to sign up for the players card.  Save $2 plus we got $5 in free play money. :)\n\nVerdict: I'm glad I tried the buffet, but probably wouldn't go back anytime soon.  I would definitely pay more for better quality elsewhere."

S"I've been to this buffet three or four times.  I think it is very good.  Some of the outstanding dishes from tonight:  green curry with chicken with a good spiciness--probably a 5 or 6 out of 10 at most Thai restaurants; black bean Asian eggplant with tofu; and some bamboo mahi mahi--the fish being tasty and juicy for a buffet setting.  Disappointments were the teriyaki chicken (too sweet) and the artisan breads.  The breads have never been outstanding, but they seem to be closer to regular sliced bread than artisan.\n\nDesserts as always were good.  I think the cannoli are the best of any buffet in town.  I wasn't fond of the pecan pie, but the creme brulee is outstanding.  \n\nService was top notch.  The server brought fresh glasses of iced tea before I was finished with one, and he brought coffee with dessert.  50% off for people 50 and older on Wednesday makes this a super value."

S'Warning\n\nInaccessible and infuriating.\n\nWhat began as a 1hr-2hr wait turned into bouncers telling people that they were at full capacity or that the line was a 3+ hour wait. This happened THREE times in the past 5 days I was trying to grab a meal there.\n\nHere\'s where it became a sh*tshow. The M resort offers a lot of complimentary deals now to gamblers now. Why you ask? To make their gamblers stay at the hotel longer, therefore raking in more revenue. Smart ass business plan they got there, they even have the weekdays covered with special deals such as "Senior Wednesdays" (a horror fest with all 60+ seniors filling the entire casino to the brim with walkers and wheel chairs). The M resort definitely cares more about making their gamblers stay; they hand out comped meals like candy therefore making the VIP line EXTREMELY long on top of the EXTREMELY long waiting lines thus translating to absolutely absurd waiting times.\n\nAnother point observed in my 5+ visits there (which all ended up driving back on the strip since it was packed to the brim), apparently they also offer meal passes (all day any day) to locals, so forget about going on weekends when the entire city of LV is trying to grab a good deal.\n\nThe M resort has made their star buffet too accessible to the masses. Just a warning to people who don\'t want to wait 3+ hours for a 20 dollar buffet. Are you seriously going to waste hours of your time just to save a few dollars on a buffet? Spend the extra 10 and go on to Bellagio and the Wynn, their lines move way faster now (waited 30 or less minutes for both of them on a WEEKEND during dinner rush).  \n\nOr wait a few years until the old folks that flood the lines to croak from too much crab legs and beef fat.'

S'BUFFET FAIL! \n\nOk, so I was a loyal RIO buffet goer since they offer many types of food, and most are very good. They got the crab legs, the prime rib, and all the "must-haves" in Vegas.. BUT they slowly changed and now its become gross.. So i discovered the M buffet a few months back.. It was TOPS, super good, high level of food for sure!\n\nBUT! This previous weekend I went, spent 32 bucks and regretted it the entire time. It was HORRIBLE, food was old, seafood was pastie! THE CRAB LEGS WERE ALL MUSHY(lacked the texture of crab). Their cocktail shrimps were "eh" and their oysters were "OK".\n\nAs for the hot food, it was ridiculous, everything looked old.. like panda express at 230pm or something(left over from lunch). SO I KNOW, you\'re thinking you must of went on the off-time. so we waited around till 5ish, when there was a good 1-hour wait outside(line to get in) and they set out fresh dinner food..\nSAME THING!\nThe fish was all gross, the food was gross, prime-rib tasted more like subway roast beef... SIGH, this was my new fave, now its my new most hated.. i would say this is about 1 click below hometown at 4x the price... sad..... so sad...a few of my friends and I found the same findings...\n\noh yeah and the service was horrible, no refills, no removal or dirty plates.. then our server disappeared totally and we found out he went home..'

The creme brulee and chocolate souffle are delicious! Not to mention, they have all you can drink wine and champagne (extra star!). The only downfall is the hour (and then some) wait (minus 1 star). Kinda pricey but definitely worth every penny! Definitely the buffet to visit when in Vegas :)'

S"Went here on a Saturday evening so I knew there would be a wait and we waited for about 40 minutes in line. Anyone who's not willing to wait at least a little bit should just leave. Because of the location prices are definitely lower for a weekend buffet than similar buffets on the strip plus this one comes with beer, cider and wine included. The place is very casual with lots of tourists and families with little kids, definitely not a date place. Service was decent with soft drinks and water being refilled regularly and dishes being taken away promptly. \n\nThe food was very good for a Vegas buffet. Weekends are seafood and there was a LOT of it. Hot and iced crab legs (but I seemed to be the only one who enjoyed it cold), sushi which was decent but heavy on the cucumber instead of the tuna and nigiri that was definitely not top quality but was edible, very good fried cod, ceviche which was barely edible, and a really good salmon dishes. There was also a very well stocked salad bar and lots of none seafood dishes including a carving station. Since it was Chinese New Year (ish) there was also Chinese food which was just god-awful and made me very sad. Dessert was DELICIOUS because they had flan and creme brule in addition to some other pastries and small cakes (all on their own little individual plates) that I didn' bother with because of the flan and creme brulee. \n\nThe place is very beautiful and the buffet itself is set up as one long bar that curves through the middle of the space. It makes it a little harder to reach things than in many buffets were tables are in the middle and the food is surrounding you, but it was also very attractive and I figured I could use the tiny bit of exercise considering how much I was eating. Parking was ample and free (Go Vegas!) and the casino itself smells less like smoke and desperation than other casinos. \n\nI would recommend this buffet to anyone in Vegas who's looking for a weekend dinner but doesn't want to spend $60, or to any lushes who want the free booze!"

S"Don't go to the Sunday seafood buffet if you want fresh food. Not worthy of the $39.99. The crab was just OK. The cold shrimp were dreadful. They poured way too much ice on it so they became flavorless and soggy. The prime rib and dessert was pretty good though. But everything else was just not like it used to be. When they first opened they really payed attention to detail. Now it seems like management just don't give a crap cause it showed in the food."

S'Studio B Buffet has to be one of my favorite buffets in Vegas! I went here on Saturday for lunch with my family that was visiting me from California. I paid about $180 for their seafood lunch for 4 people. If you are going with a group be ready to shell out quite a bit of money..but when is that ever new in Vegas? I was not upset with the price because I knew the buffet would be worth it.\n\nUpon entering you will see a vast array of food spread out before you. A word of buffet  wisdom: scan around and then take a little bit of what looks appealing, and figure out your favorites. Believe me. You will want to keep eating everything there.  Everything that they have available from the crab legs to the fruit is fresh and flavorful. One of my favorite things that I tried was the prime rib. The prime rib is usually generously served and very juicy. Definitely something you want to try if you\'re a meat lover. Another great option that they have there is their kalbi ribs. The kalbi ribs are cooked perfectly and are very huge. I don\'t think I have ever seen kalbi ribs so big! \n\nIf you aren\'t a fan of beef, they have various pasta choices that you can try that are very delicious. If they have mushroom ravioli available, I definitely recommend you try it. The cream sauce and ravioli filling will make you go "Mmmmm" from the first bite! Their crab legs are always being refilled because everyone loves them so much! They are all pretty big and have a good amount of crab meat in them. In addition, they have various fruits to choose from that look and taste juicy and sweet. \n\nStudio B Buffet is definitely one of the best buffets in Vegas that is actually worth the price. If you are looking for a great buffet away from the strip, this is your place! I promise, it won\'t disappoint you. \n\n**Be sure if you do plan on coming here during a weekend that you get there early. The buffet gets pretty packed and the line is usually really long, so plan your dinner or lunch accordingly**'

S"This is a second-tier Vegas buffet posing as a top-tier Vegas buffet.  I've only eaten the $30 weekend seafood buffet, so this is just a review of that, capice?  This comparatively expensive meal is only worthwhile under one of two circumstances:\n1.  You have a 2-for-1 coupon like I did\n2.  You have a bizarre fetish for crab legs.  \nSince imitation crab tastes exactly like very mushy real crab and costs infinitely less, I don't think this buffet can match the Spice Market, Bellagio, or Wynn buffets, and it costs just as much.  The line is just as long, too.  The entree dishes largely revolve around slight variations on the same handful of ingredients and will not blow your mind.  They're okay, but not $30 per person okay.  The dessert section, on the other hand, is top notch.  I say you go here during the week, bring a 2-for-1 coupon, eat a lot of dessert, and buy yourself a $2 package of imitation crab."

S"This may have been one of the best buffets a few years ago, but Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal have passed it by with their unique dishes and plating. The food at Studio B is still better than most buffets I've tried but my opinion of the place has changed since my first visit years ago when the M Resort opened.\n\nDesserts are the best option here with the apple pie, cookies, and pecan tart leading the way. Items like stewed and braised meats work well because the quality doesn't diminish as quickly when it's been sitting out a long time as opposed to other dishes where timing and freshness matter. For example, the chimichangas and pizza crusts get soggy  after a while and mussels become rubbery. You should skip the sushi altogether. The Asian section with kalbi beef, curry, and kung pao beef fared much better and were some of the more memorable dishes."

S'To be fair, I\'ll separate this review into 2 parts: 1 about the food and 2 about the horrendous service.\n\n(((1))) FOOD: 3/5 stars\n$24 per person for the weekday (no seafood) dinner buffet - certainly a better price than the buffets on the strip. The food here was average. I was only able to find a handful of solid items that I could enjoy. Would I come back? Slight chance, but ONLY for the the sashimi salad and the few items I have listed below:\n\n- Salmon sashimi salad - This was the star of the entire dinner. The salmon was extremely buttery, sweet, moist, and fresh. I could just eat this all night and be happy. \n- American beef BBQ ribs - The ribs were meaty, not too dry, and the BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy. It satisfied my rib craving just fine.\n- Chinese style BBQ pork ribs - The Chinese BBQ sauce was sweet and not too salty. The ribs were moist, meaty, and didn\'t have too much fat, which made it enjoyable. \n- Kalbi (Korean BBQ beef ribs) - I enjoyed the flavorful and bold Korean sweet and salty marinade. Some of the meat was tender, but there were also many pieces that were charred to a crispy black.\n- The creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e was perfectly custardy. \n- The luscious flan had a beautiful smooth texture and not overly sweet.\n- I also enjoyed being able to order Americano and expresso from the dessert bar. They were both light (watery) and not robust, but they were packed with enough caffeine to fight off the food coma.  \n\nThe rest of the food and desserts offered at the buffet were either dried out, overcooked, bland, mushy, or tasted like dishwater. I was also really looking forward to the oysters and crab legs that I\'ve seen in pictures, but alas I didn\'t see them being offered last night - Note: the seafood buffet is more expensive ($40) and it\'s only offered Fri-Sat-Sun. \n\n(((2))) SERVICE: 0/5 stars\nThe servers here are shockingly rude and ruined my experience at this buffet and my appetite. \n\nWhen we arrived, the ladies working the front registers advised us that their buffet line will be closing at 9 pm tonight and that\'s also when the food will stop being refreshed. It was about 7:50 pm, so that wasn\'t a problem to us - from our understanding, we wouldn\'t be able to grab anymore food after 9, but we would still be able to finish our meal even after the buffet line was closed. Well, that\'s typically the case at most buffets...\n\nApparently that\'s not the case here. What ended up happening was, we grabbed our food, ate, and when 9 pm rolled up, our server abruptly came up to us and said, "you have to leave now, we\'re closed." Her tone of voice was extremely coarse and unprofessional. Mind you, we still had a plate full of food in front of us and we were in the middle of eating (chewing) when she rudely addressed us. I had an obvious look of confusion written all over my face and she then quickly said, "I\'ll give you up to 5 minutes, then you must leave" --- Wow, who talks like that? I was in utter shock that our server was so extremely abrasive. We were just trying to enjoy the rest of our dinner and didn\'t know that they wanted us out of the restaurant by 9 pm - no one told us that! How does "buffet line closes at 9" = "you must get out by 9"?!\n\nWe quickly tried to finish chewing so we can get the heck out of there and then another gentleman rushed up to us and yelled at us, "just to let you know, you have less than 2 minutes to leave." ---seriously? You can\'t even approach us with kindness and professionalism? I was beyond infuriated at that point and also still so confused as to how the staff here carried themselves with such poor etiquette. \n\nWith hindsight, I understand that it was major negligent miscommunication between the staff and my party, but even so, that\'s never an appropriate reason to mistreat your guests or speak to them like they are livestock. \n\nAlso, to rub a pound of salt into our wounds - I didn\'t even know we could have unlimited beer/wine during our buffet - none of the servers or staff informed us. I just ordered a coke and our waitress never even came back to refill it! My glass was empty 15 minutes into eating there and I had to get up and go look for her and ask her if I may get a refill. Of course she forgot to refill it, so I had to get another server to refill it for me. Finally, my server waltzes up with my refilled coke. It was an extremely annoying dinner to say the least.'

S'Ohh mahh godd! I had been hearing about the M Resort\'s Buffet for some time and had been wanting to try it badly. First of all, it\'s called Studio B, not the M buffet (very helpful hint because googling "M buffet" doesn\'t get you anywhere). Coming out to Studio B is definitely out of the way when you\'re staying and partying on the strip, but it is soo worth that 15 minute drive. \n\nWe happen to come on a Sunday around lunch (technically, the seafood bunch for $29.99 per person) and there was a hefty line. I was already pretty hungry, but the line moved pretty quickly and in 30 minutes we had a table and were on our way to the food. \n\nThe food selection is huge! It snakes around with so many choices, different cuisines, so much variety. My bf and I have to survey all our choices before filling our plates. There is a lot of seafood choices, some American choices, a salad bar, good meat and fish selections, and then an Asian section. What is unique about the Asian section is that is actually broken down into different Asian cultures including Japanese, Thai, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian (not really Asian, but whatever), and more? Everything looked delicious, but of course, there isn\'t room for everything. \n\nThe outstanding and the must have: \n-Crab legs. They had crab legs, 3 different styles! Jack-friggin-pot. Steamed, chilled, or cooked with an asian ginger sauce. All three were yummy. The ginger sauce was extremely messy, though. My friend noted that the chilled legs didn\'t taste watery or taste like they had recently been defrosted like some other places. A note to my primary care physician: there is a high possibility that I developed gout after this buffet.\n-Eggplant parmesan. I don\'t know why I really loved this, but it was sure tasty.\n-Dessert. Definitely leave room for the desserts! They were all amazing, but especially the gelato and the pistachio shooter. My friends also really liked the brownie that they topped with gelato, but I was too full to try it. \n-Sushi. Usually I avoid buffet sushi because they are overloaded with rice and are usually low quality rolls. Studio B serves large pieces of sushi that looked fresh and tasted delicious. \n\nThe good and repeatable: \n-Prime rib. Good, solid prime rib, but not the best I have ever had. \n-Salad choices. The had many salad choices and all were very flavorful especially the antipasto.\n-Sweet potatoes. yum yum yum. anyone else ready for thanksgiving?\n-Shrimp. We had the Wynn buffet the night where their shrimp look like they are on steroids. Studio B has good sized shrimp, though. \n-Mussels. The ones topped with mayo and cheese (i think?). Delicious.\n-Cappuccino bar. Great way to end the meal!\n\nThe only two things I didn\'t like here:\n-The bathroom is outside. Whyy so far and so inconvenient. Buut I guess this fault is forgivable.\n-Oysters. I was excited to see oysters, but they were small and tasted fishy and gritty. I\'ll pass on these next time. \n\nBy the way, did I mention unlimited beer and wine is included with the meal?! Unheard of! You might want to take two strategies here: 1) forego the excess liquid to maximize food space OR 2) eat, drink, and enjoy the buffet for as long as humanly possible. Either way, you\'ll get your money\'s worth! I personally couldn\'t drink much alcohol right before the drive back to LA, but I tried their root beer on tap and that was dark, creamy, and tasty!\n\nStudio B is the buffet where you get the most for your money in terms of food quality and food diversity. The giant TV screens that line the wall and the overall cleanliness of the place are added touches. You won\'t be disappointed!'

S"BEST. BUFFET. EVER.\n\nMind you, I travel to Vegas about 3-4 times a year, and resided there for more than one... So, I'm PRETTY sure I've tried every buffet on and off the strip at least once (or even twice) in my life. (True fatty, I know.)\n\nOnce you've tried the Vegas or Henderson buffets more than once, you'll notice that most of them serve the same foods... in the same style... with the same taste. There's nothing wrong with that, considering all Vegas buffets are pretty good and satisfactory.. But if you want to try something different, definitely go for this gem.\n\nTheir presentation is quite classy for an all-you-can-eat restaurant. They serve a huge selection of food, and the quality of it all is evident. Rarely did I see an empty platter during my round trips to the food bar. The chefs behind the bars are friendly, too. During my last Studio B visit, I was addicted to their sashimi salad. Every time I walked back to get more, I always caught the salad chef making a fresh batch to serve.\n\nThe best time to go to Studio B is during the weekend-- It's when they serve their Seafood Brunch & Seafood Dinner. But, you may have to wait in line for almost an hour since it's currently one of Vegas' popular buffets. It's also a little more pricey compared to most Vegas buffets, but it's worth it. I PROMISE."

S"Chicagoan visiting here. Wow, I have been there 2 times this year and both times failed to disappoint! I am in love with their endless choices of seafood, meats and fresh veggies. \n\nI'm not much of a crab leg person as my friends/family but this buffet has plenty of great options for you if that is the case! I opted for their shrimp and prime rib, (my fav) and everything else in between. You really have to pace yourself because it is impossible to try everything they have without drowning yourself, that or a heart attack, whichever comes first.\n\nThen there are the desserts!! O...M...G.... the desserts! For someone who has a much of a sweet tooth as I do, this was indeed pure  HEAVEN. They have all your regular stuff like cheese cake, cookies,  brownies, etc. But then you move along the line and you see these cute little dessert cups nicely decorated and seemingly made just for you. Yes, you!!  There's a fruit and custard/yogurt one, a tiramisu, one with banana... Yum. The best part is, they are small so you can sample more without wasting or feeling as bad when you grab every....single... one to try. heheh...Really, at this point there is no turning back, you may as well go FTW! Then there is also creme brulee and flan (fav), and gelato at the very end (another fav). \n\nOverall, I cannot think of any negatives of Studio B, except that I wish my stomach would stretch to accommodate my visits to you. And also that you would move to Chicago..*sigh*til next time Vegas!!!"

Just don't try and double fist it, they'll only serve you one drink at a time.\n\nLoads of crablegs, both hot and chilled. These seemed to be the main attraction. Also sushi, pizza, asian, and american sections, and a great dessert selection. Pretty much everything under the sun. You really get what you pay for with this buffet, but I still prefer the Feast at the Stations properties for about half the price."

But the food made up for it. I LOVED the oysters! No limit on how many you can take. Thank goodness!! The soup was amazing and the gelato ice cream all you can eat!! Yum! \n\nI loved how we can get wine or any type of alcohol at the buffet which is all included with the price. I probably had 4 plates yea I know but I can't help it.

I only ate that! The dessert bar has gelato! That was a nice departure from the normal soft serve and ice cream. \n\nSo not to repeat what the other have said, here's my recap:\n\nPros:\n-Good quality food for the price\n-The dessert bar was so good!\n-Free alcohol with your meal\n-Newer facility, newer hotel, quiet location\n\nCons:\n-Can get very busy, so go early to avoid lines\n-Not an easy buffet to navigate. You have to walk all the way around to get to places. No cutting through\n-15-20 mins from the strip, but this is only a con if you're staying near the strip =)"

There was so much variety ranging from Italian, to Japanese, to Mexican, to American, to beer, to wine, to gelato, to cup cakes, to cookies, to macaroons.  There was just so much food, I couldn't eat it all.  I would say the best is the meat, but that's because I'm a guy and I like my protein.  There was so much desert, by the time I was half way done, my plate was full and I couldn't add anymore.  I got to the end (best part) where there was a ton of ice cream and gelato.  Great! Amazing! Delicious!  \n\nThe price for lunch was $15.99 which isn't bad for an all you can eat and all you can drink buffet.  I couldn't even drink that much because I didn't want to get full off the beer.  They had a bunch of wine choices, beer, and others.  Give it a try, especially if your there for lunch."

This cost also includes all you can drink wine and beer from tap like Cidar, Bud, etc.\n\nI was very impressed with the selection and taste of the food here. I was really surprised how good the Thai food was, especially the Pad Thai, the curry, and the Panang Beef. Yum! \n\nThe dessert section was also very exceptional.

At least they serve sashimi, which isn't always present at other buffets\n-Roasted mahi mahi on their cutting board. Never seen fish on a cutting board, but this one is good!\n-Decent BBQ short ribs and clam chowder\n-Unlimited beer/wine, no champagne\n-They play Worst Cook in America here on the big screen\n-Good salads (who eats salads at a Vegas buffet...laying the bedding for the food.)\n-Interesting dessert selection\n-No one was manning the coffee station :(\n\nI waited over 1.5 hours for this buffet, and apparently from other yelp reviews, that wasn't too bad.\n\nThe people who eat here seem really into other people's business. Don't laugh at my enormous plate of crab legs. Seriously, let me eat in peace.\n\nThis place is great. For under $30 a person, with all that they offer, this is the best bang for your buck. The hotel is beautiful and the buffet is no exception. If the opportunity arises and the wait isn't too bad, I would definitely come back here again.

Studio B has a vast selection of foods here.  I got to have some hummus, tabouli, artichokes, diff salads, sides.  I looooved the crab legs here.  I'm not usually a fan bc I hate eating cold crab legs.  But here they have warmed crab legs which made them so much more delicious.  Like their Thai selection.  I was pleasantly surprised to have like all their thai curries!! Very good flavor. And I also loved their oxtail soup...NOM NOMZ!!!  And oddly enough, although I did not think any of their other asian dishes were worth more than a spoonful...I liked their California rolls!! Usually I don't even waste my time on CA rolls but I think that they used fresh crab so it was SUPER tasty. \n\nNote: I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the prime rib & the mahi mahi.  I was expecting good things from what I saw from my plate but the fish was too dry & the meat wasn't as melt-in-my-mouth tender as I'd like it.  But I guess you can't always get it right everyday.\n\nThe dessert options were TO DIE FOR.  Loved their macaroons!!  Always a fave of mine.  I also enjoyed their crepes with chocolate sauce & brownie bits.  Liked the cheesecake...and how could I forget...THEIR GELATO!!! They had about 12 flavors to choose from and I really liked their coffee flavor.  \n\n*****this is not only an all-you-can eat..but ALL-YOU-CAN DRINK!!! Unlimited beer & wine =]  Too bad you can't get drunk bc you'll too full of food.  But the sheer fact that they have this option is great.  Plus, wine & beer is always nice when you are stuffing your face. \n\nLoved this place!! I'd consider it one of my Top 5 buffets!!!"

I used to love the Wynn buffet, but this place has so much more variety and they probably taste the stuff they make.\n\nNowhere else can you find pad thai, chow fun, and sweet potatoes. I was amazed at the selection! I had eight plate fulls before I finally left after two hours. =) \n\nThey also include free beer and free coffee drinks (espresso, cappuccino, etc). You just have to get up and get it yourself. \n\nThe dessert bar is the best I've tried. Love the little dessert cups, but the mango and coconut sorbet was probably the best.

The food was better too! They now have sashimi salad which was my favorite item of the place (aside from the snow crabs).\n\nthey also have this Thai section, which i thought was pretty good for a buffet. the pad thai was cooked well. \n\n\nand server Choy is awesome.

Ambiance was terrific.  \n4.  The layout of the seating area, and the buffet area was very cool.\n5.  The place was so clean.\n6.  Service by the waitress was exemplary.\n7.  There were so many food choices that had a beautiful presentation.\n8.  The desserts were terrific, and the perfect size so nothing wasted.\n9.  There was no long wait for paying to get in.\n\nNegatives:\n1.  No wait for paying, but 20 minute wait to be seated!!!  There were only 5 of us.\n2.  The food tasted ordinary!  \n3.  There was no "WOW" factor to any entrees I sampled!\n4.  This is voted "Best Buffet in Las Vegas" by many publications so I had very high hopes for the place.  Suffice it to say, my expectations were not even remotely met!!\n\nOverall, the buffet is pretty good.  I just expected so much more!!  Especially after hearing so many positive comments about the place from friends and family.  \n\nThe one section that I did like (besides the beer and wine) was the dessert section!  The gelato flavors were terrific, and their pecan tart was very very good!\n\n3 stars for now because I am not yet a fan.  I\'ll try them again in the future though.'

S"I visited Studio B during my second visit to Las Vegas. I typically HATE buffets, because random people hovering over the food I'm about to eat skeeves me.  BUT, I really enjoyed Studio B.  For $36 you get to eat pretty much any type of food you can think of, and you get unlimited wine and beer, including sparkling wine for mimosas.  \n\nThe resort is a bit off the beaten path.  If I remember correctly, it's about 15 minutes away from the main part of the strip, but it is easily accessible by car with plenty of parking. The atmosphere is very nice for a buffet, and we were seated in a section in the far back with a beautiful view.    If you have a chance, take a walk around to the main lobby where they have floor to ceiling flowers that are beautiful and smell amazing.\n\nThe buffet has great sneeze guards and is refreshed often, so it's not a messy pile of slop like I expected.   I was a bit disappointed by their dessert selection, but after 3 visits to the buffet I didn't have much space left anyway.   The best part? ALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB.

The Osso Bucco is as hard as leather.  Pad Thai too spicy.  Crab legs are very thin and hardly have any meat.  Oysters and shrimp are ok.  One Plus is that beer and wine are included.

S'I hadn\'t been to a buffet in a while. I sort of out grew them a few years back. It\'s just massive hoarding and chowing down and you leave feeling "ugh". My family was in town and they had heard good things about the Studio B Buffet at the M Casino. I had been out at the M Casino once before just to take a look around. Seemed like a nice enough place but didn\'t eat anything. Since they wanted to try it we thought why not. \n\nWe ventured out on a Saturday night. The line was huge, took about 45 minutes to get in and we got there around 8:30. When we got in I realized what I had been missing. \n\nThere is so much variety of food. It reminded me of the Rio buffet with all the different things to eat. It\'s sort of pricey but what buffet isn\'t? It was about $28 per person (maybe a little more, little less) but after abstaining for so long it felt good to try a new buffet. Too many different types of foods to mention here. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to try a buffet off the strip.'

You will not be disappointed.  Tasted so damn good that I didn't even want au jois or A1 or Tabasco.  I didn't want to spoil the taste with other sauces, even if they help enhance it. Best Prime rib I have ever eaten, melts in your mother fucking mouth! *WARNING*  Do not, I repeat Do NOT, start with this dish first, it will ruin everything else in the buffet for you because it is so damn good.  By the end of my meal I went back for seconds.\n\n#2 Mac and Cheese One of the best Mac and Cheeses I have ever tasted.  Enough said.\n\n#3 Maybe the Green Sauce and Pork in the Mexican section, this was pretty good, soft pieces of pork.\n\nOther dishes that stood out was the sweet mashed potatos with marshmallows, Clams, Mussels, and Tempura Shrimp.\n \nEverything else was so-so.  Even so it is still one of the buffets you must hit up.  I'm not sure if it is the best in Vegas, but I was not disappointed.\n\nThe deserts:  Chocolate Rice Krispies and Gelato.  The Ice Cream was great.\n\n$26 a person on a Weekday, free Wine and Beer.\n\nBy the end of the meal I was so full I wanted to throw up.  We went for a feast and left more than satisfied.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that it is far away.  Other than that, everyone that comes to Vegas must go at least once in their life."

S"Wow.  It's 9:30 on a Monday evening and I am fighting the urge to just completely zone out and fall asleep.  Why might I be so tired?  I just got back from a ridiculous weekend in Vegas.  Yet, despite my exhaustion, I feel compelled to start my reviews.  So over the next few reviews, you will see a sort of travel journal.  Hope that this review turns out to be coherent.\n\nHaving arrived in Vegas on Saturday afternoon, my friends and I decided that the first course of action should be to grab some dinner.  My dear friend and facilitator, Monica D., suggested that we hit up this seafood buffet.  Being an avid fan of both seafood and eating way too much, I was more than happy to try this place out.  \n\nFirst off, let me say that in most instances, I've been pretty disappointed with Vegas buffets.  The last buffet I went to was the Spice Market and I didn't even bother writing a review about that place.  Well, this certainly isn't the case with Studio B Buffet at the M Casino and Resort.  The food here was surprisingly good.  In most instances, the food was at least on par with standard restaurant fair.  Granted there are a few things that seem more buffet fair, that was definitely more of an exception than the norm.  \n\nA few highlights from this buffet:\n\nOysters:  I love oysters.  While I had my fair share here at this buffet, little did I know that this would be a reoccurring theme throughout the weekend (you'll see what I mean later).  I'm pretty sure I've done my part in attempting to commit genocide against these delicious little mollusks. \n\nCrab legs:  Delicious.  Dipped in butter these crab legs were sweet and flavorful.  It also didn't hurt to watch my friend Craig struggle to get these things open only to end up having one explode all over the place.  Let's just say that he probably was wearing more of it than he actually ate.\n\nClam chowder:  Seriously, this chowder was a CHOWDA (say it Frenchy!  It's chowda!).  Thick, rich, and packed with flavor, I would be happy eating this chowder at any restaurant.  \n\nDessert bar:  Banana crepes? Yes please.  I love banana crepes and these were fantastic.  Almost a bananas foster atop a delicious crepe, I devoured mine and would have gone back for another if there were even an iota of space in my already food pregnant stomach.  They also have a bunch of other desserts, all of which were pretty damn good.\n\nBeer and wine bar/Espresso bar:  What?!?  You mean to tell me that beer and wine are included with my meal?  Yes, yes it does.  And to put things over the top they also have an espresso bar.  You can add shots of Amaretto, Bailey's, and some other things to your shot of espresso if you feel so inclined.  I know I did.  Two espresso shots with Bailey's for me please.  Ain't nothing better than mixing a stimulant and a depressant together to get your evening started right.\n\nAnyway, by this point you probably get the point.  This buffet, while out of the way from the strip is well worth the trip.  I'll definitely be coming back.  Also, another perk -  there are a lot of really cute Asian girls here.  Go figure, little Asian girls and seafood?  Who would have thunk it?"

S"Love this buffet, they even had mimosa and champagne! Overall the food was ok for brunch. We came here versus going to Bacchanal because it was on our way back to Cali and the line wasn't super duper long. Love it, service was pretty good, but it took awhile for us to get seated and get our drinks ordered, otherwise, the extensive array of food made it almost impossible to try everything. For the most part the food was good, I really enjoyed the beef roast, the pad thai, their sesame chicken. The dessert section was delicious, they had creme brulee, an assortment of mousses, and tiramisu, which I enjoyed the most. The creme brulee was also super yummy. And my friend, who is a fan of flan, said it was probably one of the best flan's she's tasted. Again, I'm not a fan of flan, but anyone who is, may want to definitely come try it. Gelatto was also delicious, but less creamy than the ones I've tasted, I liked the pistachio flavor the most only because they had small bits of real pistachio in it.\n\nThey even had a bar where you can order champagne and wine. I got the mimosa, and it was a bit strong for me, luckily I just diluted i with more orange juice. To order drinks, just bring your ID over. Great thing about this place is that you can go to the restroom and come back, the workers don't say anything to people coming and going.\n\nFor me I would rather go at night then in the day. We pay $40 per person for the brunch menu, but I feel like there could have been more of an assortment of seafood. The only thing I really enjoyed seafood wise were the mussels with the mayonnaise. Everything else was mediocre for me."

S"For sure, I had to go here for lunch since more people have gone for dinner. The lines are still long!  I asked the server what she thought was the main difference = no sushi.  They had CA rolls but no fish on top of rice.  But I made do with poke (totally hit the spot), oxtail soup (ok), fried clams, sweet potatoes (exceptionally good), prime rib (deliteful), rotisserie chicken (piping hot as he just brought it out), thai curry with mussels (so so).  I sampled the hummus, baba ganoush, guac, salsa to find it was all very good.  I'm not going to name all the gourmet desserts I tried since they were all A1 & I will need to leave more room.  But with 3 people eating lunch, I could have a bite of many & with no repercussions!!!!  All exclaimed this was a worthy lunch buffet (esp since it's a hike from the LV 'burbs)."

S'Even though this place is off the strip in M hotel and resort, for a $33 Saturday Dinner - It was all you can eat and all you can drink alcohol! Yes! All you can drink pale ale, cider, and three different wines.  In addition to this, they have a coffee bar where you can get unlimited cappuccinos, espressos, or cafe lattes with any addition of Bailey\'s!  mMmMmMm!  This is one of the best buffets that I have been to in Vegas!  Amazing!  \n\nIn terms of food, they have the "World" theme of variety just like the Rio with a touch of Bellagio\'s and Wynn\'s classic buffet!  What was exceptional? They had amazing SNOW CRABS - served both warm and cold!  I also recommend their Tri-Tip steak along with their Prime Rib with their special sauce! mMmMm - Thumbs up!  All of this went super well with the bartender\'s "moscato" concoction of cider and splash of pink zinfandel! Thumbs up! \n\nIn terms of dessert, I highly recommend their coconut pudding with mango and pineapple sauce topped with raspberry and blueberries! It was so good, I had three of those after my mountains of steak and snow crabs!  It also went well with my cafe lattes!  I also recommend finishing up their draft rootbeer - RootBeer Float style!  You just get the rootbeer from the beer section and take it to the dessert section!  Did I mention that this place had the best service that I ever had at a buffet?  Thumbs up all the way!'

S'Hey...let\'s take a 25 minute drive from the strip to go to a buffet. That was my pick-up line to take a woman to dinner, actually my fiance, but no matter we had nothing else to do for dinner. \n\nWhen this hotel first opened back in \'08, studio b was a hit, the line going beyond the provided stanchions I would have put "five on it" if I was a yelper back then, but  since my recent visit last month, I was somewhat disappointed.  They didn\'t switchout or refill the choices as you would expect.\n\nThe best parts of the buffet are that all you can drink wine and beer are included with your meal, yes i repeat wine and beer are included with your meal (but I think it is a ploy to load up on beer so you don\'t waste food) the prime rib and yes of course the desserts!

S"I don't know why I didn't write a review earlier.  We really enjoy the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort.  We go at least once whenever we are in Vegas.  Even though the M Resort is off the strip, the line up for the buffet especially for the seafood buffet on weekend can be verrrrry long.  The food quality is top notch, except for the sushi.  I don't care for it since the sushi rice tends to be too cold.  The mac 'n cheese is one of my favorite dishes here though they tend not to serve it when they have the seafood buffet.  The prime rib is good too since if you are patient, you can get a medium rare piece but they disappear fast.  My last trip out I had the seafood buffet comp'd so I really indulged in the fresh oysters and the crab legs (which I am glad were not salty).\n\nThey have a really good assortment of desserts but my favorite is the ice cream counter. \n\nService is generally really good to excellent most times we have been.  The wait staff works hard at clearing the tables and getting drinks.\n\nDefinitely recommend Studio B if you want to wander away from the strip.  M Resort also has some really fun slot machines to play before and after dinner - BONUS!"

And yes, an inordinate amount of Asian families. But unlimited wine/beer? And crab legs for days?! I say yes to Studio B Buffet a million times over. For only $30, you can pig out on crab legs, paella, oysters, mussels, sushi, and tempura. There is also a breakfast section open until 3 pm and a selection of Italian food.  \n\nThe dessert was also great - but stay away from the pies. They're old and taste stale. Otherwise, I loved the cream puffs, tiramisu, and chocolate souffle (which was more like an airy cake and not very soft). \n\nThis is a great value buffet compared to what you find on the strip. I definitely ate more than $30 worth of crab. Just make sure you're sober enough to enjoy it all!"

It's a good value for sure, but when there's so much in Vegas to do why would I want to stand in a line for an hour and a half like I'm in Disneyland? To be fair, it wasn't an unbearable wait since I helped myself to the complimentary soft drinks on the casino floor and brought some back for my family also.\n\nNow onto the food, the most noticable feature of this buffet is the free beer and wine, which is nothing short of awesome. Now granted, the beer was cheap PBR and coors light but I'm not complaining. The food, however, I found to be quite lacking. The first prime rib slice I got was way too rare and hardly looked like it was cooked at all. The second slice I got was good and made up for it, however. The salads looked unremarkable and the pizza looked worse than the stuff you get in a school cafeteria, so needless to say I tried neither. The selection of food was pretty good, with varying degrees of success. The desserts were very good, though not great. \n\nOverall, this is a great looking, high value buffet but for those of you who value your time more than your money, take a pass."

The price was comparable with the other high end casinos on the strip, but the food here was much more impressive.  I love the open atmosphere and inviting feel of this place.  The lines can get quite long so  make sure to get there early.  This place beats the price on my favorite buffet, the Bucannal at Cesears Palace.  The food comes a close second.

S'Food: Every time I come here, the quality of the food goes down. This place is definitely living off of its former glory. This buffet started off being pretty spectacular, but it is now just average. Of course the price of the buffet still keeps inching upwards. The one thing going for this place is that they have unlimited beer and wine. They do have one decent beer on tap every time that I\'ve been here.\n\nThey used to give you crab shelling tools, but now their crab legs are pre-opened for easier consumption. Go for the steamed crab legs, they\'re better than the cold ones. The pile of cocktail shrimp is always a mess.\n\nThe carving station is still pretty decent. They have sausages, turkey, and prime rib. The omelette station is pretty popular if you come for brunch.\n\nService: The cashiers are pretty friendly. But when it comes to those bussing your table... they have a look on their faces that says, "I hate my job". They do come by often and do a good job though, so I can and will excuse the sourpuss face. :) The people at the carving station have a hard time understanding English when I asked for a rare piece of prime rib.\n\nLocation: Nice location inside the M Resort. It\'s away from the hustle and bustle of The Strip. Parking is much easier here.'

American, Asian, Italian, Soul food...you name it and they'll pretty much have it. It's quantity that doesn't sacrifice quality. Steaks aren't sitting under warming lamps for hours until they get dry and rubbery. Sushi runs out fast so they whip up a new batch every 5 minutes. The variety is pleasantly overwhelming - you'll almost feel encouraged to try every single thing you see (which I've done) even food you won't normally eat.\n\nThe line gets extremely long so you have to get here at an odd time. Otherwise, you'll be standing in line for hours and I'm not kidding!"

S"This really is among Las Vegas' best when it comes to the city's iconic culinary experience -- the buffet.\n\nStudio B hits on multiple levels.  The food selection is right there with The Rio.  Probably not too surprising considering the people behind M Resort also created The Rio 20 years ago.  Italian, Mexican, American, Asian, protein, vegetarian, seafood and dessert.  All of the popular food groups are represented and not just with a taco section or spaghetti.  You'll find multiple dishes for each style of food.  Presentation is also a priority at Studio B.  When lesser buffets almost feel like a school cafeteria, you can see the quality and care from the chefs.  I can't imagine that's an easy task when cooking for hundreds.\n\nYou can also tell a lot of thought went into the layout.  Instead of a long, singular spread, the experience is almost Ikea-like in how you get a chance to see everything with seemingly little effort.  All the foods are well marked and well lit.  Plenty of space means it doesn't always feel like a feeding trough.  The decor is very modern and sleek.  There's even a wrap-around video screen although it looks like it's used more for promotion and marketing.  I wonder if they had the capability of showing live sports.  THAT would make this place radical.  There's also a VIP seating area with a great view.  But I think this is probably a better view at night with the strip lit up in the distance.  During the day it's just the undeveloped side of the M Resort grounds.\n\nFinal verdict: You can't go wrong."

S"Came here a few times recently with my Mom. She had 2-4-1 coupons to use here. The decor is pleasing and open enough that one will probably not notice anything but the food. There are large screens mounted above the buffet line showing various things like Food Network. There is a bit of a wait sometimes, but that is fairly normal for a buffet in vegas. The selection is quite large. Instead of usual buffet line lining the outside of the room. Studio B takes more of a wavy, bell curve approach with the dessert section off to the other side of the entrance. A plus to note, they do offer free beer and wine included with the buffet price. Since I don't drink I don't take advantage of that portion of the buffet nor can I vouch for that part. For drinkers I'd think that adds a bit of extra value to the experience.(Long as you're not the one having to drive after!)\nThere was one odd experience. One item offered once was ginger stir-fried crab legs. They were grabbed up quickly each time it was refilled. The odd part was it seemed the cook was instructed only to refill the fairly small tray only every so often. We were there at least 30min, maybe 1hr at most. It was only filled twice.\nI was stuck at about 3.5 stars for this review but gave it the bump up since the service everytime was very good. Refilling drinks, taking away used plates and everyone in between."

S"It all started with a plan...a plan to try their dinner buffet for $23.99 on a weeknight with unlimited beer and wine. I can't possibly say no to that, can you? That was the first thing on our agenda coming in to Vegas from Orange County. Traffic happened and we got delayed, let's say 3 hours delayed form our original plan. We called to inquire what time they would put away the food if we came right at 9pm which is their closing time. We were assured over the phone that we will have more than enough time as long as we get to pay before the clock strikes 9.\n\nAfter holding our breaths and skipping out on stops for a bathroom break, we finally made it to Studio B just 3 minutes shy before closing. Whew! \n\nThe place wasn't busy at all so I wonder why it took a while for them to take us to our table. Our table was finally ready but our chairs were wet and sticky. I asked for them to replace the chairs but the server assured me it was only water so she wiped it off and left it there for me to sit on. Eek!\n\nWhen our server greeted us, we were assured once again to take our time with the food because they'll have it out until around 10pm. I heard him but as I was going through my rounds, I decided to get everything I wanted before sitting down to eat. I literally had 3 plates in front of me and a bowl of soup before I started digging in. \n\n30 minutes in and they started shutting off the lights and pulling out the dishes from the buffet. You're kidding right?! If I had listened to our server and the person who answered the phone, we would've been screwed, big time! \n\nThe rest of our party was quite upset. We had other dishes we would've wanted more of or some to try. I didn't even get the chance to hit the dessert area. Although that one closed later, I was too busy eating my main dishes before it got cold. Unlimited beer and wine alright but guess what? I only got one glass of cider. Boo!\n\nIf we all lived in a perfect world and we got here on time, I would've been able to muster a 3.5 stars for the price and value. \n\nTheir oxtail soup is one of the best I've had. The hot and sour soup was something I went back for while their prime rib was dry and a bit rubbery. Everything else was forgettable. Ok food + fair service + horrible experience = 2 stars.

You may see people paying within 30 minutes of getting in line, but then there\'s the wait for a seat. After you leave ask yourself if it was worth the 75 minutes you waited. \nThe food hasn\'t changed in three years. There\'s no attempt at sourcing what\'s in season. Why bother with watermelon in November when you could instead replace it with another seasonal dish, even if it meant one less fresh fruit?\nThe sushi is bad. All of the sushi on Buffets is bad. Stop acting like its something special and get out to a place that serves sushi. \nThe pizza is bad, and it\'s easy to cook good pizza, especially if its something you serve every night of the year for three years straight. \nThere\'s no effort given to the espresso drinks made at the desert counter. Look at the pitcher they are steaming the milk in and the steaming wand. It\'s disgusting - it should be made with fresh milk and clean equipment each time. \nThe bread is stale. They put out way too much and it gets stale. Period. \nFrozen crab legs and defrosted shrimp aren\'t anything special. They sell these in your grocers freezer and you just thaw them. Stop acting like you\'ve died and gone to heaven and stop piling them 16" high on your plate. You can always come back and get more. \nThe plates are hot and ruin the already bad cold dishes they have. Warm lettuce? No thanks. \nTheir Asian dishes have fancy names, but they aren\'t that good. Seriously, as you eat them, ask yourself if you\'d ordered this in a restaurant if you\'d ever go back to get it again.\n\nThere are a few pluses which set them apart from comparably priced buffets in LV:\nFree booze. That\'s a nice touch. \nEasy to get really rare, bloody prime rib, which I do love. \nDecent cheese and olive selection. \nThe raw oysters are a nice find on seafood night. \n\nDo try this place if there\'s a short line.

S'"Woohoo!  As good as it gets!"\n\n"Best Buffet in Vegas!"\n\nReally, believe what you hear about this place.  It really is the best buffet in Las Vegas.  A friend told me to check it out if I loved seafood so I decided to give it a try a few Sundays ago. They\'ve got a weekend seafood buffet for about $29.99. It\'s on par pricewise with the buffets near the strip so I didn\'t mind too much. \n\nWhen I got seated I noticed that the room was really open and has a nice ambiance to it. I believe this is one of the newer hotels so the dining area seemed very modern and new itself. It isn\'t stacked with variety like the Rio Buffet but what other place is, right?  \n\nThey\'ve got a good selection of food. Not too much, not too little. What I do love about this place is the quality of the food that they have. This place is amazing as far as seafood is concerned. They\'ve got ice stacked on three stations filled with crab legs, oysters, and shrimps. They\'ve also got all the necessary condiments and flavoring to go with it. Melted butter with lemons go GREAT with crab legs. \n\nThey\'ve also got a good selection of other foods. I didn\'t take a tasting of their French toast as well as their Thai delicacies. \n\nOverall I would probably say this is the best buffet to go to in Vegas.

S'No idea how this place gets voted best Vegas buffet, or anywhere on anyone\'s top 10 list.\n\nWe had the seafood buffet, where there was a large variety of items, all made by school cafeteria cooks. All the meats were well, well done and dry, and you had "hot" crab legs that had simply been baking under heat lamps for hours, not actually fresh out of a boiling pot like any other place.\n\nThey were slow and skimpy with nicer foods - the carvers at the meat stations would take frequent breaks and let a line build up, and the sushi section was simply empty and unstocked 4 out of 5 times I passed by.  There were several sections on the right side that were *labeled* with nicer foods like smoked salmon or trout, but had been simply replaced by salads instead. Crepes were pre-made and pre-packaged with toppings, and they only give you a 1/4 slice of a crepe at that. My standard drink is an orange juice at buffets, which every other has a real version of - the M Resort served up some hideous Sunny D from concentrate concotion.\n\nThe waiter service wasn\'t very attentive, and both us and the table next door ended up stacking about 25 plates on an empty nearby table before someone came to pick them up.\n\nThat hasn\'t even gotten to the $40 per person cost for lunch, for which they tack on the mandatory cost of alcohol even if you don\'t drink. That\'s in the same category of the Bellagios and Wynns and Caesar\'s of Vegas, all of which are more centrally located and actually serve decent food. The line also took about an hour, at around 2-3 on a Saturday.\n\nIf you\'re looking for a buffet and nowhere close to the strip, go to a buffet at one of the Station casinos - it\'s a $7.99 (vs. $40) lunch and the food is hands-down BETTER.'

No smoke smell (yet.. this is a new hotel, and maybe the smoke hasn't settled in yet, maybe they have a good ventilation system?).\n\nWe got to the buffet at around 11am and there were maybe 6 people ahead of us. As soon as we got our seats, there were 50 people in line - we got lucky. It was about $30 for lunch.\n\nThe food was REALLY good! They had an infinite amount of king crab legs! There was a lot of REALLY good food including: Adobo Chicken, Noodles, Oysters, Sushi, Chicken, Meat, etc - I didn't really spend too much time there because I was too busy filling up on the crab legs - cold and hot.\n\nThey would get 5 stars just because of two simple facts: 1. unlimited king crab legs. 2. all-you-can-drink wine and beer!!!!!!!!\n\nWORTH EVERY PENNY!\n\nWe even saw Chris Anderson from the Denver Nuggets there!\n\nAnd if you Tweet about the @MResort, they WILL respond back!"

I use to love the oysters here; that was the main reason I came but now it's frozen and tasteless.  I walked around the whole buffet three times and it was dufficult to find anything that was above standard.  The only thing that was good anymore is the seafood salad in the Asian food section.  I am not quite sure what happened but I will definitely not come back for a very long time.

S"We waited two hours for this buffet although they did give us a ticket to come back when the line died down so we ended up wandering around the casino for a hour and then standing in line for the second hour. Studio B has a very unique setting. There is a TV studio inside and lots of TV screens all over the place. They were showing some show with Guy Fieri on the screens when we were there. The buffet is in the main room and faces the studio. A side room that is a little further from the buffet has windows with a spectacular view, especially at night. Some people waited a little longer to be sat in there.\n\nThe food is very good. We were there on seafood night so there were more seafood options. While the fancier dishes were good, it was some of the simpler items that really stood out. In particular, I really enjoyed the mac and cheese and the tomato bisque. The only disappointing section was the Asian food section. Everything tasted like there was too much sauce. Maybe it was an off night since usually Las Vegas buffets have good Asian sections due to it being a popular tourist destination for Asian tourists. The dessert line is poorly designed. Long lines form for the ice cream and coffee bar so thoe who just want to grab a cookie, slice of cake, or some of the very good flan have to either wait or awkwardly ask if we can go ahead. Service was OK. Our server was really nice, but we could tell the poor guy was tired. They stayed open almost 2 hours past closing because of the long lines so we could tell he needed a break.\n\nI'm looking forward to hitting this place again, although I will make sure I get there super early next time to avoid the huge lines."

S"I have a love/hate relationship with all buffets, but after teetering between the two extremes, I have to say I love you Studio B! Out of all the buffets I've been to in Vegas, I have to say this one is definitely the best. It definitely beats Rio, Wynn, and Paris hands down (though I am still dying to try Wicked Spoon!) \n\nIt's best to go on Sunday's on your way home from Vegas (I refuse to eat a buffet on Friday's or Saturday's because I NEED to fit into my dresses ;P) and the wait wasn't too long for our party of 8. I think we got there around 1pm and waited about half an hour to be seated. Price was $29.99 per person and includes wine and beer. \n\nTruthfully, I didn't get to try out much because I filled myself up on the Asian food alone. I'm not much of a meat or seafood eater, so I gravitated towards all the carbs. Everything was pretty good from the pad thai to fried rice to chicken teriyaki and sushi! I also tried the pizza and breakfast items (eggs, waffles, pancakes) which all tasted good too. I have to say my favorite part of their buffet was definitely the dessert bar though. There was a huuuuuge variety of desserts (more than any other buffet I've been to) and all of them were sooo amazing! Huge variety of ice cream, yogurt, and sorbet as well.\n\nThis will definitely be my go-to buffet in town!"

S"I have been to this buffet many times and it is our normal stop as we drive into Vegas. I can say that I enjoyed it alot better before it became popular (especially with the locals) because the line can be well over 2 hours long.\n\nOur most recent trip to the buffet was on Christmas eve. We waited in line for over an hour and it was a total clusterf#$k. The line was unbelievably disorganized. The people who had already paid and were waiting to be seated were blocking the path of the people waiting to pay. Because of this the cashiers were not calling people up to the counter to pay and the line seemingly didn't move for an hour. I was scolded by the cashier when I dared to walk up to the counter without being summoned. Our total wait time was 1 1/2 hours, but when we were led into the dining room there were many empty tables. The line could move more efficiently if they would put some sort of system in place and possibly remodel the entrance to the buffet where people queue and pay.\n\nAside from the logistics, the buffet itself is good but not great. For the price it is a good value considering it includes all you can drink beer and wine. My favorite items at the buffet are the Tomato Basil soup and the sweet potatoes. I sat next to a man and watched him down 4 bowls of the tomato soup...it really is that good.\n\nOther than that the prime rib is good, and everything else is hit and miss. Like any other buffet some items are better than others. The desserts are good. There is a nice selection of cookies, pastries, and many different flavors of gelato. There is also an espresso bar where you can get drinks with Baileys, amaretto, Kahlua, etc.\n\nPersonally I think lunch is the best value at $14.95."

S"Kudos to the M for providing locals with one of the best overall buffet choices we have! This was my 2nd time at Studio B, and I tried to sample a variety from the amazing choices. Some standouts are the fresh salads & fruit (loved the beet salad and egg salad), the jambalaya, creamed spinach and chipotle corn. I also tried the fried rice with shredded pork, which I felt wasn't flavorful enough. \nYou can only eat so much, so I will have to return to try the Mexican dishes and more of the Asian choices. I did have room for dessert, so I sampled the creme brulee and bananas foster. Both were very good!\nThey still have the cappuccino/espresso bar, which is part of the dessert area, and you have to ask for one as there's no sign. I had cappuccino, which was decent. You also get free beer/wine, but I didn't have any so I can't comment on the types available."

Those were notable items, but everything seemed pretty average to me. It wasn't bad, but not something I was wow'd by. There was so much hype about this place, but in the end, it was just alright for me. Their desserts were really cute. Assorted desserts were in perfect portions. Just right to try everything. Actually, the dessert might have been the best part of the buffet. Everything else was mehhhhhh....haha.\n\nI'd come back, but maybe when the prices are normal or something. $40 for an OK buffet is not for me."

S'We almost had a crisis here. It was about 12:30pm on Father\'s day, and after some confusion about where the line started (there was a MOB of people in front of the place), we asked a service lady what to do and where to go to line up. She said they were closing the line for this wave of seating, and we had to instead get a "queue card" that would let us GET IN LINE at 3pm. \n\nWait up, say whaaaaat?! \n\nNormally this would have been a deal breaker, but this place is out in the middle of nowhere miles from the strip and any other decent buffets/restaurants. I think she sensed the desperation in my eyes...and she politely told us, "Well, the VIP line is also a line for people with disabilities. They won\'t ask what your disability is."\n\nCha-Ching! Baby was that money. We whisked into that line, which was considerably shorter. My shameless, plotting Chinese mind then immediately started coming up with reasons someone in our party had a disability...we ended up slightly embarrassing my boyfriend\'s dad by explaining he had just had a hip replacement (which was true!) and couldn\'t stand in line for that long. The cashier was suuuper nice and didn\'t even bat an eyelash. She took our money and 15 minutes later we were in -- saving ourselves lots of grief! I was a very giddy girl indeed. *Note this will probably not work if you are young and healthy with a bunch of your young and healthy friends..so get there early to avoid lines? This place has blown up in popularity!*\n\nNow, the next hour and a half are a blur for me.  \n\nI remember king crab legs...lots and lots of crab legs (again, I am Chinese people!)  With melted butter and lemon...MmM...lots of different Asian foods...pad Thai, Korean BBQ ribs, satay, cucumber salad, sushi, a REALLY good tuna salad...uMMm and the standard prime rib and different types of meat, poultry and fish. Not a big fan of their prime rib, twas a little dry. Desserts were all amazing...they had individual size hot chocolate lava cake..this itty bitty chocolate pudding cup with oreo crumbs on top..mMm..and all these ice cream flavors...and you could ask them to make you a dessert coffee drink with coffee liquors! Like Baileys and whatnot..I should have gotten something..but alas was too full. \n\nFor $25 a person this place is a steal! If staying on the strip, it\'s probably best to hit it on your way out...it\'s probably a good 20 minutes away!'

They don't have a silly rule like other buffets and kick you out before they serve the dinner menu. Why not save the extra bucks?\n\nOverall...How can you complain when beer and wine is included in the price? The cider is to die for. You basically get your money's worth when you come here.

I recommend going in an off hour, like maybe right when when dinner starts or on a weekday. We got there at 7 and the line was outrageous...and even if we wanted to stay in line we couldn't...a guy gave as a pass to come again at 8:30 and then we would have to wait in line again, and he warned us that the buffet would be over at 10...so basically it prob wouldn't even be worth it!  So, what I know is dinner is about 26$...free wine and beer! and they also have capuccino...and the lady at the rewards center told me that you can also tell them to add a shot of bailey's up in there!

S'Overall, this is a solid "local" casino buffet.  The layout is extremely well done, the decor is up to par with the rest of the casino, and the large tv display added a nice touch to the overall feel.  There are a ton of food choices.  The food itself was hit and miss; some of it was very good while some was fairly blah.  But with so much to choose from, you can easily fill yourself up with items that you truly enjoy.  The beer and wine station is definitely worth an extra star by itself (that\'s why I\'m giving it four).  The desserts are also of good quality.'

S'Was here on April 13th for dinner, been about 9 months since my last visit, price jumped to $39.99 for adults and $26.99 for kids.  I was disappointed this time around. I was here with my husband and 8 yr old kid.  When paying for our meals upfront, I told the cashier we have 3 people, she rudely asked if it\'s for 3 adults... I guess the obviously short 8 yr old minion that is with us looked like an adult. SMH.  After we were seated and got food, the quality of selection seem to have dropped from last year. It seemed more simplified, nothing fancy.  Our waitress (plate cleaner more like it) was also oblivious to my hand sawing the prime rib I got with a dull knife, after she had stopped by 3 times and I was already almost done with my prime rib I finally gave up asked if there were steak knifes and she said "yea".  Eh, after seeing my husband and I both having prime rib on our plates, wouldn\'t the first visit to our table ring a light bulb to get us steak knives anyways!?!  \n\nFood quality has gone down, the selection of unique food seems to be less.  I did not see some of the other dishes that they had 9 months ago.  For $115 for the 3 of us and the experience was very disappointing.  For that price I\'d rather just go to a steak house and have better food.  This time around, I was not impress, especially with the prices up, I would expect my experience this time around to be at least the same and was not.  Don\'t think I would come back again.'

S"A few years ago we vacationed in San Diego and had amazing chicken and waffles from Hash House A Go Go.  On our trip to Vegas, we kept with tradition and decided to go there for breakfast.  We went the same weekend of a college basketball tournament, so the place was packed.  The turnover seemed pretty fast, and we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  Their breakfast menu is intimidating, they have so many tempting options.  One tip, i remember from the past is that their portions are large.  We had been eating out all week, and i just wanted a simple meal.  I ordered the two egg breakfast with potatoes, bacon, and a biscuit.  The whole meal was bad, the only thing that was edible were the eggs.  The 2 measly strips of bacon had every drop of fat rendered out, it was way too crisp.  The potatoes, i did like the addition of the red onions, but they were bland, they needed seasoning. How do you name your self Hash House, and not serve amazing potatoes?   They have a biscuit or toast option, and i was never asked so i assumed they they would bring me toast, instead a very dense biscuit arrived.  My sister ordered the steel cut oatmeal with fruit, and as beautiful as it looked, it was poorly executed.  The banana was simply halved, and still had the peel on.  The melon was peeled but it was segmented into enormous pieces.  I don't think that when you eat out that you yourself should have to prepare you own meal.  Also, i don't know if this is standard or if someone in the kitchen was attempting art, but they smeared blackberries around the rim of the plate, it was very off putting.\n\nOverall, i was very disappointed at the lack of consistency within the restaurant chain.  I really hope that it was just an off day, because i  like what they stand for for and the dishes they are able to put out."

I did exactly that and shared my fried chicken eggs benedict with my boo thang. All in all it was very satisfying. What I can tell is that their fried chicken is very good. The batt contains corn flakes in it and the chicken stays juicy and moist yet fully cooked. In some ways the fried chicken is better than roscoe's (but that is up to debate, imo roscoe's) \n\nWhat was a pleasant delight was there BLT Bloody Mary. Containing a slice of bacon and lettuce (just because) and a side of toast.. honestly it probably was just the presentation of the bacon and toast added to the drink but it made the experience of drinking their bloody mary so much more enjoyable. Getting all of the Ooh and Aahs when served to my table was also nice, and quite honestly, the attention you get is half of the payoff, am i right?\n\nOur server had a crazy mohawk which was totally awesome, he was happy to answer questions about it also which was very nice of him. Ive been here a couple times and it has never disappointed. \n\nIf you don't know what to get, get the chicken and bacon waffles. It seems to be their most popular dish.

S'We have a Hash House in San Diego and the wait is always over 2 hours. I did it once, and swore I\'d never do it again. Because I refuse to do the wait, when we were in town visiting, my fianc\xc3\xa9 wanted to give Hash House a try since he\'s never been. \n\nWe came in on a Friday around 12 PM for brunch. We were quoted about 25 minutes before we could be sat. What\'s awesome about this location is that they have a bartender by the hostess who can make you drinks while you wait for  your table so you don\'t have to go up to the bar. I liked this idea!\n\nSince there was open seating at the bar, we decided to just hop up there and opt out of waiting for a table. I warned him that the portions are HUGE and since I didn\'t feel like walking out of there in a food coma, we should just share a plate. Judging by the two men seated next to us who looked like they were struggling to get another bite down, he decided to take my advice (smart guy lol).\n\nWe both ordered up Bloody Mary\'s- which were perfect- not too much horseradish ( I hate horseradish so the fact that it was in there and I couldn\'t taste it, was awesome), and perfectly spicy. Of course my fianc\xc3\xa9 opted to "man" up his Bloody Mary and ordered the BLT Bloody Mary.\n\nWe decided to share the chicken and waffles. The waffles had a strip of bacon in the center, another bonus for all you bacon lovers out there. The sage fried chicken was good, but the sage was WAY too over powering. \n\nOverall, it was decent- nothing crazy. The portion sizes are what draws people in but the taste is meh. \n\nI probably won\'t be back unless I\'m with a group of people who absolutely insist on coming and even then- I\'d probably just order a bloody marry.\nOh, a plus is the bartenders kicked ass!

S'Went for Brunch on my short stay in Vegas for a wedding. Had the highly favored Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Not a fan of sangrias, but they offer supposed great ones for $5 while you wait for your table by the hostess. Would definitely go back again!'

S"The portions are just ridiculous! Seriously ridiculous. My sister and I shared a plate of the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles and I don't see any other way to conquer that plate.  It comes with two large fried chickens (not chicken pieces, but a whole chicken) and 4 waffles.  All for $15, this was the best deal that we had in Vegas.\n\nOur concierge at the Bellagio recommended this place.  She called it the strip's hidden little secret, but it's not a secret because in the middle of the day, the wait time was 30-45 minutes.\n\nThe hostesses were very impersonable and really had an air about them as if we were bothering them by wanting to be seat.  Luckily, our waiter made up for the rude hostesses.  He was attentive and on point with the drink refills; Always appreciated when the Vegas weather is 115 degress outside.\n\nPlease make this one of your stops when in Vegas.  From the decor, various celebrities have endorsed and multiple food/cooking shows have featured this restaurant."

Tried 2 plates; the cheese burger and the eggs with biscuits and gravy.  Not worth the calories or the price.

The waitress will tell you ahead of time that they make all their food fresh and it'll come out as soon as it's done so it won't sit under heat lamps or anything. From the time you order, the wait could be equal to if not more than the wait to get seated.\n\n2) HUGE portions. It'd be safe to order one thing for every two people since the portions are so huge. Unless you were as hungry as I was, in which I nearly killed my whole plate.\n\nI ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was amazeballs.  Biscuits, fried chicken, eggs, cheese, bacon, chipotle gravy...not much to complain about.  I was going hard at it but hit a wall with probably 1/4 left.  This was also called the Man vs Food dish.\n\nGreat place, great food.  I'd go back, just not in the summer when the pools are open ;)"

S'I liked it enough, but my boyfriend thought it was sloppy. I got the Chourizo Hash and he got the HH Original Eggs Benedict.\n\nNow we\'re not terribly healthy people, so my boyfriend\'s "sloppy" feedback doesn\'t have anything to do with him being offended by the portion size. Trust me, he ate the whole damn thing Man vs. Food style. I guess there\'s just food that MAKES you fat and then there\'s food that makes you FEEL fat just by looking at it.\n\nOur waiter told me that the Chourizo Hash was the best hash they make, so that\'s what I got. It wasn\'t terribly spicy... pretty much perfect. Maybe too much for a hangover cure but good as a brunch item otherwise. The portion was huge and the potatoes were excellent.\n\nMy eggs were severely undercooked for over-medium... shoot, they were undercooked for sunny side up. I ate them anyway with no ill effects.\n\nI enjoyed the presentation of mine (obviously the boyfriend was nauseated by his) and you definitely get plenty of quality, creative food here... but...

NOT.\n\nI ordered scrambled eggs with goat cheese that came with a side of potatoes and warm biscuits. It looked delicious. It lacked seasoning. I don't know if it was the goat cheese or the strawberry spread that I put on my biscuits, but less than an hour after walking out of there I had terrible stomach cramps. \n\nI bought pepto bismol at a convenience store and took one after another to help with the stomach pains. I was stuck in my hotel the rest of the day & night.  It ruined my time in Vegas.\n\nI really think it was the strawberry spread that had been sitting on the table.

S"Word of mouth spreads fast for this place which is hidden inside one of the less stellar hotels of the strip (and I say this in the least snotty way possible). Came here based on a coworkers recommendation of LARGE PORTIONS, CHEAP PRICES (notice the emphasis, he basically yelled this at me). We get there and there is a whole crowd of people and a 1 hour wait time. We patiently wait next to a giant plastic cow until our names are called at which point once we are seated, our waiter informs us its another 45 minutes for food. Based on all this wait time, you expect something spectacular, right? Husband ordered the chicken and waffles and I just got their buttermilk pancake since I was planning to eat his food anyway. Well the LARGE PORTIONS definitely is true. Also, they bring out the food as its ready and not all together so I got my pancake like 15 minutes before he got his food which is kind of awkward but whatever. Chicken was okay, moist and flavorful. Waffles were a disaster, some weird smell. Also, for such large portions, really only 1 small cup of syrup?? I saw multiple tables request a plate of extra syrup cups. Total bill came to $24 for two entrees and an iced tea. I'm sure this review won't discourage those who have already bought into the hype (it's okay, I was one of those) but for those who have discerning tastes, skip this place unless it's convenient for you and there is less wait time. There is better quality food out there in the vast wonderland that is the Las Vegas Strip."

S"How have I not known, until now, that this hidden gem existed??!! Located on the 2nd floor of the newly opened Quad Hotel Hash House A Go Go has been here for 6+ years back in the Imperial Palace hotel days... \nWe showed up on a late Saturday morning and while the wait was long (about 40 minutes) the food and service was well worth every minute! Hash House has an extensive menu but we opted for two house favorites: Sage-fried chicken and waffles with fried leeks and upside down chicken pot pie. And talk about portions?! They are HUGE!!! It was quite entertaining to watch table after table be served their meals and to see the camera flash bulbs going off with people wanting to capture the artistry on their plate- me included. \nThe sage-fried chicken and waffles with fried leeks was truly heaven on a plate! I have always wanted to try chicken and waffles and this was definitely the right place to be sucked into that world. The fried chicken was flavorful and juicy and the fried leeks?? Yes, I was skeptical about fried leeks but they were simply divine. They weren't overpowering and complimented the sage flavoring of the chicken breading well. \nThe chicken pot pie was a marvel in its own right. Served with the crust on the side versus on the top/bottom allows you to enjoy every aspect of a chicken pot pie from the first bite to the last. \nHash House is definitely a place to seek out and savor!"

We put our name in and went down to the casino to gamble a bit. We came back and we're sat within minutes. Our server Alonzo was helpful with directing us through the menu because I was very indecisive. I wish he warned us about portion size, had we know how big the plates were, we would have split an order. We went from starving to uncomfortable full with less than half the plate eaten.\nWe also came back at 2 am because the place is 24hours.

S"So much hype. I have bookmarked this place since my first trip to Vegas when I was 21, and all I have to say is FREAKING FINALLY after how many years? Goodness! \n\nNOW OPEN 24 hours?! Wait, what?\n\nFirst off: PACKED. 30-45 mins wait. Note that if you are a larger party, you will be waiting longer (5+ people = large). How they do their seating is: smaller parties first and then large parties. And you all have to be presented to be seated. If you check in with the host saying how many groups before you, she/he will not tell you that it's one SMALL/LARGE group before you - FYI.\n\nService: Our waitress was sassy at first. Maybe because it was a busy Saturday and everyone got on her nerves, but it was definitely not early... We went around 11 close to noon and it was crazy packed. Later on she was attentive to our needs and became nice. We tipped her anyway!\n\nFood: LARGE PORTIONS. I cannot stress that enough. So if you're a hungry hippo, you'd be satisfied with your own plate, for sure. But a girlfriend and I split a dish. (I don't know what they're popular for, I just heard great things about this place). I ordered the Egg Benedict Smoked Salmon = HUGE. Nicely decorated and visually appealing; so good enough to eat for sure with a side of crispy potatoes. \n\nI wish it didn't have the biscuit, it made the dish extremely heavy. The dish included: cheese, eggs (duh!), dried tomatoes, spinach, salmon (not a lot at all), biscuit and mashed potatoes (starting from the top to the bottom layers). So definitely a heavy plate with the potatoes and biscuit. The flavor was in the middle, like some bites were very bland and others were good.\n\nI was actually not satisfied with my order. And it was on my end, not the restaurants. I should have went with the salmon scrambled dish - had a bite out of that and OMG so baaamb! \n\nVenue: It's in confusing area - The Quad, and parking was a hassle or whatnot. The restaurant is actually really big, and I couldn't tell because the way it's laid out. \n\nDefinitely would come back and try another dish - maybe dinner time since it was so packed for brunch!"

S"Wove through the maze of the hotel to find this location, which wasn't particularly easy. It was totally freezing inside, which i'm sure during the worst part of the day is great, but at 8am, it was a little much. \n\nWe were seated and had coffee quickly. Food came out superfast, was fresh and, obviously, plentiful. I ate about a quarter of the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, fed some to my fellow diners, and took even more back to our hotel for others. The chicken and biscuit were moist and flavorful, the bacon was crispy and plentiful, and the potatoes were great. I pushed aside most of the sauce on top and just went for the chicken -- sauce on the side would've probably helped control the balance better.\n\n I cannot imagine anyone eating this whole crazy thing. I wish there was a tasting portion so that you could just have three perfect bites, as I think that that would be more satisfying and in line with how I like to eat, but I totally get that that's not the idea here.\n\nSo, bring your friends (or let them sleep in and bring them leftovers), and come early, and it seems like the worries about sogginess, slowness, etc., aren't an issue. But bring a sweatshirt. Brr."

The flavor combinations are amazing. Nothing like I have ever eaten before. If your a person who does not like their food mixed or touching each other then do not order this. Everything comes on top of each other, which is how you have to eat in order to taste how good it is. I had a BLT Bloody Mary to wash it all down. And it is just like it sounds, Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Bloody Mary, even with a slice of toast on top\n\nIf you have never been here you must go. Its a great place to eat.

When we finally were seated at our table after about an hour's wait, the server just handed us our menu and asked us what our order was.  His attitude was short, rude, and unhelpful.  The music was playing way too loudly and we have to scream at eat other across the table to hear ourselves while servers and bus boys danced and fist pumped around the restaurant.\n\nThe Sage Fried Chicken was ok.  It was a HUGE brunch portion - enough for maybe 3 girls.  The food came out fast and fresh, but it didn't taste any more special than if we went to a normal breakfast place down the street and ordered the same thing.  The food presentation was nice, but all that food piled up on one huge plate might have just been astonishing..\n\nThe brown sugar banana pancakes were yummy, and again the portion was enormous! It could probably feed a family of 4 or a linebacker.  I've never tasted a pancake like this before so this is a must.  The chewy / crunchy caramelly rim of the pancake was just plain GOOD.\n\nYou're paying for a long wait, rude service, ok food, but if you're curious to see for yourself because you saw the episode on Man vs. food, then go right ahead.

S"Went last week on our trip to Vegas after seeing them on Man V Food.  Loved it!\n\nGot there and told it'd be about 30 minutes to get a table and we wanted to go back downstairs to gamble, so we asked for a pager.  She said to not go too far or it wouldn't work.  After 30 minutes we came back up to check and they'd called us 5 minutes earlier (pager didn't work cuz I guess we went too far). But they quickly seated us anyway, so that was great.\n\nService was good.  Only thing that would have been better is if they'd checked on us a bit more and refilled drinks more often.  But that's often the case with the average restaurant that's so busy you're waiting to get a table.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.\n\nI ordered the sage chicken benedict and my husband had the banana pecan french toast.  We're pretty big eaters and he did manage to clean his plate, but I could only do about half of mine, even though it was delicious.  If you're with someone you can share a meal with and can come to an agreement on what to order (so much to choose from) then I suggest sharing.  Because it tastes so amazing you want to keep eating and you'll totally overeat.\n\nThis was probably the best breakfast meal out that I've had in years!

We should have shared something, we lament. \n\nA couple has chicken and waffles deposited before them. It has a huge steak knife impaled through the mountain of it. It appears they are pulling out their phones to bid their family members goodbye. Or to take pictures. They might not make it through this.\n\nI had asked our waiter about the "fresh-squeezed" orange juice. His response is the reason why he\'s awesome: "the box SAYS \'fresh-squeezed,\' but ain\'t nobody back there squeezing oranges." Thank you, Lonzo. I\'ll have the lemonade.\n\nAnd then. Our food. Arrives. \n\nJust as I had feared: a bed of potatoes topped with 2 dense biscuits, topped with poached eggs, topped with a slightly spicy sauce of heart-attack doom. I look at the boy; he has his own concerns. I can almost see him beyond the pile of meat hash deluxe-ness before him. I tell him I love him before we start in.\n\nA few pathetic minutes later, we\'ve done all we can. Lonzo knows the symptoms. Still, he refills my bottomless hand-squeezed lemonade, later providing a to-go cup when it becomes obvious I have no more stomach room to give. \n\nIn my deliriously bursting state, I think back to an innocent time, before we placed our orders. To all of the things we had planned to do that day, the shops we would visit and the sights we were going to see. It had once seemed possible. Now we just want to live to see beyond our stomachs again. Every day it gets a little better.'

I thought our party of 5 would have to wait forever on Sunday at noon, but surprisingly, we were seated in less than 15 minutes. First off, it was like a sauna at the "Quad" and upstairs at Hash House a Go Go. Not a good experience to start off with, and the hostess was a bit rude, saying EVERYONE must be present to be seated.

One ordered a coffee, and he brought a total of 2 waters for 5 of us, even though others wanted water. The fruity lemonade was refreshing and not overly sweet. They serve it with boba straws!\n\nMy friend and I decided to share the famous fried chicken benedict. As a benny fan, I was really excited to try this Man Vs. Food staple. Another ordered the salmon benedict, a salmon hash, and the fried chicken and waffles.\n\nFood came out pretty quickly, and the portions are HUMONGOUS! I was so glad someone agreed to share with me. Overall, the dish was okay, nothing out of this world. The best part was the biscuit.\n\nFriend\'s smoked salmon benedict was actually cooked, some overly cooked and dry. When she mentioned to the waiter that it wasn\'t smoked salmon as it said, he got really defensive and said it is smoked, but when they cook it as a benedict, it cooks that way. Friends hash had very badly burnt potatoes, and he agreed that the biscuit was the best part.\n\nFelt bad for the friend that got the fried chicken and waffles. He said the chicken had no flavor and very dry. The waffles had a strip of bacon in the middle, but I think it would be tastier if they crumbled the bacon and put in the batter.\n\nOverall, I would try again, but maybe a different location. I'

The waiter made a slight error with my Mom's order, but made up for it with a complimentary side of biscuits. We sampled the salmon and meatloaf along with my chicken and waffles.\n\nThis is definitely a fun food place with huge portions presented interestingly, but I thought the taste of everything overall was just average besides the waffles.\n\nBe warned as the restaurant's noise level is very LOUD."

"yall ain\'t ready for this!" there\'s so much food on this plate you need 4 people just to finish this s$#t!! YUM! :D \n\nSeriously, your gonna have a hard time even deciding what to order when or if you come down here! just come really HUNGRY!  i swear i got 20 pounds heavier after this damn vacation!!!! \n\nDamn you Vegas!.... Damn you...'

S"Disappointed by the chicken and waffles. After reading some of these reviews, I believe the only time to eat it is when you're inebriated or hungover. \n\nFirstly, the chicken was luke-warm and dry like it were sitting out for a while. The waffles were much too doughy! (And here's a tip for the bacon; use bits, not strips if you're placing it inside the waffle.) The maple reduction didn't taste like maple, but some sort of teriyaki-based Asian sauce. Like I'm all for Asian-fusion, but this dish was a disaster. I choked back tears it was so bad. The only thing on point quite frankly was the fried leeks and the only saving grace of our dinner was the Arnold Palmer. I drank it like I was dying of thirst.\n\nMaybe I am being a little bit dramatic, but it's only a little. Order the chicken and waffles at your own discretion. They should rip down that giant poster, burn it, and replace it with the rib-eye."

S"My friends and I were having a really bad day. We did what girls best when we're upset, and that's eat... A LOT. For appetizers we ordered some kind of fried shrimp starter (forgot what it was called), which was really good. We also ordered a crab cake pasta salad. It was AMAZING! Our waitress described it as one of her favorites, and we were sold once she said it was a  jumbo crab cake made up of over 90% crab. The crab was lump and delicious, and the pasta salad complimented it really well. The four of us split two fried chicken benedicts, which were also quite delicious, over-indulgent, and satisfying! Our server was so attentive and helpful. I feel bad for not remembering her name though.. She definitely added to the experience. We even wrote her a note on the check telling her that she made our horrible day much better :)"

S"Surprisingly below average. First expect a pretty long wait to get your table of corse because it is in Vegas. Second my wait for the food was around 45 minutes witch was annoying but in my mind this was gonna be the best breakfast ever so It was worth the wait for me. When the food came out I was ready baby!!! AND THE FIRST BITE.....hmm not that good. I got the grilled French toast and a side of biscuits and gravy. I get biscuits everywhere I go just to try everyone's and find the best. This place was not good at all very stale biscuits and cold gravy. Let's move to the French toast, I understand it's grilled however burned should have been the word it overpowered the taste so it did not have much flavor and they give you a tiny little maple syrup to cover 3 HUGE pieces of French toast. Only come here if you are already drunk, I think it would be pretty good then but so is Waffle House. Friendly staff though"

Overall though, a must stop when in Vegas."

S'The final food spot on this Vegas leg was Hash House. This place was packed, so we decided to bar at the bar. The bartender was full of energy and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the bacon stuffed waffle and the sage fried chicken Benedict. Let me tell you, it was a ton of food. The Benedict by itself was enough for two people, but when you add the waffle it turns into a "You will be Full as hell experience".  \n\nGood experience and I would definitely be returning!'

S"This place made me hash house a go go to the bathroom. Okay that may not even be true but I wanted to write it anyway.\n\nNot a surprise that we stumbled in here at around 2am on a Friday. I was with a group of seven, though that really only counted in terms of bodies. There were about three functioning brains in total. Then a few girls came and joined us. One of them knew my brother. Somehow that made the functioning brain count go down one. Boom! Take that, girls that I don't know at all!\n\nI ordered some eggs and they actually weren't that bad. They weren't that good, either. But again, 2am. So whatever.\n\nEvery single plate that came to the table had a piece of watermelon, a strawberry, and a giant sprig of rosemary. Every plate. Not sure why. The guy who orders things must have a connection with the guy who distributes those things.\n\nStrawberries and watermelon are not in season (actually, does Las Vegas have a fruit season at all? can produce grow amidst despair?)\n\nRosemary...well that would have been fine, except that every indication on the menu suggested that it would be sage. Sage waffles. Sage chicken. Sage this, sage that.\n\nBut then it turns out it was all rosemaried instead.\n\nComputers went down at 2:45. Computers came back up at 3:00. There is no bathroom in the whole restaurant. I think that is illegal in California. But we were not in California. We were in a hash house in Nevada."

Bigger groups beware as it seems to be busy all day long.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n2x Sage Fried Chicken N Waffles\n1x Sage Fried Chicken Benedict\n2 Coffee drinks (Something with mint... cant remember!)\n\nI am only reviewing the Chicken n Waffles portion.\nChicken was very flavorful, juicy, and piping hot! The waffles we soft and fluffy, also there was bacon in them too! I've had chicken n waffles elsewhere and this by far is the largest portion provided. The waiter mentioned they were large, but this was ridiculous! \nThe food was good overall, but the main downside is that none of us finished any of our dishes. I want to say about 20% remained unfortunately after eating way too much!\n\nI recommend to share with people. Each dish easily feeds 2-3, maybe more, but it is still worth to try them out.\n\nThere are other Hash Houses in Vegas but this was the closest for us."

I got a breakfast plate (waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage).  Honestly, it was as average as a hole-in-a-wall.  Sure, maybe if I got that Man v. Food plate, they may have gotten one more star out of me, but the service would have knocked it back down to 3.\n\nThis was a 11pm food run with maybe a restaurant that was 45% full.  I shouldn't be applying this to all the servers since I did see several waiters wizzing by me numerous times; however, i just didn't see mine.  Never refilled my water, kept the table waiting for a box, then the check, the the receipt.  Literally, 22 mins between when I was finished and when I was able to sign the check and leave.  Don't get me wrong, the dude was nice.  Very courteous and opened his greeting like a pro.  When its closing to midnight, I just need basic service and I didn't get it - Sit, order, a refill, and check.  \n\nGood:  Food\nBad:  Service"

S'Saw it on TV years ago.  Finally made it.  Was not disappointed.  A lot of times big-portion food sacrifices quality. While the portions are ridiculously obscene (which I like), the food was great.  I am a picky breakfast food person.  Eggs scrambled with cheese were fluffy and moist, sausage links were plump and flavorful.  The 14"dia, 1/2" thick pancake was very tasty.  Will be back to sample the menu.'

S"They told us the wait would be 45min to am hour.  We went downstairs to use our phones.  There is absolutely no reception in there, their only major con. Would be nice if they had free wifi.  It is difficult to have people meet you for breakfast when they can't get a hold of you.  They also do not let you use their phone. We came up after 30min and our name had actually been called 5min prior.  We waited 2 more minutes and got sat at a nice booth. Our server Jason was amazing.  He was very happy which made my mood better. He suggested a wonderful mimosa. Fresh squeezed orange juice.  It was very fresh and a good sweet.  She ordered the tractor combo with a vanilla waffle. They gave her potatoes instead of bacon.  They brought out her bacon quickly and she got to keep the potatoes too.  She said it was the best waffle she ever had!   I ordered the French toast.  The banana and pecans come together with the French toast so well. The toast is very thick. Felt like I had close to a loaf of bread on my plate haha.  Love the portions here $12.95 for each of our plates.  This restaurant is always consistent.  My favorite breakfast in Las Vegas."

S'I was craving breakfast at 100pm so we decided to go to Has House A Go Go at the M Resort. We were there last year, and now I remember why we haven\'t been back since, service was bad! Last time we were there, service was sooo slow, this visit wasn\'t any different. Mind you, the place was not packed considering it was a Saturday but maybe because of the time. My drink didn\'t come out right away (I had the tri colored lemonade (watermelon something)) but my husband got his immediately. For the main food, he got the famous Andy\'s Sage Chicken (as featured on Man vs Food) and I just ordered the Tractor Driver Combo. I asked to have my eggs "over medium" as I hate to have runny whites (that\'s just me). It took FOREVER for the food to come. The waitress never came back to say what the hold up was. So after what seems like an eternity, the food came. His food is good, but mine, well, I had to ask for new eggs. I told the waitress I wanted it "over medium". She gave me a lecture on how over medium means the yolk is still runny, I said I understand but the white part on my eggs were still runny (I showed it to her on the plate; when I cut the eggs, the white part were still liquid and this was practically over easy). She said she\'ll get me a new one. The waffle, on the other hand was good, except the little tin cup of syrup was placed on the waffle itself. Not such a good hygienic practice; how do I know where that thing was before they stuck it on my waffle! When we were done paying, the waitress places the black bill container on our table, no thank you\'s, nothing! At that time, my husband and I just looked at each other and said, this is the reason why we haven\'t been back! Now, we will NEVER come back, EVER! The food may be ok/good, but the service was horrible!'

S'My husband and I came here for breakfast to this location after trying to decide what we wanted to eat. We had ate at one of their other locations off the strip last year and were already prepared for the portions sizes. We opt to split one of their breakfast meals and were not disappointed. There is a small surcharge for plate sharing but at this place it is is well worth it. The banana brown sugar flapjack tasted very good and had chunks of bananas throughout. It reminded me banana nut crunch cereal. Make sure you have plently of time to waste. The service was very slow and took awhile to get refills on my coffee and water.'

S'**3 (2.5) STARS -- DOWNGRADE FROM 4 STARS** \n\nMade sure to come before the LATE menu kicks in. Yay, made it!\n\nConfused? Did I go to the wrong place? Is my memory failing me already? My second time (9/10/11) here within 24 hours, can\'t be. \n\nService: \nGoing to have to start with this vs. food. How can service differ so badly from one night to the next? Absolutely the most dreadful service. \n\nWhen we got there, there was NO host(ess) in sight. Patiently waited for about 15 minutes by reading the news prints. Then I started popping my head into the main seating area. Seen but not acknowledged by several employees: bartender and 2 waiters(tresses). \n\nAnother 5-8 minutes pass... Now there is another party waiting with kids. FINALLY, an older male waiter with glasses quickly announces that someone would be with us shortly. He also asks where the hostess is and answers his own question by saying "she\'s around so wait." Before we can say anything, he\'s gone. WTH?!? \n\nIf I wasn\'t dying to try their food, we would have left. Darn you, taste buds and cravings. \n\nOkay, another 5 minutes pass. Two additional parties have joined at this time. Now, I\'m irritated and hungry. Before, I could take action (my BF hates it when I do this), another gentlemen who just arrived about 2 minutes earlier walks into the main seating area and loudly states... "Is anyone going to help us?" A different waiter says someone will be with us and ushers the man back into the line. \n\nAfter another 2 minutes, a very apologetic waitress (old school glam girl, looks young with dark black hair) quickly seats us. She also makes excuses to us indicating the hostess must be in bathroom or something. \n\nAbout 32+ minutes to get seated.... 30 minutes before getting acknowledged. \n\nOur waitress didn\'t make up for it either. She was a tall, heavyset Caucasian with glasses. Our glasses were empty and NEVER refilled. I had to ask a busboy 2x for refills. She was prompt with the check though. Go figure. \n\nFood: \nWas it worth the wait? Yes, yes, yes... Almost an orgasm in the mouth. \n\n- Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles \nLarge portion, definitely 2-3 could share. Very innovative dish form preparation to presentation. Better than Roscoe\'s, no doubt. Just like the host said the first night we came. \n\nChicken was tender and flavorful. Waffles were perfectly cooked, fluffy and bacon stuffed. Green onions were deep-fried and surprisingly delicious... I couldn\'t stop eating them. \n\nThe kicker though is the garnish dressing. There were 3-4 bites that had this amazing spicy kick. The dressing with maple syrup and the spice... OMG, to die for!! It was that good that I had to ask. I think the waitress was off though. She said it was the same as the rib place... soy-teriyaki sauce. But it wasn\'t, it was different in color and taste. I tried each drizzle multiple times to verify and it was definitely DIFFERENT. \n\n- Ribs (Small Plate) \nThis was a just-enough serving. Succulent, savory, and it fell of the bone. Take note, this is the way ribs should be. \n\nIt was accompanied with a simple potato salad with dill dressing. Very tasty. \n\nParking: \nThere is a garage available for parking. \n\nOVERALL \nFirst visit was waaaayyyy better than the first, service-wise. Honestly, I am still in utter shock of what a big difference my experience. I\'m big on service. I\'m a reasonable person, if it was busy, I would understand the wait. But considering the situation, it wasn\'t. \n\nWould I go back? \nAs much as the service sucked, I would have to say "YES," but maybe I\'d try a different location. The food was extremely good. If I had to rate the food alone, it would have gotten 4.5 stars. \n\nFor 5 stars, they need to make that spicy, maple garnish sauce for the chicken and waffles plate. \n\nNo matter what... Even if food is awesome, if service sucks, rating will suck.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**REVIEW BASED ON SERVICE ONLY... FIRST VISIT**\n\nOn a recent Vegas trip, everyone was raving about the food here and said it was a "must go." Then I saw it on tv when we were having some downtime, and the food just called to me. It actually made me salivate so we had to visit it.\n\nSo the plan... Get the chicken and waffles. \n\nLocation:\nThere are multiple locations, this is one of four. Others are located at the M Hotel, Plaza Hotel, and off the strip.\n\nMenu:\nBe warned, there are DIFFERENT menus.  We hit it up pretty late, around 11:30pm. So that means, we made it for the LATE menu. So what sucks is that only select items are offered. \n\nService:\nThe host was pretty cool. He was down to earth and really informative. He said if I really wanted the chicken and waffles that we should come back because it was worth it.\n\nOVERALL\nBased on the service, I\'d come back again. Trust me, I will to try the food.'

But still worth it because you can probably share the dishes and be full! They are indeed that huge.\n\nThat said, we paid decently on the cocktails, and I didn't really like my electric blue sports drink cocktail (forgot the name).

S'This place is a little piece of heaven to me. Breakfast is my favorite meal, so much that so that just "a little" breakfast doesn\'t do it for me. I\'m used to bacon/eggs/toast/grits with a side of bacon, maybe it\'s my grandma\'s southern blood in me. When the waitress explained the menu here to us, she pointed out a particular section and said something along the lines of "be careful, this is a lot of food." I had already selected something else not from said section, so natuarlly my thought became, "Uh oh... I must not have ordered enough..." Boy was I wrong. What Hash House must categroize as "not a lot of food" is enough to feed a small country.  \n\nIt\'s like getting two meals at once. I can be a pretty big eater and this breakfast had me satisified until dinner time. \n\nNot only are the portions substantial, but the food is good too. This is not slop - it\'s well put together dishes with tasty sides and a lot of flavor. The fried chicken and waffles is their signature dish, but i decided to go "lighter" with the fried chicken and mashed potatoes and i was not dissappointed.\n\nThis is a great spot and i definitely recommend. Try going early (pre 8 AM) if you want to avoid the breakfast crowd on the weekends.'

Our friends wanted to come here while in Vegas because they had seen it on Man vs. Food (or one of those shows) and we didn't even have to second guess why it was on the show after walking to our table.  Our friends settled on french toast and granola pancakes which were literally the size of tractor tires as they were described on the menu!  DH and I each got the farm scrambles, I the bacon, avocado, swiss, and onion one which was DELICIOUS and him the ham, cheddar, and spinach which he didn't enjoy as much as mine.

The wait staff get points for personality and knowledge of the menu and its offerings but they cannot over come the fact that it is all show and  no substance.

So we waited...and waited...\n\nMeanwhile, a big party that checked in after us got seated before us. \n\nBut we waited some more...and waited.\n\nFinally, one of us went to ask the hostess how much longer it would be.

Another one of us went to double check if it would be soon. We were all getting very hungry. \n\nAnd this time the hostess told us 45 minutes!!! And we told her that someone had told us 30 minutes ago, that it was 30 minutes. She just looked at him and said it would be ABOUT 45 more minutes.\n\nNeedless to say, after losing over two hours of our day on just waiting to get in..we gave up and went somewhere else.\n\nIt was pretty upsetting because I was looking forward to eating here after reading reviews and hearing such satisfaction.'

S'I will miss you Hash House a go go.  Our time was short, but well spent.  And now all i have is pictures to drool over.\n\nBefore eating here I read the review that keith a. did.  I noticed the waits are long. So when we got to Vegas and were planning everything out, I called down and spoke with someone about best times to come in.  He asked if I was going to be around mid-week and I said, "Yep! Till Thursday!"  He said, "Any day mid-week after 10:30 is generally no wait at all."\n\nI Called AGAIN on Wednesday morning to double check and the gentleman said there\'s no wait at all.  We got down there about 45 minutes later, and as said, we were promptly seated with no wait.  Our server was a really nice guy who was on top of his game.  Polite, Kind, and Friendly.  Three things most servers should practice!\n\nMy wife ordered a egg scramble that was decent sized, it came with a biscuit and she ordered a mimosa and said that all of it tasted really good.  I tasted the scramble, it had chicken, corn, eggs and cheese.  Maybe a few other things I cant remember but it tasted really fresh!\n\nI got the Fried Chicken Bene!!! My eyes were HUGE with amazement at this insane looking mound of food that was put on my table.  I stared at it wondering how the hell do you eat this thing!?!?  After simply "diving in", I had a system going and it was going well!!! So many flavors colliding that I was very impressed.  The chipotle topping was a nice flavor added to everything else.  I saved some for that night being I was so stuffed and It was gone!!!  \n\nIf eating at this location, give them a call and see what the wait is, it\'ll help decided if you wanna come or not.'

S"What I really admire about this place is the emphasis they put on making everything from scratch and using high quality ingredients. It's written in fine print on the bottom of their menu, along with a little notification that your food may take awhile to prepare because of it. (Our waiter quoted us 45 minutes for our food to be done after we ordered.)\n\nAs for the food though, I was pretty underwhelmed. We ordered the Chicken Benedict, Chicken and Waffles, a smoked salmon scramble and a chicken hash dish. The portions here are very large. Four dishes fed 7 girls, and we probably would have been just fine with 3 entrees instead of being greedy and adding the fourth.\n\nThe star of the show was the Chicken Benedict. Delish! The sauce and melted cheese... Mmm.. The flavor is different from your traditional Benedict with hollandaise sauce, and well worth your time. \n\nEverything else we ordered though kind of fell flat for me. Bland... Boring... A waste of my stomach space. I was looking forward to the chicken and waffles most but I had a few bites and abandoned it. \n\nThe wait to be seated and the wait to get your food is a little unbearable, especially when you're hungover from your Vegas shenanigans the night prior. But I would come back just for that benedict!"

S'This joint came highly recommended by a client who said the meal there was "magnificent."  \n\nIt was magnificently disappointing.  \n\nAfter making my mom trudge through the crap-hole that is, the Imperial Palace, we took the middle escalator (important fact) up to HHAGG.  \n\nThere was no wait, but it was relatively late after the LOVE show.  We were both tired, hungry and not feeling well.  I ordered the grilled cheese.  It was huge and had a steak knife stuck in the middle.  The bread wasn\'t very grilled and the cheese wasn\'t melted and gooey.  But it was BIG.    \n\nMom wanted a BLT which is served on the lunch menu and although they serve sandwiches at dinner, the BLT isn\'t one of the dinner offerings so no dice.  This rule was explained by our somewhat ditsy server who said it was important to "maintain the integrity of the original HH in order to keep the license. "  That made us feel so much better about the lack of accommodation.    \n\nShe ordered a Cesar salad instead.  It was a huge plate of iceberg lettuce, some croutons and a giant tree of Rosemary.  Wha???\n\nMuch like the LOVE show, I didn\'t really "get" HHAGG.  \n\nI sense the original version in San Diego is much better so skip the Vegas rendition.'

S"Ehh mixed feelings.\n\nSo after having this place hyped up by one of my buddies, I was really excited since i like a good breakfast. And i LOVE a good breakfast after a hard night of drinking..which is where this review will begin! lol\n\nSo when we get to Imperial Palace, we find Hash House and it's swarmed by people waiting to get in.  The hostess informs us that it's about an hour wait time to get seated..$10 and 5 minutes later, we were seated haha\n\nI know it was busy and all, but it took absolutely forever to take our orders, bring out drinks, and bring out our food.  So service you can was average at the best. Our waitress was nice when we did see her, but that was rare.\n\nI opted for the world famous sage fried chicken and waffles. the chicken was really good! the batter was light and flavorful. the waffles had huge strips of bacon inside them. however, besides that there was nothing special about them.  batter they used was a little heavy, and the waffle itself was uneventful. \n\nPricing is good for the Strip. Most dishes were around $15 and portions were huge and easily shared. \n\nMaybe I was expecting too much? But this place wasn't all that cracked out. The food was average at best. If I hadn't greased the hostess, this meal would have taken more then 2 hours if you include the wait time.\n\nI'd eat here again though, but maybe on a weekday and a different dish!"

However, the portions are HUGE but the food is just not that great. Prices are a little high but you need to think about the amount of food you are getting.

S"I was super excited to try Hash House A Go Go. We had heard it was good for brunch and really good food. However we were turned off almost immediately. It is very difficult to find if you are just using a map app... we walked around for a good 20 mins before discovering it is inside the Quad, past some interior construction, and on the 2nd floor.\n\nWhen we finally got up to the restaurant, there were people everywhere waiting to be seated. There was no rhyme or reason to the wait area and it was difficult to find the host/hostess station. We inquired as to the wait (we were not greeted or anything) and the host didn't even look up and told us 25-40 minutes. He did not inform us of any drink specials we could have enjoyed while we waited - although I did see a sign on our way down the escalator. The lack of acknowledgment and enthusiasm made our decision easy: to see food elsewhere. Perhaps I will try this spot on my next trip to Vegas."

S"It started with seeing Hash House A Go Go on a Vegas website. Then found out it was a Man VS Food stop, which if you know me, know that I had to go once I heard that. We stopped in for breakfast and we got there just in time. When we walked up there were only 2 people in the restaurant. When we left there were about 20 people waiting to get in. we were greeted by an excellent server, who definitely knew his shit. He was on it with recommendations, suggestions, asking what stuff we liked. He was awesome.  We ordered some drinks that came with boba straws in them, which in my opinion gets you drunk faster.  More liquid quicker. We ended up splitting a dish and I am glad we did because they give you a mountain of food. We got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. First of all, the chicken breast was bigger than my hand. Second it is the best fried chicken I have ever had... Sorry KFC.  The seasonings in the batter was perfect and the maple made the chicken breast so tender. The chicken was sitting on top of 4 bacon strips that topped a mountain of thick mashed potatoes. Added to the plate were 2 eggs, and fruit all over the dish, a biscuit that honestly didn't need any butter or jam. It was moist and very flavorful on its own. I added a couple of pork sausage links because I didn't really that they made plates to feed mountain men. But those were really good also. I really don't think I could complain anything at all for this place. Perfect service, mouth watering food and cute atmosphere. I think I am going to make it a point to go back every trip to Vegas and try something different."

Crappy hotel and casino, but Hash House is a hidden gem.  \n\nWe had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 4, but well worth it.  The food wasn't just huge in portion, it was actually good.  Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, BBBLT, Sausage Gravy Pot Pie, and the Scramble were all very tasty dishes and a perfect cure for the hangover from the night before.\n\nService can be a bit slow, but who cares when you get to watch everyone else get the most ridiculous meals?

S'Went here with some friends for breakfast after a late night out. We arrived shortly before 10am and the place was packed. We had a party of three and it took about 30 minutes to be seated so be prepared to wait.\n\nFor my meal, I got the meatloaf hash. It was a large portion (as many people mention here), but I have to say it was quite lackluster. The food was very average in taste and even the "hash" was disjointed. All of the items seemed to be placed in the skillet randomly and didn\'t really have a tie together.\n\nOverall, this place is pretty pricey, you have to wait a long time and the food is very average.

Located on the second floor of Imperial Palace which is a random spot to be, HH is place you should defintely check out if you want some good food and want to avoid buffets. I always hear there are long waits to get into this place so when I got there and got seated right away I was very surprised. After watching Man V Food I really wanted to try the chicken eggs benedict. It was so much food I barely even finished half of it. The whole meal was full of flavor. The bed of mash was tasty, chicken was moist, the cheese topping was delicious, and the best part of it all was the chipotle sauce that is covered on everything. Had a kick to it which I enjoyed very much. Service here is really good, our waiter gave good recommendations and came by to check up on us throughout the meal. Def stop by this spot when you are in Vegas, you won't be dissappointed."

S'We stumbled upon this place while wondering around the strip and to my surprise the place was really nice and it had a very fun atmosphere. \n\nMy friends and I decided to grab something "light" but had no idea the portions were going to be so huge. \n\nI ordered the mozzarella cheese hamburger. The burger was really big and I also got the side of fries. The patty was very juicy and the temperature was perfect not too hot not too cold.  :) The cheese was perfectly melted on the patty. The sad part was.... THEY HAVE NO RANCH ... they had no RANCH!!!! :( I wanted to dip the fries in ranch !!! GAHHH hahah they gave me cucumber ranch?... which wasn\'t so bad but... didn\'t beat ranch.\n\nMy friend ordered the smoked Applewood bacon hamburger I was too full to try hers but looked heavenly with the bacon in between the patty and the bun! She also ordered the tangerine mimosa but..that was definitely not a good choice...\n\nOther buddy of mine decided to order the sage fried chicken benedict. The presentation of the dish is very unappealing but the taste is the total opposite of what It looks like. There\'s so many flavors in one bite but it\'s complimentary with each other! \n\nDefinitely a place to try when you\'re in the area and for the portion the price isn\'t so bad ! :) we actually took the left over back to the room and was enough to feed two people.'

S'Come here with an appetite because the portions of food are ginormous. It was a treat watching the food come out and watching the look on peoples faces. I would say that most of the dishes here can be split with a friend.  My breakfast was pretty delicious. My friend ordered a chicken pot pie dish that came in a hat shaped cracker. It was oozing with a creamy gravy.  It was very good.  I did have to send my hash browns back because they were cold and bit soggy but then they just brought more and I had a ton more hash browns. They were much better HOT.  The waiter was really passionate about the food and very nice.  I saw drinks on the menu that I would have tried that were extremely pricey. There was a bloody Mary drink on the menu that comes with Bacon and it was like $15.  I do not care if it had a souvenir glass I would never pay that much for that drink. I mean nothing that special about it.  I think if  you order a regular Bloody Mary and put your own piece of Bacon from breakfast you would have the same effect for half the price.  :-)   We did wait awhile as expected but it was worth the wait.  I definitely recommend this place.'

Regardless, if I'm going to be spending in the price range of $12-15 anyways it might as well be something that'll keep me happy.\n\nMy gf and I shared the Saged Fried Chicken (Man V. Food pick) and it was awesome. We didn't mention that we were sharing because they charge an additonal $2.50 plating free so she just said she wasn't eating anything and we just split the dish without an additional plate. The fried chicken was  with a combination of biscuits, bacon, scrambled eggs, spinach, and cheese all in between. This dish was huge and lived up the the Man V. Food recommendation... I don't think I would've bene able to finish this on my own! The Sage Fried Chicken really did hit the spot and I would go back specifically for it.

What upset me was the food. Yes, the portions are still monstrous. But the food is not fresh. Part of the appeal with the Hash House for me and my beau is the freshness of the food. \n\nIn Vegas we sat down, ordered, and I kid you not, 5 minutes later we had our food. Ick... The bread tasted stale, the potatoes were luke warm, the chicken had seen better days... I could go on. We ate our food and went along our merry way. \n\nFor what it is it\'s "OK," for the quality I\'ve experienced from their SD location, this place was a huge disappointment.'

S'THe second we exited Flamingo from the 15 fwy i said, "We have to go to hash house a go go Right now!" Thank GOODNESS!! I saw it on Man V Food and have wanted to eat here for a really really long time. So, i already pre-meditated the fact that i would probably have to wait about a hour for a table, or be on the list for next day, or whatever. Whatever the reason i was willing to wait. I just wanted to eat here really bad. \n\nIts at the Imperial Palace (weird hotel with lots of smokers), went left, right, south, north, couldn\'t find the place. Asked security for assistance, and bypassed a huge "HASH HOUSE A GO GO" sign above an escalator in the middle of the casino. \n\nThis place does not disappoint. The proportions are HUGE. If you can\'t finish a $6 burger at Carl\'s Jr then split a plate with a friend. If you CAN finish a $6 burger at carl\'s jr then split a plate with a friend. They are GENEROUS with proportions. I was under the impression that it would be super expensive with outrageous prices, but NO i was wrong. Plates are from $11-$15, totally affordable. Its VEGAS, live it up. \n\nWe ordered the meatloaf breakfast, HH delux (?) plate, and Andy\'s fried chicken benedict(as seen on Man V Food).\n\nMeatloaf tasted interesting, came out in a skillet with chunks of potatoes and vegetables with two huge biscuit. (I swear this restaurant is for people with big appetite and with 3 stomachs). Sister said she didn\'t like the meatloaf entree (too bad). Other sister ordered their GIANT pancake with sausages and scrambled eggs with a side of crispy potatoes. I mean GIANT pancake. I think it was 1 ft in diameter. It was HUGE, at least 1/4 inch thick. She of course didn\'t finish it. I ordered Andy\'s chicken and biscuit (i can\'t remember the name but as seen on Man V Food). SOO GOOD.\n\nHUGE biscuits with two huge fried chicken, on a bed of perfect mashed potates and strips of bacon and some special sauce. Don\'t forget to try their homemade JAM. Super delicious. Scoop some unto the biscuit or on some potatoes or on some mashed potatoes. Try the homemade jam. \n\nThe table next to us were a party of 4 HUGE dudes. Macho douchebags with their artificial tan and muscles bulging from their tight ed hardy shirts. They could probably eat everything on the menu. Anyways, they all ordered burgers. They didn\'t finish it, and wrapped their half burgers to-go. Another table of big dudes order the chicken and waffles and had half their food boxed togo. \n\nSo, A LOT of food. Not expensive. The hostess told us (a party of 4) would have to wait about 40 minutes, which was totally fine. Only a 30 minute wait, which flew by b/c we were reading the menu. \n\n I gotta try the chicken and waffles next time! or maybe the french toast or a burger. eeeek'

S'First of all, like everyone else, I\'ve wanted to try this place. I\'ve heard fabulous things about it but never had the chance to go. So about two months ago, my friend is staying at a casino across the street from Imperial Palace. She and her friends were craving breakfast food and not a buffet so I said we could try this place. \n\nI arrived and told the hostess that my friends were already in there. She told me, (and not even kindly), "We don\'t seat parties if they aren\'t all here, but you can check if they\'re in there." Well, they were seated and I joined them and we ordered our food. \n\nFirst of all, I give the food a 4 out of 5 -- Chris and I had the farmer\'s platter or whatever it was called and although it was good, there was just toooooo much of it. I think there\'s a difference between good and thinking something\'s good just because they put 5 pounds of food on your plate. \n\nSecond, the service was second...no, wait...third rate. I have lived in Vegas for almost 10 years and seriously, I\'ve had better service when Binion\'s Horseshoe had their steak and potato midnight special for $2.99. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when asked for a refill, the waitress seemed annoyed. \n\nThird, this place was way too crowded and not enough servers. Come on now...I\'ve eaten at the Cheesecake Factory and you\'re practically sitting on their neighbor\'s lap as you enjoy your meal with your dining patron and you still don\'t get the rudeness or the stress that you can sense from the waitstaff. This way not be their problem so then the management needs to get a clue. \n\nFourth, as we were paying our bill, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back. Upon arrival, she tells us that between the kitchen at our table, she "LOST" our credit card. So not only was she a bit on the rude side, the was obviously tied up doing several other things AND she loses my husband\'s credit card??!!? COME ON!!! There had to have been at least 200 people in the restaurant and anyone would\'ve picked it up and taken it. About 5-7 minutes later, I guess someone turned it in to the hostess and the hostess tried to find the waitress to give it to her. My hubby then got it from the hostess and although the waitress did apologize, you could so tell that she apologized really to save face and get us out of there. After that, I wanted to take the tip we had left for her. Normally I\'m not so mean, but my husband is a busser and he wouldn\'t be that rude to anyone! \n\nI give this place two stars because the food really was good, but just overrated. I do think it\'s worth a try...and maybe not the IP location. Maybe Sahara is different...and when the M location opens up, then they have a chance to prove me wrong. We\'ll see...\n\nSo Hash House a Go-go management at IP, if you want people to  pay way too much for pancakes, you can afford one more server or busser so your existing waitstaff isn\'t  running around forgetting people\'s orders, losing people\'s credit card or cutting people short to take care of others with a stressed out and uncaring attitude. 4 farmer\'s platters can pay a waiter\'s 4 hour shift and they\'d provide better service so they can generate MORE money for your joint!'

S"I'm going to start this off by saying that I am not a fan of casino eatery places (aside from buffets) that are on upper floors of the buildings. I feel like they are almost always desolate (at least in my experiences) and are void of any and all character that it may have if it were in it's own separate location. And this particular place was of no exception. There were three other tables (the place was a really dull atmosphere- CMON, it's vegas people!). I perhaps saw my waitress three times-including bill drop-off and pick-up and the food was not on the cheap end of things. \nI ordered Andy's sage fried chicken benedict (w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs- I subbed grilled chicken in for the fried, not like that redeems calories or anything) and it was HUGE. And contrary to other reviews, DELICIOUS. The mimosa I ordered was really strong for such a little thing and had me kind of whirling out back into the casino. I ate off that thing for two days and will definitely get it again (at the other location) next time I'm there : )"

All of our jaws dropped when we seen how humongous the burger was!  Just WOW! \nI couldn't decide what I want because everything they had to offer sounded great. \nI ended up getting the chorizo breakfast and OMG, it was SO delicious! Such wonderful blends of seasoning. However, I did not like the potatoes, even though they are pretty good, I'm just not a fan of chunky potatoes. I asked for a side of gravy for my biscuit and they charged me $3. Grrr. \nMy cousin ordered the basic breakfast w/ grilled ham and he loved it! And all my other cousins enjoyed their food as well! \n\nThe portions here are huge! If you come here, I recommend splitting it with someone but beware it may be a little difficult since everything on the menu sounds amazing it may be hard to agree on one thing!

We ate at both the one in the Imperial Palace on the Las Vegas strip as well as the one at The Plaza Hotel in old Vegas.  Both were excellent, but the one in old Vegas has much less of a line.\nIf you go to the one on the strip, eat at the bar so you won't have to wait.\nThe prices were VERY reasonable for the amount of food you get, and two people can easily split an entree. Their sage fried chicken benedict was beyond words!\nYou HAVE to check this place out...especially after a night of partying."

Every time a waitress or waiter would walk by with a plate of food everyone would stare and ask the person who received it what they ordered. Every time something came out everyone was amazed! You know you're doing something right when everybody is surprised and  delighted every time. It's a must go if you're in Vegas!"

S"The wait here is crazy... because it's Hash House in a casino on the Strip, so duh!  You can get a drink to liven up your wait a bit, though. The bloody mary is actually very good. And large... like everything else here. \n\nThe portions are huge and sickeningly so.  It wouldn't surprise me if they adopted a policy of wheeling food out in a wheelbarrow -- it would fit the theme perfectly!  Every plate I saw cleared around us was still half full, as the TV was playing a commercial to help starving African kids.  It felt pretty indecent to be throwing away all this food just for some 'Murican farmhouse gimmick. \n\nThe flavors were good, but everything just kind of gave me indigestion.  The Benedicts come with a biscuit instead of an English muffin. Everything's just a little overboard.  The smoked salmon Benedict isn't with lox how you would expect it to be, but salmon with smoke flavoring. It was still pretty good, but wasn't what I thought I was ordering.\n\nI think the gimmick wins over the actual experience.  When your food first appears in front of you, you're kind of star-struck and giddy.  But about 3 bites in, you realize you're just about done and there's no fridge in your hotel room."

S'Such an odd location for a restaurant like Hash House A Go Go, but thankfully there were huge signs when you enter the Imperial Palace Casino to direct you to this spot. I heard about this place from my parents, who had wanted to visit the original Hash House in SD, but had to back out because of the ridiculous wait. There was also a bit of a wait at this location (~30 minutes for 3 people on a Wednesday afternoon), but when we were seated we noticed there were a lot of open tables; I suppose they didn\'t have enough waitstaff. Our server was amazing; really fast and friendly, calling us "sweetie" and checking back on us frequently. \n\nI decided to go for the famous fried chicken and waffle plate, and my sister and bro-in-law went for the same but in an eggs benedict version. I also had the spritzer, which was refreshing and not overly sweet. There\'s a very strong chance that I may be biased to give my chicken and waffles a good rating due to its behemoth size -- it was awe-inspiring -- but it actually tasted good, too. The chicken was actually tender and moist with a strong hint of rosemary (that, and the stick a whole sprig of rosemary into the chicken). The skin was ridiculously crunchy and peppery. The waffles had bacon embedded into it...I mean, c\'mon, how could you go wrong with carbs, butter, and bacon? I guess it is so wrong, it\'s right.'

Overall, a very different Pig/Cow themed restaurant upstairs from the lobby of the The Quad hotel.  A bit pricey maybe for some folks.  With tip and coffee, price comes out to be about $20.  But you're on the strip so that price is probably normal.  I don't know why the wait time was so long since there were many empty tables on the back.  But once at the table, the service was pretty quick."

Perfect complement considering it was 2am in the morning. on a separate visit, i had the salmon omlette which wasn't that great and was more on the fishy side and oily side(it was drenched with olive oil to cook the fish)  overall its a pretty awesome place. \nbtw. the chairs suck .. they've been ruined by fat butts, so you tend to sink into them in an uncomfortable way where your arms are a bit elevated ...

S'The tagline for the joint is "twisted farm food," but it really should be "good food writ large," with emphasis in the "large." Hash House can\'t do anything small. But that\'s OK. The quality does not suffer from the size of the potions. \n\nI have had the 1 lb. stuffed burger here multiple times. Note: Before attempting, skip breakfast & lunch. I get mine stuffed with cheddar & bacon (skipping the avocado), one of three varieties. It comes with a steak knife and a sprig of sage stuck on the top. Tip: Use the knife; you cannot eat this burger whole. The burger is good beef, cooked just right. The side of fries is huge and they are cooked just right. The drizzle of BBQ sauce and the sticks of something add a nice touch. All-in-all, a burger, fries, and a lemonade will run you just over $20 (with tip) and will leave you with a good taste on your tongue, a warm feeling on your belly, and no need to eat for the rest of the day. \n\nI had a breakfast here too, a chicken breast deep fried with a maple glaze, grilled mashed potatoes with bacon, and two eggs w/ fruit & a biscuit on the side. Once again, the dish was huge. The chicken breast was magnificent. The biscuit was flaky and huge. I could not finish. I passed on the overpriced OJ to keep the cost below $15, but once again, this is a meal that can last you the day. \n\nHash House dies not try to be pretentious, like so many Strip establishments. It\'s hearty food, and while the prices seem Strip-like (that is, 50% higher just because it\'s in Vegas), the amount you get easily justifies the prices (at least for the food; they must make their nut on drinks, where even soda prices are stratospheric). This is a destination place to ear when you are in Vegas.'

S"All of my excitement about Hash House was unwarranted. After a 45 minute wait, we ordered our food immediately because my husband had a poker tournament to make. Despite ordering right away and informing our waiter of our slight time crunch, my husband's food came in 45 minutes and mine in 55 minutes. By the time my food came, my hubby had to leave to make the tournament he signed up for... I ate my chicken and waffles alone. (To be fair, we probably should have known better than to come somewhere like this with a schedule to keep.)\n\nIn a nutshell, my problems with HH:\n1) Average food. Chicken and waffles and corned beef were good but not great. Expensive for average food.\n2) Poor customer service. Lots of staff running everywhere with little getting accomplished. While we were waiting, I was at the front bar to order a drink and had to interrupt a lipstick application gossip fest among the front staff to ask where the bartender had gone. Our waiter came by 3x to tell us our food was coming and it was still 15 minutes until the first dish came out. When I voiced my frustration about the wait for our food, it barely registered. No offer to make our experience better. Only a sheepish apology as our server ran off to run my credit card.\n\nIt must be nice to give terrible service and still have a crowded restaurant and celebrity guests. \n\nMy advice, don't waste your time.

First off, the portions are HUGE. I would recommend sharing for sure but they have a split plate charge of $3 so i recommend ordering a side of something.  \n\nThe fried chicken was forgettable. It was dry, bland and had no flavor at all. I ended up using ketchup and tabasco on the chicken to eat it. It was quite greasy and the batter was sweet? Probably some maple in the batter but i didn't care for it. If there was some salt, then maybe. It was too late by the time it got to the table to add salt since it wouldn stick to the crust.  Potatoes were decent cause it had bits and pieces of bacon in it. Biscuit was soft and decent. Best part of the dish?  Fresh melon and pineapple\n\nsorry hash house, it was all hype to me."

S"More is more at HHAGG. \n\nUnfortunately, this loud, windowless, and fluorescent lit eatery focuses on quantity over quality. Their potions are so ridiculously huge that guests photograph their plates before they dive in. What they soon discover is that most dishes lack much flavor  - IHOP's buttermilk pancakes for half the $8.99 price are a thousand times better. I'd guess that 33-50% of every dish gets thrown out.\n\nThis restaurant also prides itself on being guest-unfriendly by refusing to substitute anything in their dishes. For example, if you don't eat pork and prefer their chicken sausage in your egg dish, they're more than happy to leave the pork out of the $13.99 dish, but they'll charge you an additional $5.99 to replace it with chicken sausage. WTF?\n\nIf you like to think that big portions equal value, customer service is overrated, and bad lighting and noise make for a festive dining environment, then by all means join the others here who agree! \n\nFor those who seek out quality ingredients and flavor for their money, the ability to order what you want without getting ripped off, and a pleasant setting to dine in, then Las Vegas offers many more choices."

S"So let me start by saying that, my friend suggested we go here in fact she raved about it prior to our arrival at the Quad (where we were staying anyway). On the afternoon that we ventured upstairs we were beyond hung over and quite ready for a meal of epic proportion BOY DID  WE FIND IT!! To begin our server sucked, I believe her name was Shea, but don't quote me but if you get her avoid her ass like the plague. She took 15 minutes to get our drink orders  (one Pepsi and two waters)to the table after telling her we needed a minute to look over the menu.When she finally brought the drinks and I discovered my water glass was dirty I proceeded to wait another 20 minutes to get my water again. The kicker...they weren't busy and she tended to just disappear for 20 minute increments. Another waitress that we called over (Janine) was SO helpful! Despite us requesting the manager she still was polite and attempted to help us with anything we needed even though we were not at her table. Once the manager arrived and we explained our issue he took over and took care of us for the whole rest of the time. I ordered the rib eye with horseradish potatoes and boy was it good! The manager made sure that EVERYTHING was taken care of and was so freaking attentive to our needs. He even brought us a huge piece of their wonderful strawberry cheesecake and ice cream for our troubles. We tipped (Janine) stiffed that other chick...and consistently thanked the manager!! I will definitely go here every time I'm in Vegas and want a great meal and great service...Love it!"

If you are anywhere near Imperial Palace, head to the back of the casino and up the escalator to some of the best food you can find in Vegas. You will leave full and ready for a nap, almost no chance of finishing your meal as the portions are big enough for 2 or 3 people. Not bad Bud in a Bag for $5 to get your day started right. If you leave hungry , it's your own fault, this is good ol' comfort food done right. The wait staff is slow so don't be in a hurry.\n\nMan v Food meal is very good and filling.

First, the server brought a giant honey covered biscuit with a side of butter.  You have to eat this with a fork and you really don't need the butter.  The biscuit would have been a tad dry if not for the honey, but it worked and I ate most of it.  Which was probably a mistake, because soon after a gigantic skillet with enough food for three people arrived.  In this skillet was a generous serving of delicious, fluffy scrambled eggs that did not taste like they were over milked but were fluffy on their own, some delicious garlicky green beans, some cooked carrot slices, sliced red and orange bell pepper, a metric buttload of roasted potato chunks and four lamb chops. With a sprig of rosemary.    Holy guacamole*!  (*there was no guacamole)\n\nI sort of made a dent - I ate all the lamb chops (great), all the green beans (great), all the eggs (great), a good amount of the peppers, a few of the carrots and a couple bites of potato.\n\nIronically enough the potatoes were the weakest part.  I'd like them cut smaller and crispier.  But heck, everything else was good and there was WAY too much food.\n\nThis dinner was $18.99+tax.  A very, very good deal for the strip and it tasted pretty good too.  Honestly I'd prefer a smaller portion since I hate wasting food and most people on the strip won't have a way to deal with leftovers.  But, if you come with a companion who likes to eat the same food, you could easily share one of these if you asked for an extra plate."

A large portion of food was thrown on to a platter sized plate to make you say "wow" when you see it.  I did.  Partly because I thought I had received the wrong dish.  \nThen I tried to eat it.  A dinner plate sized "cracker crust" that was about 90% inedible.  The crust had the texture of a medium/hard jerky.  I couldn\'t even cut it with a knife and fork.  Seriously.  "Cracker Jerky Crust" might be more accurate.  At the bottom of the pile there was some mash that was just mash.  Slopped on top of that was the "filling" that was OK.  Lots of chicken but there better be for the price they charge.\nEvidently no one on the tv shows that I\'ve seen ordered this dish.  I saw a picture of it in the photo section.\nThere are a lot of good meals to be had in Vegas.  Don\'t waste an hour of your life at this place.'

S"Oh man, who would've thought this kick ass resto was in such a old school hotel?  After several trips over the years to Vegas, it was my first time stepping into the Imperial Palace and kinda glad I did.\n\nDecided to have breakfast here on Saturday and arrived at around 12:30pm.  There were a ton of people ahead of us and the wait was like 30-minutes but we decided to stick it out.\n\nWe had enough time waiting that we looked through the menu and knew what to order.  The s/o was ordered the Chicken & Waffles and I had the Chorizo Hash.  Fast forward 10-15 minutes...They bring out the plates and God have mercy, the s/o's C&W was huge!  I would've helped eat it but it came with two, yup, two breasts and I don't like white meat.  The s/o liked it and said the chicken was flavorful.  My Chorizo Hash was terribly good and spicy.  It had tons of jalapenos on it which radiated it's spiciness.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly and delicious, geez, even my eggs were delicious!  I didn't care too much for the biscuit though, it was a little dry.\n\nOur server, Marcelino I think his name was, he was super attentive and friendly.  He anticipated what we needed right when we're about to ask for it.  The entire staff was friendly and seemed to help each other out, even the manager refilled our drinks, way to go team!\n\nHHAGG is definitely a must try when you're in Vegas!"

In fact, we ended up going twice in our 4 day trip!\n\nPortions are GIGANTIC and that is not sacrificed by the tastiness of the food. I got the tenderloin with mashed potatoes AND biscuit AND egg and it was as large as a computer monitor. Seriously? Wow. \n\nAmazingly delicious sounding drinks with alcohol and bacon and chocolate.

We also got a really good waitress so she made the experience much better.\n\nKnowing how big the portion is, I opted for something lighter.  I can't find it on the menu that is on the website, but it's Beef Tenderloin with  Palenta covered in Mozzarella Cheese and Roasted Tomato http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=gP8_Emk2LPdvpEmLVGSqaA.

S'We were on vacation with friends and this was our last morning to eat something other than a buffet.  We were told about this place by a friend in California and boy were we glad.  It was a wonderful breakfast dining experience.  The food was very good, huge portions and the waitress was EXCELLENT (I forgot her name though).  She was fun and knowledgeable and there for our every need.  All four of us were happy were our selections.  I ordered the Hash spinach mushroom scramble, which was a little dry, but when I ordered a side of the Chipotle sauce from the Andy\'s Man vs food dish it was perfect.  I asked for just a little bit of the sauce because it was a little dry, but they still charged extra for the sauce.  We also ordered the "Andy\'s Man Vs Food" breakfast which was delish, although crazy carb loaded with biscuits, mashed potatoes, angel hair pasta, fried chicken, bacon and more.  Our friends got the Mango Coconut pancake and also the French toast and they absolutely loved both dishes.  The coffee was hot and very good and constantly refilled as it should be at breakfast time.  I think everything was definitely a bit overpriced for breakfast with drink, tax and tip probably around $16-20 per person.  I will definitely eat here again the next time I come to Las Vegas, but next time I will share a dish with someone.'

S'Another place I found because of Adam Richman from MvF....\nThis place has made my list of regular things to do when in Vegas.\nThe first two times I went to the original place on Sahara Blvd about 10 min of the Strip but then I found out the Quad (FKA, Imperial Palace) had one (which is right next to where I stayed) so I had to go again..lol\n\nYou will not believe the portions at this place!  The Pancakes look like the size of a medium Pizza (or Hubcaps), Their Benedict creations are not only monstrous they are off the hook! Personally I liked the Chicken one that was on MvF better than the Pork Filet  but the Pork one could easily feed three people (I\'m 250+ lbs and it fed me twice and admittedly I should have split it into thirds). The last time I went, I was with a buddy and his son who said they live down the street from Rosco\'s Chicken & Waffle\'s then said "These are better than Rosco\'s" when referring to Hash Houses Chicken & Waffle tower (They were very good, but I\'ve never had Chicken & Waffles before)'

S"Hungover much?\nHungry much?\nWill eat anything as long as its edible?\n\nIf you answered 'YES' to any of the above, this place is the place for you. Its A WHOLE LOTTA food per person and has the hometown favorites - fried chicken, corned beef, scramblers - pretty much all the comfort foods you could think of. Although if you were to eat all of it, you would definitely not be so comfortable! \n\nThe food is, to cut right to the chase, not very good. So if you're looking to just eat because you're hungry and would eat anything so long as its food - then go here. \n\nIts a good experience overall too - just go to see how much food a restaurant could possibly give you on one plate. In terms of portions, Hash House A Go Go has surely made quite a feat!"

S"+ Some of the best service I've had, period, and the best we had in Vegas, far surpassing all of our super expensive indulgences.\n\n+ Went 11 on a Friday morning, was told there'd be a 15 min wait, waited 10 or less.\n\n+ Maybe the best breakfast I've had, period. Split the chicken and waffles. Still couldn't finish it all. Also tried a couple of the scrambles that friends got, and were delicious. The biscuits were wonderful, too.\n\n+ Drinks were some of the best I've had, period, and the best we had in Vegas. We got the spiked watermelon lemonade, both juices fresh. It came in a glass that you get to keep and is actually super neat, and nice quality. The booze is something like 20 oz and strong - and that with the glass is $12.95. If you ask me, that is not bad. \n\nHeads up that it is in a super random spot in the middle of the Imperial Palace casino, so kinda hard to find.\n\nI would like to give a special shout out to our waiter. I will come back and add his name if I can find my receipt. He was so attentive, helpful, friendly, everything, had great suggestions, didn't mind that we asked him to take like 50 pics, offered to put the second watermelon lemonade we ordered for the road (because they were that good) into several cups so we could all share. Truly a nice guy.\n\nProbably the only thing I will miss in Vegas. Please open more!!!!!"

To our surprise, the whole waiting area is packed with people waiting.  Our wait was estimated to be 40 minutes so we went to play some pai gow downstairs.  We came back in 30 minutes and they already called our name.  Awesome!   \nWe ordered the sage chicken benedict to share, which the waiter admitted will take at least 35 minutes.  The portion was huge.  It was a good size to share between 2 people.   This dish had chicken, cheese, bacon, eggs, biscuits, potatoes and some sort of hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were scrambled instead of poached but they were scrambled perfectly.   \n\nPros: new location inside the Quad, huge portions, siracha available, slow but good service, cheap.\n\nNote to self: try Sage chicken waffles next visit.'

This would be the first in a series of Godzilla attacks.\n\n1979 - The Imperial Palace opens in Las Vegas.

Besides, the Bellagio wouldn\'t give him permission to rise up out of their fountians.\n\n2010 - Hash House a go-go opens a second Las Vegas location, this time in the Imperial Palace.  Although the Americian farm-fresh food concept clashes with the predominantly Asian theme, The food portions are large enough to feed Godzilla.\n\nHumans eating here are best served to go in groups of two or more and splitting plates family style.  They have a $2.50 split plate charge*, but unless you eat like a linebacker, are a 300 foot tall lizard, or plan to take it home, you will be wasting a lot of food.  Food is very lively and fresh, as well as unusual.  It\'s not your typical "country nasty" (bacon, eggs, sausage, gravy, and biscuts).  It\'s a total re-invent.  It works, but it is a little pricey even when sharing; A split breakfast for 2, with 2 large (fresh squeezed) Orange Juices came to $29 (not counting Tip).\n\nI love the food but not the price.  Like the Best of the Godzilla films, it only merits 3 stars.\n\n* You can bypass the $2.50 split plate charge if someone just orders a biscuit or a plate of bacon for $1.  It costs less, but you get even more food :P'

S'Had breakfast here about two hours ago. Still full as all hell. Your server will tell you, as will the menu, that the food takes a while to cook. They aren\'t kidding. I went in hungry, and was ready to bite off some heads by the time the food was brought to our table. No worries, they were very attentive along the way in updating us on the status of their clearly heavily-burdened kitchen and bar staff. Service is top notch, atmosphere is very laid back (I had dress shoes on and felt a little bit douche-ily overdressed). \n\nPortions were very very large. This is not the kind of place where you order more than one entree "just to try" different things. Get one plate per person, expect to share and still have leftovers. One thing I noticed is that everything was very light on the salt. Some might appreciate that, but I prefer everything salty. Salt is as essential to a man as testosterone. I found myself slathering everything in salt and Tabasco, but everything was quite tasty after that.\n\nAll in all, a good place I wouldn\'t mind coming back to, but not quite four stars.'

Maybe it was the alcohol -- they loved their food but I was greatly disappointed (drinking coffee).  I had the HH original that was supposed to have tomato cream sauce. I was unpleasantly surprised to receive a plate covered in marinara sauce; eggs, mash, biscuit covered in marinara. The biscuit on it's own-delicious. The mash-yum. The combination?

I had the crispy pork loin benedict, which was really tasty. The southwest sauce on it was perfect, but the scrambled eggs on top were almost superfluous. The pork loin covered my entire plate and was laid on top a big biscuit and mashed potatoes. I don't think I was able to finish half of it. I get that they're known for their ridiculous portions, but seriously... it was a bit much. \n\nTheir bacon waffles (yes, there's strips of bacon IN the waffles) were really good. Super fluffy and a perfect balance of sweet and salty. Their biscuits are big and fluffy and are great with their homemade jam. I think their jam may have been some of the best i've ever had. And the kiwi watermelon lemonade was so so good! \n\nIf they were to tone down their portions (you can keep them big without being insanely ginormous) I'd give them 4 stars."

Yep - that\'s what I want.  \n\nThen, of course, it comes and it is barely pink in the center.  I forgive the cook because the patty was about 5oz.  How would you get that to MR? Then I tasted it.  Yes, I have had maytag blue cheese, yes, I know its strong. NO - I didn\'t expect it to be all I tasted and with the rind put on the burger. I tried getting thought it because I didn\'t want to get ripped by the bartender again. I couldn\'t.  I left 3/4 on the plate. When she asked if everything was OK - I explained.  She asked if I wanted to order anything else.... for a moment I thought she was offering to replace it.  Nope, just wanted to know if I wanted more food.

Husband ordered a drink, a specialty burger at $18, plus fries ($11), and a shake. \n\nEverything was fine. Nothing special, I\'ve definitely had better. Some times it was like Gordon Ramsay just wanted to do something "fancy" and it was just annoying. Like he uses Roma tomatoes on his cheeseburger instead of sliced tomatoes.\n\nHe added sliced apples to the Caesar Salad, again a "fancy" creative addition that I barely noticed. Salad was actually best part of meal. \n\nThe shakes were arguably the worst. The first half is pudding. Like real pudding, but the pudding wasn\'t good, in our opinions, and then the rest of the shake was your typical milkshake that was gone in like 5 slurps. The shake was good, but my portion was automatically halved by having mediocre pudding on top. Sharing is simply not an option for the shakes. \n\nThe fries were truffle parmesan. They were Ok. Again, fancy creative = over the top and I barely had any. The ketchup also tasted different, most likely Gordon Ramsay\'s own recipe. \n\nWouldn\'t recommend, won\'t return. But again it is decent quality just not particularly tastey (or, therefore, worth the price).'

It was like eating some kind of warm tasteless substance, my stomach was getting full, but my taste buds haven't register any kind of sensation. Similar with other burgers. They all tasted like the meat was heated in the microwave, the only difference were bits of various veggies or cheese. The buns were tasteless as well. For an average $17 a burger it feels like a huge rip-off. I love to cook. I use many wonderful recipes from Gordon's cook book on the daily basis, so my disappointment was even bigger. The worst culinary experience of my Vegas trip. S."

No, this was not the best burger that I've ever had as honestly, BJ's Brewhouse has a burger that is better and more tasty, but all in all for the price point, this was not bad!  The onion rings were good as well.  For a decent price, we received a decent burger but nothing that I found to be exceptionally great, but wouldn't mind going back either."

S'So my husband and I were excited to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant after watching Hell\'s Kitchen and kitchen nightmares. We figured the food and service at his restaurant has to be the best. Let me just say that I hope you read theses reviews Chef Ramsay cause your restaurant was not up to par. The hostesses were nice but once we sat down, it\'s like we were invisible. Our waiter finally appeared to get us drinks maybe 10 minutes after we sat down....drinks someone else delivered. Then he finally took our order. After that we didn\'t really see him. My husbands coffee cup sat empty for the longest time before we flagged down a bus boy so he could get a refill. Our food came about 25 minutes later and again, someone else delivered it. I wanted mustard for my burger and when I finally saw our waiter I asked him for it. He said he\'d get it and never came back. I tried to flag down another waiter since ours was helping every other table but us and that waiter completely ignored me. Once again we asked the bus boy and he gladly brought it. I would like to point out that while it was busy when we got there, it had definitely died down in our waiters section. I finally found the waiter to ask for the check which took another 10 minutes and when he saw the mustard he said "oh good they brought it". As if he had asked them too!! If he had, I\'d have 2 mustards sitting on our table. Somehow he became more friendly handing over the check, I assume because he wanted a good tip. I tipped him for the amount of service he provided....73 cents so I could even out the bill. All he brought us were drinks, no refills, and the bill. Any fast food place would do the same and I don\'t tip them. I wish I had seen the bus boy before we left cause I would\'ve left him the 20% tip we always leave. If the waiter had done the bare minimum, I might\'ve left 15%. All in all, food was decent but the service will keep us from coming back.'

S"The hype for this place is everywhere so I decided to check it out with some coworkers. It was absolutely hyped for a reason. One of the best places in Las Vegas to get a burger!\n\nI ordered the Farm Burger. It was a sesame see toasted bun, with fried egg, english sharp cheddar, and duck breast bacon. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth! The egg was cooked well and their was yolk in every delicious bite. The duck breast bacon good, but I expected it to be more savory. It's okay though because the burger made up for it!!\n\nFor appetizers we got parmesan truffle fries, jalapeno poppers, and wings. The truffle fries were the best out there. Lots of parmesan cheese and the best part of all was their house ketchup sauce. It worked amazing with the fries. The jalapeno poppers were good too. They came in a cheese sauce that cooled down the spice. The chef included seeds in one popper making it a game of roulette for which one had it. It came down to the last one! I split it with my coworker and it was spicy!\n\nThe wings I weren't a fan of. They bring out a duo, one more traditional buffalo and the other wasabi style. The cool thing is they scrape away some of the meat so you don't get your fingers very messy and can hold the wing by the bone. But unfortunately neither style of wings worked for me. The traditional had a good spice but it wasn't anything great. I took one bite of the wasabi and that was it. It wasn't spicy at all, but kind of sweet and it just didn't work for me at all. \n\nAll in all I plan to return and soon. The menu is decently priced, better than I was expecting. The food was amazing and I can truly say they do a burger right."

S'Awesome food, but Ramsay really won\'t put his name on anything less.  Burgers are well worth everything, I\'ve been there twice and tried one pork and one normal.  My friend\'s pork he claimed was overcooked, but I thought mine was excellent.  Fries are interesting and out of the ordinary.  I\'m not really sure why they have a wait most of the time, they don\'t fill all the seats all the time, maybe it\'s to feel more "exclusive."  Wait staff is pretty solid and attentive, but the (female) outfits are awesome.  I want to get my girlfriend one...'

S"This is right inside Planet Hollywood when you first enter. You can't make a reservation, as it's first come, first serve. That means you have to wait in line with everyone else, but make sure you let the hostess know you're there and the size of your party. Smaller parties can sit at the bar and often be seated much earlier, so if you don't mind, ask for the bar. \n\nI tried the truffle Parmesan fries and the Hell's Kitchen burger, which included asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and roasted tomatoes. The fries were thick and crispy, and the accompanying sauces were incredibly delicious. For the burger, the meat was perfectly cooked, the peppers were actually spicy, and I liked the overall flavor. I also tried the Oreo milkshake with creme brulee pudding, which adequately satisfied my sweet tooth!\n\nFor drinks, they have about 30 beers on tap. The bartender gave me samples of a few I was interested in, and I picked the apple cider. I would come back just for the beer! I visited all 3 Gordon Ramsey restaurants during my last trip to Vegas, and I would have to say that I received the best service here. Also, if you're a Total Rewards member, everything on the menu is $1 cheaper, and make sure they credit your card."

I order the  Blue burger and some type of garlic fries. the burger was ok but the Fries did not sit well with me and I got sick when I get home.

UP!! not a fan at all.\n\nThen when we told the waiter it was our friends Birthday does he get a something. he then side it someone it going to pay for it under his breath.

S'BurGR is open late on Friday and Saturday nights. Unfortunately they do NOT allow reservations. So you have to wait if you want lunch or dinner at a traditional lunch/dinner time. I went there at around 12am at night, so there was pretty much no wait. We were seated almost immediately. Here\'s what is so wonderful about this restaurant that made me give it a 5:\n\n1) Service -  The service here was SPOT ON. Our server was extremely friendly. He came by pretty much a couple of minutes after we got seated (I was too busy looking at the surroundings to be impatient too), and gave us an iPad to take a look at the drinks menu (pretty darn cool). He told us straight out that they were a little busy and that it might take him a little longer to get around to us. Just the fact that he told us that was a +1 in my book. Plus, he didn\'t actually take that long to get to us. The time in between him popping in our table to get the drinks order and to get the food order was perfect in my mind. We didn\'t feel rushed, and we didn\'t feel like it was too slow. It was great that when he served the food, he even told us what was the ingredients in each dish. It was also AMAZING that he didn\'t drop by too many times to ask how we were "doing" with the food. Another thing we noticed was that he never asked if we wanted more water, he just notices it and brings us a new cup of water (yes a new cup, not come by and refill the cup) without disrupting our conversation. Another +1 in my book.\n\nI saw a couple of reviews where people complained about the girls in the front gossiping and talking amongst themselves. I have to admit that that part is a bit true. The girls who are seating you stood in the front in a group of two to three sometimes, and they were just talking with each other. HOWEVER, what differed in my experience was that though they were talking to each other, once I walked by the front desk to ask them where the restrooms are (they are right across the restaurant by the way, I was so dumb), they immediately snapped their attention to me and did not continue talking to each other until they\'ve answered my question. I didn\'t feel like I needed to stand there and wait for them to finish talking or anything. They immediately noticed me and answered my dumb question.\n\n2) Food - For a burger place, the food was pretty darn amazing. We got the five spice chicken sliders for appetizers and that was, I think, the greatest part about my meal. The chicken was PERFECTLY juicy and friend/cooked SO crispily. The five spices that were in the sliders were not overwhelming nor was it underwhelming. The sliders were not too salty, and it had just the right amount of creamy flavor. I loved it!\n\nI got the Apple Cider drink that was recommended to us. It was made very well, and had very little hints of alcohol/beer in it. My partner and I are not a big fan of beer, yet we were able to stomach this very well because it tasted just like apple cider without the alcohol!\n\nThe truffle fries were amazing. It was not overly salty and it had a great balance of flavor. My taste buds are generally very sensitive to salt since I cook with very little salt and oil. Here, I did not feel that any of the food was overly salty at all.\n\nFor entrees we got the Hell\'s Kitchen burger and the Char Siu Burger. I thought the Hell\'s Kitchen burger was a bit better/unique than the Char Siu Burger. The Hell\'s Kitchen burger was great with the japaleno kick, and it was not super spicy at all. The Char Siu burger was a bit sweet, which was what added the edge to this burger. Both were very well made, to our specifications (medium rare). The buns are made in house and it was the right amount of fluffy and crispness. Also, during this whole meal we did not feel heavy at all, which was really amazing because many burger joints are very heavy. We felt full, but not bursting with oily/salty heaviness after the meal.\n\n\n- - - - -\n\nAll in all, we felt that this place was a great value (it\'s not even THAT expensive) and the service was great, as was the food. I\'d definitely visit again!'

We had the American burger and the Chanterelle burger, onion rings, truffle fries, two sodas and one shake and the bill was over $80. The onion rings had barely any onion in them, the buns were nice but the burgers were bland and not worth the over ten dollar price tag. The fries were soggy although plentiful and the shake with pudding on top was just too hard to eat.\n\nAnother celebrity chef concept that is overpriced and doesn't deliver."

Of course as a last minute trip we didn't get to his fancier restaurants, but a burger, ahem, burGR would have to do :) \nThe wait on this particular day was 30 mins, which I have heard is amazing .  Of course if you're an elite diamond member you get to pass the line all together and get first priority. :)  If you have to wait in line...hopefully it's not a sweltering day outside because standing next to a wall of fire is HOT! \nOnce seated you are presented with an iPad that shows you the desserts and alcoholic beverages. There isn't too much, so you don't get too overwhelmed. You're in, service is fast, and you're stuffed. Everything was amazing and prompt and correct! We even scored extra fries! \nThe atmosphere is amazing but my only complaint is how close you are to the next table. It's close enough to dare conversations...but still close enough to be too awkward. \nDefinitely recommend this place!"

S"The best thing we ordered was the hummus appetizer.\n\nFor a burger place, that says a lot. We were two vegetarians and two meat eaters eating at Burgr. The place was recommended by a Vegan friend so we thought - hey should make everyone happy! \nThe hummus was great, though came with some weird veggies to dip with such as green onions? Flat bread was good too though they only gave us 4 little triangles. We had to order more as had so much hummus left over and were charged $4 extra which was a bit steep for more bread. Most restaurants will just bring you more. \n\nThe veggie burgers were very very average. Just a Portabello mushroom cap. I've had better elsewhere. We also ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was recommended by the waitress as one of their most popular and the Chicken Burger. No rave reviews here. The Hell's Kitchen Burger arrived stone cold and underdone (my friend had specified she preferred hers medium-well). We sent it back and the burger was still underdone but we had given up by that point. \n\nExpect to wait up to an hour or more for you table. Luckily, the hostess will take down your cell number and text you when your table is ready so you can go to the mall or have a drink somewhere. \n\nOverall: Go eat elsewhere. Don't waste your time."

Walking through the casino the next day at about 3:30, we were hungry and noticed there was no line, so even though we already had a great burger just the night before, we decided that a short twenty minute wait was worth it for a chance to try this place out.\n\nI had no complaints at all. My burger was cooked to my liking, the bun, toppings, condiments, etc......all good. Some people have mentioned that their burger didn't have much flavor, I'd just say that it wasn't over seasoned. You can taste the quality of the meat underneath the seasoning. Fries were also good and the service was exactly what I expected. \n\nI liked that they send you a text to notify you when your table is ready instead of making you carry around the big vibrating coaster, but you shouldn't have to wait very long for a burger in Vegas. As much as I enjoyed my burger, there is no shortage of high end burger joints in Las Vegas these days (many within walking distance of this very restaurant). I'd put this place near the top if I were ranking Las Vegas burgers, but there are burger places equal in quality nearby without the insane wait during peak dining hours."

Had the Euro burger with goat cheese and it was cooked to a nice medium.  The burger was a nice size, not too big but maybe slightly too small to share.  The truffle Parmesan fries were really good and a pretty large portion (easily share).  The sticky toffee pops were not my favorite.  I order the sticky toffee dessert at all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants (including one in London) and honestly this version I just wasn't too keen on.  The peanut butter ice cream was the problem.  It seemed too salty, maybe with a caramel ice cream it would be better.  Overall not my favorite burger joint in Vegas (Bachi burger is the current winner) but if I was stuck on the strip I certainly wouldn't complain."

S"I was so excited to come here because I love Gordon Ramsey and wanted to see his creative take on burgers.  First thought was the layout seemed very cluttered and it was so loud.  The menu was pretty neat looking and the food descriptions looked fun inside it so I had hope. My boyfriend wanted to try their truffle parmesan fries which  ended up being super thick cut fries, and the truffle portion was in this goopey mayo dip, it just was not  appetizing.  I like bachi burgers way better.  I got the euro burger.  I thought the oven roasted tomato would be roasted long enough where it created a sweet acidic contrast to the goat cheese it just was so bland tasting, and basic for being 16 dollars. My boyfriend got the hells kitchen burger and the porportians were way off and was overloaded with avocado so you only tasted that, and the jalepinio was barely registering.  My boyfriend wanted the creme brulee oreo shake and once again just not proportionate.  What small amount of oreo shake was in it was super yummy but the creme brulee portion took up like half of it since the bottom of the glasses where the shake is are skinny.  Creme brulee is a very heavy custard and is best served in a shallow dish, and then has the nice crackly caramelized sugar on top.  It would have been better if they had used this component to accent the shake rather than take it over, and it would have been nice if they actually had the crackly caramelized sugar on top, without it, its just creme...The service was at least very good, I will give them that.  So overall I wouldn't go back, if you want a great fancy burger go to bachi burger it's much better, and less expensive. This place is way overpriced for flavor profiles that are not executed properly, and lack balance."

S"I live in the Las Vegas area and have dined here twice since I moved here 5 months ago. The first time I ate here was in December of 2013. Immediately after we were sat, our server (I don't recall his name because it has been a couple months, but he reminded me of Aladdin) went over the iPad drink menu with us and was EXTREMELY knowledgeable of each specialty drink, wine, and beer selection. He didn't just know the basics, he knew every intricate detail that went into making that cocktail, the process the went into giving each wine its distinct flavor, and was able to describe all the intricacies that went into brewing each particular beer. During his descriptions, he walked us through how to navigate the iPad drink menu as well, which I'm sure is extremely beneficial to any folk that might not be familiar with Apple products. \n\nHe was also an expert on the food menu items as well and was able to guide us and provide recommendations that best suited each of us. I ended up trying the Hell's Kitchen Burger and split orders of Sweet Potato Fries and Truffle Parmesan Fries with my friends. Since the burgers themselves don't come with fries, you have to order the fries separately as if they were an appetizer. Since the fries didn't come with the burger, I expected them to come out earlier before the burger was brought out, however, they arrived at the same time of the burgers and we had to wait a couple extra minutes for the last side of Sweet Potato fries to show up. Other than that, the food was absolutely PHENOMENAL!! The Truffle Parmesan Fries were outstanding and the dipping sauce complimented the flavor of the fries. The Sweet Potato Fries were BY FAR my favorite, definitely the best fries I have ever tried in my life. They some with powdered sugar to sprinkle on the fries. I'm no chef and I certainly would never have thought to pair sweet potato fries with powdered sugar, but it was delicious! The Hell's Kitchen Burger did not disappoint either. Everything was cooked to perfection. \n\nOverall, our experience at BurGr was fantastic! From our server, to the cooks, to the friendly and helpful busser, Kelly, BurGr definitely lives up to the service expectations out in Las Vegas. The fire fixture ties in well with the ambiance and is definitely eye-catching for anyone passing through the casino."

S'With over 2000 reviews and a 4-star rating, my review will do little to impact the average. I\'ll still put in my two cents:\n\nAfter finishing the meal, my thought was that those giving Burgr 4* don\'t get around much. Maybe they live in a city with lousy food and this really mediocre burger is "the best ever".\n\nMy first reaction to the menu was that I may come back. There are a lot of fun items on it in addition to the burgers. I ended up ordering the Farm Burger and the Aioli / Parmesan fries. This was on the strong recommendation of the server (and many reviews here). In the end: Ho-Hum cheese, ho-hum duck bacon, a fried egg that was over done ( the yolk should be runny and become like a sauce to the burger; it was fully cooked). Worse yet, my Medium-Rare burger came medium-well. I wanted to yell out "You Donkey! You overcooked the #@$%@ Burger". I dealt with it as unless something egregiously bad I don\'t like to send it back as I know it goes straight to the bin. The parmesan fries are large rectangular cut. The aioli was good, but that\'s hard to mess up. The fries were a bit chewy. Not crisp outside, soft inside as they should be. I get way better fries from fry trucks at home.\n\nI don\'t get the four stars. Even if the meat was done right, it would not have been great.'

S'Oh boy, I am very sad to report that I was so disappointed after my experience here. \nMy boyfriend is a fan of chef Gordon Ramsay so it was a must-go-to place on our list. \n\nThe wait wasn\'t very long, we requested to sit at the counter to be able to see the chefs cooking. This "live action" was not so entertaining. The staff was very slow at getting our food to us (bizarre as we are sitting RIGHT IN FRONT of them). I was literally sitting and drooling while looking at the untouched maui onion rings, wondering why no servers were claiming it and why it wasn\'t coming to me! I\'m generally a fair person when it comes to waiting but this place really pushed my patience.\n\nOut of everything on their limited menu, the only enjoyable dish was the maui onion rings. I\'d highly recommend it but unfortunately won\'t be coming back just for it. Burger patty was a little overdone and the shake we had was way too sweet for me.'

S"I skipped this place a few times. Honestly the menu was not that appetizing and pricey for a hamburger.  \nThis time I figured screw it, place is packed, gets great yelp reviews, let's give it a shot.  Slow service, cold burger and really just not that good.  Celebrity face +cheap food = Money maker.  2 burgers with 2 beers, 50 bucks.  It should have been the best damn burger ever. My dinning partners burger had a stinky meat taste to it, she barely ate any of it.  Mine was just cold.  Place is packed with servers, yet everything took so long. \nHonestly Gordon Ramsay should do a kitchen nightmare episode on this place."

S"My roommate and I came to Vegas for spring break and I was super excited to try this place out since it's one of the cheaper restaurant but still by Gordon Ramsay.  \n\nWe had a show to catch at 9 so we wanted to have dinner at around 6:30. Unfortunately they do not take reservations... WHY?!?!\n\nTo start, we shared the sweet potato fries and the jalapeno poppers. The fries come with vanilla powder sugar and honey jalapeno mayo. The fries are fried nicely and pair really well with the powder sugar; however, we weren't a fan of the honey jalapeno mayo. It sounded good, but the mayo didn't taste that great.  The jalapeno poppers were also a let down. They seemed like they've been sitting on the counter for a little bit. It would have been a lot better if they were hot. Not only were they a let down, the jalapeno poppers also made my friends and I sick. I felt sick almost immediately after dinner and my two friends were really sick the following morning. My stomach still feels queasy just thinking a bout it... Just be warned, they are pretty spicy and could possible make your stomach on fire!\n\nThe burgers we got were solid, but the burger places in L.A. still have my heart. \nI might give it another try next time I visit Vegas, but no more jalapeno poppers!"

Make sure you check in with hostess when you have a party of three or more otherwise when you have a table for two you just stand in line and wait your turn for a table. (We only waited about 25 minutes)\n\nOur server was real sweet.  I got the Hell's Kitchen burger with the peppers on the side so it wouldn't be too spicy.  Oh lord.  Love love love!!!!!!!  Highly recommend.  My mom got the Hog Burger.  Don't recommend.  It is cooked one way, really raw, greasy and didn't taste like much :/  \n\nFor desert we had to try the sticky pudding :) it was good.  Not amazing but good.  Our total was $50 for two burgers (no fries), desert, and two drinks.  Not bad I say!!!  \n\nI will be back BURGR"

I highly recommend you be the carrier of a Rewards Card as this may help group sizes in obtaining a table sooner rather than later.  Ryan, our server, was professional, courteous, and had a splendid sense of humor.   Parties of two generally are seated more quickly than groups (3+ people) so be aware of that before showing up here on a busy Friday/Saturday night.\n\nBlue burger... Farm burger... we had other types as well.  They were excellent.  The truffle fries were scrumptious and we recommend asking your server for the plate of dipping sauces (blue cheese, ketchup, ranch, et cetera)\n\nRemember Ryan...

Ordered the Caesar salad which sounded interesting but the apples seemed like an after thought, just a little topping to a mediocre overly dressed pile of lettuce. I got the American burger which was really juicy and delicious and bf got the Hell's Kitchen which he loved. It definitely has a big kick, if you don't like spice you won't like that! Service was super slow but we were watching tennis anyway so no big deal. It's decent and better than eating lunch at a bar where everyone is getting drunk so 3 stars, served its purpose for what we needed."

We had two separate waiters, both dressed nicely and very knowledgable of the menu. Drinks were refilled promptly and food was delivered at a good temperature and within 15 minutes of ordering. \n\nThe atmosphere is mod with an English flair. The food is served in the same manner. We had very basic burgers; one was juicy and full of flavor, while one was on the dry side and desperately needed 5 minutes less cook time.\n\nThe bigger star of our meal were the sticky toffee pudding push up pops. DELICIOUSLY buttery and sugary, they were the perfect ending to the meal. \n\nThe drink menu is unique, as they bring you an iPad to browse your choices. There are tons of beers available in bottles, and an extensive mixed drink and wine listing. Can't go wrong with any of these choices!"

S"My wife and I came here one day for lunch, and we were a little disappointed. First the outside design is fantastic, fire inside a window and the design of it was just so interesting. \n\nOne thing we didn't really like is that they seem to want to build up hype by creating a long line when there is no reason to. All the times we walked by (which was a lot because we were staying at Planet Hollywood) there was a long line, and the majority of the time the restaurant was basically empty and could have sat everyone in line. \n\nAs for the food it was not really the best, we both had a burger, though I don't remember which because they were both pretty bland and unimpressive. The truffle fries were really good, though at times a tad too salty. \n\nThe milkshakes were also a little different, instead of just a milkshake, they put custard on top of the milkshake, very different and I enjoyed that. \n\nI would not recommend going here for a burger, there are a lot of other places around the strip that have better burgers."

S'LOVE GR! so, since we couldnt afford his steakhouse, we opted for lunch at Burgr.\n \nThe real flames on the sign were pretty cool. Fiiiiiiiiire! then there was a line forming with a sign that said "do not wait here until you check in with the hostess".  so, we left line to do just that.  after waiting to speak to the hostess, she said "oh yeah you just wait in the line".  ok..... Now we lost our place in line! annoying!\nthe wait wasnt too bad tho (theyre lucky).  we were seated.  all the waiters and waitresses were good looking.  funny, he only wants good looking ppl working for him.  eh, dont blame him but i didnt think the women\'s uniform was very nice.  they were one piece tight ass short ass dresses.  all the men waiters wore his personal line of jeans with a gold "GR" on the back pockets.\n\nOur waiter comes.  very friendly.  everyone smiled, ask how your day was going, etc.\nthen a young man approaches us because he sees my husband\'s Sabres hat.  He asked if we were from Buffalo.  We said yes, chatted a little, he asked what we were in Vegas for and we told him for our 20th anniversary.  he congratulated us and told us he was one of the managers there. I thought he was just a guest!\nthen 1 minute later our waiter comes with 2 glasses of champagne! very nice touch GR!\n\nfood did take a bit to come out but it was very good! overall very nice place.

The dog was so huge that it was borderline obscene, also very tasty and packed some heat.  The rings and fries were perfectly good, nothing spectacular.\n\nThe service was slllloooooowwwww.  We waited 40 minutes after ordering for the food to arrive.  I am sure the kitchen is slammed and working out the kinks since they\'ve only been open a week but the servers made it worse with comments such as: \n\n"Wow, your food hasn\'t arrived yet, that\'s totally sucks!  But I promise it will be worth the wait, save room for dessert"\n\nThe comment may have been cute and peppy 1 time but it was gratingly annoying the fifth time.\n\nI\'ll come back after the kinks have been worked out of the operation.

I ordered the Chanterelle Burger ($16).\n\nOur food came out fairly quickly and we were ready to eat. The Chanterelle Burger was too sweet for my liking.

S"This was the second time that went Burgr. The first time was just okay. I went such a long time ago that I don't remember much of anything. This review consists of my visit on Sunday 9/21. \n\nI had a great experience. We arrived at 12pm, and there was no wait. We were seated immediately, and a server came immediately to bring an ipad with cocktails we would be able to order. There were technical difficulties with the ipad, which we didn't mind since we weren't interested in drinking. \n\nWe all ordered the farm burger because it looked the best. I didn't like the last burger that I had, while this one tasted delicious. It was a burger with duck bacon and an egg. I asked for mine to be medium, but I felt like it was more medium rare. I'm not much of a steak fan, so I don't prefer the taste of beef/steak so much. The duck bacon and the egg mixed really well, so it was absolutely delicious! The egg was cooked medium, do when I cut my burger, the egg just spilled onto the plate. Sadly, I lost a lot of my yolk, but that's the price I had to pay. :( The duck bacon was thicker than normal bacon, but it was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered Truffle Fries which were much thicker than I expected. I actually don't like the taste of truffle and I don't know why people put it in everything. But, that's just my opinion. They did sprinkle the fries with some sort of cheese which I did like. They make their own dipping sauces- one of which was ketchup and I forgot the other one. The ketchup tasted sweet and reminded me of tomato juice.  \n\nThe service was spot on. The waitress kept coming over to refill drinks whenever they got low. The waiter brought out our check and when my friend presented her total reward card, he quickly brought her out a new tab. \n\nThe only problem I had was the wait for the burgers was super long. It took quite a while for us to get our food. Other than that, great burger and great service."

S'I have to preface this review with- we eat rare burgers. like so rare it qualifies as tartar. We did not get rare rare burgers at BurGR (which surprises me on one hand because I have seen Gordon ream out chefs for not serving meat at the correct temperature, but doesn\'t surprise me on the other hand because I know that a lot of restaurants are afraid to do a true rare burger).When the hostess seated us she pointed out their merchandise (wtf I didn\'t know i was going through a gift shop on my way to the table).\nWaitresses need a new uniform. Period. Gordon, you miss the f+cking mark on attire. What are you thinking with this retro futuristic style of dress for your waitresses. Its almost to the point of offensive because of how short and low cut, distracting, the outfits are. I almost felt bad because our waitress, Crystal, was awesome but her boobs in my face was a little distracting. Crystal was great, she recommended some great drinks ( I did the skinny screw and hubs got a Guinness, the little Guinness shooter was his first choice but when he found out it was a tiny shot  sans actual Guinness he decided on just true Guinness). The ipad drink menu is weird, I almost thought the entire menu should be on it or something else- didn\'t seem like a good use of an ipad. \n\nThe husband got the farm burger- duck bacon and an egg, he liked the flavors a lot. The bun was good, the patty was a bit smaller than we are used to. We shared an order of sweet potato fries (without vanilla sugar) and it came with house made ketchup and a jalapeno mayo sauce. We felt that if you are going to say jalapeno you need to make it spicy. We almost asked for hot sauce. The house made ketchup is really good- very tomato-y. \nI had the Choy Sui burger which has pork belly, carrots, radish, and cilantro. It was good, the flavors were there. The pork belly was a little chewy so it was hard to just take a bite of the burger and come out with all the flavors intended. Pulling fattiness out of your mouth is never becoming either. \n\nThe fries were cooked well, the waitress was a doll, but I will always have this experience in the back of my mind when I watch him scold chefs for overcooking meat. Getting a rare burger is hard, but we thought that of all places, BurGR could hit the mark. "WOW,Wow wow wow " as Gordon would say, this place needs to check itself that it isn\'t just riding on the popularity of it\'s name and is actually delivering. Burgers have NO sides, so I guess $15 for just a burger is a good price for the strip, but I am used to getting RARE burgers with fries or salad included for that much. Bottom line: If you love Gordon, go taste what he has to offer. If you are expecting a meal that shows you what Gordon does to other restaurants go to a different f=cking place. WOW, wow wow wow.'

NOTHING SPECIAL. Seriously. And that is our take on that. The bun was good quality though compared to burger king's buns, that's the only difference. Lol\n\nThe only thing I really loved was their Parmesan fries and their sweet potato fries were also delicious. The sauces it came with are also delicious.\n\nThe only time I'll ever go back to this place is for the Parmesan fries. But I know other restaurants where I can have it.\n\nWe won't be back to this place again. It was nice to try once but not again.  We paid $60 with tip included for two burgers and two fries. The most expensive Burger King food I've ever had. If I wanted Burger King patty, I'll just take myself to Burger King."

S"Definitely NOT worth it.\nThe food was bland! \nGordon's idea of a limited menu may be nice but if the one main food on the menu is bland, then the entire restaurant is bland.\nThe fries were also just blah. Parmesan fries should maybe have some garlic or something. These were just salty so you had to dip it into the garlic aoili sauce to get flavor and cut the salt. but the aoli sauce is just glorified mayo. Nothing healthy here.\nAnd what's with the fire display.\nThat is totally wasting a very limited resource of natural gas.\nI'm NOT a fan. Even hubby, a burger lover, says that Slater's 50-50 burger in San Diego is miles ahead on flavor and quality.\nMy advice to Gordon, get some flavor in your meat and your fries.\nOh yes, the beer selections were good. I enjoyed the hard cider, yum. Best part of my meal."

S"chef ramsay is one of my fave chefs EVER but i am pretty disappointed with the burgers here. it hurts that i have to give this place 3 stars because i respect chef ramsay as a chef and i watch all of his tv shows. i couldn't believe how DRY the burgers came out for my boyfriend and i. it was crazy because we both ordered medium rare and the patty was a bit hard. i ordererd the farm house burger and the egg complimented the burger very well i just wish the patty as well as the buns weren't so hard to bite into. my boyfriend got the hell's kitchen burger and it was pretty good but we weren't too happy with the texture of the burger. i want to go back just to give it another try but each burger came out to be $15 each.\n\nour fave on the menu was the TRUFFLE FRIES! the aioli sauce was to die for! it was SOOO good! it went very well with the fries. usually i love ketchup but i did't touch the ketchup at all! the restaurant was decorated with a fun fire theme. they have the nicest staff and they also send you a text when your table is ready! the menus are cool looking and very inviting. \n\noverall just pretty sad about the dry burgers. hopefully it won't be so dry for other customers."

S"After watching all of Gordon Ramsey's tv shows, I had high expectations for Burgr. \n\nWe tried the Farm Burger which had the duck bacon and the egg. I normally put egg in most of my sandwiches so it would make it more rich. But with that, the burger was bland.  the burger definitely needed cheese or something salty to balance out the neutral taste of an egg (like how eggs always need salt/pepper, soy sauce). For me the flavor of the burger was lacking in that department. I rarely say it but it def needed a tad more sodium :/ \n\nMy group shared order of sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries. \n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries: I was expecting to love this but it was soggy and a bit colder than fries should be. I was disappointed that it was so soggy. and the flavors did not seem to come through for me. I barely detected any truffle. \n\nSweet Potato fries: I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful these fries were! The vanilla powdered sugar really boosted the flavor of the sweet potato! It was scrumptious and I normally don't like sweet potato fries very much. :] MUST try this!\n\nAll in all, for the price, it's still pretty hefty for a burger but it's vegas. :/ I would definitely try something different the next time I come here."

S'There are hundreds of burger joints in Las Vegas by famous chefs, franchises, and local families, so standing out takes a lot of effort--and a lot of taste.  Gordon Ramsay\'s BURGR bar is one of those places that is on travelers\' bucket lists for Vegas eats, as well as some locals.  I decided to give this place a chance given my love for Hell\'s Kitchen.  \n\nThere is a long line to get in to the restaurant, one that any patron must endure if they did not make a reservation.  The line is 30-45 minutes long depending on what time it is.  The nice thing about standing in line is the amazing flaming sign that is stare-worthy for about 30 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe flames keep patrons warm while waiting in line, but on a summer day, this could be annoying.  Still, it is unique and is a great conversation piece.  It makes patrons wonder what is on the other side, and if the food is as intriguing and sexy as the front entrance.\n\nAfter 30 minutes, we were finally seated in the main dining area right against the other side of this sign, and thankfully it was not hot to sit against.  The menu is simple and consists of appetizers, burgers, sides, and desserts/shakes.  We ordered the Brittania (mango chutney and sharp cheddar) and the Hell\'s Kitchen (jalapenos and gouda) burger.  To start, we went with the most unique option on the apps list--the banh mi pork belly app.\n\n\n\nI did not expect to see this on the app menu at BURGR, but technically, it kind of is a burger if you consider burgers to be meat in between a bun. The pork belly was well seasoned, melts in the mouth, and the richness from the fat is cut by the pickled radish and carrots.  The bun, though, was lacking.  It had good flavor, but it was a bit dry and not as fluffy as it should be.  Still, the taste was there and it was a nice way to start the meal.\n\nWhen the sides and burgers arrived, we were quite excited.  They were 4" in diameter and served in a bun that held up to the juicy patty.\n\n\n\nThe britannia has caramelized onions, a mango chutney, and a sharp cheddar with arugula.  The toppings were amazing and the patty was seasoned well.  The buns held up to the patty, having that bounce back to it.  The Hell\'s Kitchen burger is spicy and juicy, salty and a bit sweet.  I cannot say the burgers were terrible, because everything tasted great, but neither are burgers that I dreamt of the next day.  Gordon Ramsay has his reputation for a good reason and his food is very good, but I wasn\'t too impressed.\n\nThe patty was great and cooked to a perfect medium, which I loved.  Overall, a nice burger but the toppings made it yummy, not the meat, which should be the main event.  The fries were served with a curry ketchup and a spicy one, which both were good.  I love steak fries and could eat these all day.  The fries are crispy on the edges and baked potato soft on the inside.  I love how perfectly fried they were and how large each fry was.  The winner of this visit, however, was Gordon Ramsay\'s sticky toffee bread pudding--push pop style.\n\nThey layer the pudding with the ice cream and it is sticky, sweet, and creamy.  I could eat four of these for dessert despite the richness of each pop.  I love the whimsy of the push pops.  Ending the meal with a fun dessert made the entire experience a positive one.\n\nService was just as lovely as the food.  Our server was outstanding, friendly, and helpful in every way.  From watching Gordon Ramsay on television, I expected excellent service, and this restaurant delivers.  From wine lists to dessert, our server cleared our table all the time and made sure we had everything the way we wanted it.\n\nOverall, BURGR was a nice experience but a place that will be the first to come into mind when I\'m craving a gourmet burger.  Although the food was good, it wasn\'t memorable in any way, except for dessert.  Maybe I am picky or one that cannot be satisfied easily, but BURGR will not be on my "regular eats" list.  Still, it is worth a try and gave me the right to say that I\'ve eaten at a Ramsay restaurant that was on television.  In the end, I think that\'s what BURGR is all about--bragging rights.'

S"We decided to try this for lunch on a Wednesday and only had about a 30 min wait which was nice considering how long the line was.  It was definitely worth the wait.\n\nI am 99.9% sure this was the best burger I've ever had in my life.  I ordered the Britannia burger and it was the most amazing, flavorful and juicy burger ever.  I ordered fries which were nicely done - crispy but not overdone.  We shared the Jalapeno poppers - six on a plate, each in their own individual ramekin with sauce.  One is supposed to still have seeds - ours had two and I happen to pull both of them!   \n\nI highly recommend for a great, reasonably priced burger on the Strip.  \n\nLooking forward to my next visit!"

The accouterments (fries, rings, etc.) were nothing special.  I wanted to give it 2.5, so you know.  For less money go to Ketchup Premium Burger Bar in Miracle mile.  Better food FAR better service.  Oh yea, the service is mediocre, just too busy for the number of staff."

It was more or less a protein burger. The flavor wasn't great, and was disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the euro burger and it was much more flavorful.  \n\nIf you go, order beef burgers, it looks big, but it's because of the bun. The service wasn't bad I suppose, quite nice and burgers did take awhile to get to us. They mentioned that they make everything as orders are placed to ensure freshness. Ok, I give you that.\n\nBut will I return? Um..not likely and I'd try other burger places on the strip. For the wait, cost, and taste? No.."

S"We went to try burgr after a disappointing experience at Ramsay's pub and a great experience at his steakhouse... We showed up at 1:30 and it was packed ! we waited and got a table I got a beer (Innis and Gunn), very good and we shared the euro burger. The fries and the burgers were great (they should go to the pub and show them how it's done !). The Waitress was nice and efficient. The only downside was the atmosphere a little too.... cafeteria in my opinion, which kills the experience a little bit since you are literally stacked on top of other people. Prices are reasonable and the food is good. A good place to grab a quick bite (if you can wait in line for a while...)."

S"Amazing Burgers! Obviously. When my husband and I go here we usually get one of two Burgers the farm burger or the hells kitchen burger. The farm burger has a fried egg on top with crispy duck breast bacon. We order it cooked to medium and boy is it juicy and delicious! By far one of the best Burgers I've eaten... In my life! We have also had the jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers which are super tasty but watch out at least one per order is like the blazes of hell. Dude to me getting the hottest popper once I ended up getting the sticky toffee pop.. It was the bomb and also helped cool my mouth from the intense heat. The French fries are very good too, but the best fries are the sweet potato ones! They have some sort of sweet maple dip or something and it's just amazing! Love this place can't wait until the next time we hit it up!"

The Maui onion rings were on par too.  Loved the chipotle mayo and cheddar ranch.  Our server was absolutely top notch.  Though it took our food a little while to get to table, she checked in, made small talk, and helped the time pass so nicely, we barely noticed.  Highly recommend this.'

The wait is a bit long, but you're in a casino so there are plenty of things to keep you occupied. \n\nFirst off, they have an excellent beer selection & the service is wonderful. Our waitress was really enthusiastic and knowledgable about beer. She gave us recommendations & even offered us samples. For such a busy restaurant I did not feel rushed at all.\n\n- THE FRIES. The truffle parmesan fries are a MUST. It comes with two sauces, a bbq type sauce & an aioli. The aioli was delish. It complemented the fries very well. \n\n- THE BURGER. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger, which came with asadero cheese, jalape\xc3\xb1os, avocados, and a roasted tomato. I've never had asadero cheese before. \nI'm not even sure what it is, but it was really good. The meat itself was good quality and cooked perfectly! Overall, really good burger!"

S"Very very delicious burger, almost a 5 star but I'll tell you why in this review. So the place is located inside Planet Hollywood near the front entrance. The inside was very chill, cool, and greeted with nice customer service. As I sat down the waiter have me an iPad to look over the beverages & deserts which is cool that you get to see a clear view of what you want to drink and eat.\nSo ordered the popular European burger which had various types of cheese which was very similar to blue cheese but I forgot the type of cheese it had. I had the meat cooked media cause I wanted that juicey taste. Every bight of the burger was great but the only thing I didn't like was that it put too much of the creamy cheese. Other than that the burger was delicious. \nThe highlight of the dinner was the awesome epic parmesan garlic fries. These fries is a must to have and their white dipping sauce was epic. So good that even my gf that's not a fries fan, she loved it soo much."

Just your standard burger with fancy ingrediants. Got the Farm Burger with Duck bacon and fried egg.\n\nThe parm truffle fries were pretty good. LOVED the truffle aioli dipping sauce.

The Earth Burger is just a grilled portobello mushroom and some other stuff that I can't even remember. But whatever, it was so good. I usually hate portobello mushrooms, but I devoured this thing.\n\nService was okay. I didn't care because I was busy drooling.\n\nBurgr is the only Gordon Ramsay restaurant that I can afford, but nothing about it felt like someone's cheapest restaurant. I took a menu home because it's epic."

My husband and I agreed that these were the best onion rings we'd ever had. They came with a cheddar ranch sauce for dipping which was out of this world. The burgers were really tasty also, and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the hot dog too, but honestly probably would have preferred a other burger! We also sampled the jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers which my husband adored (I'm not big on spicy in general). You could tell that everything was fresh and homemade. Also, the service was awesome on both visits. Each table has a server and an assistant so there's always someone available if you need something.

The service was very friendly, from the hostesses to the servers.  The Manager noticed we had been waiting for a few minutes, and I do mean a few...and offered us a free appetizer or a free round of drinks, we chose the parmesan fries. The ambiance was very modern and sexy.  The server outfits were all a tad short - but I think GR was going for sexy when he designed the overall look. We waited in a long line, for only 15 minutes; it moved fairly quickly.  We waited for our actual burgers for about 12, while munching on some free fries.

S'I told Jacqueline R.  that I would go try this place.  And I finally did!\n\nTo clarify, this one is not the Gordon Ramsey burger joint over at Planet Hollywood with 20 different choices.  This one only has four burger/ sandwiches in the category.  We were confused after 45 minutes of walk on the strip.  Tired, hungry... And found out that the place was fully booked for the night and the receptionist had stopped taking reservations!  She saw the devastation on our faces and immediately said, "you can always sit at the bar!"  So we did.\n\nInterior design-- spacious, modern, British simplicity and elegance.\nThere are about 200 Beer kegs on one side of the wall indicating a wide selection of brews available at the bar.\n\nStaff-- cool, friendly, knowledgable.\nI couldn\'t help asking about the uniform-- black & white short sleeve collared jersey with printed houndstooth design, skinny jeans in pumpkin spice color.  It takes some guts to put on these very bold outfit everyday, guys!  Well, they hate it.  But the irrelevant colors attract attention for sure.  \n\nWell, I took the bartender\'s recommendation and ordered the lamb burger.  This item was AMAZING.\n\nThe bun was unbelievably soft.  The goat cheese and lamb dissolved on my tongue and went down like a fast train.  I usually hesitate with the combo of lamb and goat cheese because the smell could be easily overwhelming.  The ingredient used here were apparently superior.  There was no scent of lamb or goat for my anxiety.  A very successful dish!  And I loved the fries too.\n\nDrink-- "Goodbye Blue Sky"\nChampaign, berry juice, vodka, 2 big blue berries on top with a twist of orange peel.  Bubbly and fruity,  it was delightful.\n\nI\'m glad I came here.  I would definitely come back!'

The wait staff are very friendly and good looking... Eating utensils are pretty nifty as well. Your knives stand up! Great experience, awesome food, and a very tasty expensive burger.

The presentation was wonderful and the portion was perfect for my husband and I to share. I don't remember what burger my husband ordered, and I actually don't remember seeing him eat it! It was gone so fast! He loved it! I ordered the Euro burger and was a little apprehensive at first, but after the first bite, I knew I made the right choice! Hands down, this is the best burger I have ever had! Nothing compares to this, and I wish there was a restaurant of his here in Chicago. Even the drinks were exceptional! We ordered everything our waitress recommended and we were more than satisfied with all of her choices! She even sold us on a second drink (which we weren't going to get) but she gave it to us to go!!! :) Our overall experience here was beyond words. From Annie the manager to our waitress, from the appetizer to the entree, from the presentation to the proportions, every single moment was wonderful. We will ALWAYS come back every time we are in Las Vegas, and anywhere else we travel that has a BurGR restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant, and always ask to meet Annie.

It was very large, (enough for two), not too overwhelming truffle flavor. And then the shake, creme brulee oreo. It was the highlight!

Lacking moisture, the burgers we tried were just "okay"...the truffle fries needed salt...and the starters like the pork buns lacked flavor, as if an ingredient or two was missing.\nGordon, Gordon, Gordon...we wanted to be pleased with your presentation of one of the simplest foods elevated to your standards!

Thinking about it creates drool right now. \n\nFor burgers we got the euro which has arugula and goat cheese and the hells kitchen burger which has jalape\xc3\xb1o and a roasted tomato. We were really impressed with the harmony of flavors.  Very well paired and extremely delicious. \n\nThe burger patty was cooked perfectly. Pink center and juicy. \n\nAlso check out the staff. Besides everyone being ridiculously good looking,  they all worked like a well oiled machine. Super efficient and friendly. Will definitely return when in Vegas.'

S"I'm a HUGE Gordon Ramsay fan. As a viewer of his many TV shows (MasterChef, Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, Hotel Hell [..did that one get cancelled?!] The F Word), I've come to admire his creativity, perfectionism, and work ethic. Granted, I arrived at Burgr NOT expecting Mr. Ramsay to be serving me a burger himself, but I was very much hopeful that his ideals would translate to his staff there. AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT!\n\nThough I'm a big GR fan, I'm an even bigger fan of burgers.. all things protein and sandwiches, really. I've had my fair share of burgers and I have to proclaim The Farm Burger at Gordon Ramsay Burgr as the BEST burger I've ever had.. hands down. \n\nFarm Burger: beef patty (I ordered mine Medium), English sharp cheddar, duck breast bacon, poached egg, brioche bun. \n\nWhat was so magnificent about this burger was that each element in it was a knockout; you could pick apart the egg, bacon, etc. to eat individually and be delighted, or eat them all together and still grasp the flavor of each topping in every bite. The patty was cooked to perfection: juicy, not over/under-cooked, tons of flavor that you could eat it alone sans toppings. The bun was toasted just right. No one flavor was bland or overpowering. Also, the burger wasn't stuffed with TOO many toppings where it became this unconquerable mountain. \n\nAnother item to try (if you have room) is their pork belly buns (bao). Happy servings of fatty pork belly with shaved carrots in a fluffy bao. \n\nBest part of Gordon Ramsay Burgr? It was under $15! Not shabby at all for a gourmet burger. Given that prices are all inflated on the Strip, you could've gone to McDonald's or Panda Express and almost paid the same amount for crappy food. \n\nIn conclusion: EAT HERE. Especially before a night out of clubbing/drinking. Your body will thank you!"

S'Since watching Kitchen Nightmares, I\'ve been wanting to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Well, BurGR was my first and probably last.\n\nTo start, the service here was a bit cold. Probably because I was dining alone and preferred to sit at a table over the bar. My restaurant star ratings are rarely based on service though, unless it\'s exceptionally terrible, so let\'s move on.\n\nI ordered a Hell\'s Kitchen burger with Parmesan truffle fries. The burger was cooked to perfection, just as I ordered it; medium rare. The meat itself sort of lacked flavor, but the jalape\xc3\xb1os, tomatoes, bun and avocado made up for it. The fries were great. They\'re cut thick and come with two dipping sauces. Ketchup, which tasted better than a lot of other ketchups for some reason, and a white (mayo based?) sauce. One portion would probably be enough for two people. \n\nSo why the two star rating? For one, my burger was cold. After my first bite, I figured maybe it was only cold on the outer edge of the patty, but that wasn\'t the case. Then I thought maybe the toppings cooled it down, but the entire burger was pretty much room temperature. Also, I noticed a disgusting looking hair caked onto my fries halfway through them. \n\nIt\'s a shame, because this place went from a definite four (potentially five) star rating to a two within minutes. Had my burger at least been hot, even warm, I\'d have looked beyond the hair and rated this place higher. My experience, however, to quote Gordon in a recent episode, had quickly become "dreadful." Perhaps Gordon should look to his own restaurants for the next season of Kitchen Nightmares.'

S"My wife and I are big Gordon Ramsay fans so when we saw the restaurant as we walked the strip we had to stop in.  It was noon and the line was a bit long, however the wait was only 20 minutes. This might indicate that they were churning out customers, however that was not the case at all. We spent time talking to the hostess, waiter and manager, however Gordon wasn't there. We missed him by 2 days.  \nI was hung over so I opted for the Farm Burger which included an egg and duck breast bacon.  Perfect.   We also enjoyed onion rings which were the best I have ever eaten.  My only regret was that I was only able to finish 1/2 of my beer.  30 on tap.  \nThe service, food, prices and atmosphere are excellent for a casual meal.  \nWith so many choices in Vegas to eat its hard to go wrong, however I do not give out 5 stars often and BurGR well deserves all 5."

S'I want to meet Gordon Ramsay, he knows how to handle a successful business, love that quality about him.  You can tell he prides himself on his restaurants, just by observing the staff.  Our server was so accommodating, it\'s the most memorable part of my dining experience.  \n\nOn to the burger!  I love burgers, I am always talking about Vegas\' best burger.  Some of these include Flemmings\' burger that you can get at the bar, Tommy Bahama\'s kobe burger, Holstein\'s,  Del Taco\'s Double Del Cheeseburger, etc... And I must say, the two burgers I got (The Hell\'s kitchen burger, and their mushroom burger, forgot name) are good contenders.  The burgers are cooked exactly to their order, the beef is tender, and the ingredients that are added on are well thought out.  The roasted tomato in the Hells Kitchen burger is guaranteed a new flavor for you to have in a burger, and I must say, I loved it.  The mushroom burger though not as unique as the Hells Kitchen, still a well crafted burger and still highly enjoyable, but nothing you haven\'t already had.\n\nDesert, one of the most unique I have ever had, and will always remember this desert.  The milkshakes are about 3/4 milkshake, and they are topped off w pudding in the top 1/4.  Wow, we had cocunut pudding with strawberry milkshake.  Indulgent and so good, a must share.\n\nI love Gordon, I love when he gets into his fits on TV, I love when he yells at people, I want to eat more burgers and desert here and have him yell in my face, that would be awesome.\n\nBest Gordon TV quote, "This is rancidddddddddd!!!!!"'

S"Another pricey Vegas restaurant that's mediocre at best. My burger was good but nothing special, it was kind of lacking until I requested the spicy mayo.  The fries were ok, plenty to share between two people. The dipping sauces were different and fun. Was it worth $25 for a burger,1/2 and order of fries and a glass of water? Not really."

S"I was expecting to like this place better, given how much I enjoyed the food at Gordon Ramsay Pub in Caesars.  Burgr has the drink menu on the iPad, which is common to all of Ramsay's locations in Vegas.  I didn't partake, but there was a lemonade and vodka drink that was popular with the couple we ate with.\n\nTo start, we had jalapeno poppers.  These are large, and come 6 to an order.  They are served in shot glasses with an excellent ranch sauce at the bottom.  In an interesting twist, they don't tell you which one has the seeds still in it.  Seeds are what gives jalapenos their heat, so that one is noticeably hotter than the rest.  I got it in our order, which is good because I like hot stuff. \n\nI had the cheesy burger with added duck bacon.  Be advised they burgers don't come with veggies or sauces on the side, so you have to ask for them.  The burger was a perfect medium, but lacked flavor.  It cleary is very good quality meat, but was underseasoned.  I had to put the truffle mayo on it, which was served as a side to the truffle parmesan fries.  These were excellent, and I don't usually care for thick-cut fries.  But, the truffle flavor came through, and the mayo was an excellent dipping sauce.  I didn't much care for the housemade ketchup, too sweet for me.\n\nThe wife had the maytag blue cheese burger, which was delicious, but only because it had such a large amount of blue cheese on it.  I think anything with that much maytag would be great.  \n\nAll in all, the appetizer and fries were the most memorable part of our lunch.  And, that's not how it should be at a high end burger joint.  I may return if someone visits and wants to go, but I doubt it.  Would probably direct them across the street and up a block to Gordon Ramsay Pub at Caesars..."

S'Best burger of my LIFE! I came for my birthday and we almost walked away when we saw the line. Turns out it moved fast and I was impressed with their technology. They send you a text when your table is ready so you can walk away and get a drink nearby and relax. After a short wait we were at our table. You could tell they thought about everything. The waitress was very informed about every item on the menu, even when the food was served they make sure to face every plate in the same exact position. \n\nBut let me get to the food. Prices extremely reasonable, especially considering this is a gourmet restaurant. All the choices were appetizing, I went with the Euro burger (truffle, goat cheese, arugula) and my boyfriend the boar. We had the truffle fries to share. Everything was as good as it gets. The meat was cooked just enough and juicy. Again I was so impressed at how well thought out everything was. \n\nI cannot wait to return here!'

S"I would like to begin by stating, the ambiance and food were fantastic.\n\nHowever, there are two things which lead me to give a 4 star instead of a 5 star.\n\nNumber one, we felt rushed from the beginning by our server. The moment we got our seats, our server asked us 4 to 5 times in under 5 minutes if we were ready. While we were eating she asked if we wanted desert. While we were finishing up our burgers, she put the check on the table without asking if we wanted anything further, which we did.\n\nSecond, I felt that the burger options on the menu overlapped and wasn't enough of a selection. Many of the burgers seemed extremely similar to one or another. Considering there is only about 6-7 burgers on the menu, going off my memory, I felt somewhat trapped in selection. However, the burger I chose was fantastic. \n\nOther than the two problems I addressed, it was a great experience. Definitely try it out."

They actually seemed please you chose to eat there. \nThere were 4 of us and we each tried a different burger. The Euro was probably the best, though the jalape\xc3\xb1o was a close second. \nI like that they kept you change things (I added fried egg).  Wasn't too crazy about the fries or the sauces that came with them, but I like my fries thin and crispy. I don't eat sweet potato fries but everyone thought they were delicious. \nCan be a long wait, but if think worth it. Not cheap, but not over the top like many restaurants in Vegas. Bon appetite"

The food was ah-mazing, the decor was beautiful, the menu was unique, the service was exceptional.  The quality of the ingredients was everything I expected.  I also enjoyed the mini Ipad drink and dessert menu.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the choice of outfits for the servers.  It was tacky and it cheapened the look of the entire venue.  I'm not sure what Gordon was going for but as a female, I was a tad offended that the female waitresses wore outfits that reminded me of Hooters and that the guys were completely covered up.

S"I wasn't a burger person but came for the Gordon Ramsay hype. We had truffle Parmesan fries to begin with, the fries is ordinary but with the truffle a\xc3\xafole sauce it was really good. I got the hill's kitchen burger and it was the best burger I've ever had. The burger was not dry nor greasy. The hint of spiciness from the roasted jalape\xc3\xb1o peppers made it so delicious. Brought the whole flavor to another level. I think Gordon is very good with the flavor and the texture of the foods he create. This burger joint was the most surprising meal for me in this trip. \nThe decoration of the restaurant is very modern and fun. The fire display in the transparent wall with their logo is eye catching. The waiter who served us was very friendly and not seemed hurry even it's busy. It showed professionalism. The only thing I  DONT LIKE about is the servers' uniform. It's a spandex nylon texture denim look top that shows every inch of the person's body. IF the person has a good body shape it will look good but most people don't have perfect shapes so it is not a pretty picture. I think the design was originally made for Gordon or people like him who does ironman triathlon. Anyways. I don't want to continue on this insignificant topic. It's just details I noticed. Overall. It's very good. I'll definitely go again next time I'm in Vegas."

The Euro burger had just the right amount of goat cheese. \nOnion rings and fries are very good, not oily and crisp!

S'After about a four hours drive we were pretty hungry.  Walking in and saw a line and thought "okay great, how long is this going to take?"  Checked in with the hostess and she said about a 20 to 25 minutes wait, so I guess not too bad.  So you get in a line for party of two or less.  For larger party you sign in with the hostess.  \n\nhoney pig bao bun (3/5) -- ordered this for the appetizer.  There\'s two bao in an order.  The bao (chinese steamed bun) is pretty much like the ones you get when you order the peking duck platter at a Chinese restaurant.  Nice and soft.  Sandwiched in the middle are roasted pork belly, cucumber,  radish, cilantro, and hoisin sauce.  The reason for only 3 stars is because the pork belly was bland.  There\'s not enough flavor.  And the meat is not fatty enough.  I think if the cha siu was more flavorful and juicy, this would have been mouth watering delicious.    \n\nfarm burger (3.5/5) -- duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and fried egg.   The beef patty was good.  Moist and juicy.  I ordered a medium and it was cooked just right.  Reason for not giving it a 4 or 5 stars is because I think the duck bacon was a little too salty for my taste.  The saltiness over power the flavor in the beef.  \n\nbritannia burger (4/5) -- English sharp cheddar, mango chutney, and arugula. Tasty!  The beef patty was juicy and moist.  The mango chutney gives the burger a hint of sweetness.  The arugula provides a pungent peppery taste.  Overall, a well crafted burger.  \n\nOreo shake (5/5) -- YUMMY YUM YUM!  Sooooo good!  Oreo milk shake with a layer of creme brulee and whipped cream.  To add to the deliciousness, you also get a whole oreo on top!  Shared it with my hunnie.  I got the side with the cream :)  The milk shake was creamy.   The creme brulee was so smooth and rich.  Delicious! \n\nService was good.  Staffs are attentive.

S"I recently ate at Gordon Ramsey Burgr @ Planet Hollywood and thought I should write a review.\n\nAs a fan, I had recently eaten at GR Steak, which was an amazing experience, but again as a fan I felt compelled to eat at burgr and probably shouldn't have, leaving my GR food experience as super positive.\n\nBurgr is ok, the food is good enough and its cheap.  But given that Ramsey's name is on it you expect a certain level of quality and its not there and honestly I'm pretty forgiving.  I know line chef's and serving staff work very hard and things happen but I again because Gordon Ramsey associated his name to it I expected a base level of quality.\n\nMy burger was ok, undercooked but ok and I enjoyed it honestly but I should have eaten at holstein's in the Cosmopolitan which is a lot better in my estimation.  \n\nThe burger was undercooked.  I had ordered medium rare but what I got was really rare. Despite being super rare it was good enough to eat and not return.  The burger was also pretty bland, I expected a bit more flavor.\n\nThe fries were overpowering - a lot of Parmesan which got all over everything and overpowered the fries and everything else.  But surprisingly I will say the ketchup was really good! It was also good presentation, I'll give it that.\n\nBut honestly I don't think I'll go back and wont be recommending it to anyone.  Its cheap and looks neat but if I want to pay for a premium burger I'll go to holstein's as I've had very good luck there.  \n\nMaybe it was a bad day I'm not sure but as I said I was less then impressed.

S"It took me a hot minute to figure out why this place was called BurGR with the emphasis on the GR and the misspelling of the word 'burger' in such an odd manner. But yo, my friends didn't catch onto it either and they go to USC (some go to UCR too so we balance the highs with the lows, we a diverse bunch). \n\nBut yeah, for those of you wondering, the GR is for Gordon Ramsay, that arrogant bloke that we all know and love from Master Chef and Hell's Kitchen fame. \n\nI actually thought the GR would have stood for Gastro Release or Great Reaming ... but no! It is simply a clever way to secretly endorse the great GR $munny$ himself. Okay, I dunno what I'm saying.\n\nWe had to wait a fairly ridiculous amount of time to seat 7 people. I don't think 7 is too big of a group especially when you're considering it's Vegas. Maybe I'm wrong though. I think they quoted us at 20 minutes, but it was definitely at least an hour. The girls working were also wearing skimpy ass clothes, but I didn't understand what they were supposed to be. They just sort of reminded me of the Hot Dog on a Stick girls. Maybe that's what they were going for though ...\n\nI think I had just recovered from a pretty massive hang over when I came here, so a greasy burger and 'truffle' fries sounded right up my alley. To note, I was also sick. Yeah, I was sick, exhausted, and hung over in Vegas on New Year's Eve. IDGAD, IDGAF. numbersignSWOLOnumbersignYAG ... (+100 pts if you get that)\n\nAny way, I ordered the Farm burger which clocked in at an amazing $15 price tag (sans frites to boot!) solely because it touted duck breast bacon and a fried egg. Let me tell you that a duck breast bacon ain't anything different from a regular bacon. Maybe my tastebuds don't know anything about anything, but I couldn't tell the difference. In fact, the entire burger tasted really bland. Like ridiculously so. But then again, I was sick, so I dunno! \n\nI also got truffle fries that came with a house ketchup which was just sweet and a truffle white sauce thing? Which was just creamy and bland. I preferred the ketchup. The fries alone were salty. Sorry I can't use foodie words like umami and pungent and mouthfeel. Fries were salty. Ketchup was sweet. Burger tasted like nothing. The end. Simple as it gets.\n\nThe fries DID come in a cone though, which impressed me. That's some fancy EURO shit right there. I dug that. Regardless of serving apparatus, they were still pretty unimpressive fries. It's like handing someone shit on a golden platter. It's impressive for a second or two, and then you kind of get dismayed. \n\nThe bar next door was cool though. The bartender made me a white russian and he didn't even card me! I'm 21 of course, but me being a baby faced Asian don't help, so I guess I was glad that he was kind enough to believe in me. \n\nAll in all, not as big of a disappointment as Wicked Spoons. And seeing as how the alternative was to eat at the $77 Cesar's buffet, BurGR was a welcome choice. I'd take a good ol' Father's Office burger or Umami burger any day though. Hell, even the Counter would do."

One of the manager guys told us to hang tight and he would accommodate the change; we were seated 10 minutes later. The service was great. All the staff was pleasant and although busy, it seemed like we were the only table our waitress had. It's reasonably priced as well. We had a Hells Kitchen Burger which was ok, nothing to back flip about. The Parmesan fries were delicious with the house ketchup; there was a truffle mayo too but I found it to be too bold for my taste buds. Sweet potato fries were good too.

But I thought the entire meal was mediocre and underwhelming. \nWe started with jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers and onion rings. I will say it was the beat part of the meal. In fact the onion rings were the best thing I tried.\nNow, getting down to the burger business. It was a difficult decision. My girlfriend and I decided to split a Euro and the Homestyle. Both of our husband\'s went for the Hog. We all ordered them cooked to medium. There was no consistency in the temperature of the meat. The colors ranged from red to pink. The husbands both complained that the Hog had an Asian type of flavor going and were not impressed. I was afraid to eat my half of the Homestlye because it seemed undercooked. The Euro was OK, but still not mind blowingly good. Finally, the fries came with 2 kinds of "fancy" ketchup. They both tasted the same and chili powder was a main ingredient.  \nAlso, reservations are not accepted so expect to wait a while for a table.'

S'It was a 30-minute wait (give them your cell # and they\'ll text you when the table is ready).  There were three of us.  We ordered the American (me), Euro (person #2), and the Farm (person #3).   Also ordered a side of parm fries and onion rings.  The verdict?  Good, but not "WOW that\'s a juicy mother of a burger!"  The curry ketchup was the highlight for me, but that can\'t be good when ketchup steals the show.  The onion rings were better than the fries.  As for the burgers... the Farm was the best.'

S'I think Gordon Ramsey needs to practice what he preaches. I love his shows where he is always complaining about the food being too cold or raw. I had lunch at about 1:30 pm.    I had the damnation chicken burger which was served slightly above room temperature. It taste fine but there was no heat to the burger that boasted jalapino as a main ingredient. I did not see a jalapino anywhere. It was cooked through and served on a plate with no garnish just an empty plate.\nI also got the chocolate and carmel milkshake. This was served just above room temperature. Not cold like a good shake. It also had the caramel as a layer on top of the chocolate. I had to stir the shake to combine the caramel into the chocolate and since it was filled so high it spilled over the edge down the side and onto the table. I had to get someone to clean up the mess.\nI also got the sweet potato fries. They were also served just above room temp. Covered in powdered sugar with a dipping sauce that was like weak lemon curd it was more of a dessert that fries. The fries were cooked well but I could only eat about one-fourth of the order. (It was a huge amount of fries that could easily feed two or three people.) I was so over taken by the sugar on the fries that I had to stop eating them as I was starting to not feel well. By the time I left I was not well at all. I started having an upset stomach and really bad gas as well as feeling like I had motion sickness. This continued all night and I felt so bad I could not eat anything  for the rest of the night. That was last night This morning I feel better but bloated.\nI was not impressed with the food though I really wanted to be impressed. The decor is nice and the staff is young and sexy. I guess Gordon is selling sex appeal to make up for the food. The music was bit loud so people had to talk louder to be heard which made for a very loud lunch. They had wide screen tv sets to watch so I watched all the fast food commercials. I spent $40 with tax and tip for lunch. I have had meals at Red Robbin and Subways that I have enjoyed more. Go by the place and take pictures of the fire wall but pass the meal and get something cheaper at the food court.'

S"I totally hate to do this but the environment kinda killed it for us. You cannot hear the person sitting right next to you talk. The server just kinda pretended she heard everything we said but I don't think she did. the food itself was great, but hard to enjoy a meal that should be a memorable one when you cant even talk to the person your there with. Definitely make a reservation they say you don't need but its most likely an hour wait if you don't. I expected better service."

S"Gordon Ramsay is known for perfection and doesn't take anything less than that and after hearing he had a restaurant in Vegas during my visit, I knew I had to try it and see his take on dining! This place instantly captures your attention boasting fire and flames shooting in a wavy pattern seen through glass with his logo name written in front of it. The place is trendy and modern with people being seated and served and food runners that seemed to be running around like clockwork. Upon watching this happen while waiting in line, I was also super hungry so I was more than ready to eat here!\n\nBeautiful tables, silverware, and cool square and wavy plates was what we were met with when were finally seated. The menu was foldable and wrapped around our silverware napkins. After looking at a cliche picture of mr Ramsay himself on the unfolding menu, I perused all the juicy sounding burgers and we ordered.\n\nWe started off with the jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers, in came with 6, and they all were served in their own square shot glass that had a white fiery sauce with a squirt of red hot sauce in them. Lets just say I wasn't prepared for these because I bit into them instantly and seconds later was asking for more water to cool my mouth down! The restaurant read my mind because before I had a chance, my glass was being refilled and refilled again, they must know this is common when people order these, I mean there place has fire everywhere and it's Hell's Kitchen, I am not surprised! The waiter also told us after that one of the poppers was secretly spicier than the others, kind of like a Russian roulette type of deal which I thought was neat and innovative and I'm pretty sure I got that one!\n\nNext the burgers.....oh man, nothing short of amazing. Fresh buns, perfectly melted cheese, fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked meat. Everything seemed to just melt in my mouth as it was the perfect balance of flavor. I opted for the Hell's Kitchen burger which wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. It had tomato, avocado, peppers, and cheese. My date got the arugula and goat cheese burger which I tried and it was just as delicious. I was highly pleased eating them as we munched on our garlic fries with a side of homemade ketchup and truffle mayonnaise dipping sauces on the side. The fries were great but a little heavy on the seasoning.\n\nBeing in Vegas, these prices were very reasonable (~$12-$16 a burger) and it left us with plenty of money aside to use for gambling! This place did not disappoint at all and it was the perfect way to start off the night! Gordon Ramsay knows how a restaurant should be run and this place is a prime example!"

S"Well I am a big fan Chef Ramsey and his styles of food so I am biased, I had the pork burger, was a great spin a burger.  Truffle fries are a must get, and the chipotle ketchup was great as well.  The atmosphere is loud and modern, we enjoyed that.  \nThe waitstaff was the part not quite up to par with what I would expect from a GR restaurant.  They could be a bit more attentive and less social with each other and pay attention to the customers.  \nThe wait was fine, greeters were nice.\nOverall it's a $50-$75 burger trip, but the uniqueness and experience is worth it."

S"Euro Burger!!! Oh my, how i miss thee already. At first i thought I wouldn't like this place. I really just wanted to check it out because It's a Ramsey restaurant.\n\nThe price was reasonable which was a pleasant surprise. The wait was not bad either because It's one of those eat and get out quick type of setup. Staff were awesome and seemed like they genuinely care about the customers. \n\nSo I tried the Euro Burger and Truffle fries. I had to literally eat slow because I wanted to savor the moment! Fries were nice and crunchy outside, moist and tasty inside. The truffle sauce... Oh man, the truffle sauce! Can't get enough of that thing. It was sooo good that having only one cup was not enough. \n\nNow here comes the Euro Burger. Meat so juicy, sauce oh so darn good. Even the bun tasted amazing. Hands down one of the all time top 5 burgers that I tasted so far. I can probably eat 5 of them at once if my stomach was big enough. \n\nSure the place looks like a tourist trap but don't let that stop you from visiting this place. The next time i visit Vegas, I will definitely get me some Euro Burger again."

I bet it's like a thousand calories each shake but its good.\n\nthe boa appetizer and chicken wings are good but its small portions.\nthe service we got here was great everyone is very efficient and they move fast so you're not waiting too long for your food or your drinks.

We had an American burger which was awesome. The 28 day aged burger was the BEST I had ever had. It was cooked perfectly. We had the truffle fries which were amazing as well.

S'I watched a bunch of Gordon Ramsay TV shows and finally got to try his BurGR restaurant out. I came in with HIGH expectations and every one of them were met. Whether or not you are a Ramsay fan, this place is a must try for the best service and burgers.\n\nWait:\nYes, there will always be a line. Each time I walked by at all hours of operations, I saw a line.\nMy visit was on a Saturday for lunch. 10:45am Saturday = no line. 11am (opening) = 30 people in line. Since we were the first group to enter, line died down really fast. However, expect a line if you go during any main meal times.\n\nService: \nAfter being seated, we were presented with an IPad for the drink menu. Very easy to navigate and modern. Our server(s) (they apparently have a "backup" server as well) were all attentive and friendly. Great service.\n\nTiming:\nIf you watch Hell\'s Kitchen or Master Chef, you know Ramsay is all about timing and putting out delicious food without making the guests wait. I have to say, the timing of the drinks to appetizer to entree was perfect. \n\nFood:\nSince it was my first time, had to order the Hell\'s Kitchen burger -Medium Well. Let tell you.. from the top bun to the bottom, pure perfection. The buns were super soft yet maintained it\'s form from the crisp outside, the bottom bun was not soggy, and all the ingredients worked really well. Definitely one of the best burgers I\'ve had.\n\nJalapeno Poppers - what a clever way to present it. Not that having a main dipping bowl to dip your poppers is hard work but the individual shot glasses containing sauce and the popper makes it... easier and more enjoyable. Hands down, the freshest jalapeno poppers I\'ve had. \n\nFries with Truffle oil. If you are dining with someone else, 2 burgers and one order of fries is plenty for both. I saw some people order a side of fries per person and none of them left finishing the fries off. What can I say... fries.. truffle oil.. yum yum yum.\n\nGreat service, great food, VERY reasonable price (TR members get $1 off each item), this is definitely a must try if you are on the strip.\n\nGO GO GO GO GO!'

Even if you don't think you have enough room, get one of these awesome desserts!\n\nWe didn't have much of a wait.

S'Prepare to get tantalized by Gordon Ramsay\'s BurGR! Featuring the all-American favorite sandwich with his own creative twist. With that said, be ready to wait for a table if you\'re with a big party otherwise, for groups of two or three people, you can wait in line outside the restaurant to get seated at the bar. The advantage of being located in Planet Hollywood is the fact that you can walk around the Miracle Mile Shops to kill time. As soon as your table is ready, you\'ll get a text from the restaurant. Convenient, don\'t you say?\n\nAs far as the food goes, here\'s what I tried:\n\nThe TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES were good. I wish the fries were thinner and crispier. It\'s just my preference. But flavor wise, especially with the truffle aioli dip, it\'s fantastic! An order can be shared by 2-3 people. $11 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#fu1M2DR5IoCGVupQGjmG3A\n\nI\'m such a fan of SWEET POTATO FRIES and Chef Ramsay did not disappoint. The honey jalapeno dipping sauce he paired with this was absolutely beautiful! The fries themselves were cooked perfectly, thin with a nice crisp... just how I like my fries! Again, plan to share, or not! $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#DBVUeVe3EfoRTIdWiKx6nw\n\nThe burger choices on the menu are not that many so I wanted to try them all if I could. I\'m glad I have a family to eat out with because we can each get different things and share to get a taste of several items the restaurant has to offer. Take note that their burgers are grilled over apple and alder wood which is responsible for the smoked flavor aroma you\'ll sense in the air. \n\nPer our server\'s recommendation, I went with THE HOG BURGER. Instead of beef, the patty used here is Mangalitsa pork which is an "old-world heritage breed renowned for its rich, butter fat and flavorful meat." Topped with sharp cheddar, apple butter, and arugula, this burger is probably the healthiest among all the burgers on the menu next to the Earth Burger (no meat). The meat itself is overflowing with awesome flavors but the entire taste of the burger sandwich was a bit on the salty side for me. $18 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#jRL6Zjpomomxh9CsQXXMAg\n\nI also had a quarter of my husband\'s FARM BURGER and this my fellow Yelpers,  is my favorite here! The beef patty was cooked to perfection and who doesn\'t like fried egg on their burger?! More importantly, topped off with duck breast bacon? All I can say is...WOWZA! $15 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#UKPej0Qj1CDjKSo7DSn1qw\n\nIf you like anything spicy then the famed HELL\'S KITCHEN BURGER will be sure to satiate your palate. The roasted jalapeno poppers add a nice kick while the creaminess of the avocado gives off a silky sensation in your mouth. Oh and let\'s not forget the fried egg. It\'s probably safe to say I really enjoyed this. $14 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#s3YRX-KZ3dTR7nits2ZuQg\n\nLastly, my daughter ordered the EURO BURGER. I like goat cheese and almost anything with truffle, hence my adoration for this creation. Topped off with arugula and oven roasted tomato, this burger is a winner in my book. I highly recommend if you\'re a goat cheese fan. $16 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?selected=pxle_4AJBnqWpLLNXwyHvA#tu4w5YVMRHOp_qz91zGkAg\n\nA burger meal is never complete without a milkshake. Our sugar fix was SHAKE #3. It\'s banana shake layered with butterscotch pudding on the top, then a snicker doodle cookie for that added crunch. Verdict? Deeeeeelightful! You\'ll literally go bananas over this one. $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#oeLyAQ8Jv2nNgVj90nJ5IA\n\nSERVICE started off not-so-great but throughout our meal here, our server proved me wrong and showed our table genuine service. She patiently answered all our menu questions, took our chaotic order quite well, and made sure all our glasses were filled all throughout our stay here. And we did stay for quite a while. \n\nIf you\'re in town and tired of the buffets, this place is worth a shot!'

S'I\'m thinking about breaking up with Gordon over this debacle of a restaurant. And that says a lot because I love this man\'s restaurants. \n\nYou almost get the idea when you walk in that you\'re going to be disappointed. From the cheap looking outfits the girls wear, to the crowded, pushed together tables with everyone sitting on top of each other, you feel mediocrity permeating this place from the onset. \n\nIt seems such a weird thing to be eating here as I\'m vegetarian, but they do have ONE option for me so I wasn\'t staring into space while my friends noshed on their burgrs. That\'s how you spell it, right? No? Okay, sorry.\n\nFirst the service. If you were thinking this restaurant was on the mediocre side then the service would have you falling over into it. Completely unable to wait on more than one table at a time (both times I visited). My water glass the first time didn\'t even recognize its use as a water glass. The second time was a little better, but the waiter buzzed around like a robot barely talking. Apparently he was working on his multitasking. Also, how unsexy are jeans with the intials "GR" on the pocket? A little overboard on the vanity methinks.\n\nI had the Earth Burgr (ha, I just love doing that) consisting of grilled portobello mushroom, fontina cheese, arugula and roasted tomato. The combo sounds good and it\'s fine, but not for $15. I mean, it\'s not even meat, it\'s a mushroom disguised as meat. That lessens the chance of me raving about it considerably. I like to get what I pay for or I lose the ability to rave about anything. The taste is fine, the bun is soft, the arugula is a nice touch, but it seriously is just OKAY. \n\nLet\'s just get to the fries. I have never in my life tasted fries like this. I hated them. They are too big, they are too SOMETHING and it\'s not something that\'s positive. I had both the regular and the parmesan. Just no. The flavor is just wrong. I can\'t even really put my finger on why. I regret ever tasting these at all. \n\nNow to dessert. Sigh. I was hoping that after just spending $80 on a meal prior to dessert that I would somehow be redeemed for that colossal wasting of money. HA! I\'d be wrong! Ordered the sticky toffee pudding ice cream on a stick thing and wondered who in the hell I\'d pissed off at this place. What a joke of a dessert. First, it\'s so obviously made ahead of time (it\'s frozen, so of course), but it tastes it. I\'m not a fan. I can\'t even go on about it, it was just such a disappointment. \n\nI\'ve been to GR Steak and the GR at the London (NYC) and have come from both feeling like I would never taste better. I think GR is much better at gourmet then low brow burgers (yeah, I even got tired of it).'

Place was quite busy because of course it\'s in the center of the vegas strip in a busy mall. Drink menu was presented on an iPad which is becoming the new thing at most metropolitan and touristy places. \n\nGot the Hell\'s Kitchen burger. I\'m usually not a fan of jalape\xc3\xb1os and avocado in my burger but I got it anyway because well I wanted to try the "official" burger. Regardless of my preferences for burger additives the beef was not really seasoned well. It was cooked good and the bun was good but the lack of seasoning made the entire experience bland. \n\nThe fries did not taste fresh. Despite dipping them in the accompanying sauces I couldn\'t really get myself to like them. Very dry.\n\nThe strawberry milkshake was good but it was just like any other good milkshake. Nothing to go crazy about. \n\nMediocre food. Extra charge for fries. Not really feeling it. \n\nMy waitress was super hot though. And nice. So that\'s a plus. And hot. Pleasant too.

S"I've only had a to-go order here, therefore, my review is mainly for the food itself and not for the service or ambiance of the restaurant. \n\nCame here a couple weeks ago because my family was in town and they love Gordon Ramsay. We ordered a couple Hell's Kitchen and Farm burgers. \n\nThe good:\n1. Girls at the front were very friendly and helpful. I read a couple reviews that said they were rude, but we did come at a time when they're not busy at all, so I think that helps. My parents, being the Asian tourists they are, took pics all over the restaurant and they weren't hassled.\n2. Burgers are great, perfectly seasoned. \n3. Menu is cute.\n\nThe bad, or I guess the so-so:\n1. Girl who helped me order said that they grill the burger pretty rare here and told me to order Medium Well when I said I like my burger pink in the middle. I've ordered a burger Medium at the Counter and it came out pretty much still bloody red in the middle, so I thought BurGR is the same way. I ordered mine Medium....there was hardly any pink in the center. It looks like a Medium Well on its way to become Well Done really soon. It was overcooked. The burger still tastes great but I was disappointed they didn't cook it to my liking. \n2. Price. Obviously I do understand I'm paying extra because first, it's inside a Planet Hollywood on the Strip, and second, it's Gordon frickin' Ramsay. But the burger was pretty small for $15 and it doesn't come with fries (most gourmet burger places don't include it). Fries are another $7 - $10 so you'll be spending $22 - $25 for burger and fries. Maybe I could justify the price if I were sitting down, enjoying the atmosphere or watching sports. But I wasn't.\n\nI want to come back to dine in, and also try the jalapeno poppers which look amazing. If you do get a to-go order, check and make sure they cook the burger right before you leave.\n\nTip: use your Total Rewards card! $1 cheaper for almost every item."

S'Went on Saturday night w/ no reservation. Was told an hour wait time but they text you when the table is ready which is nice, which allowed us to wander. 45 mins later, we were seated by the window looking into the casino. Our waitress, while nice, seemed very frantic, and we witnessed her drop water on another guest. However, we had no problems with her service. She explained the menu in full and gave "her" recommendations. The menu is small but really nice. \n\nWe got the Farm Burger, the Euro Burger, and truffle fries. Everything came out fast and as ordered. It was all delicious, especially the fries. It was one of the best burgers I ever had. The manager came by and checked up on us as well. \n\nWe tried the Sticky Toffee Pops for dessert, knowing the Sticky Toffee Pudding was his signature dessert at his steakhouse in the Paris Hotel/Casino. However, we were utterly disappointed in these. (Side note: We went to his steakhouse and got the real Sticky Toffee Pudding and it was delicious!) \n\nWould definitely recommend going if you want a burger though.

I can usually pick which one I like better but not this time. Both very different from each other and equally stellar. It may look smallish but we were so full we couldn't finish the fries.

Perhaps when you live here, you loose the awe most seem to find in celebrities.\n\nBurGR suffers from the same maladies as all the other $50 burger joints on The Strip do. Very slow, very expensive, overworked and (I'm sure) poorly paid staff.\n\nThe menu has some interesting variations on the theme and surely one of them will be to your taste, but we've found nothing so positive that it justifies putting up with the negatives.\n\nThis is just another celebrity carpet-bagger here to suck some more $$ while the gray train is still running.

S'I thought the one featured item "the burger" was a bit dry. I\'ll prefix this with the fact that I like my burgers plain. Meat and bun which means the choice of meat, it\'s seasoning, the bun, how it\'s cooked are all that much more important. When I asked for for burger medium I found it to be overcooked (dry). I sent it back and got a burger that was undercooked. Neither had anything but average flavor. So why did I give the place four stars instead of 2 or 3. The truffle fries. They were steller.'

S"Last day in Vegas. Staying at the Flamingo, and hubby had a hankerin' for a burger. We asked a server at the pool, and she recommended BurGR. A nice short walk to Planet Hollywood, and BurGR was right at the entry near Cabo Wabo Cantina. Walked right in and was seated right away. \n\nHusband ordered the American, I ordered the Hot and Spicy, which had tomato, jalape\xc3\xb1os, and avocado, with a sesame seed bun. It was absolutely delicious. The flavor was so bold, the burger so juicy, the cheese and avocado, so nicely paired. We shared the original fries, with a side of avocado ranch for dipping. We ate every last bite!! The service was prompt, the lighting was a little dark, and I felt like we were sitting a little close to our neighbors, but I understand being in a casino hotel, that's the way it is. Nice beer selection, which was presented on an IPad. Interesting way to display the drink menu, but it was fine by me. The meal was affordable, about $55 for 2 burgers, 2 tall drafts, and a fry. \n\nThis was the best meal I had in 3 days in Vegas. If you want a delicious burger, and aren't turned off by celebrity owned restaurants, check this place out!  YUM"

S'In the wise words of Gordon Ramsay, "This was bloody fantastic." Also, "*BLEEP* BLEEP* *BLEEP* %$%#%#!!!!"\n\nI didn\'t expect much going in, as every time I walked past BurGR it was always filled with tourists that looked miserable and tired. Tourist trap to the max, but like a moth to a flame, I was attracted to it and knew that after 3 times in Vegas without going in, this was it. \n\nIf you\'re a Total Rewards Member (at a higher tier), all menu items are a dollar off and you can cut everyone in line. Too bad all my points are at MGM.The wait wasn\'t too terrible and I was plenty entertained by the people behind me talking about Master Chef Junior and the differences between the UK and US Gordon Ramsay shows. \n\nMy friend and I weren\'t in the mood for fries (wahh...next time) so we split a cold chicken soba salad and HOT DIGGITY DAMN. Yes. Drop whatever the hell you\'re eating and split this. It was so good I didn\'t even want my burger anymore. I just wanted more salad. \n\nShe ordered the Farm Burger ("orgasm in my mouth") and I ordered the Hell\'s Kitchen Burger medium rare. DELICIOUS. While not the best burger I\'ve ever tasted, it is definitely top 5. Everything went well together and I happily scarfed down $15 while trying not to look like I was vacuuming it into my mouth.\n\nThe service was fantastic and our server was personable and friendly (not to mention super young). I will be back!!'

S"I don't really know what to say, except this is the best burger I've ever had in my life. The patty was juicy and well cooked, and the combination of tastes complemented everything perfectly. It really was as good as a burger can get. Just watch out though, the Hell's Kitchen's burger can get SPICY. The chanterelle mushroom burger, which my gf got, was also delicious. The parmesan truffle fries were tasty as well, and matched the burger well. The line can get long, but if you only have two people, they guarantee 20 minute or less wait if you stand in line. I waited about 4 minutes. Seriously consider making this place a staple of my vegas trips in the future."

S"Be prepared to wait, unless you make reservations here, they are really racking in the business! Our wait wasn't too bad, to get in at least, about 40min. It took a half hour to get our food, but like I said, they are pretty busy, and our food was at least piping hot and fresh when we got it.\nWe came here for the Restaurant Week deal, and I got the Parmesan Truffle fries with the Earth burger, my boyfriend got the Euro burger and the fries as well.\nThe fries are amazing! I've never had truffle fries before, so I was pretty blown away by these. They come  with their own truffle sauce and a house made ketchup, but the fries taste really good with their corresponding truffle one. They are huge steak fries, and they give you a lot of them\nThe Earth burger is a portabella mushroom with some melty cheese and tomato. It wasn't the best I have had, yet it was not the worst. It was really disappointing though, since there is SO much you can do with veggie burgers, but oh well. \nThe dessert was a sticky toffee pudding push pop, very much like the childhood Flintestone pops, with a salted peanut ice creamed layered with a toffee cake. Pretty darn good, but I didn't like the combination much. The salty ice cream with the sweet cake would sound great, but they didn't mix very well with me. I would prefer the cake by itself and leave the ice cream.\nMy boyfriend loved his Euro burger, and the fries, but the prices outside of this week's deal, and the wait, will keep us away for a while."

After selecting our drinks, we chose different burgers. I chose the hell's kitchen burger and it was amazing. You know how some burgers drip all this shit on a plate when you bite into it, but this burger was contained. All the juice was soaked into the patty, and each bite was great. The fries though sucked ass, but I came here for the burger."

S'I commend Gordan Ramsay for his work, but in all honesty this place was alright. The fire/sign decoration, creative menu design, and the I-Pad drink menu was all impressive but the food itself was not as savory as I would expect. \n\nWe ordered the jalapeno poppers, truffle parmesan fries, and the Farm burger. The Jalapeno poppers were yummy and came with this spicy ranch sauce. FYI, they include a "surprise" jalapeno popper which is basically a super spicy one that creeps up on you. Haha. The fries were hearty, but it definitely wasn\'t the best fries I\'ve had. The duck burger itself had all the right ingredients but for some reason it just wasn\'t as savory as I was hoping for. If anything, I think it was the burger meat - all the add ons and condiments saved this burger. \n\nThe sticky toffee pudding push pops were a good ending to the meal, yet had an icy/frost-bitten consistency to it. I could understand someone that\'s not into sticky toffee pudding being turned off by these. \n\nThere is a wait, but they do give you the option of giving your phone number and they\'ll text you when your table is ready.\n\nAll in all, it was a good experience but definitely not my favorite burger joint.'

Turn and burn is the name of the game in this high traffic area (in planet hollywood).  With that said, the staff was helpful and my drink was never empty.\n\nGot the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Truffle Fries.  Both were excellent, but if I were anywhere else, I would never pay what I did here.  However, the experience coupled with a solid product left me walking away happy.  Just know that you are paying for the experience with your meal and you will be satisfied."

Of course we had the sticky toffee pudding pops for dessert\\ and they did not disappoint!\n\nCons: There will most likely be a wait if you go during your average lunch/dinner time so plan for that, there is first come/first serve seating at the bar area.\n\nOverall great place to dine!'

S"I've never seen Hell's Kitchen or any of Gordon Ramsay's other shows, but I've heard 'of' him. Our friends were staying at PH so we decided to meet up for lunch. On YELP (cough) it says you can make reservations but when we called concierge they said no, it's first come first serve. Luckily, the line wasn't very long yet - 10-minutes before they opened for lunch service (11am). The hostesses slowly seating people which is typical since you don't want to overwhelm the kitchen with orders coming in at once. When we were seated, the service was awesome and the team of people taking orders, delivering and cleaning up were friendly AND efficient. The manager stopped by twice to check in with us as well.\n\n+ lots of tvs (good ambiance i guess, haha)\n+ high tech (drink menu on ipads, survey with check on iphone)\n+ total rewards members get -$1 nearly every menu item\n+ onion rings are SO GOOD\n+ hell kitchen's burger's jalapeno is VERY SPICY - I had to be a whimp and take it out\n+/- shakes are good but filling (and thick/heavy)\n- pricey (but if you can't finish your food, take it to go and it'll still be delicious later)"

S"Ate here today for lunch.  There was a short line but it moved quickly.  We had a party of six and were told it would be 40-45 minutes; however, they were able to seat us within 5!  (Brownie points for that!)  After reading earlier reviews, I went with the farm burger.  My wife had the Hell's kitchen burger.  We were both satisfied with each.  They were juicy and tasty and cooked to order (we both went with medium).  They weren't like knock-your-socks-off delish, but definitely decent.  I'd recommend trying this place if you're in the neighborhood.  \n\nWe tried all the fries--parmesan truffle, just fries, and sweet potato fries.  They were all good and came with tantalizing sauces for dipping.  If you like sweet potatoes, I'd definitely recommend the sweet potato fries.  They were absolutely amazing and worth going back for.  Also tried the onion rings and they were good as well (the dipping sauce added to their flavor).  \n\nThe service was average.  At the time we ate there, they weren't super busy but we still had to wait longer than usual to get refills and/or additional items.\n\nIn short, have I had more tasty burgers?  Yes.  Have I paid more for burgers?  Yes.  Have I paid less for burgers?  Of course.  So where does this one fall in the mix?  I'd rate it above average, but definitely not tops.  Worth checking out though."

My Uber Cheeseburger was juicy and full of flavor.  It had 3 different types of cheese and carmelized onions on a Brioche bun.  The parmesan fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The shake was to die for.  The chocolate was a pudding on top of the hazlenut flavored shake.  It was topped off with a thick whip cream and a praline cookie.  It is pricy, but what do you expect?...it's Gordon Ramsey."

S'I checked out this gourmet burger place while I was in Vegas.  Went in for lunch around Noon on a Saturday and the place was *packed*.  40 minute wait for lunch.  I snagged a seat at the bar and avoided the wait.  Service was a little slow, but it was really crowded, so I\'ll give them a free pass.\n\nProbably should take off  half a star because it was a little hard to eat lunch when every 5 minutes someone would shove their way up to the crowded bar and order a beer.  The bartenders should really try to guide the beer ordering masses to a spot along the bar where they won\'t be jammed between two people trying to enjoy lunch whilst saying things like "Tell me about a craft beer on tap that is *different*"\n\nI had the Uber Cheeseburger and fries.  Burger was perfect in every sense of the word.  The fries were some of the best I\'ve ever had; crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and perfectly salted.  They serve two different types of house-made ketchup, I didn\'t care for the Curry Ketchup.\n\nIf you are in Vegas, definitely give this place a try if you are in the mood for a burger.  It\'s in the Planet Hollywood hotel, right off of the casino floor towards the doors that open onto the strip.'

S'What can i say, gordon ramsay sets up great establishments.\n\nFirst impression is of course WOW. No res so we walk up, just in town for a few hours so any seat will do... by the by the place was full. As we sat near the bar i noticed there was a bar where you can watch the chefs... f me for missing that. I asked the staff if there is a special request needed to sit there. they said no just ask... i did, but even with empty seats couldn\'t get the seat. it\'s okay.\n\nmenu is awesome, simple and fairly priced. if you aren\'t used to paying more then 10 bucks for a burger then this place isn\'t for you. the price matches the quality and care the chef take to make it. if i could work there i so so would. fries are great. sauces were awesome. the chipotle ketchup wasn\'t very heated as i wished it would be, but i know the cliental are mostly tourist so oh well. i get it, make sure your guest aren\'t overwhelmed. curry ketchup, awesome! ummm, food great. oh yeah many awesome beers on tap... on to the next\n\nwhy no 5th star... staff. since this a review of overall, the staff let me down a little bit. the hostess, pretty awesome. our waitress you can tell was having a rough day, she had a look of concern and frustration the whole time. i get it, rough crowd when you have many coming in but take a min and get it together. smile. lucky for her the other staff that was just coming on for the switch was ready to go and very friendly. another thing... don\'t most managers have a office, one manager walkin the place and saying hey... good work. the other had much work to do and was busy at the bar but also running staff... ??\nwell, as i took a look around most people were okay, all but one table... most obvious too, they had that look like "where the hell is my damn waiter!!!" i called out to the manager working on with iPad, he asked what was up and i told him about the table... boom they got service. if i didn\'t i wonder how much longer they wouldve waited... so much wait staff kept passing them up. sad.\n\nbut, overall still gets my respect, i will be back, at the chef bar though. and maybe i\'ll bring my veg gf cause yes they do have a veg option. if you are in town and want to taste something gordon puts his name on then go in and try. maybe you\'ll love it too.'

S"My experience here at Gordon Ramsay exceeded my expectations!! Let me just tell you that you will not be disappointed!\n\nThis place is easy to find as it is located near the entrance of the casino at Planet Hollywood. As you wait in line, you'll be able to look at the touch-screen menu and gaze at the fiery decoration.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. Euro Burger ($16): Truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomato. I actually preferred this over my own burger. This is probably my favorite one! The truffle was spot on along with the flavors of the burger. The goat cheese was a great complement to the meat and truffle. Just imagine a perfection infusion of savory flavors leaving you wanting more!! (5/5)\n\n2. Farm Burger ($15): Duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and fried egg. Frankly, the only reason I chose this was because I was attracted to the idea of duck breast bacon. It wasn't that special as it just tasted like any typical bacon. However, the burger was delightful and delicious. But overall, I was eyeing my boyfriend's Euro Burger all night hehehehe. (5/5)\n\nService was friendly and very attentive. Will I come here again? Of course! I want to order my own Euro Burger next time and maybe run into Gordon Ramsey himself! The staff told us that he visits the location every so often. :)"

S"It was 3 star for food but great service bumped it up to 4 star! We ordered many different types of food  to try on. The shakes are AMAZING and unique! The 2 shakes that we ordered were: Coconut pudding and strawberry shake, Butterscotch pudding and banana shake. The shakes have a floating pudding on top, creating a different balance of color, texture and taste! Our Truffle parmesan fries came cold and too salty, so we sent it back for a more hot and less salt, and it was perfect. For burgers we had Hell's Kitchen burger (a bit spicy, perfect!), Uber cheese burger (the trio cheese has a unique flavor), and Farm burger, that had egg, oozing out. My favorite was the Hell's burger. We ordered Pork belly Dawg, which was a New York dog (super salty, beware!), with bits of cha siu that was overpowered by the saltiness of the dog, but the bun was a killer. My favorite small dish was Roasted jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers that was filled with cheddar cheese, cream cheese and bacon bits,  presented in 6 small shooter glass. Not only it was visually appealing, it also had a bold kick in taste factor! Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream  was memorable too. I loved the way they put it in a clear pop sickle case that you have to push up to eat it. I know they are just opened a few days ago and there were still things to improve. I will definitely give them a chance again in the future.  I had a nice talk with the friendly manager, Emily, and she was listening and was writing down notes. I liked the fact that they are open minded, and willing to take suggestion to improve. The best part was the SERVICE! They explained the menu and food with passion, very knowledgeable, and very open minded for improvement! Manager Emily ROCKS!!"

I think it really brings out the medium rare taste of the meat.

Gordan Ramsay puts perfection above my expectations. \n\nThe only con about this dining experience was the long wait after we ordered our food.

I was overjoyed when I realized that my hotel, Planet Hollywood, was home to Chef Ramsays affordable burger joint.  We came in at 1:30 am on Friday and enjoyed not having to wait. Our service was friendly and the food was amazing.  I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger.  It was tasty but the grilled jalape\xc3\xb1o it came with was way way way too hot.  I'm just going to assume this was one of those flukey hot jalape\xc3\xb1os.  Usually I have no issue chomping down a jalape\xc3\xb1o pepper but this was the hottest thing I have ever eaten... My whole throat burned.   I pulled the pepper out and enjoyed the rest of my burger.  Our table scarfed down the truffle fries too.  \n\nSaturday we came in for lunch and there was a wait.  There were 4 of us though, so we could give them our number and then meander through the casino, which really helped.  The Oreo shake is AMAZING.  It's rich but its like heaven through a straw.

Went to the Asian hostess and ask for a table for 2 and she old me the wait would be 20/30 minutes. Sure, no problem. While waiting I got a call from a friend saying that he wanted to join us but wasn\'t sure yet. Asian Hostess comes to check again "so table for 2 right? I\'m just making sure". I said, YES but a 3rd person might join us for drinks. She said "oh no. That changes everything. Your wait now is going to be 1 hr. And I said ok, I will make sure he\'s coming and I will let you know ASAP. She looked at me and said "AND DONT EVEN TRY TO SNEAK A 3rd PERSON TO A TABLE FOR 2, OR ELSE YOU\'RE GETTING KICKED OUT!" I was like "excuse me? Get kicked out of a restaurant? Are you serious?" She said "that\'s how my manager is". That KILLED my experience. I was really really upset. After that, I dont even remember how my burger tasted like. The straw is shorter than the cup... You have to fish it with your fingers to drink out of it. Definitely NOT the attitude I expected from a GORDON RAMSEY restaurant and his standards.'

S"Gordon Ramsay BurGR! There's a huge flame wall outside the restaurant. You can't miss it. The entrance to it is kind of weird if you're entering from the casino side... gotta make a loop around to enter.\n\n== Food ==\n\nHell's Kitchen Burger. Was it supposed to be spicy? Where's the heat. Bring me the heat! Sadness. Great tasting burger otherwise. Juicy with a nicely done bun.\n\nJalapeno popper. There's 5 that are mild and 1 that's really spicy. It's a roulette game to see how the sucker is. The popper tasted great even the spicy one.\n\nTruffle fries were delicious with their sauces.\n\n== Service ==\n\nWait to get in kind of sucks. It took around 20 minutes to get in even though the place was pretty big. The waiter was really nice and really tentative! Huge kudos to him. Wait for the food is a bit long also, but good company can make up for that.\n\n== Overall ==\n\nSlow to get a table and it's slow to get your food. The menus make a nice souvenir and the waiter can give you a coaster also if you want one. The burger is overall good! Truffle fries and Jalapeno popper were delicious. Didn't have anything that I didn't like here."

S"I'm never disappointed when I come to Four Peaks. Their house-brewed beers are great--the first time I came I ordered the sampler, where you can try them all (there are quite a few choices), or you can ask for a taste of one you think you want. My favorites are Hop Knot and Oatmeal Stout. Inside is an expanded seating area and bar which shows sports events. I would not recommend coming during a big event--it can get very busy and loud. However, out on the patio, with lots of misters, is the best place to sit. The service is usually good, and the food is surprisingly good for a brewery. My favs are the hamburgers (which I try not to eat too much) and the vegetarian beer bread (read thick pita-like bread with mozzarella and roasted vegetables, including yummy portobello mushrooms). I like Four Peaks best in the afternoon to relax on the patio, maybe for lunch, rather than at night, when it gets more bar-like and can be hard to find parking (FYI there is parking behind the bar if none is available on the street). \n\nSummary: Beer is great. Try their seasonals (had a stellar 11% barleywine). Food is good for a pub, but not exceptional. Just a good place to hang out and relax with friends."

S"I definitely recommend Four Peaks for any beer lover who visits the valley, in my opinion our best brewery in Phoenix. Although it has become more of a restaurant than brewpub when they removed the pool table/relaxing area and made more seating; it's still a great place to sit and talk, catch up with old(or make new) friends, or watch the game. \nThe Raj IPA is my personal favorite but Kiltlifer and HopKnot are other local favorites. First time there? Get their sampler and decide for yourself, their seasonals are also excellent! Happy hour (regular and reverse) are definitely the time to go for $ deals, but be warned this is a popular hangout for regulars. \nFour Peaks food was a lot better a couple of years ago, but their flavors are still well done. My fav starter or small bite is their spinach-artichoke dip that comes with beer bread (small pita bites made with beer) and tortilla chips. Perfect to share with one or two people. My favorite main dish is the salmon BLT but check out their specials online ahead of time before heading in, these are usually delicious things you can't find on the menu. \nAnother thing that's not on their menu is grilled cheese. I know, as simple as it may seem theirs is delicious and goes great with their soup of the day for something a little less filling. Don't forget to add avacado and tomoato! \nAlso, they do brunch on the weekends. Used to just be for holidays that fell on those days but now it seems to be a usual thing. Haven't been in awhile but from what I remember it's special dishes or buffett style. You chose.\nSee you there!"

S'Ahhh, Four Peaks.  By far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  This place is fantastic as far as brew pubs go - great beer and great food to go with it.  I can\'t believe I haven\'t taken the time to review it yet...\n\nThe Beer: pretty consistently awesome.  All the beers are at least "good," my favorites being 8th Street Ale and their IPAs (Hop Knot and Raj).  I have to say the Kiltlifter is a tad overrated, but still pretty solid, and worth a try.  I\'ve been meaning to try one of their cask conditioned ales, but they always seem to be out, probably indicative of the quality of those selections.\n\nThe Food: fantastic!  I can\'t say that I\'ve ever had a bad meal at Four Peaks.  The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu, but you can\'t go wrong with the Chicken Fingers, Chicken Salad Pita, or really any of their sandwiches.  The fries are also great here - there\'s a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty.  Oh, and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer.  A little more liquidy than your average hummus, but really good.  It has a nice little kick to it that will have you reaching for your beer.\n\nBottom line, if you live in Phoenix, like beer, and enjoy eating a good meal, then you should be shot if you don\'t like Four Peaks.  If you haven\'t been yet, do yourself a favor and try it.  You\'ll come away happy, I promise.'

S'I hope I don\'t lose any friends over this review, I know everybody LOVES it!  And I don\'t mind it.  It is A-OK.\n\nFull disclosure: I\'m not a fan of beer.  That fact will not affect my opinion of the establishment!  \n\nThe food really is good.  I\'ve never been disappointed, and there are items on the menu I haven\'t had a chance to try that I think I\'ll enjoy.\n\nService has been so-so.  Regardless of the level of busy-ness, I\'ve seen a mixed bag of friendly, polite, personable servers, and stressed out, slow moving servers.  Bathroom cleanliness is iffy, if you consider that sort of thing. \n\nMy beer-loving friends and boyfriend love Four Peaks for the local beer, and new seasonal options that always live up to the micro-brew reputation.  It is cool how knowledgeable all the staff are as to their beers and pairings, and several of them have even tried to recommend something new to me, hoping to convert me to beer-ism.  \n\nI don\'t think I\'ve ever been here when it wasn\'t crowded.  I\'d say that speaks equally to the quality of the beer and food, and to the susceptibleness of ASU students who "have to go" to Four Peaks.  Although, if I lived at ASU or close by and could ride a bike or something, that would improve my opinion slightly as I could avoid fighting the good parking fight.  A little walking never killed anyone, but the parking situation here is a little out of control.  \n\nWalk or carpool, try a new beer, pair it with an appetizer, and enjoy yourself.  I\'ll pop in once in a while :)'

S'Four Peaks is an Arizona classic, with their Kilt-lifter and Hop Knot brands you can always rely on a special brand and taste.

Their prices are reasonable, especially for the amount of food you get.  Love so many of their beers.  I just wish the beer was colder all the time.  Maybe I'm an amateur beer drinker, but I like it really cold.  Sometimes it's almost room temperature here which doesn't stop me from drinking it, of course!"

S"It's ironic that I would luv this brewery because I am not much of a drinker.  I think what I luv about this place is that they find a way to sneak the beer into food so that people who can't drink much but like to eat (like me) can still enjoy being there.  I also enjoy that Four Peaks is one of those laid back bars where the music isn't pounding so loud that you can't have a conversation with the people sitting right next to you.  There's good food, good staff, good service, good prices, and lots of outdoor seating, so this is a great place to go for a nice evening out with anyone.\n\nI'm a foodie, so I want to take a minute to mention how good the food is here.   On my last trip, I ordered the grilled chicken beer bread, which is grilled chicken breast, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, green peppers, red onion, mozzarella and cucumber sauce rolled in beer bread with a side of french fries and had ice cream cake for dessert.  Everything came out promptly and was SO good.  I want to give a special shout-out to the french fries at Four Peaks cuz they are especially tasty.  I also want to mention the stout shake to all you dessert lovers (particularly MALT lovers).  This is an item I usually get at Four Peaks because it is sooo creamy and delicious.  It's basically a malt made with half an oatmeal stout beer topped with whipped cream and Oreo crumbs.  Beer AND ice cream?  Yes please!  \n\nFor an older student in a college town full of younger students, Four Peaks is a breath of fresh air.  It's a place that would not find a home on Mill Ave, and for that, I am SO grateful."

S"I rolled into Tempe on a Friday evening and my friend told me to meet her here. We met at 6:30 and this place was BUMPIN. Totally packed, inside and out, and LOUD. The place to be on Friday night, apparently. I was told the wait for 2, first available, was about 35 minutes. That wait got longer for people showing up after us, real fast. \n\nI was starving so of course everything looked good on the menu. We started off with a cheese bread appetizer which was basically pizza when you factor in the dipping sauce. But oh so good.\n\nIn terms of beer, I ordered their hef and their amber (seasonal), both of which were good. My friend got the peach ale which I tasted and wasn't too sweet, but not quite for me. She got one more I liked but not sure which it was. \n\nI couldn't decide what to order and the waitress said both things I was deciding between were good, so she didn't make it easier. I wound up going with the tenderloin sandwich. The filet was fantastic. Of course with the app and beer, even though I came starving, I couldn't quite finish the sandwich as it was pretty large. I made sure to finish the filet though, no way I was letting that go to waste! \n\nGreat place to watch a game. Not so great to catch up and have a meaningful conversation."

Amazing beer.\n\nThis is probably why four peaks is my go to spot. It's also very affordable, great for the local college students.

Although my absolute FAVORITE is the Pumpkin Porter seasonal, in off season I'm happy with any of their beer, but usually stick with some Peach Ale. It gets crazy crowded on game days (of all sports and all teams) but always worth the wait. They have the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had. The servers are 100% hit or miss. Usually I have a great service, but occasionally I've had terrible service (bad servers but still great food/beer).

S'Ahhhhhhh Four Peaks...One of the hot spots in Tempe.\n\nFor me, Four Peaks is good, not great. I\'ve had some good food there, I\'ve had some mediocre food there. Their fries are great...It\'s bar food, really. There\'s nothing that sets Four Peaks apart from a culinary standpoint, but most people seem to fall head over heels for the beer.\n\nHere\'s my thing: I\'m from Portland, Oregon. For anyone that doesn\'t know, it\'s an incredible place for microbreweries and amazing beer. In the state of Oregon there are dozens of independent breweries and hundreds of incredible local beer choices...\n\n(I realize at this point you\'re all thinking - "Hey, asshole. Stop talking about Portland. This is a review about Four Peaks" - I\'m getting to my point, I promise)\n\nUpon my arrival in the Phoenix area, I kept hearing about how great the beer was at Four Peaks. Living close by, I checked out Four Peaks early on, and have been back a number of times since. I\'ve tried a lot of their beers, and they just don\'t do it for me. I like the Kilt Lifter, and that\'s the end...The rest of their beers I am just not into. Specifically the Hef...It\'s the worst Hef I\'ve ever had in my life. Forgive me, I\'m a beer snob who likes what he likes, and most of the beers at Four Peaks are not my thing. With that said, everyone else seems to be in love with them, so maybe I\'m the crazy one.\n\nThe other thing that sucks about Four Peaks is the wait. During peak times, you\'re waiting anywhere from 30-60 minutes for a table.\n\nPositives is the size of the restaurant (it\'s huge), and the ambiance. It\'s a cool place to hang out and watch a game, and it\'s a good place to grab a quick bite when the wait isn\'t too long. I\'m sure I\'ll come back to Four Peaks, but it won\'t be for the beer.'

I think I liked the pale ale and the peach ale the best.\n\nI would have ordered my own.. but they come in large glasses and I dont usually drink that much alcohol in one sitting.. so I passed..\n\nI ordered the fish and chips.. it came with beer-battered fried fish and french fries.  It was very good.  The portions were big so I was able to take some back to the suite and take it back to the lab for lunch the next day.\n\nIt seemed like a college hang out.. it was very crowded but it was such a laid back place.. we all had fun.\n\nIf ever I find myself in Tempe again..

S"I think their beer is overrated, but if you show up not expecting amazing food or the best ale ever, then the visit will be alright if not memorable.  When I'm in San Diego, the Sculpin DOES taste like the best IPA I've ever had (98 at Beer Advocate), and when I'm in Michigan, the Two-Hearted Ale DOES taste like the best IPA I've ever had (95 at Beer Advocate).  So when I have the Raj IPA at Four Peaks, and I'm less than enthusiastic (due to all the build up of how great it is), it is not a surprise that Beer Advocate rates it an 84------pretty respectable, but let's keep things in perspective, okay?"

Drunk driving is for dumbasses who want to get tossed around Tent City like a box of Girl Scout Cookies.\n\nDon't be deterred from a trip to Four Peaks because of all the ASU youngins - There's good times and even better brews to be had for (legal aged) folks young and old!"

S'Made my way up to Phoenix and Tempe last night for the rare visit and stopped by Four Peaks for the first time.  I\'d had their 8th St. Ale and Kilt Lifter prior to the visit, but was looking forward to sampling a few of their other beers.  All were excellent.  The oatmeal stout was delicious, even to this self-proclaimed "hophead".  It appears that they have a couple different IPAs on tap regularly--the Raj, which is an English style and the Hop Knot which is the more traditional, florally over-hopped American version.  That was the way to go in my opinion!  They also had a seasonal called Double Knot--a double IPA.  Absolutely delicious and potent at 9.1% abv without killing the hoppiness with an overly alcoholic taste--a difficult thing to pull off with a double IPA in my opinion.  Also had dinner on the front patio while there.  I had fish and chips.  Fairly standard for pub fare as far as I was concerned although I did really like the chips, which were really just very nicely seasoned thick fries.  The new Nimbus in Tucson has set the standard to me for the fish portion, and this did not top that.  Still tasty though and a fair portion.  A friend of mine got the salmon BLT, which looked quite tasty.\nOn a Thursday night, the place was packed.  But there was still a fair amount of room to get to the bar for a drink while waiting for a table, which really only took about 10 minutes (we were told the wait would be 15-20).  We sat outside on a nice patio that runs the length of the front of the bar.  Heaters are abundant for those chilly AZ february nights.:)  \nIf there was a parking lot, I missed it.  There\'s on-street parking however, but you might have to walk a few blocks once you find a vacant spot.\nWait staff was young, friendly, and energetic, but not overbearing.  They gave us our space while we had our meals.\nThe interior is huge, nicely decorated, and clearly a brewery when you make your way towards the back.  Plenty of seating, plenty of room to stand as well.\nFor those who want to take home some "souvenirs", they do sell beer by the growler (as well as provide refills after the initial bottle purchase).  It looks like they also run the gambit on "Four Peaks" clothing as well.\nOverall, a great place to visit, but if you\'re from out of town, watch carefully--the turn onto 8th St. is easy to miss.'

Yes it is in Tempe and you're stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if you're in the Tempe area!"

S"Most probably know this place for their brew, but for me Four Peaks means delicious bar food for my late night dinner needs.  With Tempe's abundance of late night dining establishments, the competition is pretty fierce!  Four Peaks gets high marks with me for it's variety of bar fare but most of all for it's delicious Fish & Chips and Blue Cheese Burger.  There fries are fab!  The patio is nice too, when the AZ weather permits it is hard to find a table out there!  I struggle not to give them four stars for these items but I have to consider the ambiance and the brew also.  For me the ambiance would be cool because I love the vintage industrial feel of the old railroad location, but then there is the standard ASU crowd, bright lighting and the standard KUPD or KDKB type music that is a buzz kill for me.  The brew offerings are award-winning according to their menu but to me the flavors are mediocre, the options are somewhat limited and they don't seem to add many new options often enough.  All of these things are matters of personal taste and do not reflect the quality of their food by any means, that being said, Four Peaks is a great place to start your night or finish it, especially if you like the college bar scene!  If you are looking for a unique dive with an unusual crowd then this place may seem a little bland, but the fish & chips will not disappoint!"

S"Went for lunch on a Sunday.  It was very busy, with a lot of the frat-house college crowd here for the game. We had a large party, and the person organizing our get-together tried to call an hour before we arrived to put our name on the list, but no one answered the phone after repeated attempts.  So, when we got here we waited for a bit outside while some tables cleared out.  When we finally got a table, they gave us a table that couldn't seat all of us, for they wrote down the wrong number of people for our party.  \n\nAfter some more shuffling and rearranging of chairs and tables, we finally got seated.  I tried a sample of the pumpkin porter, and had the portabella-veggie beer bread.  The pumpkin porter was decent, and had a nice pumpkin-spice taste to it.  I wasn't a big fan of the veggie beer bread.  I was expecting more of a loaf-type bread instead of the flatbread that actually came out.  As a result, the dish was more of a wrap than a sandwich.  The interior of the wrap was filled with lots of fresh veggies, but I was hoping to find more portabella mushroom in it.  In addition, the veggies themselves were bland, and so overwhelmingly garlicky that I felt like I could ward vampires away for a mile with my breath.  \n\nDespite having a large party, service, once we were seated, was good.  The waitress had no problem splitting our checks, and she refilled our drinks promptly as needed.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there isn't any A/C in the building, just overhead fans, so if you come on a hot day you might be sweating a bit!"

S'Four Peaks is an upscale brewery restaurant. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nWith on-site brewing of several classics and rotating seasonal brews, if you\'re a beer drinker you won\'t be disappointing by Four Peaks. The service is usually reasonably fast, so you won\'t be left with an empty glass for long. You will have to wait for a table on a Friday or Saturday night, but they can usually get you sat pretty fast.\n\nThere are only two downsides to Four Peaks. The food is OK, nothing special. I\'ve had several different entrees, and while they aren\'t bad, they aren\'t anything to write home about either. The other downside is their location. They are on a side street in Tempe, about two miles from Mill Ave, where most of the bars are located. Their parking is abysmal; you either have to find a street spot, of which there are usually none, or you have to park in their hardly-lit back lot. Generally, when I\'m thinking of going there, the parking is a big limitation. \n\nTheir location is also strange, as it is neither a great spot to launch a night out in Tempe, nor is it calmer than Mill. The ASU "bros" are in full attendance on the weekends, so don\'t expect to kick back and enjoy your craft beer in peace. At the same time, if you want to get to Mill, you\'ll have to get back into your awkwardly parked car or take a $10+ cab ride to Mill. Still, they\'re a little cheaper than Gordon Biersch, which is on Mill, so you may break even. \n\nFour Peaks is a Tempe must-visit. Plan for the parking and expect a lively crowd and you\'ll have a great time.'

S"I really wish I wasn't hungover when I came here for a late lunch with my girlfriends....especially when i did my yelp research on this....\n\nI was really excited to go to a brewery in a college town since at my alma mater, they had this fabulous brewery where i probably spent half my time at because it was just...the best place ever.  I loved how everything on the menu had something soaked in beer!  Whether it was their beer bread, chicken tenders fried in beer something, it was so good!\n\nI got their Portabella Veggie Beer Bread (more of a wrap) and it was seriously packed with fresh vegetables and was wrapped in their beer bread.  You could tell the bread was freshly made because it was so soft and yummy.  Next time, I would ask for a little less cheese...I think they put in a lot.  I was really bummed that I didn't try any of their brews.  If you look on the menu, they suggest the type of beer you should get with each plate, which I thought was real neat!  \n\nAnd OMG, the fries!  So good!!!!!  Fries in general are good, but their fries, it's seriously on another level.  \n\nFor dessert, my friends and I got their tiramisu, but their take on it was not putting in rum, but guess what they put in instead....beer.  It was seriously like 8 inches tall and 4 people couldn't even finish.  It didn't taste that different....it was actually real sweet.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a great place to go with a big group of people, especially if you want to watch a sports game (lots of big TVs).  If i'm ever back in Tempe, I am definitely coming back here to try some of their beer!"

It was baffling, like our table was placed just perfectly that we weren't in anyone's zone or someone was just neglecting their duties. It was astounding. We were starving and had a thirst to boot. They were very apologetic when they finally realized we would also like to partake in the foods and beverages that the other patrons partook of. So much so that they comped the entire meal minus drinks. Only time i've ever had a negative experience there after many many visits and it ended up being a good thing in the end cause all I had to do was sit and wait and talk to my friend and they basically paid us in food for doing just that. Easiest 30 or 40 bucks in savings I've ever made! This place is really incredible. The beer is ridiculously good, the food, even better if that's possible.

S"A bit unfair to all the other microbrews in town, but obviously Peaks has been a staple in the Tempe area for decades for good reason. All the beer is brewed on site which means everything is fresh -- they actually use the same water they serve at the tables in the brewing process, to give you an idea how pure the finished product is. \n\nNo matter if you're there to eat or knock a few back Peaks is a must. You can't go wrong with virtually anything on the menu but anyone happening upon Peaks for the first time should absolutely order an entree or side of the fries, an undisputed favorite. I usually go with anything involving blackened chicken, be it salad or nachos.\n\nThe sampler trey is offered at a reasonable price and provides about 4 oz servings of each of the beers listed on the big board. If you're looking for something lighter I would suggest the Sunbru or Peach -- my personal favorite is doing a half & half of Oatmeal Stout with Peach. Get inventive.\n\nThe staff is used to working with a lot of traffic so I've never had bad service there -- these guys really know their stuff!"

S"I will always like Four Peaks for what makes Arizona great.....drinking outside on a great patio. Just awesome. That's really why I come here.  I have fond memories of this place and many happy hours. It's also where I got to know my husband through intimate conversation over a few pints while we were dating! \nI'm a huge fan of the peach ale. Simply delicious. The food is good, but a little greasy for my usual taste. Bar food though, so it goes well with beer. I ordered the margarita pizza and my husband got the beer bread wrap. His wrap was swimming in grease on the plate, which was kind of a turn-off. My pizza wasn't bad, but again, I come for the beer. \nFriendly service, decent prices."

I sat at the bar, and even considering I was by myself/out of town I didn't feel out of place.  I think that's mostly because the bartenders were so friendly (especially Jamie, who knew me by name and made me feel welcome).  The restaurant recommendation I got included what to order, and I'm glad I followed directions...my Top Sirloin (or something like that) on Beer Bread (a house speciality) was surprisingly delicious.

S"This gets all five stars on the hop knot alone. MMMM! All of the beers are delicious, maybe excluding that peach one just because it's sweet enough for a little kid to like it, which is a good sign that a drink is bordering on gross. OH DREAMY HOP KNOT! COME TO ME IN BARRELS, PLEASE! \n\nThe food is pretty descent too. I've only had a few things on the menu and I'm about as picky as a vulture, but the fish and chips are always delicious. Also, when you smother the mushroom swiss burger in ranch, I could cry it's so tasty. I love the way good bar food places have super delicious ranch, where do you get that stuff in a store? \n\nOther friends have told me that I should venture out on the menu because it gets pretty good, but there's something about the atmosphere around there that just makes me want something as easy and quick as a burger or something fried. No thanks chipotle chicken salad pita wrapped thingy, you would feel toooo healthy and I wouldn't feel guilty about you after we finished. \n\nThe service here has also always been fairly good, and we've always been able to get a table relatively quick when it's not past ten on thursday, friday, or saturday. It fills up quick around then so if you're looking for a sexy time with some sexy people, you might end up getting a sweaty time with some drunk people.

S"I'm qualifying my review on these grounds: if you like Four Peaks brews, then go - you'll obviously love the place.  If you are looking for a variety of beers with good food, then - as I have experienced - this is not your place. \n\nPositives: \n\n1. Service.  Very good: the servers and bartenders are very affable.\n\n2. Environment.  The place overall has a great look and feel to it, in respect to being a brewery.  TVs are on and people are chatting.  A very happening place. \n\n3. Specialty beers.  Their Pumpkin Ale is AWESOME. \n\nNegatives: \n\n1. Food.  Maybe its me, but I do not find the plates very appetizing.  In fact, if and when I go, I purposely do not eat.   I've tried the burgers and many breakfast items in the past; although I don't recall the specifics about each plate, I do know that they left no positive impression on me. \n\n2. Parking.  Horrendous. Period.\n\n3. Climate. BEWARE: if you go in the summer months prepare to sweat.  Fans (NOT AC) are not on.  It is truly miserable experience; winter, on the other hand, is comfortable. \n\n4. Variety.  As stated in the opening paragraph, don't expect a wide selection of beers.  They have less than ten, albeit their own.\n\nOverall, I would rather drink a Four Peaks beer at a brewery with a wider selection of beers and much better food."

S"If you're going to Four Peaks for beer, I'd say 4-5 stars, but if you're going for dinner as I was, I can't rate it higher than a 3.  The beer is quite good.  I've tried most of their beers, and I think Raj IPA is my favorite.  The seasonal was the Pumpkin Porter and it fell a bit flat.  The flavor was too mellow and overall the beer seemed too light, almost watered down.\n\nThe real reason for 3 stars was the food.  Although we had some nice appetizers (pretzels with spicy cheese sauce were great, as was the Thai hummus and pita bread), but the pizzas we ordered were terrible. We ordered the margarita and the Italian.  The margarita had too much garlic powder, and the Italian tomato sauce was much too sweet and overpowered the toppings.\n\nService can be slow when they are busy, but our waitress was friendly and pretty attentive.  The dining area is enormous, and they also have some limited outdoor seating. But this is a college town dinner spot for sure, no pretensions of a high class brew-pub here.\n\nI'll probably be back for the beer, but I hope I can find something on the menu better than those pizzas, which were truly awful!"

S'I\'m a Tempe native.  I and everyone I know frequents Four Peaks Brewing Company on a regular basis.  If you are looking to have a great time with close friends and family, this is the spot.  The interior environment is rustic and cozy but nothing beats the patio, year round.  This historic, red brick building looks like it was transported from downtown Flagstaff or small mountain town.  Something about the way it all comes together always puts me at ease.  Had a hard day at work?  Four Peaks.  Need a table for twelve of your friends without a reservation?  Four Peaks.  Want to enjoy a lazy Sunday in the cool breeze and warm sun with a pleasantly plump belly full of comfort food and fragrant beer?  Four Peaks baby!   It\'s like a Swiss Army Knife of dining solutions.  It\'s my go-to choice for pretty much every situation except the ones which require a suit jacket.  \n\nAtmosphere:  Warm, cozy, relaxing, casual, down-to-earth.  Good, fun loving vibes for ALL ages.  This is a true diamond in the rough among a landscape of corporate fugazis. Music choices are great but speaker system needs an upgrade in clarity.\n\nStaff:  Friendly, professional, efficient, abundant, ubiquitous.\n\nAppetizers:  Favorite:  Arizona Chicken Rolls.  Noteworthy:  Thai Hummus, 5 Layer Nacho Dip, Panko Crusted Calamari.\n\nFood:  Consistently great!  Diverse, upper scale comfort/bar food in ample portions. The fantastic daily specials keep this regular coming back obsessively.  Favorites: Carne Adovada, Southwest Burger, Salmon BLT, Italian Beef Beer Bread, Reuben.\n\nDrink:  Various micro-brews of delightful, world-class quality.  Favorite beer:  Hop Knot IPA.  Noteworthy beers: Arizona Peach, Oatmeal Stout, Pumpkin Porter (autumn only).  \n\nOther:  Parking is abundant.  However, unless you\'re lucky, you\'ll have to park about 60 yards down the road or down the back alley ;)  It\'s worth the walk.\n\nWhen to go:  Weekend lunch on the patio; especially in spring and fall.\n\nRequests:  Please post your daily specials to your web site rather than emailing me twice a day.  Make the "crab po\' boy" a regular menu item.  It was the best special I\'ve ever had at Four Peaks!'

S"I like Four Peaks. I really do. I like that is about a five minute walk from my apartment. I like both the Sunbru and 8th Street Ale. I like the $2.75 beers during happy hour and all day on Sunday.  I like to watch football there on Sundays because they show a lot of games, even if it is a Minnesota Vikings hangout.\n\nWhat I do not really like at Four Peaks is the food. Brunch was just OK. I had the Brewer's Breakfast (basically your good ole American breakfast), and I hated the country potatoes. I don't want my hash browns to taste only like bell peppers. The three things on the dinner menu I have found I really like and will order every time we go are the french fries, beer bread, and shrimp and goat cheese bruschetta. However, there is not enough bread in the bruschetta as we seem to have tons of toppings left, so typically we have to use pita bread from the hummus to finish the food.  The caesar salad is just OK and my husband likes the fish and chips but they are not the best he has ever had.\n\nFor appetizers and a few beers, Four Peaks is great epecially if you get a seat on the patio on a nice day.  For dinner, not so much."

Man Monday.  Literally spent like 6 hours at the bar.  It's the kind of place you can do that.  The food is above average for bar food... note, I said for bar food.  I'm admittedly a vodka and wine drinker, so my opinion holds little weight with beer.  Also, I have no idea what I'm talking about--tried some kinda port beer that tasted like chocolate--see? \n\nAnyway, I couldn't possibly see a reason for hating this place so you might as well check it out.

S"Four Peaks could be the perfect brew pub restaurant. The food and beer here are spectacular, unfortunately, the place is overrun by frat boys, plagued by iffy service, always crowded and loud, and features a nightmarish parking situation.\n\nFirst off, the beer here is glorious. I'm a man who loves beer, but not just any old brew will do. Guinness is about as low-end as I'm willing to go, and I much prefer local micro-brews. Four Peaks meets my very high, some might say pretentious, standards. They offer a wide variety here, everything from blonde to black, with a fairly inexpensive sampler to try them all at once. For my money, I like the deliciously rich, slightly sweet, slightly smokey Oatmeal Stout, or the floral, aggressively hopped, moderately bitter Hop Knot. (I love the Kilt Lifter, but I don't order it because it's available in stores.) The Hop Knot is especially good when it's cask-conditioned, as it's a bitter mellower in flavor and allows the hoppy taste to really bloom. Their website lists which beers will be offered cask-conditioned during the coming week, and it's well worth planning your trip accordingly.\n\nThe food here is generally what you'd expect: burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizza, wings, and of course, fish and chips. Everything here has been very good; you really can't go wrong with any order. But the there are a few standouts. The fish and chips here is stellar, among the best I've ever had. Crispy, beer-battered, and made with real fish and served with damn good fries. The Bavarian pretzel appetizer is amazing too, especially if you're a fan of mustard (sorry, not served with cheese). And I had the current best-burger-of-my-life here about a year ago. It was a daily special that I haven't seen since, but still, their menu burgers are excellent. Fresh meat, well-spiced, huge, and nicely laden with toppings. The only one I don't recommend is the Popper burger, as I think the flavors don't mesh too well. But that could just be me.\n\nSo, the downside... Parking is horrendous. Literally, the worst parking situation for any place I know of. I've walked a quarter mile from my car to the restaurant. I'm not exaggerating, I used a pedometer on my phone. The only real parking options are along the street, on one side, and it's parallel parking in tiny spots. Also, service is very inconsistent. About half the time, we get a competent, but not amazing server. And the rest of  the time, we get ignored. It seems like if you aren't drinking beer, you get no attention from the wait staff. The place is always packed, always loud. There usually isn't a wait to get in. But, you'll be bumping elbows with the guy behind you, shouting to be heard at your own table, and doing some serious squeezing and weaving to get to the bathroom. It's a bit better sitting outside, but only a bit, and then you'll have to deal with the weather. On big game nights, the place is insane and best avoided.\n\nThere are a lot of hassles to deal with when you eat here, but the food and the brew make it worth it. In fact, if the food and beer were all the mattered, the place would earn an easy 5 stars. Of course, in nearly every other category, it would get 1 star."

S"Probably like many recent college graduates who enjoys the drink, one of my life goals it to eventually open up a microbrewery. I tend to shy away from the idea of a brewpub since I believe that an establishment should place focus on either its beer or the food. Places that do both tend to have mediocre beer and food or excellent beer but bad food. Four Peaks somehow passes the test on both their food and the beer.\n\nFirst off, parking sucks and the place gets busy. I went on a Wednesday evening and it was packed. But with Happy Hour, what do you expect? Three dollar pints allowed me to try a bunch of their beers. My favorites included Kilt Lifter, Hop Knot IPA and the Raj IPA. They even held a delicious cask ale, style of holding beer that (thankfully) seems to be making its way into breweries and bars. \n\nThe food included fairly typical brewpub fare. Burgers, wings, sandwiches etc. All of our items were of fairly decent quality. Or perhaps I was a bit too drunk to really notice the awful nature of the food. But fuck it, that beer was good. Hands down the best brews I've had at a brewpub."

We came here straight from our flight because we hadn't had dinner and it was a place that we wanted to try that was still open at 1:30AM on a Thurs. There's only about four stools inside so it's a take-out type of place. There are long couches outside by the elevators as well if you're lucky to grab a seat. \n\nGreasy food with yummy thin crispy crusts. They have pies on the counter and underneath as well, so if you wanted something that's not on top, just ask! I got here when there was a line nearly to the entrance of the hallway. After I got my slice, the line was gone! So timing's everything here. When I finally got my slices, I was so hungry that I forgot to pat down the slice with a napkin to take off the tons of extra oil. Oh well.. vacation! :D\n\nMy order:\nSlice of White Pie\nSlice of Pepperoni & Mushroom\n\nI'm fairly partial to red sauces, so I enjoyed the simple pepperoni & mushroom more.

S"3 stars for being aite...\n\nI think most of the 'buzz' (if there still is any) has to do with the location. As the name suggests, this place isn't really promoted or advertised anywhere in the Cosmo, or in Las Vegas in general. There is not menu, or even a sign in the hotel that says that it exists. \n\nIt's actually called the pizzeria according to the cosmo, but its found pretty much on the 3rd flood right by the elevator. Look for a corridor decorated with golden album all over the walls. When you come in there is no menu printed anywhere, instead you just look at the pizzas they have and pick one.\n\nThe costs is usually around $5-6 a slice depending on what you get, which I think is pretty price for quick slice of pizza. The food itself is decent, the white pizza is excellent as I am a fan of ricotta, but there are quite a few average pies as well (pepperoni is no different than most other places). \n\nI think the real attraction is the fact that it is pretty much the only place in the Cosmo where you can get food for less than $10 a person. And it does seem kind of 'cool' to go to place that is a secret... But I think that secret is getting out especially when you see a long line drunk kids from Marquee stretching out of the hall way."

S"Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for leading me to Secret Pizza.  There are no signs leading to this place...just knowledge that it exists, the help of the nearby employees that pointed me in the right direction, and the faint smell of yumma pizza as I got closer to the secret location.\n\nI've been here twice and both times I was treated to high quality pizza.  The first time, there was enough of us that we opted to get a whole pie.  We got 1/2 white sauce w/ mushrooms and 1/2 red sauce combo.  They make it fresh when you order it, so there needs to be an element of patience.  About 15-20 min later, we got a HUGE box that wouldn't even close because the pizza was too big.  It was DELICIOUS!  I loved the super thin, super crispy crust.  I especially liked the White Pizza...creamy with just the right amount of garlic.  The second time, I went for a slice of the White Pizza with susage.  Again, it was YUMMY!"

S"Las Vegas' worst kept secret!\n\nIn a sea of overpriced food and tiny portions, it's nice to have a cheaper alternative that still tastes good! It's hard to beat $5/slice on the strip! $22 for the whole pie!\n\nYou can find this pizza place inside The Cosmopolitan. There is no sign. There is no name. Just a hallway leading to a small room that serves some damn good pizza!\n\nThis place really honors the New York style pizza. Thin crust at its finest! I usually don't like eating the crust at the end, but I couldn't get enough of it! There's just enough crust, but their crust is so flavorful. I could eat just a whole pie of that crust!\n\nTheir white pizza is the best!! Three different kinds of cheese with no red sauce. Sooooo good! It's like the best cheesy bread you'll ever have! I love the dollops of fresh ricotta that's on it. Their red sauce options are pretty good also, but the white pizza is the best!\n\nBy the way, they're open ridiculously late! Totally awesome after a night of drinking at the club! Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this place until the last day of my trip, so I didn't get to taste how freakishly awesome their pizza must taste while drunk. \n\nThere's a line here during peak hours!

So NOT fresh and good.  \n\nWe also got a whole pie that was a bit better because it was made fresh but it still wasn't great.  I personally like the pizza place in NYNY better.  This pizza actually tasted better the next day, cold.\n\nNot much of a secret anymore.  It's on the third floor.

S'My hubs and I decided to try and find the elusive "secret pizza" place at the Cosmo. Let\'s just say that we got quite a tour of the hotel trying to find the damn place, but we certainly worked up an appetite. We finally had to ask someone to give us a hint!\n\nEven with our hint we nearly walked by the place. We only found it because of the 80\'s music blasting down the hallway.\n\nThis place is like what I would expect Panucci\'s Pizza from Futurama (except much more sanitary) to be like.\n\nThe pizza is greeeasy and served by the slice. You\'ve been warned. But it hits the spot with a cold beer. Not a lot of seating, but this place is a secret...so you can\'t expect it to be huge.\n\nI danced out of the record lined hallway to the tune of Billy Idol\'s "Don\'t You Forget About Me" with a big smile on my face. A good find.'

S"Stopped in for a weekday lunch. There was a small crowd when we arrived. No menus here. Slices start at $3.00 and it's 50-cents for additional toppings. A full pie is $17. Pizzas are pre-cooked, you make your selection based on what's available and it's tossed in the pizza oven for a few minutes to heat it through and crisp the crust.\n\nWe tried the pepperoni, the onions and peppers, the white pizza and the sausage and meatball. The total with two diet cokes was 22.16.\n\nWe stood at the counter and enjoyed our slices. Nicely crisp (slight char) chewy crust, light sauce and gooey cheese. The least favorite slice was the sausage and meatball -- bland meats. The favorite was the onion and pepper slice."

Like when you go to Disneyland and a bottle of water is $6 bucks. If you're desperate enough, you'll pay the $6 and be happy about it. \n\nConsider it a convenience tax.\n\nThey have nice pepperoni and they have a bianca with ricotta, which is kind of a dying breed these days.\n\nIt's good to have this spot in your back pocket if you're on the strip and dying for hot food and you've only got a hamilton in your pocket and lost all your credit cards. \n\nIt's not destination pizza.

I have been a fan of Secret Pizza since day one, and this was the first time I went at such an insane hour. Egad. I don't recommend this AT ALL. Sure, we were the fools that walked from one damn casino to another, which in all honesty is also a dumb mistake. But the pizza here is so, so good! Nice, thin and crisp!\n\nAfter the long trek from the Bellgio to the Cosmopolitan, we saw the crowd but got in line nonetheless. After waiting for more than 20 minutes we decided that in order to make the most of it we should order a whole pie. Well some other people had the same idea and they had been waiting for 45 minutes. What? We ended up getting one slice per person, which is really sad (and kind of expensive). This was a week ago and I am still craving pizza. \n\nThe lesson? Go before midnight.

This place is not a secret by any means, but it's damn good. \n\nThin and large slices of NY styled pizza that taste like heaven when you're drunk and hungry near Cosmo. Katie B. took the words right out of my mouth because the best part of this place is watching and talking to the inebriated individuals that have no clue what they're saying while bumping into you left and right. Entertaining? I think so. I seriously think having such a narrow and long hallway for waiting in line isn't because they want people to feel claustrophobic, it's because they want to make it easy for the confused drunk people to stand in line. Don't expect to eat inside, there are like four chairs and people standing everywhere waiting for their pizza. We tried the white pizza with ricotta and the peppers pizza. Both were delicious, but I had to remove the layer of oil sitting on the pizza. Come here for a good time and satisfy your pizza cravings while you're at it!"

This place is crazy small. It might fit 15 people. Only like five seats so it's a race to find one. I stood up and ate my pizza because I didn't want to walk around cosmo trying to find a place to sit. \n\nThe pizza was pleasant, nothing bad about it. \n\nTrash cans are full, so napkins are stacked high.\n\nIt seems like only two guys are running this place so it's hard. \n\nThe prices are the same everywhere in Vegas, so I am use to the 3 dollar bottle of water and the 4 dollar slice of pizza."

I was skeptical, but when I tasted the pizza, I was floored by the texture flavor, and chewiness of the crust. For me, the pizza is in the crust. I don\'t know what they put in their dough, but it is hands down the best here out of most places I\'ve tried.\n\nI tried both the red sauce meat lovers pizza and the white sauce. I generally like the red sauce pizza better, so preferred the red.  \n\nI\'m going to be a repeat customer for sure. Oh my gosh, it is SO good.'

S'A few of my friends kept raving about this pizza place inside Cosmopolitan.  Telling me I had to try it.  So in the middle of our clubbing session at Marquee we left the club to go get some pizza.  This place is hidden on the second floor in between Blue Ribbon Sushi + Jaleo.  It\'s hidden, if you were just walking by, you\'d never know it was a pizza joint down that long hallway.  Once you reach the end of the hallway you go into this little area with a Galactica (is that how you spell it?) arcade game and a pinball machine.  The minute we walked in we were greeted by the pizza maker, Nico.  He was very personable and explained what would make a good slice.  We start off with a basic cheese slice, a pepperoni slice or a white slice and make "magic" at the end.  We told him to surprise us so he made us a white pizza w/ roasted tomatoes and basil + garlic.  Second slice was meatball w/ green peppers.  This is the BEST pizza I have ever had.  I used to love Rocco\'s pizza in Summerlin, but now that I\'ve tasted this, it is ultimately the best pizza.  The price is very reasonable.  It\'s $3.00 and $0.50 per topping.   This is a great go to place after clubbing.  It\'s hard to explain how good this pizza is.  I\'m not a big pizza eater, but this place makes me want to eat a whole pie.  Definitely worth a try if you\'re ever at the Cosmo.  Remember, it\'s on the second floor in between Blule Ribbon Sushi + Jaleo.'

Of course I got a slice of the white pizza and a slice of mushroom. 2 slices, $10.50. Not super cheap, but average. \n\nAfter being heated, they were super oily, you have to dab and dab to get all the grease off. The pizza was good, the white pizza a little heavier, lots of ricotta, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I personally like ASONY in San Jose way better. My friend wasn't impressed either.

Crisp Crust, Cooked all the way through (Hey, I live in DE, where no one can commercially cook a good pizza besides a handful of places!), cheese bubbly and alittle burned (just the way I like it!).\n\nSurprisingly a great place to eat. Simple Food. Who would have thought you could find such a thing in Vegas!'

S'HOT DAMN!\n\nYelp, you make a perfect wingman, and I love you for it!\n\nThis tiny lil pizza spot, is a hidden gem, within the FABULOUS walls of the Cosmopolitan, serving up slice after slice, of mouth-watering thin crust pizza genius!\n\nThey don\'t call it "Secret Pizza" for nothing, you\'ve gotta sort of hunt this place down. Even the staff of the Cosmo, is in on it. They\'ll give you some vague hints, as to the whereabouts of their exact location, but, the rest is up to you, to find the joint! Also, I\'m not here to tell you where it\'s located, I\'m here to tell you, you\'ve GOT to go!\n\nSmall and tiny, but with nice decor (the walled corridor leading to the actual pizzeria, is lined with album {mostly Italian} art). The actual pizzeria is TINY, with MINIMAL SEATING SPACE! Think, stand and eat, not sit down. NOT a good place, for large groups!\n\nThe pizza, is DAMN good! I\'m still upset that I didn\'t get a whole pie, instead of a slice! It\'s crispy thin crust, NY style! My style! \n\nYou basically pick a slice from their selection of ready made pizzas, and they\'ll heat it up for you, or, you can order a whole pie. Just be on your toes, because, when you\'re slice is done reheating, they just assume you\'ll come to the front, to take it. They don\'t call out numbers or names or anything. So, if you\'re not there, someone else may snag it!\n\nI came in at around 2PM, not AM, but PM, and even then, it was terrific people watching! Drunks EVERYWHERE!\n\nThe price is pretty damn good too, considering, you\'re in a 5-star resort.\n\nIf you\'re in Vegas, and you\'re in the mood for pizza, DON\'T forget about this place!\n\n\nFood: 5\nAmbience: 4\nService: 3\nValue: 4'

S'The concept of this place is cute. I had a hard time finding this place because the location didnt state the name of the pizza joint. It was literally a long hallway I had to walk through to realized I ended up at the "secret pizza". The pizza has a thin crust so the pizza was more on the crispier side. A slice of pizza is about $8 from what I remember ( hey it was 1 am lol). Oh... they open really late and for being in vegas... it\'s a hugeeee plus ! I would say this place is a novelty mainly because of it\'s name and the secrecy of the location.... it\'s on the top floor of the cosmopolitan and at the end of a long hallway... but you didn\'t hear that from me :x'

S"In absolute love with this place. So, hauled ass from LA to Vegas for a trip with some friends, and my friend that lives in Vegas told me about this place once upon a time. This time, I'm eating here, damn it! I've heard so much about you, I'm coming in for some grub! =]\n\nLiterally, located in a hole in the middle of nowhere (well, next to the pool tables in the Cosmo), there is no sign, no nothing, but a long long hallway that seems to be perhaps a janitor closet or something. Walk in, it's officially a hidden pizza shoppe, like BAM!!!!!!! Simple, straight forward, and loaded with oils/fats. This is definitely THEE perfect place to go to after drinking and partying your ass off at a club to sober up.\n\nHowever, for my friends and I, this place was a tad too greasy (sorry, had to minus a star for that! XP) for our sober middle of the day breakfast/lunch/brunch. Yet I can see the appeal of such greasy goodness in the middle of the night, when you stumble drunk like no other out a club, and crave some hot, fresh out the oven pizza.\n\nIn essence, a good pit stop to try out for sure, better when you're drunk, but if you're sober, bring plenty of napkins to sop up the grease! =]"

S'Stayed at The Cosmopolitan this past week and amidst all of the fine dining options sits Secret Pizza. I had asked someone that worked at the casino where a good late breakfast early lunch option was, quick. He told me where to find this treasure because you really do need a map to find it. It is down a tempting long hallway where the smell of NY style pizza lures you into its grip. It has about 10-12 stools with a Galaga game and an old-school pizza oven. Pizza is available by the slice and it is really good. Being from Boston, I like thin, thin crust that bends when you pick it up. This pizza did not disappoint.'

S'Wow, best pizza I have ever had!  Check it out one floor above the entrance to Marquee and look for the line of people and the old school records in a blink-and-you miss it hallway.   There is not even a sign for the place.  The line stays pretty long all night, but it is so worth it!\n\nI tried the Meatballs and Ricotta cheese slice.  Unbefreakinleavable. \n\nPrices are reasonable at about $4.00-$6.00 for a large slice.  Customer service was great too.  Cooks were obviously working their butts off moving the line as fast as possible, but still having a good time and joking around with guests as they waited.  When some drunk guy tried to cut in line they kicked him out right away.  So satisfying when you see people working hard and not putting up with BS like that.\n\nWill definitely be returning, if I can find the dang place.'

The sweet smell of cheese and tomato sauce isn't helping, just follow your nose and it will lead you to the secret hallway to the place they call Secret Pizza.\n\nIf you found the secret because the line is a mile long, sorry it's going to feel like a century to get in. I would avoid it between 12-2am, but they close at 5, so get your timing right! You can always call for a whole pie.

If I didn't see a line of people extending out of the place I wouldn't have been able to find it. It's just a hallway riddled with albums and artwork on the 3rd floor right outside of Marquee.\n\nI ordered the sausage, pepperoni, and bell pepper pizza. The sausages were amazing; they weren't the typical types that you encounter at many pizza joints. I liked the sauce and the crust. The combination of sausages and pepperoni was too salty. One or the other would've been perfect."

S'What\'s better than being drunk AND eating pizza? NOTHING. \nExactly, my thoughts!\n\nWhat makes it more fun is that it\'s known as "secret pizza" and it\'s like $4 a slice. Dude, $4 isn\'t even gonna get you water in Marquee!\n\nThe guys in there are hilarious always chatting up the folks, drunk or sober.\nOne of \'em even told me the story of why they call the white pizza, "the sunset.." Let it be known that the cheese are the clouds and the tomatoes in the middle are the sunset...So romantic *blushing*\n\nEven though mushrooms are my favorite pizza, I really love their white pizza. And all it is is cheese, sauce, and tomatoes. It\'s sooooo simple and yet, oooohhh so good.\n\nIn fact, I was debating on writing this review because I don\'t wanna tooo many people to crowd my fave food spot in Cosmo.

It\'s pretty damn good.  New York pizza got some competition.  Not so long of a line during the early day.\n\nRemember that Seinfeld episode where Jerry tries to pour out the grease on the pizza and George goes "you\'re crazy" and pours Jerry\'s pizza juice on his pizza?  Yeah, this pizza got that pizza "juice" (not grease).\n\nCheesy, greasy, and deletable meatball topping.  Yum!  Got New York prices too, but hey, it\'s Vegas, where $50 all of sudden feels like its only $10.\n\nIf you don\'t like flavor and a little saltiness, might be a little too much for your taste buds.\n\nIt\'s really good.

They were seated right near the trash can but sadly were just too darn intoxicated to find the trash can or they were just slobs. \nAnyhow, don't be too shocked at the $4.00 price for water - if you ask for a cup they have water in a filtered jug for you.\nThe pizza was good but not the greatest - I still love Settebello!!!\nBut the pizza was still better than many other pizza places.\nNot cheap but I guess if your comparing the price here to other places in the Cosmo it's most likely the cheapest. \nNot many places to sit except for stools - I hate stools only places- \nForget about remembering the Titans - just remeber the short people!!!\nThey do have a Galaga arcade game!!!!\n I love Galaga- Wanna challenge???\nAll in all I wouldn't go out of my way to get pizza here however if I find myself at the Cosmo I wouldn't hestitate to come back here either."

Just go all the way in and it looks like a quick stop pizza shop like in New York. It was $4.50 per slice and I haven't had New York style pizza this good since I was last in New York!! The thin crust and the super-elongating-cheese-when-you-bite-into-it-just-like-in-the-movies is heaven! \n\nI love how this is open late and we just came out of Marquee and satisfed our late night cravings. For being surrounded by $$$$ restaurants, this place is awesome. Thank you Cosmo for giving at least one cheaper food option. \n\nOnly con: very limited seating in there (maybe like 6-8 stools).

OMG there is a hidden pizzeria in the hotel!!  Not only does this place have no name, you'll find no signage, and no menu. It's a very no nonsense New York-style pizza counter. To find it, look for the hallway wrapped in vintage records.There was a small line that was forming when we walked up. This place is super small and had limited seats (bar stools and a long counter). You can order a whole pie of just a couple of slices. Minh D decided to indulge in his pizza craving and get a slice which he ended up sharing with me. All i can say is wow this pizza tasted wonderful and full of cheesy goodness!! Ashley ordered a rootbeer (which has unlimited refilled as long as you are eating there). That rootbeer was the best i have had in a long time. Make sure you save your change because they have a classic pinball machine there too!!"

The pizza dough is ultra thin, and the combination of cheesy goodness and tangy tomato sauce makes this pizza mouthwateringly great!  \n\nI usually get the pepperoni.  It's a oldie but a classic!

However, don't be fooled into thinking you don't have options. They have pizza available that's already out and on display, but things are coming out of the oven all the time and they will add extra toppings to their slices for you. Also everything tastes better with Dogfish Head IPAs. (Which is a beer if you're curious).\n\nNot hard to find if you're looking for it, but you're not going to know it's an establishment if you don't. Tiny little place, no room for seating unless you count the top of the pristine Galaga Machine or go when one of the five seats aren't taken. This place is probably to be avoided if you hate lines or crowds and you go during peak.\n\nI got out of there for $15 bucks: Two Giant Slices and a Dogfish Head. This is a great deal on the strip. Also as a bonus: the girl at the cash register was crazy hot. According to my friends, I of course am not in the habit of oogling random females; they are the childish barbarians.\n\nTL;DR:\nCons: No Seating. Pizza arrangement vague. Only two kinds of beer.\n\nPros: Lots of seating outside. Pizza is spectacular. Beer on tap includes the best of the worst (PBR) and Dogfish Head 60min (the best of the best)."

Track down the nearest person with a huge pizza box and ask them to direct you to the secret pizza parlor they just picked it up at. Trust me, it works wonders!\n\nThe full pies are expensive, but definitely more economical than paying per slice. Also, when you are craving that chewy, gooey goodness at 3AM and all the pizza delivery boys have been asleep since 2AM, paying close to $30 for a pie is definitely worth every penny.\n\nIt may be a bit of a wait (20-30 minutes) if you are custom ordering a pizza, but when you are stumbling back to your hotel room with that piping-hot fresh-out-of-the-oven pizza in your hands and everyone else is staring at you in jealousy, you won't even be mad.  \n\nThe retro decor is tacky, but we're just there for the pizza right?"

Pizza was impressively good. Fresh and piping hot like I like it. The crust is thin and has awesome crunch throughout. I had mushroom pepperoni which was rocking.

S"Secret Pizza is a great addition to the culinary group that the Cosmopolitan has to offer, and here are a couple of reasons why:\n\n1. If you are looking for something cheap, easy to eat, and convenient at odd/normal hours, this is the place for you. After a night of gambling and walking the strip all I wanted was some comfort food and I knew exactly which alley way to turn into. \n\n2. They limit your selection -- meaning it isn't a vegas buffet in which you way 30+ bucks and have billions of things to choose from. It's more like you have 10 bucks and you should just choose 2 huge new york slices that will satisfy your tummy for a while...unless you can handle more but that's all you!\n\n3. They have a unique white sauce pizza that has a dollops of ricotta cheese and tastes like high caloric heaven, but is worth every bite. \n\n4. The beauty is in the simplicity. A simple menu, simple products, simple food, simple happiness. There isn't an easier key to great food. Yes there might be a long line of drunkies at 2am, but that's why you plan ahead ;) Seating is an issue because the place is literally a narrow alley, but the great thing about pizza is that it's a walk and eat kind of item. \n\n5. If you think that the slice is missing something you can add individual toppings for a cost and they will do it begrudgingly, for a SINGLE slice! Something I think that other pizza places can definitely learn from. \n\nDefinitely a must visit in Vegas and it is in on the my favorite hotels on the strip, a perfect fit!"

S"For months I have wanted to sample the pizza inside the not so secret back room at The Cosmopolitan, but just never got around to it before now.  But once Tropfest ended, the planets finally aligned, and Diane and I quickly left the Boulevard Pool via escalator and easily found our way to this highly touted haven of late-night pizza at last.  The line to order was fairly long even after 1:00 a.m. on a Monday.    And, I quickly learned that if pizza slices rather than a full pie are sought, what you are able to get totally depends on what comes out of the pizza ovens just before one's order is placed.  \n\nBut luck was with us on this visit, for we were able to buy fresh hot slices of pepperoni, sausage, and cheese pizza, plus commandeer two adjoining seats at the counter to be able to eat while sitting down.  Although I might have preferred slices of pepperoni & mushroom pizza, no such combination was available when I reached the head of the line.  But getting to try three out of four flavors is pretty good!\n\nI was really pleased with this pizza.  My expectations were high going in, but they were exceeded.  The crust was nice and buttery, with no char on the bottom.  While the wide slices were relatively thin, they were not noticeably so, and the nicely finished crust was chewy, resilient, and foldable.  All slices were just saucy enough, and really cheesy and tasty.  Pepperoni was lightly spicy, and sausage was very mild, just as pizza maker Luigi had indicated when I asked him on my way through the line.  A small amount of grease was present, but to me that was a good thing for this New York style pizza.  Even though they had come out of the oven just a few minutes before I reached the cash register, each slice was given a little more fire before they were handed to me.  So they were hot and gooey, and a true treat to consume whether drunk or sober.  For, I loved this pizza, and unlike many other guests, had only water to drink all night.  In fact, the Secret Pizza establishment graciously offers free cold water out of a dispenser, with plastic cups and utensils provided as well.  \n\nBesides probably being the cheapest meal available inside a Strip hotel, IMHO the Secret Pizza likely serves the best pizza on The Strip, and is neck and neck with Biaggio's and Metro Pizza, and just a shade behind Dom DeMarco's, for the best pizza served in the entire Las Vegas valley.  Next time I will be ordering a whole pie!"

S'With over 250 reviews on here already, this place isn\'t much of a"secret" anymore, but when you\'re drunk and hungry at 4am after spending several hours on the dance floor of Marquee and you stumble in following the directions of another drunk reveler munching on what looks like a tasty slice of NY Style pizza, you FEEL like you\'ve found a hidden gem.\n\nSo maybe it isn\'t "hidden" anymore, but it is still a gem. We ordered a whole pizza to go (pepperoni and green pepper), waited about 20 minutes, then took our whole pizza over to the Chandelier Bar and enjoyed. I have to say, even if I hadn\'t been tipsy, this pizza is legit. Thin crust, but not too "floppy," flavorful crust (hard to find on thin crust pizzas), and the toppings were fresh and tasty. I was certainly pleased enough to write this review and give the pizza 4 stars, so there you go.'

Nothing more than a whisper lost on the wind.\n\nA large group of friends and myself rented out a suite upstairs for a bachelor party.

I ordered a meat lover's pizza for $5 bucks a slice, The slices are pretty huge and I love how the crust is so crusty loaded with garlic.. The pizza was awesome customer service was great, it was a quick in and out kinda pizza joint.

S'Hidden little gem in Cosmopolitan hotel! This place has no signs, and they do not advertise it. It\'s one of those... if you know about it type of thing. Funny thing is, I learned about Secret Pizza in an airplane, and knew I just had to try it for myself.  It\'s tucked away in a little hallway, full of people who just got done clubbing. I guess some can easily say it\'s drunk people food. Absolutely not!! I believe they do not advertise it because it is "Secret Pizza" after all.. I think this place would appeal more to the young adults. There are no actual tables, and just a little bar counter with a few stools and chairs... maybe five? There wasn\'t really a place to eat, and it would have been pretty awkward to eat there while the line of people stare at you because of the way it was arranged. I recommend getting take-out! Long line, but they do try to get you out of there as quickly as possible. The crust is extremely thin I assume so it can cook much quicker, some of the veggies are pre-cooked in advance, and the mushroom is sliced paper thin to reduce cooking time.\n\nI\'ve eaten pizza from here at least 10 times, and I think it\'s safe to say it\'s my absolute favorite pizza joint! \n\nThe pizza is delicious! I think it\'s one of the best one\'s I\'ve ever had. I still crave it...... WHYYYY do you have to be sooo far away!?!? Well I think only in vegas will I be willing to cough up $40ish for my pizza. Worth every penny though!! The slices are very big, and they are pretty generous with their toppings. I ate at almost every eatery/ restaurant in Cosmo, and I must say, this place was my favorite! I had to eat here twice, and still craved for more!! The menu is literately typed and printed on normal computer paper. The cover of the menu simply says "Pizza"\n\nI ordered a Five Toppings "Pie"  $29.00 -18 inches, 10 slices. Each Additional topping was $2.25\nToppings\nPepperoni\nSliced Sausage - Yum!\nMeatballs\nRoasted Tomatoes\nFresh Garlic- Added a very nice touch\nGreen Peppers\nMushrooms-sliced so paper thin to reduce cook time..almost couldn\'t taste it! ):\nOnions\nRicotta\n\nOverall, I can\'t wait to go back!! I would highly recommend this place, enjoy!!!'

(look for the hallway of vinyl)\n\nF that! I never get just a slice here, I always buy a pie, a whole one at that!  That way you can get half red sauce and half white!  Add your appropriate toppings and voila!  Dine inside or grab a seat by the pool table outside and watch all these people looking at you eating your huge slices!  The pizza here is really good and I actually favor the white.\n\nHOLLA!'

It's definitely a great place to grab a slice of pizza before or after clubbing at Marquee - be prepared as there usually is a line especially when a lot of people are leaving the club. It's not a huge place but the decor definitely reminds me of a hole in the wall pizza joint. The pizza is good, but the only drawback is the price. It is on the pricier side for a slide or even a whole pie. They are definitely known for their white pizza too."

The inside reminded me a lot of NYC's pizzerias and they even had those ancient arcade games you hardly ever see anymore.\n\nThough the line wasn't too bad (I came here for lunch), the price for a slice of pizza was a pretty penny. I think ~$5-6 for a slice is a bit pricey, but ordering the whole pizza isn't that much cheaper either, considering the # of toppings.\n\nThe texture of my pizza was crispy and thin, I loved it. I ordered the combo slice with all the toppings. Overall, it was delicious, and a great place to stop by with friends."

Luckily in the same trip we decided to check it out again and this time there was almost no line. I didn't see a menu so I just looked at what pizzas they had available. I opted for the pepperoni/sausage slice. From what others said, they usually pop it back in the oven for a quick reheat, but I think with the turnover and how quickly people were coming, the pizza was still fresh out of the oven and didn't need a reheat. \nThis place makes no sense. There is no sign and the hallway is super long. They even have like a pinball machine? Totally doesn't fit the lavishness of cosmo either. It was like 3-4 dollars a slice and served on weak paper plates. \n\nAlthough a bit greasy, it was really good. Totally hit the spot and even though I wasn't hungry, I really wanted to get another slice. We ate right outside the pizza joint because it was too small and crowded inside."

Great customer service I feel bad I didn\'t have cash and only tipped a $1 because it wasn\'t until after I tipped he started talking. Also another dude with tats who serviced us and was super kind. They had the right amount of energy to deal with a hungover couple and still provided great conversation! I tried to offer him some of my beer as I just opened it but he refused... If I had a extra one in my room I would bring it down for when he is off his shift! Lol. This place really is a hole in the wall but exceeded my expectation! Props to your beer knowledge!!!

The cashier was closing up shop and the LAST 9 VIP pizzas were being made for some celeb staying at the hotel. The pizza maker was NOT a happy camper.\n\nAll we could hustle was a piece of cheese cake from the freezer...until somehow by the grace of God and our (more my sisters) charm we managed to pull it off. The pizza maker wanted us out so he gave in. haha!\n\nHe let us have the first pizza that was ready and we got cheesecake, too! HEAVENLY!! Gooey Cheese pizza hot off the oven and right into my BELLY! \n\nThe cashier and the pizza maker were total darlings and I commend them for being such good sports.

The selection is pretty basic, you got your plain cheese, pepperoni, or sausage.  To that, you can add simple ingredients like mushroom, onions, bell pepper, etc.  Toppings will cost you extra.\n\nThe overall taste was purely simple and glistening, the way on-the-go pizza should be!  The most important fact to know about the pizza is how the crust is perfectly thin and crispy.  I almost prefer it this way!

Just know that if you go on any busy night, it will be a long wait in a long hallway. Bring some drinks or something to kill the time. \n\nIf the line is out of the hall, expect to wait almost an hour for above average $5 a slice pizza.'

S"Oh Secret Pizza. We meet again. \n\nI remember when the Cosmo first opened. My friends and I were...uh, inebriated, and we stumbled in here shoeless. \n\nI've had plenty of great memories with Secret Pizza since then. One time, we trekked from on side of the strip just for the pizza. I think that was at least a two mile walk.\n\nYeah, it was worth it and I'd do it again.\n\nThe cannoli's are my favorite. The pizzas, are duh- GREAT.\n\nGreat for when you're drunk, hungry, or in need of comfort food."

S"A small, unadorned pizza kitchen hidden in plain sight across the elevator and down a hallway lined with album covers, Secret Pizza has some of the best pizza that I've had.  Not gourmet by any means, but just the right amount of oiliness to each slice and just the right amount of crispiness to the crust, combined with the cachet of its secretive location (even the take-out pizza boxes are plain white without any markings), all make Secret Pizza a worthwhile detour to the Cosmopolitan.  And while $4.50 per slice is generally pretty steep, it's not all that surprising considering the place is in one of the newer, luxury properties along the Las Vegas Strip."

I dunno, but it is PHENOMENAL! I actually ordered a slice with a bunch of stuff on it cuz the "white slice" looked so plain, but I took a bite of my friend\'s and liked it better than the one I ordered! I went back and ordered it 2 more times. \n\nI think they close around 4am because when I first went to try it, it was closed :( I wanted to try it after seeing it featured on a TV show couple years ago and I always remembered it and boy am I sooo glad I did :) I dream about this pizza every night!

S"If you don't know, just ask anyone and they'll be less than happy to show you the entrance. This place is jammed packed with a line to the front of the long hall around the middle of the night when people are tired of Marquee. Expect slutty dresses, stinky feets, and people who can't stand straight and jibberish talkers. However, if you're like me and also one of these club go-ers, then it's just a hot spot for a late night snack before heading back to the room. :)\n\nPizza can be sold by the slice or as a whole. By slice is about $4 and is comparable to the size of Costco's pizza. They have a higher end quality in toppings than Pizza Hut and Domino's. The lines may be long but usually it moves fast, unless of course you got someone in front of you whose so drunk she can't tell she's at a pizza place. But what are the chances of that happening, right? Haha. Considering the prices of nearby food places, especially in the Cosmopolitan, Secret Pizza is the cheaper choice. \n\nBut, there's still some of us who prefer the late night steak and eggs special in other various Vegas locations!"

Cosmo, 3rd floor, by the pool table and sushi place. one of the pizza makers peaked his head out and let us in right at 11am. \n\nThe deliciousness could be smelled as we walked down the hallway... we were first in line, and within 5 min the place was pretty packed. my sister and I shared a cheese, pepperoni, white and meat lovers... All were amazing. I think the best though might have been the cheese. Flavor was great, greasy thin crust goodness. And I'm normally a deep dish girl. \n\nI brought 4 others with me and they all LOVED it. One actually got back in line for a third... And a canolli! normally I'm not a cannoli fan, but this one had super thick cream, almost a cheesecake consistency... Pretty good. But come for the pizza!\n\nLove this place!

S"Greasy pizza after clubbing? Great idea.\nGreasy pizza for morning breakfast/brunch? Umm...maybe not as great. =P\n\nSecret Pizza wasn't too hard to find. Just look for people eating pizza slices in the Cosmopolitan. =)\nTrue, there is no sign and really no storefront. It's on the third level of the Cosmopolitan, near the big chandelier. The doorway is near a pool table and some really cool/funky seating lounges.  Look for a door that leads down a long narrow hallway filled with pictures and you are there! The inside is sparse, a few stools for bar seating and some pinball machines. \n\nThere was 5 of us so we decided to order a whole pizza instead of individual slices because it seemed cheaper. A single slice is about $4.50 without toppings. We ordered a whole white pizza with 3 toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms and olives) for about $26. Plus it was freshly made! \n\nVerdict? It tasted ok but greasy. I had to dab my napkins multiple times before I started eating it. I know the oil is a combination of the pepperoni and cheese but there was nothing unique about the overall taste of the pizza.  I appreciated the crispy thin crust but didn't find it to interesting. Although, I was thankful that the pizza didn't taste too salty and that it was freshly made. Nice and hot. The guy working behind the counter said that the white pizza is more popular than just regular cheese, and the white did have generous portions of ricotta cheese. It felt a bit heavy eating it as brunch. But I could see how this could be yummy drunk food over you come out of the club inebriated. =P\n\nI'm not sure I'd come back.

You can order by the slice, which is $5/pop, or what I usually do is order the whole pizza back to the room to eat. It's definitely worth it even if there's only 2 people because you can always microwave it for another time! Be sure to call and place your take-out order about 40 minutes in advance to avoid any lines! They have an assorted variety to choose from, but my favorite is their white pizza, which is filled with garlic, cheese, and olive oil. Perfect after a long night of drunken fun!"

S'We lost a good one; Ms Winnie H...  Vanished, kaput, finito, so long wherever you may be.  Such good things never last where all traces have disappeared and have gone without merit.  Secrets are kept and reasons retained under lock and key.  Whatever it may be, I dedicate this one to thee.\n\nAfter seeing so many reviews of this worst kept Vegas secret, I finally ventured up two flights of escalators in the City of Sin, where whispers stay and never leave closed lips.  The Cosmopolitan hide-out comes to light as one ventures down a dingy hallway of framed magazine covers dimly lit by spotlight halogen lights (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#4bjZhYMwuBLPOZoW6DI9MA).  It\'s but a small 60\'x60\' room filled with a few pinball wizards and people patiently waiting for a slice of heavenly pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw#o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw).  \n\nBehind the counter, workers pound and toss their gooey dough (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#lW79LoJSUg1RwIPrp_kAKw), making sliced triangles ranging from $4.50 on up based on 50 cents a topping.  For those with a more voracious appetite a pie be available with prices ranging from $25 to a deluxe of $35.00.  Pie additions cost $2.50 each.  Quite expensive, but not on my "Lost Wages" radar, as I wanted it by the slice and by the slice I did receive.  The toppings looked plain and just nominally adequate as they sit in their aluminum bins just waiting to be tossed sporadically on round pie pans laid with golden flour.  The prices of drinks are on par with private Taoish bars:  Sodas 4 bucks, IPAs 7 bucks.  Good Ol\' PBR sewer agua a ghastly 5 bucks.\n\nWe asked the chef what be best in his opinion.  Although we weren\'t really impressed with what was presented, we opted to go with his picks of white, deluxe, and veggie-tar-e-yan (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#VpTrXV0-B3IXvr2iCQiTtQ) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#ns2AT1cd63Rihd8BiVwDqw) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#Kh_DKlGnEKPQcgDBnzmw2g) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#yYP2x9gRAHoDEx9R5E_1dw).   \n\nVarious choices to choose:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#qCog__OGMqN2fhJxaHZx7w)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#q3VPFuV-SQjXhIab6f_9aQ)\n\nWe paid and waited just as patiently as others, noticing everyone kept within their small cliques, or busily eying their mobiles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#c9cbpz6hdIG_qINg5huokg).  The slices returned to the broiler and there they sat, until our names were called and then it begat!\n\nNo idea if I be drunk or needed to be buzzin\' to enjoy these hot tempting pie slices, but whatever it was, it really worked for me.  It was but a warm slice of heaven that was on par with some of the best I\'ve put in my mouth without worrying about spitting up some hairball.  The crust was just crisp enough with the flexibility of NY-stylin\' that wrapped around my hand.  Just enough grease and just enough cheese, the deluxe was nothing but 5-star tasting\'.  We ate at the small alcove bar to take in and enjoy the happening surroundings.  I actually think the re-heating is probably the key to getting the crust texture just right.\n\nIt was such a pleasure to finally unravel your secret, and while the surroundings are a bit crewed, as long as you\'re with friends or loved ones this place can satisfy any of your late night whims.  I will loyally keep the secret of this unnamed hallway as faithfully as a yelper should.  The last buck stops here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA)!'

We rolled in a little after 4am and there was a LONG line, but we were hungry so we waited. We chatted up with a nice guy that was in front of us, which made the wait go by a little quicker. Love when I don't encounter creepy guys in Vegas! Lol.\n\nI ended up getting a combo of pepperoni and meatballs. It was really good and I believe it was just under $5 for a generous slice. I kind of regret not getting their white pizza though, since everyone says it's their best one.

At least i get to see why this place was oh so secret haha since there are no signs or even a name to let you know it's here but I guess seeing a bunch of people lining up for no apparent reason is your sign of knowing where secret pizza is. \n\nFairly decent price for how big the pizza is when you order the whole thing. I actually really like the pizza...my favorite toppings to go along with it right now is probably pepperoni, onions/mushrooms, and garlic. Man the garlic makes the pizza absolutely delicious!!! I really like the thin layer crust even though it doesn't exactly get me full :p but as long as it taste delicious then there isn't much to complain about. I guess my real only complain to secret pizza is probably the amount of oil you see on it which i should of use my napkin to soak it up because i remember i had a stomachache the next day...you know the rest. #tmi \nBUT YEA make sure you use the napkin to lessen the oil and you'll be fine as it is a delicious pizza to enjoy. \n\nWhat i also love about secret pizza is that it closes at 4-5 am and that is just 2 major thumbs up for me. #nightlifeeating :)\n\nI find it to be a place you should come every time you're in vegas. :)"

My dining companion though wasn't impressed and went so far as to compare it to cafeteria pizza.  While I wasn't totally blown away I would have to disagree with that and I definitely think it's better than mall pizza like Sbarro's.  We paid $28 for four slices (two with sausage and mushroom, one white pizza, and one pepperoni and mushroom pizza) and two bottles of water.  Customer service was terrible and the place was super packed and cramped so I couldn't wait to get out of there.

I did stop by the gift shop and grab a Dogfish Ale on the way in- may have got me in a better mood.\nAsked for the famed Sicilian and a meat lover, and a cannoli. The Sicilian was HUGE! There was so much cheese it made a huge tasty blob on my plate.\nI meant to only eat a bit of everything-especially because I'm lactose intolerant-didn't care, I was in heaven! Many beautiful women admiring my selection- couldn't ask for a better meal in Vegas. The cannoli? I had just been in NYC, made it a point to visit Little Italy and find the 'Best Voted Cannoli'. This one blew it away.\n\nFast forward to a couple days later (not 3am) I brought my Mom by to show her the amazing pizza that made every pizza I had previous to that day a disappointment. They threw a couple slices back in the oven to warm them up....\n...not the same. It was good, but not as good as fresh. I asked if they had anything fresh- they did. It was 'almost' fresh but much better than the over crispy crust of the reheated pizza.\n\nPro-tip: Get the Sicilian, FRESH! Get the cannoli, even if you say you will eat half- you'll eat the whole thing, and try the house made pickled peppers. Just do it ;)"

S"I wanted a bloody, rare burger. And that's what I got. I'm pretty sure I could hear my burger moo at me when I bit into it. Dripping in juice...so good. And yes.. again, it was so yummily rare.  \n\nDon't worry - all y'all who are afraid of a lil pink, my friends got their burgers medium and no moos coming from their burger.  Tons of burgers to choose from OR opt for the build your own burger variety.  They even have an oh-so-indulgent kobe beef burger!  \n\nI got the country natural burger, added on a fried egg, bacon, and provolone.  In all honesty, I wanted to go all out and add truffles and truffle sauce, and foie gras, but I was trying to be good.  Even with me 'sacrificing', that burger was amazing. When I ordered my burger rare.. it came RARE. I love that. I love ordering meat rare and it being done right.  It totally tickled my burger fancy. \n\nMy friends got their burger - and I wish I could tell you what was on theirs - but I was so involved in my own bloody burger goodness that I just didn't notice.  \n\nWe also shared the sweet potato fries and zucchini fries.  The sweet potato fries were good - albeit, perhaps the least amazing part of the whole meal - and the zucchini fries were delicious!!! Soft and crunchy at the same time. All that washed down with a yummy Spaten Optimator beer...this whole meal made me one very happy girl.\n\nWait...that's not all. We ended the meal sharing a mint chocolate chip milkshake made with a mint liqueur. Amazeballs, I tell you.  We were so full we were convinced we'd only sip some and take no more. But it was so good, we forced our fat asses to keep going...and we regret not one sip of it.  \n\nSat at the bar, didn't have to wait for a table, and the bartender/waitress was super awesome and nice.  So, my verdict? Burger Bar = happy lil me."

S"My boyfriend and I went to this place b/c he is a big vegetarian burger fan, and rumor had it that the Burger Bar has one of the best fresh made veggie burger in vegas.  Well, what a joke.  We went there and got them with sweet potato fries, which were good.  I wasn't terribly impressed with the veggie burger, and neither was my boyfriend.  The more he ate, the more he knew he had already had that burger before.  He turns to me and says: Its a Gardenburger.  I didn't believe him, b/c the burgers were supposed to be made there!  So I asked the waiter, and sure enough...its a Gardenburger.  So, on top of it being just a mediocre veggie burger, we paid more than I would have liked to for it.   If I can go down to the grocery store and buy the Gardenburger myself and make it, don't charge me $9 per burger.   So I wouldn't go back to this place.   \n\nThe parmesan zucchini sticks were good though."

S"I'd really want to give this place a 4 star rating... but I think it only deserves a 3 star.  Located in the indoor walkway/mall halfway between Mandalay Bay and Luxor (closer to Mandalay), I've been to Burger Bar twice in Vegas.  The first time I had seen the place featured on a travel show and thought the idea was pretty cool.  You basically get to pick from a huge list of options to create your perfect hamburger -- everything from different meats, toppings, breads, and extras.  If you want a Kobe beef burger topped with lobster tail, yes you can get it here.  If you want a turkey burger with avocado, they've got it too.  So they've got the quantity, but I really think they lack in quality.  Don't get me wrong - the burger tastes good.  And damnit, if you don't like one of the toppings, it is kind of your fault for picking that.  But really, when it comes down to it, the burger just isn't amazing or spectacular like I'd expect from a Vegas burger joint.  The sides aren't anything to write home about either.  Their prices can quickly add up too since each topping comes with an additional charge.  So in the end, Burger Bar gets a 3-star rating.  One bonus: they have a solid selection of microbrews."

The American Classic was topped with a plentiful amount of bacon which made it very good. The milkshake was also very good - you can taste the real fruit ingredients they used to make it but again was pretty expensive at $8.75. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the meal it was not amazing - there are better options in Vegas for your money.'

The burgers are delicous and you have several options: beef, kobe beef, turkey, veggie and buffalo along with several other sandwich options.  The best is the dessert burger.  This is awesome!

S"Is it cliche to give this place 5 stars??? I don't care! I would agree, this is probably among the best burger places in the city.....Yes, the prices are more than what you would pay at Apple-bee's and/or In-n-Out.... but OBVIOUSLYYYY this is a much more quality burger and you do get what you pay for. \n\nFor my experience: \nI sat at the bar. I didn't plan on it, but there was no wait.. and I was hungry! Overall I highly recommend sitting at the bar, there are plenty of bartenders, they are attentive and right there when you need them. If I were to be sitting in the restaurant, I would prefer to be in a booth because the tables seem like you would always feel in the way. \n\nFor our eats we STARTED (which was a mistake) with the Nutella shake. I will dream about this delicious thing for the rest of my life. Something this tasty shouldn't be allowed to exist. If you love Nutella, you will fall in love with this incredibly easily. Its topped with fresh cocoa whipped cream, hazelnuts, and chocolate chips! I will drink this down before I die.\n\nBurgers: I really wanted the buffalo burger(which they serve here) because I love buffalo and its better alternatives to beef. But, I stuck with turkey. Turkey burger with provolone and guacamole on a ciabatta bun. This baby was steamin when it came out. Fresh off the grill. I really appreciated the guacamole they had here, fresh and yummy, and its obviously not for dipping chips in, and they understand that. It is for spreading and the consistency of it was beautiful for spreading! All the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and purple onion on the side... and a pickle spear:] \n\nMy friend got a burger as well, and she also got the zucchini fries, PIPING HOT also. These were good, and a good change from fries. \n\nSadly, I couldn't finish my burger because of the delicious Nutella shake. I will definitely be back here for my indulgence and gluttony, but next time I will fast and make sure Burger Bar is the only thing to be in my stomach that day."

S'OK, but didn\'t live up to expectations.\n\nI came here a couple of times while in Vegas for a conference at Mandalay Bay.  I\'ve seen this place many times on TV on Hubert Keller\'s "Secrets of a Chef" that was on PBS a while ago, and have been to his flagship Fleur de Lys restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nOne of the things that looked great on the TV show was the lamb burger, which has since been discontinued, so no luck there.  I wasn\'t up for the $65 Rossini burger, so I went with the build-your own, which was OK but nothing amazing.\n\nThe problem is that you can dig yourself into a hole with bad combinations, and there weren\'t that many suggestions made on the menu.  I gave it a couple of tries, and they were decent, but not great.\n\nThey had a good beer selection, which was a plus.\n\nSo, it was decent, but to be honest I probably preferred my Fatburger down the street, and definitely preferred burgers from The Counter.'

S"this is one of those occasions where i wish yelp would let you give 1/2 stars\n\ni am a beer snob. i will be the first to admit it. so i was pretty damn excited to learn that what i have been told is the best beer bar in vegas was next to my hotel. the beer selection was solid. the prices were pretty on par with the average beer bar back home in chicago. i did notice few very very out of season seasonals which makes me wonder about their turnover on bottles and kegs. having pumpkin beer in stock in july is just strange.\n\n the bartenders we chatted up were super nice. i commented on one of the beers in particular and the bartender called over the beer buyer to tell him what i said. then came the part that irked me. the buyer asked me about chicago beer and the breweries here. i said a few sentences about 3 floyds in particular and mentioned something about having had some of their super limited dark lord a couple of days before. the buyer was very clearly not interested in hearing what i was saying even though he had asked the question. he basically smiled and nodded but did not listen at all. this too would be fine, rude but fine, had he not 15 minutes later while i was in the middle of eating come up behind me and asked me to tell him about 3 floyds and this dark lord beer he had heard about. frustrating situation. i don't really understand managing a beer bar and not wanting to talk about beer. \n\nin the end the price wasn't bad. the burger was pretty good. nothing amazing but pretty good. they had a ton of topping options and out of sight onion rings. \n\nall and all we were here for about 45 minutes and as can often be said for a good bar. come for the beer, stay for the food, enjoy the bartenders, avoid the management."

S'What an awesome find!!! In the middle of a shopping "mall" inside the Mandalay Bay hotel.\n\nOk, so this is one of those places that have one expensive burger ($60 rossini burger). No, that\'s not the one I tried although I\'m thinking next time I might, just to see what a $60 burger taste like.\n\nAnyway, we walked in and they sat us down right away. This is a very casual place, nothing extremely fancy. It\'s an upscale bar, very cool, looks like a great place to grab a drink, grab a bite and hang out.\n\nWe decided to split the Hubert Keller burger (his favorite according to the menu). The burger meat is buffalo and it comes with caramelized onions, baby spinach, and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. It was pure heaven! The meat is very tasty and the bread is delightful. This comes with a side of skinny fries which we swapped for sweet potato fries and they were fantastic. This plate of one burger and a side of fries comes at a whopping $19.25. But we split it between two people and it was enough to fill us up.\n\nO.K, are you ready? NUTELLA milkshake!! Did you hear me? I said, NUTELLA milkshake!! Ohh, vanilla ice cream blended with lots of nutella topped with homemade whipped cream topped with hazelnuts and a drizzle nutella. What a dream!!! I know they make this at some other places but this one is the BEST so far.'

S'After hearing about the Burger Bar for the last two years I finally got a chance to try it and the gourmet burgers are very good. I went with a business associate and we both ordered the Kobe Beef burger which, according to the menu, is produced in the Snake River area. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and were tasty. I ordered the buttermilk onion rings and they were excellent. Maybe the best onion rings I have ever eaten!\n\nBurger Bar offers a huge selection of condiments to pile on your burger but every item will add a buck or two the the cost of the meal. The Kobe Burger will run $20 so be prepared.\n\nService was very good and the iced tea and lemonade are both perfectly prepared. The restaurant reminds me of a loud sports bar and there is loud music playing over the speaker system.  It is very difficult to hear and carry on a conversation.  It is a good choice for quick meal, once you are seated, and a tasty burger.'

S'We frequent this place one every two or three months, not only as it\'s the spawn of one of my favorite Chef\'s (Hubert Keller) but these burgers are made with some of the best ingredients in town.  The sweet potato fries are a must as well.  I\'m a self deemed foodie so I\'m all about customization.  I know you are never supposed to mess with a good thing (as the majority of menus TELL you what you will be ingesting), but I enjoy Chef\'s approach where you choose your protein, bun and toppings.  Sometimes I\'m not always in the mood for the INSERT NUMBER here, so this type of menu opens you up for multiple visits.  \n\nDuring the last visit I had to go with the Angus (mid-rare) on Ciabatta (for the crunch) topped w/ Blue Cheese (addict), Avocado and Carmelized Onions w/ a side of Sweet Potato fries.  \nBurger came out in about 15 minutes and it was gone in less than 5.  The crunch of the bread w/ the combination of the buttery avocado, saltiness of the blue and sweetness of the onions made me have instant happy face.\n\nVery satisfying meal and we will be back next time I swing by Mandalay.  Next time, i\'ll have to try the Milkshakes as I saw these being served to the Mid-Westerners at the table next to me who were raving that they were "GONNA DIE" because they were so good.'

S"A concept table service burger joint plus full bar in the shopping zone of Mandalay Place, from chef Hubert Keller of Fleur-de-Lys fame.  The concept is that you choose a base burger (3 kinds of beef, lamb, turkey, garden, etc), one of five buns, and then pile on your choice of about 40 toppings at extra cost, ranging from homemade beet pickles to a half lobster or a fried egg.  The $60 Rossini burger (with foie gras, sliced black truffles, and madeira sauce) is something to try at least once and the $16 regular Kobe burger is good too.  Knowledgeable and courteous waitstaff, great ingredients.  A real temple of burger-dom.  Only two reason for four stars instead of five are: 1) bar concept though ineeds work and better mixed drinks (but does have 24 beers on tap); and 2) prices a little high, and really, after all that it's still a hamburger."

The bad stuff, most things overpriced, and the service.\n\nSorry Todd (the server), I know we were a big table (10), but that food took forever, one order was completely forgotten, and one burger was medium well instead of medium rare.  And while my wife got the $16 buffalo burger you raved about, I got the $9 Angus and mine was better.  The fatty cow is always tastier than the lean healthy buffalo in my experience, and at double the price for lean and healthy, I am not willing to give up flava.  Fooled me once and got me to buy your pricey burger while you had an automatic 18% tip for a big group, but it won't happen again, and hopefully all the Yelpers will be on to you now.\n\nOh yeah, Karen got the $12 foie gras option and it was nothing to write home about. Cool that it is on the menu, but I would like it to pay it's own way too.  While I don't mind spending $88 for burgers at lunch while in Vegas, it better be over the top spectacular at that price, and this simply wasn't.  \n\nOther notes: The zucchini fries were pretty good, though a bit mushier than I would have preferred.  And this would be a 3 star place if we had just gone in, got the Angus burgers at $9+options, had our food prepared right, and got our food in less than 50 minutes, which is kind of ridiculous for a burger.  Oh yeah, also cool that this place has about 4 different fresh bun options, 3 different bacons, and about 20 or so other interesting sides.  Jsut skip the foie gras and probably the lobster, though no one in our group tried the lobster so Ic an't speak first hand for it."

I gotta say, it wasn't worth the $17 I paid for it. I've had my fair share of gourmet burgers and this was NOT worth $17. Maybe $12. No more. \n\nI left satisfied, but not. I just couldn't help but feel ripped off. Maybe living in California has spoiled me a bit and we have plenty of amazing gourmet burger joints out here for way less! \n\nSorry, but if you're charging me $17 for a burger, it better blow my damn mind."

Normally, I have no problem waiting it out (the shopping close by is SO great), I mean, who would for quality food? But on this particular Tuesday, we had tickets to see a show at 7:00pm at Mandalay Bay and I wanted to score dinner here before the show.\n\nI know they dont take reservations but figured I would call anyway and see if I could try to arrange something. The girl who answered the phone gave me the email address of the manager to see if she could accomodate.  The manager was so incredibly sweet and went above and beyond to make sure we had the best table with the best server and got in and out on time to see our show.  Needless to say, the service here is top notch, excellent.\n\nNow on to the goods: the eats.  I had the Kobe Burger built my own way. The toppings you can choose from are SO original and they have a TON of choices. The meat was insanely tender and juicy, so lean, not an ounce of fat. I couldnt decide whether to pair it with the buttermilk fried zucchini sticks or buttermilk fried onion rings, so the waiter mixed and matched and brought me out a half order of both!!! And I'm so glad that he did... they were BOTH rediculous!! So, so delicious.\n\nIn closing, once again, the Burger Bar out-did themselves and keeps me looking forward to my next trip out west so I can score some more food there!

These women definitely deserve a raise or a promotion or something because the service they provided at this burger joint was even better than the service i've gotten in much fancier much more expensive fine dining restaurants. if you're ever at Burger Bar look for either Erin or Ashley (or bothe of them) and i will guarantee that your dining experience will be as good as the transcendentally excellent burgers."

So many sides too, like avocado, pineapple, sprouts, jalapeno bacon and carmelized onions. The ground mustard is amazing!  Their salads are nice.  The shakes are awesome, many varieties.  They have a "burger" dessert made from a Krispy Kreme donut for the roll and a nice slice of nutella for the burger!  Erin is our best favorite waitress at the Burger Bar.

Usually there will be two giant Aunt Jemima's camped out at the bar and the usual collection of  Red Lobster customers one would find, similiar to that of wet Willys in Miami, however there are always groups of 5+ hot and willing half drunk girls stopping by here to do some jello shots.

S'Food?  Good.  I was definitely a fan of their Sweet Potato fries with my burger.  \n\nAhh the service.  I would like to just say that after this experience I sent an email from their website to the location letting them know about our bad experience, and no one ever contacted me.  Hmmm...what does that say about their commitment to their guests?\n\n So I arrive at burger bar with my two sisters and a mutual friend in tow.  We approach the hostess stand and let them know we are a party of four.  So the host grabs the menus, walks us to a table, sets the menus down, and promptly walks away.  Doesn\'t say a single word to us during the entire interaction.  Not "Your serve will be right with you", not "Right this way guys" Nothing.  Just dead silence.  Awkward.\n\nSo our dude of a waiter comes up and takes our order, our food comes out, and the guy comes back to check on us once.  Everything came out perfectly we tell him.  So as the meal continues, our drinks get empty.  We kind of all glance around, but no one has seen our waiter walk by in at least 15 minutes.\n\nSo finally another server walks by, his name tag read Damien, and he glanced over saw our drinks were empty, and brought over a pitcher of water.  So another 10 -15 minutes goes by...still have never seen our unnamed server...our meals are well beyond finished, and Damien walks by again. \n\n"Has your server checked on you"\n\n"No"\n\nSo he says he\'ll be right back, and comes back with our checks.  So we pay, and I don\'t think too much about it until as we are leaving, my sister and I look back and Damien is cleaning our table.  She walks over and politely asked him if he was getting our tip or the dude who took our order.  He informed her that when he went back to check on the server and find out why he hasn\'t been attending to his table that the guy had left for the night and hadn\'t reassigned our table to anyone.\n\nSo..thanks Damien for your server and F-U dude who deserted out table.'

S"Called in to put our name down. It's located near the shops at Mandalay Bay, near Lush Beauty and a candy store. Be ready to stack up $$ on your burgers. \n\nFOOD:\nTurkey burger (4 stars): Customized with wheat bread, fried egg, avocado, American cheese, and mushrooms. All burgers come with the standard lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle. Turkey was cooked well and was moist. \n\nVeggie patty (3.5 stars): A little dry but looked much better than any other turkey patty I've seen. \n\nSkinny and Fat Fries (4 stars): I usually love skinny fries but I liked the fat ones more here. Nice and crunchy. \n \nNutella Shake (5 stars): Do not come here when you are trying to eat healthy because this was the best thing that I had here. SO FREAKING GOOD. Well anything with nutella is always good, but this was extra good! \n\nCoke float(4 stars): Also really good (= They make good shakes. \n\nService (5 stars)\nOur waitress was awesome. They mixed up a couple of fries on our order but fixed it right away. She kept up with all our requests, and for a group of 10 we had no problems. \n\nATMOSPHERE (5 stars)\nCool burger place. They have nice big booths to sit in also, with a small TV at the end. We had too big of a group to sit there though. \n\nThe hostess girls in the front were fake nice. Almost made me not want to eat here. Sorry I asked how long the wait was girls, but we had 3 kids in our group and kids go crazy without food. All you were doing was standing in the front anyway!"

The meat was cooked medium rare and it was the best burger I've had! It was so juicy and flavorful! \n\nOh and the sweet potato fries are good too!"

S"There's a loooong wait here for a reason. Burger Bar is awesome. The best thing about it I would say, are the endless options (customizable burgers, drinks, etc). Not to mention the deliciousness. Burger prices range from normal to ridiculous ($60) for those with fancy tastes. There was turkey, salmon, normal beef, Kobe beef, etc, with all sorts of fancy toppings available. (The expensive one had truffle essence...I still have no idea what that tastes like).\n\nWe ended up splitting a Kobe burger (they charge for splits, ugh!)  as pictured (http://media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xPX-07JmgKNbObjsoYBP2g/l). The patty was impossibly tender and wonderfully seasoned. We ordered a dipping sampler for our fries (\nhttp://media2.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GB-CP9WLcVvQKnjJ0-d2fQ/l). It was super-fun to try all the sauces. I liked the chipotle sauce the most. I also got seriously what I consider the most luscious Strawberry Margaritas ever (http://media1.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WoZJlUx7yG4yrR6ycTuXbw/l). I had TWO of them. There was a lot of fresh, sweet strawberry puree in there, as well as scattered mint leaves for to make it even more refreshing.\n\nLast, we topped our meal off with dessert. There were many, many choices available...including alcoholic milkshakes, with customizable flavors (pick the liquor, pick the flavor)! Amazing. We settled on the dessert burger, which consisted of donuts sandwiching a sheet of passionfruit jelly, kiwis, strawberries, and gnutella (http://media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7p_GLg35zpGOLnw-FjHLqg/l), accompanied by a drizzle of raspberry sauce and a dollop of whipped cream.

S"Rossini for the win!  $60.  I will never forget it.  Nor will I ever order it again, because I think my memory would be spoiled if I ever re-tasted it.  Must remind everyone again that we were in Vegas, where money is thrown around like in Monopoly and the atmosphere can cloud your judgment sometimes.  All good.  I think I would've had non-buyer's remorse if I hadn't ordered it.  \n\nWent with a group of 10 around noon on Saturday.  Waited all of 5 minutes.  Seating was cozy with a table pushed up against a booth table.  Clean, polished wood, part sports bar, part diner atmosphere.  Had college football going on the tv in the booth and the waitress was cool enough to change it to a game one of the guys requested.\n\nThe menu was ka-razy.  You choose your patty and bun ($8-16), then pick from toppings separated into categories (from cheddar to guacamole to jalapeno bacon to shaved black truffles:  $1-30).  Then, you still have sides, dessert burgers, shakes, and an extensive beer menu to sift through.  I was overwhelmed.\n\nI had to go with the package deal, the Rossini.  American kobe patty, onion bun, foie gras, shaved black truffles, madeira wine sauce, served with cracked black pepper, coarse sea salt, and a truffle oil sauce on the side.  The burger was like butter, juicy throughout without much spillage onto the plate.  The flavors in the burger were so rich, I had to really slow it down and thoughtfully taste.  Therefore, I was pretty much done two-thirds of the way through.  But that would've been $20 of burger left so I continued to chomp away.  \n\nThe fries that accompanied didn't suck, but they weren't memorable.  Tasted some zucchini fries, those were pretty good as well.  Might have gotten tired of them if I had to eat a whole serving.  Your choice of dessert burger came with the Rossini (something I swear I didn't see on the menu) so that was pretty cool.  I chose the chocolate burger--sliced donut, chocolate ganache patty, strawberry slices, passionfruit-pineapple gelatin, and mint ($3.95).  Looked like a cheeseburger, so cool!  Tasted pretty good but grew tired of the ganache.  I thought the cheesecake dessert burger was better, cheesecake was light and almost fluffy.  My chocolate loving homegirl would beg to differ though.\n\nSo all in all, I was satisfied with my $60 purchase.  Burger, fries, and dessert.  Another friend loaded up his burger with toppings and it ended up being about $30.  Plus, I figured I'd hit the slots later and recuperate some funds.  Whaddaya know, won $100 on one of those flaming 7s dollar slots.  Sweet..."

I loved my burger, and the fact I got to choose everything, from the meat, to the bun, to the toppings, to the fries.\n\nI don't have much to complain about, really, except service was a little slow, and the prices are really expensive for BURGERS.\n\nBut I'd still recommend trying it out!!!"

For a burger, fries and a soda it is usually around $20, so be prepared when you sit down. \n\nConsidering that everyone else in town for a convention eats at Border Grill or Red, White and Blue it is worth the walk to Burger Bar because you can sit down right away usually."

S"So I had kind of a mixed experience here. I had read the reviews and thought it would be a great choice for a casual dinner. My friends all agreed. The wait was about 40 minutes at 9pm on a Friday. (We used the time to grab a martini and buy bath bombs at Lush across the way. OMG heavenly, both of them.)\n\nAnyhow. Our waitress was super sweet and very helpful. I ordered the Angus burger on an onion bun, with caramelized onions and blue cheese. She told me that was the best combo EVER and not to add anything, it was perfect. I like positive reinforcement, awesome. My friends all ordered and we spent a few minutes watching the Laker game on the TV in our booth. \n\nThe good: My food was delicious! The blue cheese was a nice kick complimented by the perfect onions. I had also ordered sweet potato fries, and they were great. Our server had brought out ranch and mayo for dipping without us asking, which we loved.\n\nThe bad: I ordered my burger medium and it was RARE. Bloody all the way through. Normally I would have sent it back....but I was starving and it tasted good. So maybe that's not so bad then.\n\nThe ugly: As I was 3/4 done with my burger, my friend who had gotten the sliders noticed a hair wrapped around the toothpick and bun on one of her sliders. This hair was so wrapped around and clearly not hers. Yuck. She pointed it out to the server and in seconds, a manager was at our table, offering to make a new plate or take it off the bill. She opted to just take it off the bill.\n\nSo theres my dilemma. I loved my food, I wish I could go back today, BUT I won't because hair is not delicious. Bummer! I'm still giving 4 stars though, it could have been a fluke!"

S'Hubert, Hubert, Hubert... \n\nSorry, I\'ve gotta say this place didn\'t meet up to my expectations. It\'s alright for a burger place, but a tad expensive. Having went to Fleur de Lys the day after, I wish I would\'ve went to Fleur de Lys twice (though, my pocketbook probably couldn\'t have taken it =P).\n\nAs for the Burger Bar, I decided to go for the Hubert burger - trust the chef, right? It was a buffalo burger with spinach, bleu cheese, and grilled onions on a ciabatta bun. Was it a good burger? Yes and no... I mean, it was pretty much just a burger. I thought the spinach was a little weird and the bleu cheese was a bit over the top. The prices, too, were a little high. \n\nI was amazed at their beer selection - they actually have a whole menu dedicated to beers - and they have choices from around the world. I went for the Burger Bar Seasonal since it was something brewed right in Vegas. It was ok - a bit sweet. \n\nOverall a bit pricey for burgers billed as "fancy" - but worth a try. I\'d definitely try Fleur de Lys SF before Burger Bar SF.'

S'Not bad, somewhat memorable. I love the variety of ingredients and "stuff" all over their menu, I am all about adding different things and love access to lots of sauces. I assume that as a tourist trap, the burgers have become what they have for feeding the masses. Reading the descriptions I was very intrigued; upon tasting the burgers, I was not. Not disgusted by any means, but just not impressed. The buffalo meat was delicious though.\n\nI\'d also assume that the fries a place like this offers should be great in one way or another and I found none in both types. \n\nOverrated is quite the perfect word for this place, just like most of Vegas. Some places are, while being overrated, worth trying just, or at least, once. This place, I found no merit for. Reminds me of an airport restaurant. I\'m not mad I tried it, but I wouldn\'t be recommending anyone to go out of their way to.'

The restaurant's decor is simple -- think neighborhood bar tucked away in a casino.  But the menu is vast.  It's a high-market grocery store's collection of meat, vegetables, cheeses, sauce options.  Put simply: Burger Bar is [bleep]'n fantastic.\n\nThe cooks prepare the patty perfect to order (I'm a medium rare kind of girl).  I had my bison burger with blue cheese and cucumbers.

S"***Many Las Vegas restaurants let their quality standards slip once they have been around for a while and that is the case with Hubert Keller's Burger Bar; Burger Bar is still a decent value compared to the many overpriced high-end restaurants on The Strip, but there are several new gourmet burger spots in Vegas (like Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood) that are probably more exciting***\n\nThere are several reasons to visit Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.  It is from a celebrity chef (Hubert Keller), but it is a relatively inexpensive restaurant (at least compared to the many expensive celebrity chef backed fine dining restaurants on The Strip).  It also primarily features two items--burgers and milkshakes--that are very popular.  Finally, Hubert Keller was on Top Chef Masters and showcased this restaurant as well as his burger skills so many might be intrigued with this one if they saw that season of Top Chef Masters on the Food Network.\n\nThis Burger Bar (there is also one located in the Macy's in San Francisco) is housed in Mandalay Place--a mini-mall within Mandalay Bay that features a few retail and dining options.  It is a fairly small place and the menu showcases a build-your-own-burger concept where you pick your burger protein--several types of beef, lamb, buffalo, turkey, and veggie as well as chicken breast and salmon.  You then choose your desired bun as well as all kinds of toppings including raw vegetables, grilled vegetables, many types of cheese (standard stuff like American and cheddar but also brie and smoked Gouda), several sauces, additional proteins like bacon and prosciutto, and finally a few premium ingredients like seared foie gras and black truffle.  You can also order one of their signature chef's burger creations so you do not have to make any choices.\n\nIn addition to their burgers, Burger Bar also serves all kinds of fried food from French fries and onion rings to zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks.  Chicken wings and a few salads are available too.\n\nI went the build-your-own-burger route and opted for their Prime ground beef and added bacon, smoked Gouda and spinach on a potato bun.  The burger was okay.  I thought the burger at the newer Gordon Ramsay BurGR was much better--the beef was much juicier there and it featured both a higher quality bun as well as higher quality toppings.  The burger at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar was okay, but only the really thick and meaty (crispy but also chewy) bacon stood out.  The bun felt very plain for a gourmet burger spot.\n\nI also opted for one of their milkshakes.  They have all kinds of milkshakes from build-your-own-milkshakes with many toppings to signature creations.  I tried their caramel latte, which featured coffee ice cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels.  It was a great mix of caramel and coffee and the milkshake had a great thick and creamy consistency (very addictive and hard to put down).\n\nService was good--pleasant and quick.\n\nPrices are reasonable for a notable Las Vegas restaurant.  Burger Bar's prices are higher than similar gourmet burger restaurants in other big cities like Los Angeles, but that is to be expected given that Burger Bar is on The Strip.  Burger Bar does offer a decent meal that comes at a much lower price than the many celebrity chef backed (and very pricey) fine dining restaurants on The Strip.\n\nI remember liking Burger Bar more on my first trip.  It is not too surprising that the quality has dropped since then; the quality standards at many Vegas restaurants seem to slip if it has been around for a long time.  Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is still a decent spot, but Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood is a much better option for an gourmet burger on The Strip.\n\nBurger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, which is attached to Mandalay Bay.  Like other major casinos and hotels on The Strip, Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary self and valet parking."

S'This will now be one of my standard stops when I\'m in Vegas. Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, the shopping area that\'s technically part of Mandalay Place, but the restaurant is actually closer to the Luxor.\n\nIf you\'re going just for your basic hamburger, it may be overpriced, but this place is all about customization and outlandishness in building YOUR perfect burger.\n\nThis is how I built mine:\n- American kobe beef burger, medium rare\n- Ciabatta bun\n- Sauteed portobello mushrooms\n- Seared foie gras\n+ side of onion rings\n\nAre you sitting down? My burger easily cost $35, and it was worth every penny. And I would gladly pay it again. Just know that it\'s very likely your burger won\'t be that expensive, and it will still be very good.\n\nThey didn\'t skimp on the foie gras, enough in fact for me to take a slice of it to enjoy separately.  The ciabatta was perfect for absorbing all the delicious juices and foie gras fat without disintegrating.  Man, I\'m drooling just thinking about it again... if someone pointed a gun to my head and said, "You must make love to a food item of your choice!" this would be it. Rar!\n\nAmenities wise, there are several TVs throughout (including one at your table)... we went on a Sunday, so we got our fill of NFL games.  There was quite a large bar and lots of booth seating.  This being Vegas, the servers were all attractive... not that I noticed, since they still didn\'t hold a candle to my burger. \n\nDid I mention that it was pretty good?'

S"We ate here before watching the Lion King show. Let's just say I wasn't impressed. The reviews raved about the food and I was expecting more, I wasn't dissatisfied just disappointed. The place is small, like a dive bar and not what I expected.  I ordered the salmon burger with skinny fries. The fries were crispy and tasty but I have had better salmon burgers at Fuddruckers! I guess I expected since we were in Vegas (where things are bigger and usually better) the salmon burger would blow me away. That it did not, it kind of tasted like it had been frozen for awhile and didn't even taste like seafood. I expected more fishy, I like my salmon tasting like fish at least even though it's a burger. The bf got a regular old hamburger which he was not impressed by either. He said he has definitely had better and by the end of our meal I wished we would've saved our dinner to go somewhere else at the Mandalay Bay. We did end our meal with a strawberry banana shake which was yummy and I would return to get a shake but definitely not coming back to eat a burger."

S'All you need to know: THE BEST SKINNY FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. EVER.  Perfectly cut, not greasy, perfectly salted, crunchy outside, soft hot inside. I ate every last one and I could have eaten more.\n\nSo it is no secret that I love Hubert Keller.  I have the hugest crush on him with his French accent, charming smile, and gray ponytail.  And I don\'t typically crush on older men, that\'s a fact.  I also love how he\'s always adorably sweet and encouraging on the Top Chef shows.  And his PBS shows make it look easy to make souffle...yeah, right, but he makes it look easy.\n\nSo we went to Burger Bar after an unintended visit to the airport to retrieve my BF\'s lost ID.  Ugh.  This place looks like an updated more upscale diner with booths, tables, and bar seating.  Get your fave type of seating and get ready to stuff yourself!\n\nBurgers are either "build your own" or Chef\'s burgers that are already designed with toppings, etc.  They even have veggie burgers and fish burgers so if you don\'t like beef you are still going to find something here.  I ordered the Hubert Keller burger that was buffalo meat with caramelized onions, baby spinach and bleu cheese on a ciabatta with red wine and shallots sauce.  If it is good enough for Hubert it is good enough for me.  The burger was perfectly medium rare and the entire thing was messy and dripping with savory juices from the sauce and the caramelized onions. It was delicious...and huge!  I didn\'t finish the entire thing but that may have been because I stuffed my face with fries.  The BF got the lamb burger.  This one is with secret spices, tomato, cilantro, and spicy burger bar ketchup.  It had a great spice taste, like Middle Eastern inspired flavor.  And the spicy ketchup - that is the stuff.  We ordered a separate order of that for our fries.  Not that the fries needed ketchup but damn that ketchup was good.\n\nI cannot stress enough how good those fries were.  I am a huge fan of skinny fries, crunchier the better, and dear God they were amazing.  \n\nIf you don\'t want burgers, they do have salads and a chicken sandwich too.  They also have milkshakes, including BOOZY milkshakes.  If ONLY I had enough room for one of those too.  \n\nService was good, our waitress was attentive and didn\'t let us go thirsty.  She also answered that Chef Keller was not there that weekend and told me I could keep up with his whereabouts (i.e. stalk him more effectively) on facebook.  She confirmed that he is a sweet guy just like I already knew.  The prices are pretty standard Vegas if you ask me which means it isn\'t gonna be the cheapest burger...mine was $22 if that tells you.  And the ketchup extra was $1.  But hey, that\'s how it goes.\n\nNext time you are in Vegas and want a casual atmosphere and a damn fine burger and the best fries EVER you need to come here.'

S"Our first meal in Vegas, my sister, mom and i made a mad dash of tummy rumbling hunger to the Mandalay after we checked into our hotel. My hands were practically shaking at the thought of yummy sweet potato fries *adores* \n\nWhat I Thought: So not pretentious! With a chef as famous as Hubert Keller, you'd think the place as a stench of snobbery to it, but it doesn't all. Very casual, elbows on the table can we get you meat and beer type joint. The servers were too slow for my taste and didn't check in on us but one time. it would've gotten 5 stars had it not been for that \n\nWho I Dragged Along: Ros and our Mommy (yea, i still say Mommy) \n\nAtmosphere: Clean, modern, dark wood, dimly lit with TVs at the booths with some sort of football game on. \n\nPrice: Our bill including tip came out to be $55 or so \n\nWhat We Ate: My mommy is a semi-vegetarian and she said their veggie burger was seriously the best thing she ate during our Mother/Daughter's weekend in Vegas. Unfortunately she refused to get onion rings since she's against all things fried. \n\nMe: turkey burger on sesame with sauteed portebello mushrooms, provolone cheese (for extra stringy cheesy goodness), bacon (pork fat ftw!!!), lettuce, tomatoes, onions with a side of sweet potato fries and chipotle aoili for dippin \n\nMommy: Veggie burger on Wheat with lots of hot sauce, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, tomatoes and onions.. and ate of our plats of fries \n\nRos: black angus burger with Cheddar, bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, onions with a side of skinny fries \n\nShared: chocolate burger for dessert (yummmm, dark chocolate goodness) \n\n\nParking: We walked over from MGM, but its Vegas, there's parking everywhere! \n\nWould I Come Back: Next time I'm in Vegas.. sho nuff! I hope Hubert opens one in the Bay, that would rock sooo hardcore \n\nDid i miss anything?: Hubert Keller is one of my ultimate Chef crushes, being a wannabe chef myself i adore his culinary point of view plus.. its damn friggin great burgers!"

This is a build-your-own-burger place and they have an amazing selection of meats and things to put in your burger. The last time I was here, I ordered a regular angus patty with grilled onions, American cheese, prosciutto, bacon, and garlic aoli on the side. I love the onion rings here! They are the type that when you bite in, the whole onion doesn't come out! How nice. A little on the pricey side but worth it. Huge portions too!\n\nA little hint... This place is almost always packed and usually there's a crowd outside waiting. Helpful hint, find yourself a seat at the bar!

They have seafood burgers too.\n\n*TIP: It's close to FAT TUESDAYS so you can get a drink from there and eat here if you want more varieties.\n\n\nCOOL INFO: The head chef Mr.Keller was on TOP CHEF and is a finalist on TOP CHEF MASTERS on BRAVO TV.

I was supposed to go here last November, but my plans had switched because of the Pacquiao fight.\n\nWe were greeted by a beautiful lady and placed on the tables near the entrance because the booths were full. My boss wanted to see the Football game, but at the same time have a great meal with our work money. I opened up the menu and I see this expensive $60 burger. Foie Gras Burger...What?! Geez. I ordered the American Classic with skinny fries ($14). I am not sure what my boss ordered since it was a customized burger, but sure was delicious for both of us. I guess I am willing to pay $14 for a burger, but not a dime more.\n\nThe atmosphere was awesome and people were just having fun watching the game either with the MLB or NFL.

The booths each had a mini flat screen so you can watch while you eat. There are two bar areas, for those who do not want to wait for a table. Take a seat at the bar if you are hungry and want to be served immediately. \n\nMy burger came in a foccaccia bread with loads of blue cheese. My first bite was great, a mouthful of cheese, tender meat and chewy bread. I tasted my hubby's burger and mine was definitely the winner. The hubby's Kobe burger had lots of hard bits in it and that was surprising, especially if its supposed to be a Kobe burger.\n\nAll in all a good experience but I still prefer the Perfect Burger at LBS at the Red Rock Casino.

It comes as a double veggie patty, which I didn't realize.  It was good, but from the description, I expected a little more flavor (more spiciness, specifically).  In any case, I really like the value.  It's a pricey burger but not extravagantly so, and you're full at the end.  \n\nThey have about four or five styles of fries:  the sweet potato-style is a tasty, less salty-tasting, alternative.\n\nI'd go back, as the other burgers ordered at the party looked really good."

First off they have a huge menu of different beers from all over the world, although I was infinitley disappointed they did not have Lowenbrau.  Anyway I highly recomen the American Kobe beef burger.  It was great and in my opinion very close in quality to the Japanese version, while being immensley less expensive.  My burger was $16, but I will admit it was more than worth it.  Pretty much the best burgers I have had in a very long time.  I highly resomend it, and I can tell you all that if this place was more along the lines of a reasonable spot in price (which it is not) I would probably be eating there at least twice a week, and I live 40 min from there!

S"I am a fan of the burger, and the burgers at Burger Bar are in the top 3 best burgers I've ever had in my life.  The really cool thing about this place is you can customize the burger to put whatever you want on it, from the meat (beef, lamb, kobe, or bison) to cheese to the type of bun to the saucr to about 40 or so different toppings.  My go-to burger is the bison burger with blue cheese, avocado, shaved black truffles, and pesto mayonaisse.  It is absolutely amazing, and not too too expensive, which is a rarity in Vegas.  I make it a point of coming here at least once every time I go to Vegas, which is about once or twice a year, and I've come maybe 8-10 times at this point.  The last time I was in Vegas (for my birthday last year), my wife and I came here and also tried the fry sampler for the first time, which comes with regular fries, sweet potato fries, and I think steak fries, and you get a choice of I think 5 sauces of whatever you want off the sauce menu (we got pesto mayo, BBQ sauce, chipotle aioli, and a couple others), and it was also really good.

S'An all American classic with a twist. Well I guess if you read through their menu there are quite a few twists. This place gives you an option to build your own burger or choose from 5 or 6 of their own creations. You start with the meat. You have options of buffalo, turkey, American kobe, or regular grass fed ground beef. This is where the fun starts...... After you choose your meat you then choose how you would like to top it. You can go as plain as American cheese and bacon, or you can fancy it up with foie gra, a lobster tail, and slices of truffles. Anyway you mix and match it, they know how to cook your meat to perfection.  Be careful of not "over-topping" your burger as you\'ll find it difficult to wrap your mouth around it.'

They also had a bunch of toppings to choose from including lobster tail and some high end truffles. I chose portabella mushrooms, which was stacked, and caramelized onions. DELICIOUS!! I also chose a side of sweet potato fries, which was also great. \n\nWhat was also impressive was their beer menu. I could have sworn they had every beer/lager in the world. If you're looking for something a bit stronger than a beer, I suggest the Chimay, white ribbon.\n\nIf you still have room after your burger, try the dessert burger!! It's a warm doughnut sandwich with ice cream and some fruit I think, but it was YUM!! I thought that it was going to be too sweet, but it was just right.\n\nThe only downside is that adding on all the toppings can get a bit pricey, but it's worth it!"

S"The Burger Bar is my kind of place. The burgers I've ordered have always been fantastic! It's like you assemble your fantasy burger and the'll prepare it to your exact specificatins. As burgers go, they are on top of their game! The real reason to go however are the beers. A wonderful variety of beers on tap (most I have fund in Vegas anyway) and an impressive selection of bottles from around the world! So in other words it's a great place to drink exotic beers that happen to have some fantasic burgers. I got a bacon cheeseburger with grilled pineapple, guacamole, and chipotle. Creamy, crunchy, sweet and spicy...  grade A goodness."

S'What can I say... I love the Burger Bar! My husband and I always make a trip here when we are in Las Vegas. We just stayed at Mandalay Bay over Labor Day weekend so we had a short walk to one of our favorite spots.\n\nI have to say, the Kobe Beef is one of the best I have ever had. It is so delicious and just melts in your mouth. But if you want to keep it basic (and less expensive) the Angus Beef is a great choice as well! You really can\'t go wrong.\n\nThe only reason I am giving Burger Bar only 4 stars is because our server was a bit off. When we told him he left bacon off of one of the burgers, he said "well then there\'s a kitchen full of Mexicans I need to go yell at". It was so off color and uncomfortable for our entire table that we really didn\'t want to deal with him any longer.\n\nOther than that odd experience, the food and ombiance is amazing.'

S"This restaurant, by famed restaurateur Heubert Keller touts itself as the best burger in Las Vegas and the ultimate burger experience.  Instead this place is everything you would expect from a stuck up gourmet who wouldn't know a great burger if it hit him in the face.  Don't get me wrong, you won't get food poisening here and you won't come away saying that the burgers were inedible, in fact for the most part the end result is a good burger.  I am certain however, Mr. Keller and his chefs have never seen the parking lot of a sporting event with a charcol grille and a spatula. \n\nFirst, what I don't like about this place.  The burgers were cooked like a gourmet would, meaning good for a steak, bad for a burger.  All the burgers we tried were underdone and we asked for them medium.  Second, the prices are outrageous.  You will not get out of here below $20.00 per person and for a burger, that is just wrong.  Third, the service is absolutely attrocious for the price.  This is supposed to be a burger place but they treat you like the fine dining establishments, meaning rude service and slow service.  Fourth, the Kobe burger is a waste of time.  The flavor is lacking and quite honestly, you don't need the best meat to make a good burger. Fifth, the bun is boring. I expect better from a 20 dollar burger joint.  The buns we had were dry inside and soggy outside.\n\nNow, for the good about this place. 1) you can get just about anything on your burger and you pick and choose what is on it. 2) you can get just about any type of meat on your burger from kobe to buffalo to ostrich. 3) the burger is tasty if you get them to cook it right.  The sides and drinks deliver.\n\nStill searching, let me know your favorite burger place so I can try."

S'Came expecting great burgers and was disappointed.  I ordered the Angus with peppered bacon and my friend ordered thr Kobe, both supposed to be medium well (a thin line of pink.) When our burgers came out both were overcooked.  Sent the Kobe back, comes back medium with blood all over bun.  I was willing to put up with overcooked angus but the bacon was so tough and it was too dry. Manager comes out with an attitude, and instead of trying to make the situation better makes it completely worse. And the poor server tried her best. Nit recommended at all. Will not be returning here.'

S'This will most likely be the best burger that I will ever eat in my life. For people not familiar with the Burger Bar they let you customize your burger. You can even add lobster into your burger if you want. Basically there is something for everyone here.\n\nThis was actually my second time back and this time I tried the Kobe Beef Patty. I added cheddar jack cheese, jalapeno bacon, jalapenos, fried egg, onions, ( I forgot to add mushrooms =**( )and got a side of buttermilk fried zucchini fries. They have all kind of fries at the burger bar.\n\nI always have a hard time eating slowly and completely enjoying my food but I forced myself to eat slower than usual for this one. All I can say is WOW. My first bite was incredible!! As Homer would say "MMMMMMM MMMMMM BURGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER". The kobe patty was so juicy...truly an explosion of flavor. This is something that I could probably eat everyday during my trips to Vegas.\n\nMy trips to Vegas will never be complete until I make a stop at the Burger Bar. I also recommend going to Fat Tuesday for a monster drink, which is down a couple stores from Burger Bar, after you finish your burger.\n\n5 STARS'

S"Such good burgers.  The other reviewers do not lie.\n\nDon't let the prices on the menu - especially the nickel-and-diming for additional condiments - fool you.  You may pay $20 or more for your burger, but you're getting a burger that's worth more than that.  Your Inner Deliciousness Accountant will balance the books and nod approvingly.\n\nAs if being a quality burger joint weren't enough, they have a surprising selection of craft beers available.  I was not expecting to find Dogfish Head IPA on the menu three time zones out of Delaware.  I went with the Fat Tire Ale, though - highly recommended.  I liked it so much, in fact, I drank six more the next evening, BUT THAT'S A STORY FOR ANOTHER TIME.\n\nAnd in case I haven't made it clear: yes, the $16.00 Kobe Beef burger is worth it.\n\nProtip: tourists, this is a bit of a walk.  Once you get in the front door of Mandalay Bay, you still have to walk through the casino to its attached shopping mall, Mandalay Place, and circle halfway around.  Do not let the Urban Outfitters and LUSH outlets fool you - this is not a mall diner.  This is the velvet rope of burgers."

It was short of being the cream of the crop, but it was better than average.\n\nWhen we sat down to eat, I liked that the waitress was friendly and easy to talk to.  I also liked that they had a small TV embedded into our booth so that we could watch baseball while dining.  \n\nFor my entr\xc3\xa9e, I ordered the Surf and Turf burger, which consisted of an angus beef patty with three jumbo shrimp (although the menu online says it has lobster, but it was actually shrimp when I ate here) and asparagus on top.  It was good, and tasted like they used quality ingredients.  However, it didn't mesh as well as I would have liked.  To complement my burger I substituted a side of onion rings instead of fries, and thought they were pretty good.  \n\nI can't say that I would go out of my way to eat at Burger Bar, but I would definitely eat here again if I am in the area and can find it.  I give it a solid 3 1/2 stars."

S'So here\'s the thing about Burger Bar: you have to believe that a $15-$30 burger can be worth the money.  I know what you\'re thinking: "No f-ing way."  Well, that\'s fine.  I used to be like you: uneducated, unknowing.  Unenlightened.  And then I went, and my eyes were opened to the top of the burger world.\n\nFirst, you gotta choose your meat: you can get Angus, Kobe, hell, even Buffalo and Vegetarian.  Then you choose your toppings, and this is where the fun starts.  You like lobster?  Bam!  Throw it on top of your Kobe burger.  You like shrimp?  Bam!  Throw it on top of your Buffalo burger.  You like lobster AND shrimp?  Bam!  You\'re crazy.  But you can throw both of them on top of your Angus.  They\'ve got different kinds of bacon, different kinds of lettuce, cheese, mushrooms... hell, they even have shaved truffles, which launches your burger into the price stratosphere.  Somehow, everything is cooked so well that it all goes together, even if you\'ve got a Vegetarian burger topped with eggs, asparagus, and applewood bacon.\n\nThen you have sides.  They have a great selection of those, too.  Normal fries, sweet potato fries.... they\'re wonderfully crisp with just enough of the potato matter.  My personal favorite is the fried zucchini; way better than anything you\'ll get at a carnival or random schmuck burger joint.\n\nThe decor is pretty nice; it\'s sort of like a gentrified sports bar.... that occasionally serves $65 burgers with truffles.  But it\'s comfortable, warm and inviting, with tons of wood bars, tables, and booths.  I haven\'t really had a chance to try the beers, as I think I\'m usually too busy stuffing my face.\n\nAnyway, give it a shot.  I never thought a $25 burger could be worth it, but they\'ve made a true believer out of me.'

S"OVERRATED.\n\nCan I just leave the review with that one word?  We visited Burger Bar because it was in the concourse that connected our hotel to the Luxor, so it was convenient.  A friend of mine also spoke very highly of their food, so off we went.\n\nThe menu is much like Kuma's, but the quality of the food is much lower.  Maybe I've been spoiled here in Chicago, but we have a LOT of good burgers and burger restaurants.  Especially ones that make 'signature' or 'specialty' burgers.  That said, nothing at Burger Bar was particularly interesting or novel to me.\n\nThe food was good, don't get me wrong.  It's not like everything tasted gross.  I just think that the reputation of this place is more a myth since this place is just a burger restaurant.  \n\nThe food is (duh) overpriced since this is inside a Vegas casino mall.  The drinks were decent and apparently the booze shakes were excellent.  Order one of those and tell me what you think.  \n\nI'd rather enjoy the buffet at my hotel next time since it's cheaper and offers a larger selection of various foods.  Meh."

S"Holy Kobe, Batman.\n\nThings that are good:\n\n- Yeahhhh, burgers. I know it's become terribly \xc3\xa0 la mode to dress up your beef with all sorts of fancy toppings (burger \xc3\xa0 la mode not being one of them, I should hope, but I'm sure some molecular gastrotard has put a mustard sorbetto on top of ground beef.) Love the menu. Pick a meat (including buffalo, turkey, or veggie. How nice. But seriously. Red meat.) Pick things to put on it. Pick a roll. Pick a temp. Watch your wallet shrink. (Truffles! Foie! Lobster!) Everything was good, save the aioli. A little forward for me; couldn't really taste anything but garlic. The roll was insane.\n\n- Really good beer selection. I picked a bad beer (I'd heard good things about Hitachino Nest but I thought it tasted like sour upper-lip sweat post-workout.) But that doesn't stop me from appreciating the overall collection.\n\n- Our server was nice, speedy, and thorough. About as much as you could ask for.\n\nThings that were off:\n\n- They definitely lean more towards undercooking here, so if you're in doubt, I'd go a notch up as far as doneness is concerned. I'm of the mind that rare = good and foodborne illness = I'll take my chances, so the extremely red and wet nature of my burger wasn't so much of a problem. If you're picky, I'd say go medium.\n\n- Waiter for the section next to ours let out a most vociferous belch while exiting the service station, and while I'm not entirely OPPOSED to a good burp, I'm also a little put off by such public displays of wanton near-regurgitation.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I hope to return."

I burned my mouth in the zucchini fries more than once, even after waiting awhile for them to cool.\n\nRelatives passed a lot of food on our direction.

They have buffalo. They have any kind of burger you can think of, and any way to top the burger you can think of. The appetizers are great too. I usually end up with an appetizer because I\'m not a big burger fan... but other times the server will be very accommodating and make up a vegie sandwich for me. We have always had top notch service at Burger Bar, from the twins and all other servers we may get.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Burger Bar (aside from it being right across the way from Lush where I love to shop) is that you can get a beer paddle with 6 beers.

S"not bad... not bad...\n\nmy boyfriend and i shared a make-yourself burger with australian kobe beef ($17.75) + 2 slabs of foie gras ($13 each) + portabello mushrooms ($1.50?) + truffle sauce ($5.50?). the burger for some reason came out really lukewarm. mmm.. no, not lukewarm. more like cold, as if it had been sitting out for awhile. it was kind of a bummer even though the food itself tasted good. it would have been much better had it been delivered to us freshly cooked. \n\ni loved the skinny fries. they were so crispy and delicious. we ordered a side of truffle mayo to dip with it ($5) and it was REALLY yum. we also ordered pepper jack cheese shots, which are basically mozzarella sticks except with pepper jack and shaped into a ball rather than a stick. those came with some type of buttermilk ranch sauce and were okay, but again would have been better if it had come to us directly from the fryer. \n\ni give this place three stars because located in mandalay bay, it was WAY too far, especially in 110 degree heat, and because that heat didn't translate onto our food.\n\nbut $13 for a piece of foie gras... legit!"

S'We went there at the recommendation of a local friend who loved this place, but we left there just kind of feeling "meh" about the whole experience.\n\nFirst, the good: There were a lot of options for our burgers, in terms of selection of ingredients, toppings, etc.  You can even build your own burger with just about as many things as you could want in or on it, truly making your own masterpiece of a burger.  There are a ton of side options, too, and you can even get a sampler of different types of fries, tater tots and even fried mac & cheese bites.\n\nAnd the dulce de leche martini that I had was to die for.... It was the perfect blend of alcohol and sweetness to me!\n\nThen there\'s the not so good: The place is ridiculously loud to where even with a 3/4 enclosed booth with high walls separating us from patrons at the next table over, we still could barely hear anything through all the music and noise.  \n\nI had the Hubert Keller burger, which as others have reviewed, is over $20.  Yes, I get that this is considered a somewhat "high end" gourmet restaurant, but for 20+ dollars, I expect that burger to sing in my mouth with flavor and texture, and what I got was a very generic burger that tasted overwhelmingly of the carmelized onions and slightly stale ciabatta bread.  \n\nThe other burgers that our friends had were good, but again, no one reported that it was anything spectacular that made it worth the premium we were paying for what was essentially burgers and fries.  \n\nSo in the end, it was a decent food experience, but unless our local friend insists on going, it probably won\'t be on our radar on our next trip to Vegas.'

S'This place is cool! It was our first time on this restaurant, and the waiter suggested to us the buffalo burger. He said its lean and good for you. "Why not?" So that night, we ordered the buffalo burger with ingredients of Monterey Jack, red onion, and potato bun. It was our first time eating a buffalo meat. To me it tasted just like beef but lighter or not heavy in the stomach. The meat was medium done, so it has a little bet blood in the middle. It was very good but gamey.'

S"Didn't think you'd come to Vegas for a burger, did you!?  Well, this ain't a mere burger.  It's a burger with a capital 'B'!\n\nAll three times, I've had some form of addition and subtraction to my basic burger - medium juicy patty and a ton of fresh raw onion.  That to me is probably all I would go for on a normal day... no cheese.  Cheese always seem to overtake the taste of everything else it's added on, for me.  But add an egg cooked over-easy, real bacon and some jalepenos... omfg - I'm having a burgasm!\n\nI always almost have the black angus 'coz I wouldn't get the kobe beef.  \nI just think it's kind of silly that they called it American Kobe beef... Kobe as we all know, is nowhere near America and the ones they serve here are from Idaho... ummm... \n\nBut this is a good place for a cold beer (they really are as cold as beer should be, I'm told), a very very VERY good Burger and a nice ambiance with surprisingly not many rowdy kids considering it's a burger place - maybe they too are too busy  having their mini burgasms to be annoying :)  Again, they might need a new host (she's as stupid as she looks) but everyone else is great.  Still can't get over the twins who work there - they always throw me off :)"

S'Great Burger~\n\nI had the Hubert Keller burger--buffalo with blue cheese, spinach and caramelized onion on ciabatta--is $22 \n\nI am a big fan of Buffalo.  With the blue cheese, spinach and caramelized Onion on Ciabatta bread made this burger a Father\'s Office http://www.yelp.com/biz/fathers-office-los-angeles burger with buffalo.   I LOVE Father\'s office burger and now I love Hubert Keller\'s burger!  I really don\'t know why I like Buffalo burger so much, but I just find them so flavorful and juicy but with texture and not mushy like beef tends to be sometime when it is too juicy.\n\n$22 IS a bit overpriced for a burger.  But attaching a name like Hubert Keller is like buying a $2,000 Prada bag if you love good food lol.\n\nThe restaurant is literally a Burger Bar.  It looks like a kick back sports bar that serves burgers.  There seems to be always a wait to get seated at this restaurant, but if you don\'t mind sitting at the bar, it\'s pretty easy to grab a seat since people who sit at the bar are always on the go.\n\nHubert Keller said on Top Chef masters that he serves $5,000 burgers and they people actually order them... I wonder what\'s in his $5,000 burger!\n\nNext time I come here, I want to try building my own burger :) yummy!!!\n\n*edit*\nI made a mistake, his $5000 burger is served at Fleur de Lys, his other restaurant at Mandalay Bay.\n\n"Created by French chef Hubert Keller, Fleur Burger 5000 Fleur Burger 5000 The Fleur Burger 5000 is a luxury burger served at Fleur de Lys at Las Vegas\' Mandalay Bay. The Fluer Burger 5000 is made from Kobe beef and topped with black truffles, foie gras, and served on a brioche truffle bun with a special truffle sauce. The burger is served with a bottle of 1990 Chateau Petrus in imported Ichendorf Brunello stemware, which they let you keep.\n\nLooking at their menu, some of the appetizers include burgundy escargot with garlic and parmesan gnocchi and smoked salmon raviolis with guacamole. A sample of the entrees include filet mignon with braised oxtail tortellini and slow roasted Alaskan king salmon with a parmesan and herb crust, artichokes, lemon, and capers. The Fleur Burger will set you back $5k, but hey at least they send you a certificate of authenticity and some Italian Ichendorf Brunello stemware."'

S'Honestly, I would pick the 50 cent White Castle burger over the $80 kobe beef burger here anytime.  We heard good reviews on this place and I saw it on the Food Channel so I guess I wanted to see what the hype was about.  So I assumed, ok $80 burger, kobe beef topped with truffle sauce and foie gras...must be sent from heaven right? Wrong.\n\nI was hung over from the night before, so I figured, ok a good burger ought to cure it.  If anything, my gag reflex was triggered even more.  Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE foie gras, I LOVE kobe beef, and I LOVE truffles....but quoting from a friend of mine, "you can combine platinum, silver, and gold together and it\'d probably end up looking like shit."  That basically describes the $80 burger here.  Man and with that amount of money, I could\'ve gotten myself probably 10 White Castle crave cases.  \n\nI didn\'t get a chance to try any of the other burgers.  They do have a wide selection, and one of my friends ordered one of the cheaper burgers and he seemed perfectly fine with it.  So I suggest if you\'re going to go here, stick with a more traditional burger.\n\nAnd I guess the fries were ok...'

Best burger I've had in a long time though!\n\nOh, and there was someone famous at the bar when we were there.  But we were too lame or hungover to know who she was.

I wouldn't recommend Burger Bar if you're solely here for that.\n\nThe nutella sandwich- which is essentially a chunk of nutella squeezed between two donuts and gelatin is a heart attack on a platter.

S"I come here quite often due to the fact I have a bartender that works here and I work a few stores down. I give it 4 stars. Reason why? \n\nAnswer: all the burgers are cooked to the way you want it. Burgers can be customized-there is no limit. THIS IS NOT A FAST FOOD BURGER! so if you're expecting a $2 ... don't enter this establishment. I believe the burgers are priced right especially for the quality. Presentation is great as well. If you are unsure of what to order... ask. Every time I keep coming here, the menu seems to expand. A year ago (or less) they didn't have a desert section...now they do! Staff is very outgoing providing a laid back experience. However, don't always expect the staff to be there for every refill... They may have a habit of socializing amongst each other. (now I'm not sure since there are many new faces) Seating is very cramped especially sitting in the tables that are in the middle of the restaurant. Normally I sit at the bar...

S'Good old Burger Bar. I hadn\'t been here in years until last week when I was trying to kill some time before a concert at the House of Blues. I returned this week after seeing Lion King.\n\nI\'ve become a bit of a craft beer enthusiast recently. I still don\'t know what I\'m talking about, but I do enjoy a good brew. I noticed Ken M included Burger Bar on his "Craft Beer Revolution" list. I never would have thought of Burger Bar for that. I just pictured it as a place for expensive burgers. That\'s changed of course.\n\nOn my two recent visits, I ordered a Salmon Steak sandwich with some sprouts. At $8.50 (plus I think 55c for the sprouts), it\'s one of the cheapest things on the menu but I find it absolutely delicious. I get the salmon cooked medium and it comes out perfectly.\n\nOn the beer front, I went with the Deschutes Inversion IPA on my first visit and the Burger Bar Seasonal on my second. I\'m a big fan of Deschutes anything. The Burger Bar Seasonal is currently a Hefeweizen by Tenaya Creek Brewery. Being a local brewery, I had to give it a try. I really need to make my way up to Tenaya Creek one of these days.\n\nBurger Bar has kind of fallen off my scope in recent years. Now that I know I can get a good salmon sandwich with a great beer to go with it, it\'s back on my radar.'

The beer is always great there are always different selections for you to chose from. I love that you can create your own burger. The meat selection is always fresh mouth watering goodness. Prices are ok, but this is the strip and its high quality beef so its priced at a reasonable amount. Oh and they have little TVs in EVERY BOOTH!! How could you go wrong with that?\n\nI have ordered a few things here, all consistent and great.\nKobe beef burger which was great, came out perfect for med rare. Not too bloody not too well done. I kept it simple with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and NO SAUCE! Onion rings which where amazing and the Number 9 beer went great with this meal.\n\nThe next time I got a USDA organic beef burger. Pretty standard, except I threw on some blue cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce, and no other sauces. A-MAZING!! Not as juicy as the Kobe wagu burger but up to par with what I was expecting. The beer I can not remember since it was a recommendation from my service who got it spot on, it was excellent. I order the Zucchini which by the way with there ranch was sooooo good.  I've never ordered a shake here but they are spouse to be good as well.\n\nGreat burger joint in a very uncrowded little strip of the mall, the walk there is longer from parking but not that bad. Make the trip its worth it and if you do have to wait, there is a lush cosmetics store where you can get face mask, soap and just browse to kill time."

Everyone ordered something different and everyone finished their entire plate. We loved the option to build your own burger, my husband ordered the surf and turf burger and said it was the best burger he has ever had and trust me he has had many. We ordered the fry sampler with onion rings, steak fries and fried zucchini and we enjoyed them all. The best thing about the restaurant was the huge beer selection, my husband loves dogfish head beer and they had a large selection available at the bar for $5 dollars I think until 7 when happy hour ended. \n\nThe server was very attentive and friendly, they seated 8 of us immediately on a Friday night and were patient when we all had questions about the menu. \n\nWe will go back!'

The waitresses seem sometimes like they have too many tables but are friendly.  I've never eaten at the bar here.\n\nPrice- When you're on the strip keep in mind that EVERYTHING is pricey!!!  If you don't like it head off the strip!!!  Actually, relative to other offerings on the strip and considering portion size, this place is actually a good deal (for the strip).  \n\nI live in Vegas and took my Mom here a few days ago so i'll post from her perspective.  \n\nMum- Sliders - Raved about them rest of the day.\n\nBrother - Angus Burger.  He loved it, said it was the best lunch he's had in a long time.\n\nWe shared the Nutella  shake and the sweet potato fries.  We all agreed the shake was the best we've ever had (i'm not a big sweet guy but this was the bomb).\n\nI no longer eat red meat and had the Turkey burger which wasn't bad as well :)\n\nIn summary, don't avoid this place because people say it's over-priced.  It isn't for the strip, and I go out of my way as a local to eat here.  People I bring here think it's great and I have friends in town that have had their birthdays here.\n\nComparing it to fast food or saying fast food is better makes me LOL"

The seasoning on the lab chops is perfect. \n\nThe final stop is the dessert bar. They probably have over 75 different varieties of desserts and fruits.

S"&& I fell for this place :3\n\nEven though they just opened 3 weeks ago, I think they're doing very good in terms of quality, cleanliness and service. BUT THAT LINE WAS HORRIBLE! I don't know if I could or would ever wait 2+ hours for a buffet... so thank goodness a lady came around and told us we could pay $15 extra for the express line. Considering how hungry and excited I was, I thought $15 extra was worth it if I can cut down at least 2 hours of wait time. She said it would take 5 minutes if we go through the express line but the cashiers obviously didn't get the memo and refused to call us up until the people in front of us got frustrated. \n\nOnce all of that was over it was time for the FOOD!! MY FAVORITE PART :3 I absolutely loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeee the lamb chops (best thing there in my opinion). They also have king crab legs and snow crab legs (you can ask them for the steamed ones, taste so much better). The sliders are yummy if you add a bit of salt. The lobster corn chowder was very flavorful and hit the spot. Not sure if they had 500 items there but they sure had enough to make me go 7 rounds... don't judge me, I'm a fatass! OH! They also have some legit fresh honey next to the bread and cheese area. Make sure you walk around the entire place first so you know what you're up against. I never ever want to leave their dessert section...soooooooooooo amazing!! The biggest selection I've ever seen! They have everything from mini cupcakes, gelato, macarons, BANANA souffle!, creme brulee, MAKE YOUR OWN CREPES (my fav because they have fresh fruits and nutella!!!). \n\nI took off 1 star because:\n-They were very unorganized with the line and the seating in general even though there were tables open\n-Some of the dishes were kinda cold\n-The busboys cleaned out our table while we were getting desserts ):\n\nIf you're not a diamond or 7-star member, you'd probably want to dish out another $15 so that you can use that time to actually eat something instead of wait in line. WORTH IT!!"

But what\'s s point of that when they texted us at 630pm, for us to get in line (incomplete party not permitted)...a waste of technology I must say.  Kiosk did its job, but d human who manage it should have some kind of a brain to make it work in our favor. \nNow onto the food,  they looked good, but the line to get food was ridiculously long.  It\'s a buffet for god\'s sake, who wants to stand in line 20-30 to get a piece of prime rib, n to make it to d seafood section that\'s another 20 mins.  By the time u get to ur table, the food would have been cold.  So we had to settled shorter lines which serve food that u would get for $20.  Again, bad management.  They could have done better to make d experience better for us. We paid $55 each...not worth it at all.  Never again.'

I don't know what people were complaining about the sushi for. \n\nThere's really good Asian food, some Mexican food, Italian food, and really good, boiled crab legs. The American meat (turkey, brisket, and others) were too smoky and dry, definitely could've used some work there. But otherwise, good stuff all around. \n\nThe decor, environment, and seating is excellent and puts you in a good mood for the food. \n\nLOL, the people whining about how long the line is. What the hell do you expect, just wake up early before the opening and you get in easy. Otherwise, pay for the express  and just go in. If you're not willing to pay for the express line, I don't see how you afforded to come to Vegas in the first place."

S"First attempt to come here was last Thanksgiving. 3 Hour wait, um no thank you. Finally able to hit up this place in July and I have to say, this place is top two along with the buffet at the M resort. When you have smoked BBQ at a buffet, you had me at hello. Typical new concept Vegas buffet with stations from around the world. The kicker is that the food is actually good and your a not wasting it by taking a bite and throwing away the rest. Granted the 1st time I came here i had the runs 4 hours later (I'm guessing it was the pastrami at greenfield deli NYNY casino). Was hoping it was a fluke so came back a month later and I was a ok. Bacchanal and Studio B buffet, you are the reason I waste my money on food and not gambling."

There are a couple offerings that are high quality ingredients, so when you go, choose wisely and save space for the unique items.  I simply didn't feel there was great value in our visit."

S"I came here this past weekend after reading some great reviews for this place. My brother and his girlfriend were visiting Vegas from Hawaii, so I met them and took them here. We got there around 10:30 am, as breakfast was ending and lunch was starting. For the three of us it was around $63, not too bad.  \n\nIt definitely lived up to its hype! \n\nThey had the standard breakfast fare like eggs, sausage, pancakes, and various juices. These were all pretty good. They also had some more interesting dishes. Of the breakfast foods, they had huevos rancheros, croque madames, corn beef pizza, steak and eggs red velvet pancakes, and chicken and waffles. Unfortunately most of the breakfast foods were not great, except the chicken was delicious.  \n\nHowever, the lunch and Asian foods were really really good - I'm not talking Chinese buffet quality, but much much better. They had dim sum, and not just spring rolls, but soup dumplings (WOW!), sticky rice (good), and har gau (which I don't eat). The noodle station had amazingly flavored ramen. And the Peking duck was some of the best I've ever had.  \n\nThe charcuterie and salads rocked, especially the prosciutto. Who doesn't love prosciutto. The prime rib was also really good and a perfect medium rare for me.  And the sliders were definitely a winner too. \n\nThe desserts were good but not spectacular, but I am rarely wowed by desserts anyway. The macaroons were especially delicous"

Our party has 6 people, they don't allow you to sit until everyone is there. By the time we sit down, it's already 11:15 which is lunch time. They didn't charge us extra though. lunch is more expensive. The food was great, fresh, well prepared, we even saw oyster for about 20 minutes, not sure if they put there by mistake. I like ginseng chicken soup, grill duck, dim sum, Mexican food, cocktail shrimp, dessert. Most of them are very good. But you can only eat there for 2 and half hours. We didn't notice that, until our waiter remind us."

S"Beware physically challenged people! The policy of Caesars Palace is that if you are physically challenged and using a cane, a Walker , or a wheelchair, you will be allowed in by yourself, however if you are with somebody else they will have to pay an additional $20 to go through the handicap line with you. This can be very problematic, especially if you are a diabetic and have to eat at a certain time with medications and insulin. I can see this for presenting a problem in light of the expense of the meal. The additional $20 is ridiculous when you consider the cost of a meal itself . I guess Caesars is going to go broke if they don't charge that extra $20 . I guess most people wouldn't have much sympathy, seeing as \nthis means somebody would jump the line , but in most cases we would only have one additional person with us as a helper .\nI consider this highway robbery, and will not be spending my dollars at Caesars again!\nSure the food is great there, but there is so many other buffets in town of close or equal value and quality that do assist the handicapped that it is not worth they extra money and time."

Also we missed the other half of the buffet half the time since it was hidden around the corner in another room. Of course there was a line but  for the length it went by pretty fast. We did go toward the end of the night. We chowed on everything from crab legs to prime rib (still on the rib,dinosaur size) to sushi and made to order ramen.

My wife and myself went again yesterday and had a repeat experience. Food was not hot at many stations the salads didn't have that artsy style they had before and the ceviche was sour with no real flavor, clams and chorizo  tasted liked over done clams with a can of corn chowder dumped on them . The BBQ server was very rude and when I went to get my meat and then again when I realized the BBQ sauce was not out and I had to ask for some he told me to get in line. My overall experience this time was very poor . I don't think I will be back because for the $160 I paid for 2 people ($30 bucks to skip line) I could go to Wicked Spoon and get better service too."

S'This review is based on my experience of the current visit of the buffet; not the food, since I just did not get a chance to enjoy it.\n\nAnyway, their waiting system is just pain in the a--.  For those of you who are first timer to the buffet, you need to get a ticket from their kiosk instead of waiting in line like other buffet.  Then you need to go back with your ticket with printed time and wait in line again.  Yes, you need to wait in line again.  Plus. for those people who paid for the EXPRESS LINE will seated sooner than who don\'t.\n\nMy wrap up conslusion to Bacchanal Buffet is: \n"Waiting, waiting, and more waiting."\n\nTo Bacchanal Buffet, I suggest you to change your waiting system back to the traditional way.  Plus, get rid of the EXPRESS LINE, so everyone will be treated equally.  First come first serve.'

S"I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday early with my family, my mother really wanted to try the new $17 million dollar Caesars Buffet. We go for lunch and the line was worse than Space Mountain at Disney. We see a sign for a $15 line pass. This by the way is the only dollar amount being marketed in the buffet area. This entire area is a giant fail by the marketing department. There are no prices listed for the buffet. There are no prices listed for the special 24 hour buffet pass. People are getting to the cashier, which at 1pm on a Saturday, there is only one cashier, one cashier - and they are walking away at the ridiculous prices! Caesars, put up marketing materials, tell us how much the buffet costs. I was at wicked spoon and they tell you everything before you stand in line. Tell us the $15 line pass is per person. Tell us that if you come back the next morning, you'll have to pay another $15 to not wait in the line after you've already spent $65 a person plus tax and tip. Well after complaining to the manager, we finally sat down for the buffet. I liked the buffet, the food was tasty. I didn't overeat or go overboard because I was saving my appetite for my birthday dinner. Well, a few hours later, I'm gambling at the Wynn and it hit me. I got really sick to my stomach. I did make it to my bday dinner before I had to leave and spend the rest of my trip and a few min before my flight out in the bathroom. Thanks Caesars Buffet!"

S'Waaaaah.... *heavenly music plays*\n\nTHE HOLY GRAIL OF BUFFETS!\n\nWith so many buffets in Vegas, it\'s hard to pick just one to eat at. My stomach only has space for ONE buffet while I\'m visiting Vegas. Forget that 24 hour buffet pass. You\'ll find me passed out in the middle of the buffet tray if I ever tried doing that. \n\nThe Wicked Spoon used to be my #1 stop, but then I heard Ceasar\'s Palace had the next great thing. I had to check out it out!\n\nAnd then there was the line........... O_O\n\nJust when you thought the line was over, there was another line. The hubby and I waited an hour and a half until we were seated. According to the employees there, that wait time was SHORT. Over two hours is the norm.\n\nThe buffet is normally about $40/person with lunch being cheaper, but because we were there during Thanksgiving, they had a "holiday price" of $55/person. Bah humbug. \n\nOnce we got inside, we were just OVERWHELMED. Sooooo much food. Soooo many people! There was every kind of Asian cuisine, Italian, Mexican, American... eeeeeeverything. \n\nThe most popular (and longest!) line was the line for the king crab legs. You can have them cold or have them warmed up by the staff. They\'ll give you a good amount at a time, but you know one visit just isn\'t enough! I can feel my cholesterol rising... The crab is fresh and tender. Definitely get them warm instead of cold!\n\nThe freshly sliced prime rib is awesome! You can tell them what temperature you want and they\'ll try their best to find the slice closest to it. You can even ask for one of the prime rib bones if you dare to man handle it!\n\nIf you love foie gras, try the foie gras soup! Totally droooolworthy!\n\nDon\'t forget to check out the made-to-order noodle soup station! You can get beef pho, wonton soup or ramen. The ramen was my fave! I thought it was going to taste like some fancy packaged ramen, but it tasted really close to authentic Japanese ramen. The pork was so tender.\n\nWhen it came to dessert, I was suuuuuper stuffed. But I had to try a bite of everything they had to offer. The Jean Phillippe macrons they had were amazing. I kept going for more and more and more. I even slipped some in my bag to take home. SHHH!\n\nBut the most amazing, most fabulous, jaw-dropping dessert they had was their FLAN. Who doesn\'t love flan? It was so creamy, so flavorful, SO FREAKING GOOD! Even though I was beyoooond full, I ate more than two of them. Not too sweet. Just the right soft, yet slightly dense, texture. I could eat it all day long!\n\nThis is definitely a top contender for buffets. I didn\'t think they could surpass The Wicked Spoon, but they did and then some! Definitely worth checking out! Just bring a snack with you while you\'re waiting in the two hour line to get in. The price and wait time almost makes it not worth it, but if you only have money/time for one buffet, make it this one!!'

For that price I can eat at a very nice gastro pub. But got to admit, this place is good. The selection is good & the food is higher end than what you would expect for a buffet. They try to cover all the most popular cuisines in their selections & they do it well. Very impressed with the spread & how good each tastes.'

S"I went to this buffet on Saturday 10/20/2012 and started to wait in line at like 6pm. It was a 130 minute wait from the end of the line to the cashier and then another 30 minute wait after paying the cashier to be seated. 170 minutes total! It was good that I wasn't hungry until like 8pm and I had my Ipad there with me so I was able to watch a movie so that wait wasn't that bad for me. \n\nI highly suggest going when you are not hungry so that when you finally get seated, you will get hungry. Also I highly suggest bringing a laptop or an ipad so you can watch your movie while you are waiting to pass the time.\n\nUnfortunately on the day I went, they ran out of the stone crab claws and watermelon juice. Their souffle were horrible and by far the worse souffle I've had, but the rest food were good and this place is probably the best buffet in Vegas. I will probably go again, but I will be in line at around 4pm so that I can only wait for 1 hr instead of 2 hrs or greater."

S"I have to say Bacchanal has to be the top of class in the LV buffet crowd.  We were skeptical whether its lofty prices will be worth it but after our first visit we were sold. \n\nIt's not like Bacchanal has fancier food, or even more selection (at some point what's the difference between 450 items and 500 items).  The quality of the food is just better - better prep, better flavor.  Everything (almost ) just tasted soooo good.  Literally every station - seafood, Chinese, Mexican, charcuterie and cheeses, dessert was so good.  But the best was the carving station.  The prime rib was simply one of the best I've ever tasted.  The brisket and ribs were so smokey and tender. \n\nI will say though that the Caesar's website says 'king crab legs' are served.  Even the photo shows 'king crab legs'.  However, what you'll find are 'snow crab legs' and for those of you with discriminating tastes for seafood you know the difference . . and it's a big difference.\n\nBut, for supreme buffet grub I can overlook this and still rate Bacchanal 5 stars.  Now I can't wait to see who can dethrone this mighty king of buffets."

S"I used to think Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan was the best buffet in Vegas until I came here. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with a few friends and the line was so long that the wait was at 2 hours. Instead we opted to pay the express fee of $15 on top of the $50+ price tag for this buffet and we were seated immediately. The dining area is humongous and I believe seats well over 700. The decor is very upscale. I really felt we were dining in one of the fanciest places in town.\n\nI thought Wicked Spoon had a giant selection, but this place has a lot more. Its broken up into sections depending on the type of cuisine. There's seafood, chinese, japanese, mexican, american, salad, dessert. I was able to get a plate from every section and sample almost all the food, but was limited by my stomach capacity unfortunately. \n\nThe quality/taste of the food was a lot better than the average buffet but of course not as exceptional as a sit down and order type restaurant. In my opinion the must try's are definitely the macarons, made to order ramen noodle soup, prime rib, salmon, HORCHATA, the sushi rolls....actually just try everything. The presentation of the food also was impressive. There's only so much I can describe with words though so I must say go and try for yourself and be amazed!"

S"Bacchanal Buffet has dethroned the Wicked Spoon Buffet as my favorite buffet in Vegas. I'd still go to Wicked Spoon when given the opportunity, but I'd say Bacchanal is superior in essentially every aspect.\n\nMore variety of foods, better selections, and better tasting food. \n\nWith the popularity that Bacchanal has gained, they now have a ticketing system that works very similar to that of the Fast Pass at Disneyland. You get in line to input information into a call-back system. They print out a receipt and text you when your turn is up. This, I'm assuming, helps with their line so that people don't crowd the Bacchanal area. Also, if the wait is 2 hours long, you can go to the Forum shops, go blow some money on the tables, then come back.\n\nAfter you get back, you get in line to pay, then get in line to be seated. With so many lines and checkpoints, I guess this added call-back system is necessary.\n\nOne thing that annoyed me was that we came here for the Champagne Brunch and were forced to pay the higher price, even though my wife and I don't drink. But alas, we fell victim to this.\n\nThey had a raw bar, meat carver, street tacos area, stews and soups, Italian, and an Asian section. Some highlights were the prime rib, the seasoned steamed shrimp [if you didn't want it cold], the wonderful cheese selection, the Kalbi, and the awesome and amazing sweet potato tater tot balls. Oh My Amazeballs - those were awesome.\n\nEverything else was just us pigging out and eating in absolute gluttony and excess. \n\nWhat was very disappointing was the dessert bar. I've read review after review of how great the desserts were and how extensive their selection is. Sure, there is quite a variety and a great selection... but everything was underwhelming and quite a disappointment. The Bacchanal dessert bar is like Floyd Mayweather - rich and flashy, but surprisingly disappointing when you realize he can't even read a book. The flan was dense and thick when it looked beautiful and light. The black sesame gelato had no flavor. The cakes and cookies, while looking exquisite and beautiful, were .. again.. disappointing. \n\nSo yeah.. for the price you pay, you certainly get a great variety and, as with the Wicked Spoon, or any other buffet, there are plenty of hits and misses. Bacchanal sure had its share of hits, but the dessert bar is a complete miss."

The one downside is if your group is 8 or more they charge the standard 18% but $71.00 for a buffet meal is a little much don't you think? A lot of the dishes come on little individual plates, bowls our even lil baskets for the fried foods. Better quality than a regular buffet for sure. Go early to avoid long lines snag make sure you have plenty of rom in your stomach to get your moneys worth."

My boyfriend came back with a slider (my favorite food in the world) and I was like, "Where did you get that?" --He said, "You didn\'t turn the corner, did you?" No, no I did not. \n\nBut when I did, there\'s cheeses, breads, italian food, asian food, FRESH SUSHI!!, and a DIY ramen station. OMG this place. \n\nI would definitely come back.

S"We decided we wanted to celebrate our 8th anniversary and the well-known and most expensive buffet in Vegas. That is just how we roll!\n\nWe came in the Monday before Thanksgiving to beat the crowd. My theory is to stay away from expensive and usually well-known places on holidays because the quality might not be as good as it would on another weekend. So, it was the perfect time for us to try this place for the first time.\n\nPros:\noyster (I ate 3 dozens by myself!)\nprime rib (nicely seasoned...still thinking about it. Must eat it hot or warm)\nlamb chops (must eat warm or else it will taste gamey and chewy)\nsausage (not sure what it was made of, but it was sweet, moist and delicious)\nkabasa (sp?) (always yummy fatty sausage)\nwarm crab legs (in the Italian area...sweet and yummy goodness)\nlobster chowder (just enough amount of creaminess)\noyster shooters (I just ate the oyster in the shot to avoid taking up precious space in my tummy)\nhorchata and all other frescas (DELICIOUS!)\ndessert ( try everything!)\n\n\nCons:\nBrisket (you can either get a fat on one end and lean meat on the other hand..it needs to be marbled. Therefore, it made it taste dry.)\nskirt steak (well-done..I am a med-rare kinda gal)\nPeach green tea (it was bland and not as sweet as I would like it)\n\n\nI took a tour of the place: I\n\nIn the Asian area  few pieces of bbq pork and some eggplants. BBQ pork was pretty good but the eggplants were greasy. They were serving up pho, ramen, noodle soup, too. I didn't try any of it.\n\nIn the Mexican area, I had an order of carne asada..that was pretty good meat if you're in to a little fat and tendon going on.\n\nItalian food looks like a bunch of pasta or bread...don't waste your stomach on that when you are at the buffet.\n\nSalad area was small for a reason...and a good reason, too. =)\n\nSo was it worth $50? I told my friends that it is worth if you plan to hang out for 3 hours or more. If you have to be some where at a certain time, your standing in line to pay to get in or food will eat up all of your time. We were there for 4 hours and my husband had to drag me out ( plus it was already 10pm) so take your time and enjoy the food and the company.\n\nWe would definitely come back again!"

Ribs were actually really good and tender. \n\nThe mexican food stand was really salty too. the carne asada so so salty. I tried to eat the taco but threw it away bc it was so salty. \n\nThe italian food was also very salty. sausage was almost inedible bc it's so salty.\n\n Get the trend here?\n\nChinese food was also very salty. Their cheese selection is only has 5 cheeses available. seriously? \n\nTheir dessert is actually pretty good. Nice selection. It's a bit better than Wicked Spoon for dessert.

The lines tend to be long unless you're a Diamond or 7 Star member. Good thing about the price is that mimosas and champagne is included for brunch. \n\nThe service is on and off.

S"For $50, this buffet is a must. Going in as a vegetarian I did not expect much but was happily surprised at the selection there was to offer.\n\nSome of my favorites were the frittata, congee with thousand year old duck and pickles, mushroom risotto, guacamole, waffles, mac and cheese, saut\xc3\xa9ed noodles, roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, couscous, and dolmas just to name a few.\n\nDon't forget the dessert island separate from the salty items.\n\nWill be back!"

S"I am not a buffet kind of person but this place was worth the effort. \n\nSidenote: I didn't like the long wait or the price. We waited 2 hours and due to the holiday weekend the prices were ridiculous. We had bought the 24 hour buffet pass (which was also hiked up because of the holiday) but to get in to this buffet it was an additional $25 for dinner. \n\nI enjoyed the modern design of the place - it made you feel like you weren't at a buffet and the food was exceptional. Personally, seafood is the only thing that makes buffets worth going to and they had a great spread. Steamed or on ice, they had crab legs already conveniently cut open for you, oysters, oyster shooters, shrimp, seafood pasta, sashimi, etc. Amazing.\n\nStaff was very helpful too. \n\nFor dessert, I had some of the macarons (green ones were the best) and the mango chile lime sorbet (sooo good)."

S"Overpriced low quality food.  For months I heard my friends tell me to go to The Bacchanel. I went there tonight and to be honest it didn't meet my expectations.  The Asian and Italian sections were simplistic. The Chinese food lacked flavor and it seemed I was eating food from any other China Express or food court restaurant.  The Japanese sushi rolls were not fresh and you could see it was low quality fish/crab. The Italian pizzas and pastas were nothing special. As far as the meats, the sausage was ok, but the lamb was so bad I spit it out (I wasn't the only one).  I did not try the American section as I was already dissapointed. I would definately not recommend you to stop by. I think you can eat much better food for the $126 I spend for two."

S'One of the Worst Buffets I\'ve ever been to!  I\'ve had better quality cuts at the Sizzler!\n\nService = Atrocious.  \n\nWe arrive with 10 people.  The hostess tells us that any group larger than 6 is an automatic 18% gratuity.  This is perfectly fine and is the standard for every restaurant I\'ve dined at.  Servers should be tipped fairly; however, the restaurant MUST accommodate the large group by seating them together.  Otherwise it is two separate parties!  They seat 10 of us at two separate tables after charging the 18% gratuity.  We ask why this happens, and they send a manager to tell us that standard policy is to charge 18% for large parties.  But how can you separate the large group, yet still charge as a whole??  The manager explains that they can\'t properly accommodate seating 10 people together because of the limitations of the seating.  We\'re not going to argue over this.  It\'s absurd.\n\nThe layout of the buffet is awful.  They force you to walk down a circular maze of tiny corridors, which forces the customer to look at each item and deny it, without the possibility of getting an overview of where everything is.  You want seafood?  You can\'t just go to it.  You have to wait in this absurdly long line till everyone else at the buffet is finished getting all of  their portions.  This means that you end up waiting nearly 10-15 minutes if you wanted to get something at the end of the line (seafood), even if you didn\'t want anything from the beginning of the line!  "Why not just cut in line," you ask!  Doing this would be asking for trouble because of the layout of the buffet.  It would literally be like cutting in front of someone who is waiting to get their food.  As upset as I was for attending this place, in no way would I take it out on other paying customers.  \n\nThe waitress made several errors on our drinks and kept laughing it off.  It was completely unprofessional.  Mistakes happen, and no one expects perfection.  But to screw up orders on several occasions and laugh it off is out of line.  The server actually stepped on my feet while reaching all the way over the table to fill someone\'s cup of soda.  Why not walk over to the other side and pour their drink?\n\n\nQuality of Food = POOR\n\nIt is obvious that the food has been left out for hours.  They boast and brag about 500 items on the menu, but the meats are not quality cuts.  Furthermore, they are prepared poorly.  I\'ve had better quality at Commerce Casino in Compton!  \n\n\nGarbage Service \nGarbage Food Quality\nPoor Management\n\nSTAY AWAY!'

S"We went to this new buffet for the first time on a Thurs night in Feb '13.... Having read all the hype and reviews both good and ba we were braced for whatever we might find. The first thing we did was purchase the Buffet of Buffet passes for $49.99 plus a $25.00 upcharge then agreed to eat our next 4 meals buffet style..thus each meal costing $18.75... for us a savings of about $60.00 each.  This took the sting out of this $50.00 buffet particulary! \n\nFirst off the wait on this Thurs night was only about 40 minutes in a line that moved quickly.  Once in, the restauraunt is beautiful and surprisingly calm for how many are dining there. We were very graciously greeted and introduced to the buffet. The decor and music were fantastic. \n\nAll food stations were well stocked and looking good. Given the high cost of the meal I focused on King Crab, Jumbo Shrimp, Ribeye and Brisket. All were fantastic though the Ribeye was tough IMO. The green peach ice tea is beyond delicious.. Desserts were breathtaking and fun to sample several...the maccaroons were awesome!\n\nService was basically pretty good though dishes could have been cleared alittle quicker.\n\nI do have to mention the cook who I asked about where to find the watermelon/feta salads I was so looking forward to...she apologised and said they would not be available that night then immediately offered to make one special for me...I was stunned! They are not that easy to make, and I told her that wasn't necessary...she kindly insisted...I was SO IMPRESSED ! That really blew me away..She is pictured in the photos I have submitted...\n\nWe go to Vegas frequently and would recommend the all should try this terrific buffet!\n\nIf this restaurant and Nobu are signs of the kind of quality the Caesar's properties are stepping up to that would be fantastic because overall their properties are starting to age and need this kind of major infusion to keep us coming back...we were impressed!"

S'Update.....price is now $44 for dinner. OMG I don\'t get these reviews at all. I live in LV so I admit that I resist buffets but we had visitors in town so we had this at the top of our list. First of all, we get in line and a pleasant employee tells us the line is 90 minutes at our point but we can each buy a $15 fast pass so we can zip into the vip line. Well, we decided to decline that generous offer and lo and behold.....the 90 minute line was actually 40 minutes. Just a ploy to get you to part with more money. When we did get in, there were multiple empty tables that stayed empty the entire time we dined. Seems like they just want to build excitement and keep the buffet line long so they can sell some more of those "fast passes". \n\nThe buffet stations were ill kept and congested. There were a few small plate standouts, but the bbq station had one guy trying to carve for too many folks. The server NEVER brought us refills and our plates stacked up around us. It appeared that they did not have enough bus help or servers on the floor. I hate it when I am surrounded by dirty dishes. It certainly did not live up to the reputation many have expressed here. Really LOUD too!\n\nKing crab was the worst quality I have EVER eaten. What a joke! Desserts were beautiful, but after a bite of several, I left them on my plate. UGH! Lousy quality for such lovely looking plates. The diabetic dessert consisted of three choices. I am only grateful that we tried this before we wasted a ton of money bringing our family members here during the holiday.\n\nLike I said, I don\'t care for buffets, but if I were to consider any, I would go to the "M" resort with way better service, food & ambiance and even free wine and beer with the buffet. Please don\'t buy all the hype. We all thought it was one overpriced slop shop.'

S"On my third trip to Vegas, I went with my Partner In Dining. He's the one who chose this spot to eat. \n\nEveryone always raves about Wicked Spoon. Well, move over because the Bacchanal just took the wicked out of your spoon.\n\nThe best time to go is 30 minutes before lunch ends. That way, you get the lunch price and still get the dinner food. That's what I learned on my trip following this one.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was all the fresh juices! Guava, watermelon, mango, tamarind, horchata, orange, and jamaica. WOW did that keep me hydrated. But, be careful because they you'll get full.\n\nThe Bacchanal has the following sections:\nSeafood: Oysters, crabs, shrimps, clams, and some other hot food items\nBBQ Meats with all the Southern side fixin's\nTacos, made to order with every kind of salsa you could imaging\nCold Meats & Cheeses + honey comb\nItalian pasta/pizza\n(if you want your crab legs boiled, they can do it here just ask!)\nSalads\nAsian/Noodles/Sushi/Dim Sum\nDesserts/Ice Cream/Sorbet\n\nSeriously, pace yourself so you can eat everything.\n\nLunch is around $35 a person, and dinner is closer to $55.\n\nDefinitely worth it to eat here after a night out on the strip and your alcohol soaked liver is crying for help.\n\nIt's well air conditioned so bring a light sweater/jacket so you can eat comfortably.\n\nUntil next time, don't forget your ID!"

S"This buffet is simply amazing! I've been here twice and have not been disappointed. They have so much high quality food to choose from. I suggest starting from the back and work your way towards the front. Make sure to try their crab legs & ask for them to be steamed. \n\nMy little tip for going to for dinner without paying the dinner price is to go just a little bit before 3pm (when their lunch ends & dinner starts) and pay the lunch price. It might be a little early, but just don't eat a big lunch before you go. :) \n\nAnd don't skip the dessert! They've got a giant selection of dessert to choose from."

S'Delicious but expensive. Fresh squeezed juices if you go for brunch. They also have some of the freshest oysters and crab but many dishes are super salty. The prime rib has salt rubbed all over the outside.  You will not be able to eat the outer portion. Their leg of lambs or "lamb lollipops" as their butcher calls it are delicious and well-seasoned. Even my dog thought so. :)\n\nWhat really sets Bacchanal apart though is the wide selection of asian cuisine. Pho was actually very good. Much better than some restaurants out there. Some of the sushi is fresh but if that\'s all you\'re looking for go to Goyemon which is off the strip.\n\nPistachio macaroons and mochi ice cream are the best deserts. Maybe because I get to eat them very rarely.'

S"First off, the price is RIDICULOUS! It is probably the most expensive buffet on the strip. Being an avid Wicked Spooner, I felt guilty for trying Bacchanal because I didn't want to fall in love with the place but, I FAILED. I did fall in love with it.\n\nMy boyfriend & I visited around late lunch time on a Tuesday. No crowd (yet) which was good. You walk in & it's seriously an array of food heaven. Fresh juice, oysters, all your favorite carved meats, Asian cuisine, etc. \n\nWe personally loved eating the fresh oysters (they run out fast, so get em quick), duck, sweet potato tots, sushi cone rolls, fresh watermelon juice, peach green tea & definitely the desserts. Had some meringue, crepes with nutella, thai tea ice cream & french toast ice cream.\n\nYou have to come extremely hungry so you can get your money's worth! I've heard people also come in around 3PM-ish so you can get both lunch and dinner entrees, since they don't kick you out. Overall it was a great foodventure, expensive, but great nonetheless."

S'Overall not impressed for the price. We even got in for the lunch price as they were switching to dinner selections. Don\'t get me wrong it\'s a really nice buffet. But it\'s a buffet. Very disappointed at the very few "small plate" presentations found during our visit. Vast majority of the food is served in the more traditional communal  "trough of food" style from which you spoon out your portion. The hype I had read led me to believe the majority of the food was prepared nearly to order and that\'s simply not my experience. For the price I was much more impressed with Wicked Spoon. Had their brunch price of $27, granted no crab legs for brunch but still liked their presentation and their dessert selection better.'

S"I love this buffet; the husband and I went twice just to cover the amount of food they serve. It's simply astronomical in terms of variety, quantity, and freshness.\n\nWe went for a Thursday morning-lunch meal, and also for Friday dinner. Make sure you walk around and strategize on what you are going to consume, because you will miss things if you don't, and end up going back again... or end up going back again because you love it.\n\nSteak and eggs? Sure. Fresh smoked slab bacon, brisket, and ribs? Of course. Italian pasta dishes? Why not? Dim sum, sushi, sashimi salads? Bring it on. Stir fry, Mediterranean spreads, bread selection, sliders, sides, fried chicken, tamales, carne asada? king crab legs on dinner Fridays? YES PLEASE.\n\nSo there's no hours posted anywhere online on when they switch from breakfast to lunch and then dinner, so here they are:\n\nWeekdays\n11:00am lunch starts\n3:00pm dinner starts\n\nThere's a humongous line you can beat if you go at odd hours... people have reported 1.5 hour wait times, we got in waiting a measly 40 minutes when we got there at 2:20pm, and about 20-25 mins when we got there at 10:40am.\n\nBeats any other buffet on the strip, hands down.\n\nI forgot the peking duck. And the lamb chops. Oh and the rib eye. And the pizza. Oh and the salad bar. Dessert too!!! cheesecake, brownie, and mousse lollipops, artfully crafted wedges of pecan and apple pie, cheesecake, choc chip cookies still hot in their own ramekins, chocolate creme brulee, and fresh crepes... cupcakes, chocolate covered strawberries, gelato section, AHH!!"

S"We were not expecting to make it here because we have heard of the ridiculous wait. However, we came on a weekday for lunch and were seated right away. First impression was the place is huge. We were going to be seated at a corner somewhere but we asked for a closer table near the pools of the hotel. There are many options here. The Asian area has good dim sum and the best BBQ pork my husband has ever tried. The sushi was meh. The rice was too chewy but the fish was fresh. They have a nice area with different cheese and cold meats. The prosciutto and manchego cheese were my favorite. Next to this they also have baby mozzarella and cherry tomatoes with basil.  Look hard because you might miss them but you don't want to miss them. Their pasta area looked OK.  I only tried a seafood pasta dish served in a small dish pan and it was very tasty. As far as American food we tried the prime rib which was very well seasoned and melt in your mouth good, and the mac and cheese which had a Southern taste to it. The sliders were very good as well. I also had the paella and it was very scrumptious. They had a pork belly with lentils in a small bowl near the Mexican food area. It tasted like the Asian BBQ pork I mentioned before. The only Mexican dish I tried was the Chilaquiles. The sauce was bad. I can make better Chilaquiles from a can. True story. They have a juice section. The guava and hibiscus were my favorite. The dessert section, my favorite section, was generously stocked. If you don't like star anise don't try their 5-spice Chinese chocolate cake,  yuk! Everything else was divine. Their gelato a little on the watery sude but very tasty. The coconut flan was good and so was the creme brulee.\n\nOur tummies were happy here. We spent 2 hrs trying different foods and slowly enjoying them. Food is coming constantly so nothing tastes old."

S'I am not a buffet person, thought I\'d get that out of the way. In 2013 I tried the brunch @ Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan and my mind was changed dramatically. My friends said that Bacchanal was the best in Vegas. Since my mind was more open, I figure?...lets do it! First of all...don\'t come here hungry. We rolled up, put our name down and printed out a ticket that said when we should come back and that we\'d receive a text to confirm that as well. With the terrible reception in the casino/shopping area, we received that text a lot later than expected. We were in line forever...waiting and waiting...that we missed the cutoff time for lunch. We were the transition time between lunch and dinner and unfortunately had to pay the DINNER price...and since it was the weekend before Christmas, we paid the HOLIDAY pricing which was about $62 with taxes. AHhhh....i better eat my ass off. But that\'s why I hate buffets, I\'m not prepared to eat more than I actually am capable of.  We complained about the pricing, but they couldn\'t do anything about it.\n\nOnce you get through the paying line, you have to fall in OTHER lines. I\'m over the lines and waiting by this point.\n\nFinally... we\'re in, seated right next to the desserts. I left a note for the waiter that said "4 Waters please"....haha...sorry, I had to go eat something. We pigged out at the American/Carving Station area...picked up french fries, fresh juice, prime rib, ribs, brisket, mac n cheese...it was endless. AHh don\'t forget the pork belly. Most of this was absolutely delicious...ended up being worth the wait, KIND OF. I walked even further down the buffet, they have Chinese Food, Italian, Seafood, whoa. After that first plate, I was dying. \n\nWhen I landed dessert, I had an amazing fresh nutella crepe and some french macarons (people crowded like vultures once it was put out). So I just hate the pricing and the wait, but the food is actually good here. I don\'t suggest coming here in large groups, you\'ll just be waiting even longer, just saying.'

Every time I went it was for Sunday champagne buffet and they always had a nourishing soup available, whether it was ox tail, black chicken, ginseng chicken, or whatever, but it was soooo fulfilling after being hungover.  \n\nAside from that, the seafood station is pretty standard yet good quality.  There's never a shortage of shrimp and crab and as I recall, I've seen oysters served at a certain point in time - just goes to show how they really rotate different items in and you can never really have the same thing each time you go back.  \n\nOverall, great variety, and good quality for the price.  I don't even need to go anywhere else knowing that I can count on Bacchanal to deliver a fine buffet meal with never ending champagne.

I came here during two different times, once during the transition time (2PM) and the second time was during dinner. The transition time is best value time because they are transitioning from lunch to dinner, but you pay the lunch price. Lunch is $35 while dinner is $50. I was hoping that the dinner menu was going to be completely different, but it wasn't. \n\nIm not going to list everything i tasted there, but i will say that they offer a vast selections of cuisines from east to west parts of the globe. I was surprise that their dim sum was enjoyable (not the best) but great to there. The desserts were also a treat! The apple cobbler and expresso gelato being my favorite. \n\nThis has been my best buffet experience yet. If you pay $35 during the transition hours - its the best value in vegas.

There was a total reward discount, so we went off to get a card. They do have a new check in system where you enter your information, and they will text you within the time. We were told we would be seated within 2 hours and 30 min. After an hour they texted us, and we were to wait in line for about another 40 min. So, I guess the text is the estimated total wait time. \n\nThe Sunday Brunch came with unlimited mimisas, and we both never tried it. So, we were like why not. The lines for seafood and meat were super long! There was a lobster benedict that tasted amazing! There was a cheese pizza with mushrooms and I believe it was riccota chese that was amazing! I also tried the lamb chops that were pretty tasty. Their Asian station was awesome! The pork shumai and everything tasted amazing.\n\nIn order reviews, they had a souffle station, but when I went there, I only saw a crepe station and a shaved ice station at the dessert station. \n\nNow, why the three stars. The wait time for everything was horrendous. After waiting in that long line, we would still have to wait in long lines and wait. Plus, it was super expensive. It was good, but expensive!'

S"An explosion of live cooking stations (including a fresh Ramen station, yes!), a huge variety of great food you don't see at other buffets, a relaxed atmosphere that almost feels like you're eating in your living room (if your living room happens to be enormous)... Caesars set out to redefine the game with their new, $10 million Bacchanal Buffet, and they pulled it off. This is the best buffet in Las Vegas.\n\nMy friend and I were seated near the Asian food, and we loaded up our first plates with Dim Sum style Chinese specialties, Ramen, and Sushi. I moved on next to the Mexican section, which featured absolutely excellent and perfectly moist Carnitas. The Pizza was great as well, with excellent and diverse toppings that you wouldn't normally expect. Even the cheese and meat board were a cut above the rest. Sliced Prime meats and Oysters were fresh and delicious as well. Fresh squeezed Orange and Carrot Juices served in individual carafes was yet another nice touch.\n\nThe dessert section kept the goodness going, with fresh Ice Creams served in Chocolate dipped cones and a Crepe station. The whole experience was incredibly impressive, and $21 for breakfast was completely reasonable.\n\nI'd read a bunch of hype before I visited The Bacchanal Buffet, but Caesars delivered and then some. I will be back as soon as I can. Best buffet in Las Vegas!"

S"I'll be honest. This was my FAVORITE buffet up until this past weekend. We got ready EXTRA early and got there at 10AM to our early check-in receipt from the machine. Our ticket said: APPROXIMATE CHECK IN TIME WILL BE 11:05AM and that we'd get a text a few minutes before... We never got a text and when we went up to the line, they made us stand in line ANYWAY. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THEM HAVING THAT DUMB MACHINE THERE IF WE HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE?? THEY SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS saying EVEN IF YOU HAVE THIS TICKET YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.  Our group was trying to be understanding and saying well it IS Christmas and they're extremely busy. THAT wasn't the part that pissed us off. We waited over 2 hours IN LINE (NOT counting the 1 hour we spent near by waiting for our TEXT that we never GOT) and when we got to the front of the line, we stopped moving up for over 30 minutes because they started letting this OTHER line ahead of us. I guess these people were the 7-star guests, or guests that paid extra. WHY WOULDNT YOU JUST DO A SEPARATE ENTRANCE FOR THESE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF SHOVING THEM IN FRONT OF US WHILE WE STAND THERE WATCHING THIS HAPPEN?? IS THAT YOUR WAY OF ADVERTISING - IF YOU WANT TO GET IN, THEN PAY EXTRA PER PERSON? ALSO there were some guests that started complaining and screaming so THEY were ALSO shoved in front of us. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT... PATIENT guests like US get punished and stuck in line, while SCREAMING guests get put in front of the line... WHAT AN AWESOME management system  you got there. We got so fed up and left to eat at Spago - which turned out to be better.  EVEN THOUGH this WAS my favorite buffet EVER, I probably won't go back since they have the worst management/customer service ever. I just felt bad because I was the only one that has been to this buffet out of our group and the whole trip, I hyped this place up SO much til we got there. In the end, my family never got to try this place and everyone left angry."

S'Bacchanal Buffet, the highly touted buffet in Las Vegas I coveted. Family and friends have indulged. It was my turn =)\n\nNo wait time! Wednesday at 6pm. YES!!\n\nI was seated immediately and my drink order placed. It was time to indulge. \n\nI scoped out each station, taking mental notes of what looked good. \nI decided on the seafood station for my first plate. \nMy second plate was from the carving station (BBQ & Prime Rib this evening)\nMy third plate was from the cheese & cured meat station. \nLast but not the least, Dessert. \n\nMy food rating of each dish:\nGREAT DISHES\n*Lamb Chops - tender, perfectly cooked medium rare, yum!! Get the mint jelly too. \n*Shrimp Cocktail - Big pieces of shrimp. Not over cooked like most shrimp cocktails, perfect. \n*Goat cheese with fig - wow, wow, WOW!\n*Mushroom & Truffle Soup - this was decadent, creamy with that earthy richness, Yum!!\n\nGOOD DISHES\n*Oyster Shooter - the oyster was just okay, but the liquid it came in was delicious. Cucumber juice?\n*Brisket - I asked for the fatty part, yum!  Melds in you mouth goodness. I didn\'t see any BBQ sauce though. \n*Polenta - the only thing I got from the Italian station. \n*Wagyu Slider - delicious. It would have been better with mayo. (Which I found after I ate it)\n*Mango Pudding - the coconut jelly made this dish good!!\n*Coconut Calamansi Dacqoise - I don\'t know what a "Dacqoise" is, but it was like a macaron to me. Lol. \n*Beignet - great with coffee, just too sweet. \n\nOKAY DISHES\n*Raw Oyster - it would have been better if it was sucked better. The oyster was still attached to the shell and a lot of shell bits in the oyster itself. \n*Prime Rib - the medium rare parts were good, other parts were very chewy. \n*Creme Br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e - not too sweet, yum. \n*Goat cheese with basil - good flavor!!\n\nBAD DISHES\n*BBQ Pork Spare Ribs - too salty & not tender. \n*Jonah Crab Claws - even though they were pre cracked, it was still hard to eat. The crab meat was stuck to the shell. Over cooked. \n*Mint Gelato - first gelato I asked for was pistachio, I got "Mint" instead. Since I ask for 3 other flavors, by the time I got to my table, the mint had started to melt and ruined the other 3. Oh, I don\'t like mint ice cream / gelato. \n\nInfo: The plates are HOT. Super hot. Be careful. If you want cold plates, get them from the salad station. \n\nService was good. \n\nSuggestions: it was hard to get some of the dishes. For example the soups. The clearance between the pot and the shelves on top of it was too low. It was hard not to spill the soup because the ladle was hitting the shelving. \n\nThe flow of some of the food station was also a bit off for me.\n\nI didn\'t get anything from the Chinese & Mexican stations, I was too full. Lol. \n\nThe food here was good, I definitely indulged, okay, over indulged. Lol. \n\nSolid 4 Stars. \nTry it for yourself and decide.'

S"FALSE Advertisement. SoO Disappointed. NO Stone Crabs. My friends came all the way from New York & we came here to eat because of the Stone Crabs. When we called to make sure they're serving it they said YES. When we got there after an 1 or so of waiting on line. The host seating us said to ask for the Stone Crabs it's in the back. She also said we can customize what we wanted to eat if they have the ingredients to make it. \n\nGot in, didn't see the Stone Crabs on display & asked the chefs from behind they said NO they don't have. Asked do you not have it for today only? He said they don't serve it. ?? Confused and upset now. When I called & asked, everyone said they have it & serve it. Asked the chef he said NO & there was none on the buffet line. SIGH\n\nWent to the sushi area asked the sushi chef if he can make me a salmon, tuna, avocado with crab meat roll. He said NO. whatever is on the buffet line display. I told him thought you guys can customize stuff if you have the ingredients. He just said NO again and went back making whatever he was making. Annoyed & upset again.\n\nWhile waiting on line saw these dessert on the screen display and when I got to the dessert area most the stuff on the screen display outside was not there. FALSE Advertisement. HUGE LET DOWN. Also they say there is over 500+ items there was not that many unless your counting all the damn hot sauces & toppings. sigh.\n\nAlso they ran out of cr\xc3\xa8me br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, waited a very long time, walked in circles too see when there going to get more & finally saw they had a cart there just sitting there. I told the dessert chef that it's behind her & can she just make it now cuz I only wanted one. I was waiting for about 10 mins for it. She said NO it not there yet, they're bring up from the restaurant. I pointed to the cart & she said it's the other side's cart & not her area. BULL Sh%t. Cause 5 mins later she walked over to get the cr\xc3\xa8me br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e tray at the same cart I was telling her. Made me even more annoyed.\n\nThe line to get in was long like always & inside was only about half full. Our waiter was on top of his game but when he went on break. The waitress was kind of slow. It took us about 15 mins to find her & asked to refill our drinks. But she apologized because 1 of the kitchen was a hot mess & she needed to go to a much further one. When our regular waiter came back our glasses was always full. Then bus boys came out & started to get the dishes off our table.\n\nThe Food Overall was OK nothing that I will remember & crave for it.  But the oysters are small which I like but I didn't like the fact that they didn't clean it so good. A lot of them had sand/ dirt in them. I was scared that I can chip a tooth or something.\n\nDesserts should always be the best part but it wasn't."

S"FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT A TYPICAL BUFFET EXPERIENCE.\n\nLike other reviews, If you're looking to save money do the following: Get in line around 2PM, hopefully you'll pay before 3PM. Why? 3PM is when the dinner entrees come out. Go before 3PM, pay the lunch price and eat all the glorious dinner offerings.\n\nMe and my gf went on a Monday before Thanksgiving and only waited in line for about 20 mins and the line moved quickly. We actually got seated around 2.20PM. This place is beautiful, and not just for a buffet. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought we walked into an upscale restaurant at Caesars or the Venetian. The light accent lighting is gorgeous and is just minimally decorated but enough to make you feel like you're eating in luxury.\n\nThe service was also very top notch. Our drinks were refilled frequently and dishes were taken up fast as well. When we went, I personally had: Sushi (selection was actually slim.. just your typical rolls like philly, salmon, California, etc. and there was no sashimi), duck, sauteed crabs, cha siu (chinese style roast pork), Ramen, selection of fine cheeses, assorted deli meats, Mussels, oysters, crab legs (steamed and cold), crawfish, flank steak,  lamb chops, risotto, Dim Sum, Smoked Salmon, P/D cold shrimp, and some fresh fruit drinks: peach mango, horchata, iced teas, etc. All the food was delicious, cooked perfectly and was served at the correct temperature.\n\nThe only things I didn't really enjoy were the crawfish, mussels (my gf loved them), crab soup shooters and the crab legs, unfortunately. The crab was a hit or miss both when it was cold and steamed.\n\nThey also had Pho, Udon Noodles, Pasta, Mediterranean food, Pizza, American food (wings, sliders, fries, tots, etc), create your own taco station. The only things they didn't have that I was expecting: lobster, rib eye steak, grilling station, and Kobe beef. \n\nP.S.- they ask you only stay for about 2 hours but we we're there for almost 3... You gotta try this place!!!"

S"Came here on a Thursday evening for dinner a few months ago. There was  NO LINE which was a super plus. The food was definitely good quality, but I just wasn't that impressed. I actually enjoyed the lunch buffet at Wicked Spoon better and it was half the price. I expected to find a variety of things I wouldn't see at other buffets seeing as this is the largest but to me the selection wasn't particularly wowing. For the record I don't eat seafood so that portion of the buffet was lost on me and it seems to be what everyone raves about. \n\nCustomer service wise our waiter was fantastic. Didn't rush us, made great conversation, was ultra attentive and it really helped make the experience. I'm glad I got to try this place once and was even happier I didn't even have to wait in line for it, but I don't think I'll ever come back unless someone else is paying. And even than I'll probably try to convince them to go to Wicked Spoon."

S'Exceptional variety across 9 stations including  seafood, american, mexican, italian, medittaranian, asian and desserts.  The seafood was my favorite with an excellent variety of offerings all cooked very well.  The meats at Americana were good, but the Mexican food was forgettable. Sushi was ok, but having eaten at Sushi Roku the night before it was anticlimactic to say the least.  Desserts were beautiful to behold but average to the taste. Bar is extra so for $50 either come hungry or go home.  Not a bad experience, but not one I will likely repeat.'

S"Although an upgrade from the last Caesars buffet, a few turn-offs gave this buffet 3.5 stars:  Some of the hits included the surprisingly fresh tasting choices - the prime rib was perfectly cut and seasoned and the steamed crab leg option was a nice touch.  Some of the misses didn't have anything to do with the food really, but the layout.  \n\nBecause the prime rib and seafood stations are inherrently the most popular, it was very difficult to navigate through to the supporting cast of the super stars.  If you wanted a classic side dish of mac n' cheese or mashed potatoes, you had to wait in the prime rib line or dare to cut someone off.  The lines to the buffet also spilled into the main walkway where incoming guests were feeding through; it made the space feel a bit busy and crowded.  \n\nI know it's new, but I think it was a bit too cramped for my taste.  I think Wicked Spoon trumps Bacchanal - a great 2nd choice once the buzz dies down."

S"Hands down the best buffet I've ever been to. Food was terrific. Fresh and oh so good. Honestly, you'd have to go probably 3 times to truly sample all of the cuisines they have represented here. I've been once and didn't even try the Mexican or Italian (save for one meatball which was fantastic) and barely touched the deserts.\n\nIt's the seafood and meat station that were the crowd faves, as the lines would show.  \nVegetarians, you might want to turn away for a minute...Crab legs, oysters on the half, big succulent shrimp, lamb chops, prime rib, gourmet sausages, brisket, chicken. Gastropub orgasms each and every one.\n\nThe small plate idea is great, keeps it more intimate, unlike the food troughs of the old days. Speaking of plate, here's the one downside in my opinion: The dinner plates are tucked away in a cutout area below the serving stations....bad idea!! You have to reach between peoples legs to get a plate...or wait patiently while the line recedes enough to get one unobstructed, but you might be there for a while waiting. Just seems like a bad design.\nIt is new and yes it's busy. Expect to wait for entrance. \nOther than that, muy benito! That's very good for my gringo friends. Cheers"

S'This review is based mostly on the price vs other Vegas buffets.  Bacchanal charges a lot more than any of the other buffets in Vegas.  I went for a weekday lunch and the price was $33, ouch!!  This is compared to $25 at the Wynn.  I really like the Wynn a lot, so I was expecting a lot more at this place.  Unfortunately, nothing excited me at this buffet.  Maybe it was just a bad day for them, but pretty much everything was underwhelming that day.  A lot of the food did not get refilled in a timely manner and a lot of the signs were not in front of the food, so you did not know what some things were.\n\nIn terms of the food, I guess I got used to the Wynn, Wicked Spoon and the Bellagio.  Most of the food here was cheapie food, not that there is anything wrong with that, as I love cheapie food.  Its just when I go to one of these buffets, I expect to try high end dishes I do not usually eat on a regular basis.  They had street tacos, bbq meats, chinese food and noodles like pho, udon and ramen.  I would much rather get these types of foods in hole in the wall restaurants and they are much better at those places.  The food overall was ok, but if you are going to charge the highest price for a buffet on the strip, I think the food should be much better than just ok.'

I thought Cosmo's buffet was good, but I think I've found myself another winner. \n\nThe line wasn't too long when we arrived at 11:15am but it was pretty long when we left around 1pm.  The selection of the food is actually pretty overwhelming and I didn't even get a chance to hit up the seafood bar b/c I was too busy trying to get in on all the other areas. \n\nI think it was $45 for the brunch on a Sunday which includes endless mimosas.  That alone is $12 a glass so you're really getting your money's worth.   We had some Total Rewards points to redeem (they expire every six months) so that took our price down to $30-$32.  I must say the food is very well worth the $45 though.  I would definitely go back again.\n\nI don't know much more to say other than it was an excellent experience and I would visit again!"

Cold crab legs were well stocked.  Hot crab legs tasted good. Prime rib was good. Very dry looking chow mien and chow fun was bland. So basically ignore their crappy Asian selections. Burger sliders dry and over cooked. Mexican corn on the cob on point. Liked their mushroom risotto. "Fresh" Fruit is sour. Dessert is good. Liked the mango pudding and Nutella coffee ice cream. Lava cake dry. Flan was ok. Horchata watery. Pineapple juice good. Reviewed while I was eating.  6:50pm departure and a good amount of people in line.

I still have dreams about those crab legs (get them steamed, and they're already cut in half for you). The first time i had the rib-eye steak i was in heaven, perfectly cooked and juicy. The second time however it seemed like it was hardly cooked at all, i get that most people like medium rare but I'm more of a medium guy, so to each their own. The sushi was rather disappointing, not enough selection and not tasty. Overall I thought everything I tried was good, if maybe a little over hyped."

S"Eclectic selection. Crowded room. Overwhelming experience.\n\nAmbience: 7\nFood Quality: 8\nSelection: 8\nService: 5\n\nI'm the type to try a little of everything.  Buffets are my forte, but when I entered the bright and light entry way of this buffet, I was sure I was in for a challenge.  You're greeted with the seafood section to your left followed by the meats (line gets pretty long past 6), then the Mexican section (with a bar dedicated towards sauces).  You think that's it, but turn the corner left and you're greeted with the Italian and Asian cuisines.  \n\nFavorite dish was the sea bass, crisp glaze on the top and entirely soft and melty once you bite in.  The meats (veal, lamb chops, prime rib, ribeye, etc.) were amazing as well: juicy and warm.  Seafood was great, though the jumbo prawns were tasteless and the oysters didn't quite have that fresh sea taste found at other places in Vegas.  Asian food was there, though nothing exciting (as it was placed at the back portion of the restaurant).  Quality was a bit lacking at that point (kung pao, sukiyaki, and beef were a bit salty and dim sum was a bit hard (perhaps from standing too long out on the trays)).  They did have sushi, though (maguro, salmon, ebi, and 3 or 4 other rolls), which were generally fresh (these were the hottest items gone from the Asian section).  My weakness is definitely fried food, and in this regard, Bacchanal delivered.  Fried chicken, fried sweet potatoes, fried calamari...all crisp and juicy, especially with the right sauces.  \n\nUnfortunately, by the time dessert rolled around, my stomach was at the brink of explosion, so...I ended up getting the flan, which was average.  I started the dinner with a chocolate macaroon, which I believe was transferred from the bakery across the buffet, and it was awesome (all-you-can eat macaroons, yum yum).  The desserts island is definitely one of the main selling points for Bacchanal. \n\nService could have been better.  Their busy, I understand, but it seemed like no one really enjoyed their jobs.  Plates were taken about 2-3 minutes after you finished, so pretty fast.  But ordering new drinks and such took a little longer (6-10 minutes).  \n\nAdvice: If you're looking for great quality food and you're with a party that can't make up their mind (and you have a little extra money to spend), by all means, Bacchanal is the place for you.  But if you're stomach is small and you like to be a little more discrete with your tastes, this place might not be worth the money (at $45.00 per person for Thursday dinner). Desserts are the bomb, however. If you're comparing with Cosmo's buffet, Wicked Spoon has a smaller selection but packs a certain edge that gives more flavor to the food there.  But Bacchanal still serves quite a feast.\n\nLong live Caesar."

S"Great experience here. My boyfriend and I came to this buffet on the last day of our little Vegas trip. A lady named Valerie was at the register, she was a pleasure. She was very sweet, talking to us and asking us questions - making us feel very welcomed. The host who seated us was also very welcoming. \n\nThe food was great. There were an overwhelming amount of options but everything we tried was good. Don't skip out on the taco station, it was really good. The cooks will make you fresh tacos right there and then you add whichever salsas/toppings are preferred. We didn't save room for dessert, so I can't comment on that. But all the savory food was great. \n\nThe buffet entrance is right next to the entrance for the pool so we stumbled out there after our meal and took a little food-coma nap by the pools. Totally recommended."

S"The buffet at Caesar Palace is kind of mediocre. I have heard raving reviews about the newly remodeled buffet and decided to try it out.\n\nCame here on Monday for their lunch buffet. The cost was 35.99 plus tax, which is typical of Vegas buffets. The selection of food was okay, but most of the food was lukewarm or dried out which is strange when the place was packed.  \n\nThe layout of the buffet was also strange as it snakes around and people just stay near the front where the seafood and meats are. The lines for the meats and tacos were long and people blocked the food near there so the baked potatoes and other foods near the area were untouched.  \nThe prime rib and brisket were overly salty but compared to everything else, it was decent.\nThe seafood was also decent and but the selection wasn't that great.\n\nOur server was also never around so there was always a lack of drinks. \n\nOverall. It was mediocre at best. Expectations were not met"

S'OK, it\'s time to get out your fanciest pair of fat-pants. We have ourselves a buffet here, folks. And not just any buffet--it\'s a Vegas-style buffet!\n\nBack story: I was on a mission and meticulously planned out this meal. I came during the tail end of lunch so I could pay the lunch price but grub out on the dinner dishes. Yes, I\'m so Asian. But 2:30pm was also the latest my stomach could last before the intense pangs of hunger kept me from functioning normally. I wanted to milk the most out of this buffet (I\'m forking over nearly $40, yo!). I even went on an intense hike before my meal with only a Clif Bar to hold me over. I\'m not joking when I say meticulous. \n\nBacchanal is heralded as the best buffet in Sin City. Although I haven\'t visited any other buffets in LV, I won\'t really have any reason to if Bacchanal is the best...especially since the food here was simply average. There were a few highlights but even on a VERY empty stomach, I wasn\'t impressed. I\'ll give them credit though, the selection is extensive and quite diverse. However, nothing was so amazing that I would return. \n\nLike most things in Vegas, Bacchanal Buffet is a spectacle. From the chic venue to the paparazzi-esque photographers snapping a photo of you before you enter the buffet (because clearly you will look and feel like crap after the buffet), everything is over-the-top and grand. That\'s not bad but it can be exhausting. \n\nThis buffet provides huge variety:\nSeafood - raw oysters, mussels, shrimp, king crabs, clams, fish, seafood paella \nMeats - BBQ ribs, briskets, lamb chops, chicken, sausages\nAsian stations - sushi rolls, nigiri, dim sum, Chinese stir fries, BBQ pork, noodle soups (own station with "fresh" won ton mein, udon, etc.)\nLatin station - didn\'t check it out but there were plenty of chips, salsa, tacos, (did try the aguas fresca and they were super sweet)\nDesserts - cookies, macarons, ice cream/sorbet, flan, churros, cakes, brownies, candies, chocolate-covered strawberries, ice cream mochi (black sesame and green tea), and made-to-order crepes\nMiscellaneous - sliders, Parmesan fries, sweet potato tots, pizzas, pastas, chicken & waffles\n\nNot to mention you have your standard salad and fruit stations. Sweet Jesus (or is it Caesar since this buffet is located in Caesars Palace?). It is so overwhelming. The only items that stood out were the lamb chops, unagi nigiri, green tea creme brulee, and churros. And these were enjoyed with an asterisk; the lamb chops were savory but 40% of it was purely fat. The unagi nigiri was surprisingly tasty but it had a huge roll of rice underneath. I liked the freshly made crepes (you choose the toppings and sauce) but that\'s just waaaaay too much, even to share. I was excited about the mochi ice cream but these were not handmade. I saw the staff unwrapping and dumping them out of plastic containers. Oh wait, I lied. I did enjoy the red bean ice cream!\n\nAt the end, your money does go a long way in terms of the food offered. Although, it\'s just a lot of mediocre food and not the highest quality. \n\nP.S. I overdid it with my meticulous planning and didn\'t account for the delayed fullness. I went for three rounds of dessert when I should have thrown in the towel after the first one. I literally have never been so stuffed in my life and I eat A TON. I was 88.6% sure I was going to throw up at my table. Thank God (Caesars?) I didn\'t. Be forewarned, buffets can turn you into greedy monsters. Don\'t overestimate your stomach capacity!'

S'cant believe i waited three hours for this buffet when i started lining up at 520pm. \n\nit is super annoying that they dont tell people to just leave.  there were people that were at least 2 hours away from being seated when i was seated at 830p and the buffet closes at 10. \n\neverything was standard compared to the wynn, which is slightly cheaper.  the only big difference in my book were the freshly shucked oysters which were very fresh.  but i will never wait in line for 3 hrs for this place again.'

The wait today was supposedly one hour at noon but it was only a 20 minute wait for a group of 6.  What was worthy of filling up the tummy? Udon (add whatever you want that you can find ex. onions), prime rib, boiled crab legs, green tea brulee and bread pudding.  Don't get me wrong, everything was good quality!

From what I can tell they have crab legs, mussels, shrimp, oysters, ceviche, etc. \n\nThen you get to the fried potato, bbq type sides and meat station. All sorts of meats from ribs to sausages to chicken. I choose the truffle tots, waffle fries and mac and cheese from this section. (I'm the enjoy a few bites of basic food type.)\n\nThen you have at least 5 kinds of bread and 4 types of soup.\n\nThen you get to the mexican station, one of my favorites. You can make your own tacos here, or any other sort of mexican creation between the rice, beans, different meats, sauces and toppings they offer. Nachos made with waffle fries anybody?\n\nThen you go around the corner to the second part of the buffet. Here you have some pastas to choose from, made to order omelet bar or boiled crab legs (depending on the type of day), and pizza. \n\nThen you have the charcuterie section, followed by the cheese section.\n\nTo finish it off comes the asian food section which includes more foods than I could identify. You have your noodles, sushi, some sort of soup making station, pork buns, fried rice, meat dishes and then some. \n\nFor the cherry on top, make your way to the dessert buffet island in the middle of the floor. There you can stuff your own made to order fresh crepe, order some gelato or pick your favorite small bites of dessert. \n\nI cannot wait to go back!!! Best part is the new waiting system. You check-in and can then go on your merry way around the casino. The computer system will text you letting you know when it is time to head back to the buffet to be seated. Sure you'll still wait around 15 minutes or so but that's better than an hour or two!"

S'People said Bacchanal is the best buffet in Vegas. Compared with the wicked spoon in Cosmopolitan, the buffet at Wynn, I decided to rank Bacchanal as the number ONE on my buffet list in Vegas. Why? The variety is definitely the top reason. No matter western or eastern, people from around the world can find the food they are familiar with. This place wow me by offering their guests abundant fresh seafood such as oyster and mussel. My dad enjoyed the T-bone steak very very much and even had two of them. I especially like their fruit crepe which is made immediately in front of me. I recommend this buffet for people who can not decide which buffet to go in this sin city!'

S"On Thursday of last week I decided to try out Caesar's Palace's dinner buffet. It was the most expensive meal that I've ever treated myself to, but I can honestly say that it was worth it. The experience went a little something like this:\n\nMy friend and I entered the line that wove in a maze of black ropes and carpet with intricate detailing. Already famished from a full day of walking, we waited in line for about an hour until we got to pay the $48 per person tab. Once we entered we were greeted with cream linen furniture, classy stained glass room separators, and sassy glass adorned light fixtures, brimming with people. Then came the stations. Mexican, Japanese, Southern, Chinese, American, Italian, Thai, Seafood... it was overwhelming. We started with 8 plates and then another round of 'real food' before we took a second break and headed for dessert. Tiramisu, cookies, mochi, gelato, red velvet cake, carrot cake, molten lava cake, pizookies, custard, fresh berries, brownies, chocolate-dipped strawberries, apple pie, bread pudding, and those are only the items we managed to take advantage of. All this 5-star food in one place- available for consumption? A recipe for a full heart and stomach. And the indigestion to follow was the only detraction from 5 star rating, even though it's partially my fault."

S"It was probably the night we went but it wasn't as amazing as I expected it to be from the reviews.  \n\nThanks to the reviews, we listened to the tips about Monday night at 5pm with no wait.  We had a baby with us so lines don't go well.  By about 6pm, we saw a huge line formed already.  \n\nThere is a huge variety but more isn't always better.  The meat section is definitely the largest I've seen but everything I had there seemed over salted and dry.  They said it was because of a southern style of cooking, which really isn't an excuse in my opinion.  I've had better buffet prime rib at Paris and the World Carnival one in Rio.  Never had ribeye, ribs, or brisket at another buffet but they were dry and tough when we were there.  \n\nInteresting variety that they have here are: pho (I only got it to try it, its okay), horchata (which i enjoyed), dim sum area.  Don't need to bother with the dim sum area.  Probably because we were early and the things were sitting out longer but the steam got all their items soggy.  \n\nDeep fried things were good: calamari, yam tots, waffle fries, but a little salty.  \n\nI mostly enjoyed their desserts.  Mochi ice cream is good but they do run out periodically and have to wait for more.  Their creme brulee I felt was good but too deep.  It was a wrong proportion of the top sugar crust to the rest, which I've had better at the Paris buffet.  Macaroons were good as well.  \n\nOverall, it's good but not sure if it's worth the $46 we paid.  Good service, good variety, but not necessarily the best tasting in one place."

The selection of food was amazing and the non-standards were surprising highlights. We expected (and got) a great selection of seafood with a raw bar loaded with crab, oysters, jumbo shrimp (already peeled) and mussels but the ceviche, spicy crawfish and seafood gaspachio topped it off nicely. We expected lamb chops and prime rib but not the Mexican pozole, taco station and the chile verde which were all excellent. Pastas looked great but I really enjoyed the Peking duck, kalbi and  spicy fish and real chinese broccoli in the beef and broccoli was a treat. The kids enjoyed the dim sum, fried rice and the pizza. Don't forget to leave room for  the deserts: from creme brulee to mochi and a crepe station plus sorbets and cookies. Wow!

You can indulge yourself in the mountain of crab legs they offer. (Be sure you give the shrimp some love too!)\n\n-Not feeling crabby? Their carving station offers a variety of perfectly cooked meats from prime rib to brisket. \n\n-Maybe you're looking to travel around the world?

It's a good thing that these things are mini because there is SO much you want to eat at this buffet.  Everything was delicious!  For my main meal, I tried the chicken and waffles, prime rib, vodka pasta, fresh pastries, mini cheeseburger, potato au gratin, mac n cheese, tomato basil soup and mini caesar salad.  Now on to the best part: DESSERT!  They have a crepe station with home-made whip cream and fresh fruits AND a gelato station with lots of different flavors to choose from AND a mini cake station with several different cakes with the greatest presentation.

As per usual, I came about 15 minutes before the dinner switch over (no line on a weekday afternoon), and got to try the best of both worlds at lunch pricing.  \n\nHighlights:  The brisket, goodness, was the best brisket I have ever had.  I have yet to visit Austin, so I reserve the right to retract this, but it was the perfect combination of tenderness, smoke and seasoning.  Pad thai was also really delicious, and incredibly spicy, which I like.  Other fantastic offerings include wagyu beef sliders, peking duck, sweet potato and truffle tater tots, and rack of lamb.  In fact, a combination of all of the above would probably make my last meal if I face the electric chair.  The desserts were quite varied, from made-to-order ice cream sandwiches, cake pops, green tea creme brulee, crepes, shaved ice and every cake-y dessert imaginable, although I'm not sure anything was super memorable.\n\nAll in all, absolutely the best buffet I've tried in Vegas.  For comparison, I went to Bellagio's weekend dinner the following afternoon and it didn't hold a candle.  I make the cross-country flight to Vegas almost annually, and the chance to relive Bacchanal is one of the few things that entice me to keep the streak going."

S'Wow!  This was my first trip to Vegas and my first meal in Vegas.  I had never eaten at a $50 buffet before and at first thought, "$50 FOR A BUFFET"!?  Once we were seated, I took some time to walk around the different stations before choosing my meal.  I couldn\'t believe the selection and everything looked so delicious.  I had a little taste of a lot of foods.  My favorite were the crab legs and shrimp.  I also tried meats from the carving station, sushi, a potato dish, tacos, spring rolls, fresh juices, and several desserts and gelato.  I\'m sure I had more, but I just can\'t remember it all.  There are so many places to eat in Vegas, and hitting this place when we first got here was probably the best thing to do.  After a few days in Vegas and eating out everyday, I don\'t think I would have wanted to eat so much anymore.  I will definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas to have my first meal.'

S"Best buffet in Vegas.  It's what other buffets want to be when they grow up.\n\nI went on a Saturday around 11 AM.  It was $44.31 with tax, so it's pricey.  But, well worth it.  I have been to all of the major buffets in town (save the M Resort), and this is the best.  There are the standard ethnic stations, but the carving area was massive.  Fantastic meats off the bone and artisan sausages.  The chicken jalapeno was the winner here.  Service was very attentive as well, which is an issue at a lot of buffets.  Our tea and water glasses never were close to empty, and plates were removed very promptly.  \n\nIf any area is lacking, it's the desserts.  This area was standard and not nearly as overwhelming as the main stations.  But, the bacon balsamic sorbet was a definite repeat.\n\nThe best dish I have eaten at ANY buffet was the truffled scalloped potatoes.  I would gladly pay $25 for this dish at a steakhouse.  It was very thinly sliced potatoes and an excellent sauce, combined with excellent truffle flavor.  Had a nice crunchy top.  And, you get your own small portion, something a few buffets here are doing now.  It's a good trend.\n\nThe line went very quickly too, and that's an issue with a lot of places in town.  It was well organized and the employees were smart and courteous.  Definite repeat."

S'I\'ll start off by saying that I am not a buffet person, so for me to give this place 5 stars is a big deal.  However, my husband and father both are, so on a recent trip to Las Vegas/Caesars with both of them, it was inevitable that we\'d try the buffet.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The first thing that caught my eye was the shellfish station.  I enjoyed jumbo shelled prawns with cocktail sauce, fresh smoked salmon rosettes & shot glasses of gazpacho topped with fresh crab meat.  My husband and father also raved about the oysters on the half shell, oyster shooters and both hot & cold crab legs.  The seafood was very impressive!  My next stop was the sushi area.  There were about 6 different types of rolls and a few nigiri sushi selections as well.  Being gluten free, I was very pleased to find that they also had Tamari available (though I did have to ask for it).  The final part of my meal was the salad bar, which included several different types of greens & quite an assortment of other veggies, beans & other toppings.  I especially liked the individual diced fruit salad served in mason jars and tossed with fresh mint.  Such a nice touch & presentation!  My husband and father also enjoyed the carving stations, mexican items, asian items...pretty much everything!  They both said the buffet offered some of the best beef they have ever had.  Unfortunately for me, the dessert "island" did not offer gluten free items besides sorbet, so I had to refrain from indulging.  The items offered looked wonderful though...fresh crepes, chocolate souffl\xc3\xa9s, cookies, pies, cakes, gelato and much, much more.  I did break down and try a chocolate macaroni though, which was delicious!  The service was fast and attentive and we enjoyed chatting with our food servers.  \n\nWe also tried the Rio buffet while on this trip and the quality of Caesar\'s compared to Rio was immeasurable.  I would not hesitate to recommend the buffet at Caesar\'s!'

S'There sure is a lot to like at Bacchanal.  The hot sweet potato puffs in individual baskets, lamb chops, smoked brisket, corn and lobster bisque, Kobe beef sliders, and shrimp with grits were among my favorites, not to mention the exceptional dessert selection that topped off  a (ahem) bacchanalian feast, straining the elastic waist on the pants I thoughtfully donned for the occasion.\n\nThere was so much more that I didn\'t get to try.  Who in their right mind could partake of all 500+ items and still live to write about it?  I\'m not normally a huge eater, so this selection boggled my mind.  \n\nI didn\'t like some of the things I tried, such as the Chile Verde, which I normally love; here it was too spicy, the pork was way too fatty, and the sauce tasted bitter.  There was a Mexican concoction that one of our friends was eating, but when I went to get some for myself, it had been replaced by something else.  Oh well, I think I managed to stuff my face pretty well without it.\n\nI\'m not crazy about the cold stainless steel ambience, which to me is completely devoid of charm.  I also was impatient with the long line at the seafood section, which was held up by the people waiting for their crab legs to be steamed.  By the time I realized I could cut the line to take the couple of shrimp I was waiting to get, I had already eaten too many of the sweet potato puffs from the basket I grabbed at the beginning of the line.\n\nOur waiter was the most attentive and helpful of any buffet we\'ve ever eaten at, as was the hostess, who explained the setup and told us about the "other" side of the buffet, which we easily could have missed, since we were seated near the desserts.\n\nI can\'t say this is my favorite buffet in Vegas, but it definitely is worth the price of admission, especially if you have a big appetite.'

S"So here's what happened:\nMy family and I came on Christmas Day and had to wait 4 hours. FOUR FREAKING HOURS?!?!?!??! Are you kidding me?!?!??! But you know what? It'll be okay right? After this is SUPPOSED to be the best buffet in vegas. So we waited, got seated, and went to go ransack this joint. \nFood was okay, nothing stood out, except maybe the pho.\n\nNow onto the desserts. THIS is where it gets disappointing. \nSo one of the much anticipated options with this buffet is the fact that you can get made to order souffl\xc3\xa9s, right? The employees DENIED that. WHAT?!!??? I don't even want to talk about this anymore...And then, they ran out of chocolate strawberries, and said they wouldn't make any more. WHY?!?!! I also tried the thai tea gelato and mochi ice cream. Thai tea gelato was flavorless and I've had better mochi ice cream from my local grocery store.\n\nOverall this place is NOT worth coming to. GO TO WICKED SPOON"

S"$51.99 for lunch on Christmas Eve. \n\nI normally dislike buffets but this one was probably the best one I've tried. There is just so much variety. I didn't even have enough stomach room to try everything. My family and I decided we would all get something different and take bites of each item just so we would have room to try everything... nope, that did not happen. We missed out a lot of pastries and other items. Also, we went crazy with the warm king crab legs... mmm... so good. \n\nWe arrived at 10:55 and sat down at 11:35 which wasn't bad. Because of the holidays, we only had 2 hours to eat but whatever, I don't think obesity was on my Christmas wish list anyway. \n\nWould I come here again? No. Bacchanal is ridiculously expensive. It was worth to try it once considering it is a new buffet and was recommended by a few friends. If I had it twice, then I would agree with some reviewers--overrated."

It made every other buffet seem inferior.\n\nService was good.  We had to pay the Memorial Day Weekend rate ($55pp), but it was well worth it.\n\nIn the wise words of a college friend - when you come to this place you need to do the following\n\n1. Eat the good stuff\n2. Keep Eating\n3. Can you move? If yes, then keep getting food. If not, then stop and wait. Breathing exercises\n4. Eat whatever it took to get you stuffed all over again.\n5. Sleep.\n6. You won't be hungry for the rest of the day.\n\n\nThis buffet is everything that is great about America and everything that's wrong with it too.\n\nPurely amazing.

S"Before going to Vegas, this buffet was recommended by so many of my friends. After looking at hundreds of reviews on Yelp,  I was convinced I needed to try this place out. \n\nThey have this high tech way of putting your name on the list, but given all the hype, the wait was still insane!! 204 minute wait, according to my ticket! \n\nMy family was hungry so we opted for the express line (extra $20/ per person). Seriously , if you have the money and don't want to wait, it's the way to go.\n\nAnyways, the food was very underwhelming. There was nothing at this buffet that stood out to me. They had a bunch of stations you could grab food at, but everything was just ehh.\n\nI was very disappointed and will not be coming back here. \n\nTry it if you must, but beware of long lines, outside and inside the buffet, not so great food, and a hole in your wallet from the cost."

S"I rate this as one of my top 5 buffets here in Las Vegas! I was truly amazed on the presentation of the buffet. The this was an international gourmet buffet that pretty much completed all the common international foods such as Asian, Mexican, American, and Italian.\n\nI must warn you you will wait for about 2 hours in the regular line and i believe lunch during the time I went it was $50 a person.\n\nLuckily my high roller friend was a seven star player we didn't have to wait that long in line and we got seated right away.\n\nIf your looking for a quiet ambiance, forget it! you will be stressed out with all the loud noise and all the Asians from outta this country pushing and shoving.. ( I am guilty as well and played the i'm a foreign Asian card).\n\nThe food selection was endless with over hundreds of items to choose from. You can even get fresh juice in those milk magnolia bottles which impressed me but i guess im dorky like that!\n\nOne of my favorites was the roasted pig they had. I do not know any buffets in town that has roasted pig.\n\nI also enjoyed the presentation of the french fries and their kobe burgers. I love how this buffet is smart with portion control with their buffets but still we have a bunch of people pushing and shoving like a gang of hungry wolf packs!\n\nOverall i enjoyed eating at Bacchanal. Love the artistic decorations and the food presentation the most. I would highly recommend checking it off your bucket list."

And everything is top notch. \n\nSashimi was amazingly seasoned, I think I ate about $35 worth of sashimi alone so I was totally satisfied. The other seafood was fresh. \n\nDesserts! Went with 3 other girls we got probably 1 of each dessert and split them all so we wouldn't be wasteful. It was a giddy 30 mins just eating desserts. \n\nI would go there alone for the sushi or the dessert, or the amazing grill selection.

S'Three stars is mostly because there was nothing "wrong" with the buffet, per se.  I don\'t have a lot of experience at Vegas buffets, but I was told the price had been bumped up the weekend we were there ($61 per person, ouch).  I have been to the buffet at the Rio hotel, which felt larger and I thought had better quality food.\n\nI did enjoy the food here, though the selection did seem more limited.  There was a decent variety of types of food, but in each individual type there didn\'t seem to be an expansive number of options.  Also the food was really hit or meh, no big misses come to mind but a lot of stuff that didn\'t seem up to snuff for the price we paid.\n\nBy the way, do you like seafood?  You do?  Good, because after waiting 90 minutes to get inside and seated, there was another 20 minute wait to get through the seafood station.  I understand people like their All-You-Can-Eat crab legs, but that borders on ridiculous.\n\nThis is one of my shorter reviews because I really have little to say about it.

S'FINALLY, Caesars is getting its act together! It has always been my #1 favorite hotel in Vegas, but the truth was it was getting pretty dumpy...and basically coasting on its legendary name. Thankfully, hotel brass is now on a mission to make Caesars a 5-star resort, which includes revamping customer service, renovating rooms, and replacing the SAD, nasty-ass old buffet with this fabulous masterpiece!\n\nThe name hearkens back to Caesars\' old Bacchanal restaurant, the legendary scene of many a debauched meal partaken by fat plutocrats reclined on pillows, Wine Goddesses pouring the finest booze down their gullets. This being 2012, they toned down the excess just a TAD...so no more pillows, and no more Wine Goddesses...but in every other respect, this place is a true bacchanal! All that\'s missing is a vomitorium -- for now, you\'ll have to make do with discreetly puking into the potted plants.\n\nYou\'ll most definitely want to puke when visiting this buffet -- there\'s SO MUCH EXCELLENT FOOD, there\'s no way you can try everything without doing so. The chefs behind the Bacchanal visited every single buffet in Vegas (EVERY SINGLE ONE...even the crappy Arizona Charlie\'s ones, LOL) to suss out the competition...and then they proceeded to design a buffet that kicks every other buffet in town\'s ass -- hands down!! Even the vaunted M Resort Buffet!!! \n\nFirst off, beer and wine are included with dinner -- and whatever wine they pour is pretty damn good, so drink up! The selection of food is GREAT -- a fantastic sushi/sashimi spread, dim sum, tons of Asian salads and oddities. Plenty of glistening roasted animals hanging on hooks, waiting to be sliced up and gobbled down by salivating patrons. Fantastic salad bar, with fancy hi-class accouterments. FABULOUS charcuterie, with stinky cheeses and a variety of cured meats and dried fruits. Artisanal honey straight from a proudly displayed honeycomb -- with different spices, like star anise and vanilla bean, added to the various jars (the honey pairs GREAT with the Stilton bleu cheese). Hand-made tortillas at the Mexican station...individual baked lasagnas and zitis at the Italian station...a GINORMOUS seafood selection with every sort of shellfish imaginable, and a fine spread of greasy, lard-assed "comfort food" for the Amurricans in the house. My only complaint is that their middle Eastern selection is limited to hummus, tabbouleh, couscous and dolmades...and there is no Indian selection. But seriously, I couldn\'t fit any more anyway, so I forgive them! Oh, and the desserts are fabulous and WAY more varied than at other buffets -- it was like Willy Wonka\'s Chocolate Factory! I\'d never tried a REAL marshmallow before...and I\'m here to tell you, THEY ARE DELICIOUS! \n\nThe decor is clean and modern, with lots of classy food-as-art design flourishes. The background music is modern and the perfect tempo for eating -- fast enough to keep you pushing on through your miserable fullness, yet mellow enough to allow for a relaxed feeling.\n\nThere is a large private dining room in the back, perfect for wedding receptions or private high-roller parties -- in fact, the room includes an 80" TV and will soon feature a karaoke system for those krazy hi-rolling Asian parties! I can\'t *WAIT* to get invited to (or crash) one of THOSE!!!\n\nUgh, I can\'t write about this anymore because I am still reeling from my visit, and just threw up a little in my mouth. But take it from me -- this is a GREAT buffet!!! Its fabulous vibe of excess and decadence fit in perfectly with the whole Roman Empire shtick at Caesars...so if you really want to experience the glory and bounty of America, head here at once. You won\'t regret it!'

S'It\'s the Mercedes Benz (AMG edition) of buffets. Gee golly bob did I leave full! My group came at 8:15 am and didn\'t have to wait in line. I repeat. NO LINE on a Sunday morning. Go figure- everyone else was probably happily sleeping in after their night of raunchy debauchery. I\'m not judging because I was there once. This trip however was more food focused!\n\nFor $50 ($40.99 but ball parked to $50 after tax and tip) you get bottomless mimosas or champagne with your meal. The hostess gives you little finger protectors so that you can pick up all the hot plates without scorching a finger or two. They were adorned with the "Bacchanal" logo so I took mine home as a memento :)\n\nThe decor is fabulous. My favorite thing being the chandelier made out of wine glasses.\n\nThe food was.... Money. From the prime rib to the crab legs, fancy salads, delectable Asian dishes, fried chicken and dessert items. I mean, seriously? If you\'re picky you are bound to find something to wet your whistle. Even the sushi was pretty g-double-o-d GoooOd.\n\nThe things that kept me from a 5 star review (minimal, but hey- it\'s my review buddy!) were inconsistencies. All agreed that the croissant on the ham and cheese sammy was better than the stand alone version. More buttery and crisp! How can that be? Dunno.\nThe crab bene (or was it lobster) lacked it\'s featured protein and turned cold once I got back to my table. This occurred with a lot of the hot breakfasty items so I skipped them after my first plate.\n\nThere are way too many choices on the Vegas strip, but try Bacchanal at least once just so you can say you\'ve had it!'

I really liked the consistency.  The sea bass, seafood paella, ramen, truffle scallop potatoes, and king crab were my favorite.  I\'ve never had a craving for any food when I go to Vegas..

S"I hate buffets, but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28/each).  We had:\n\nFreshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber\nSmoked salmon & cold shrimp\nSteak & egg\nBiscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots\nFried chicken and waffles\nSorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange\n\nThere were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.\n\nThe juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.\n\nOn the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.\n\nThe remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.\n\nI would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line."

S'So.... Went to Vegas this past October and had a bad flight experience getting there and my wife heard about this place having some sort of $17 million buffet and I was already feeling down, so what better way to drown your sorrows but by stuffing your face!!! We paid about $40 per person and the line was extensive, but surely worth the wait. You pay first and you can also tip first too, I tipped first because I felt like it would bring better service since they stamp "Tipped" on your ticket. Then you go into the restuarant and just like everything else in Vegas this place is huge,sparkling,flashy, and raises the bar. Now they have just about, no wait, they do have EVERYTHING you could think about eating here! Any and all ethnic groups are represented in this place and the wait staff stays up with you making you feel like you are a Vegas baller! This will be a definite stop when we are in LV, for sure!!'

S'Yes, I am a fan. Friends of my wife and I brought us here. They highly recommended this place being they had visited 2 times prior. There are 9 food stations from exotic seafood to Chinese food to desert bar to Italian food to varies steaks, lamb and chops. I am normally ok with just 1 plate I had 3 plates here the food was excellent. My wife is not typically a lover of buffet food but she really enjoyed the options here. \n\nMy only reason for giving 4 stars and not 5 is the extremely long lines (obviously the best buffet on the strip). We were told the standard line was about a 2 hour wait therefore we paid $15 extra per person for the express line which still took about 45 minutes. \n\nFYI: If you come with 8 or more people they automatically charge an 18% gratuity to your bill before you even sit down.'

S"Great remodel on the old Ceasars buffet! I was able to use my points from my players card and didn't know that my card works as a front of the line pass woohoo bonus!\n\nWe were able to sit close to the buffet where multiple trips would not be too far to trek. First of all I have to say, anything with free flowing champagne will be a good time. There were the usual stations of Asian, American, Mexican food with fresh juices and fruit and pastries and desserts. I can't say there was any one dish that jumped out at me, but I could say the selection was something to brag about. The carvers had a selection if prime rib, slabs of bacon and turkey. Asian food was so much to choose from it was like a Chinese buffet restaurant all on its own.\n\nThere was a mini juice bar serving horchata, pineapple, mango, agua fresca etc.  this was next to the street tacos maker guy. There were tater tots in these mini deep fryer baskets-super cute. I didn't have enough room to try the cheese station, but that section looked appetizing. I'd have to be here for hours to try everything! I kept it simple at the dessert area and just had a simple fruit crepe with whipped cream. Perfect ending. I don't think you'll be disappointed."

S'We went for lunch and were disappointing with the selection based on what I had seen online for dinner. I know it was cheaper, but it felt as though it was a half effort at lunch time. Overall the quality of the food was way above average buffets, but some dishes were much better than others. The sliders, cheese selection, tiny plated salads/vegetables, and tacos were stand out items at the buffet. The sushi was decent too as well as the meat station. There was a lot missing from the seafood section at lunch time so if you are a seafood fan do NOT go for lunch.\n\nThe desserts were nicely displayed, but it was a mixed bag in terms of flavor. The strawberry cheesecake pops were amazing and the green tea creme brulee was creative, but the red velvet whoopie pie was flavorless. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the lack of a crowd during lunch time at Bacchanal, your money may be better spent at dinner, when I assume they put in more effort.'

S"freaking unbelieveable .... i had to wait 4 hours to get into this buffet . came here on jan. 2 because my hubby wanted to eat this buffet so badly . you can't just go there and stand in line .... no , you have to register your phone number to get a ticket . \nthe ticket will tell you about what time you can expect to get in .\nthey charged us 59.99 $ per person for a holiday dinner , even though it was not a holiday anymore .\nwhen we walked around to look at the buffet , we noticed , that most of the food was regular dinner food  and a lot of the special holiday  food wasn't even available .\nwe asked around for the lobster and filet mignon , which was listed as 1 of there holiday day food. everybody told  us it was only available on the jan 1. buffet .\n????? why did they charge everybody the holiday price for a regular dinner ?\nwe felt chipped and pointed the holiday menu out which was placed in front of the buffet. the manager then magically brought my hubby and me a plate  with steak and lobster . that was nice , but we still felt cheated , since a lot of the special holiday food was nowhere to be found.\nthe food was very average on this day and very dissapointing.... sure not worth  122.25  $ plus tip  for 2"

S'So I am maybe a little behind the ball on Bacchanal. It only took me a year, but I finally made it out to try the hyped "best buffet in Las Vegas." I haven\'t been to a buffet in years. No, Bacchanal hasn\'t turned me into a buffet fan. However, the food, selection and bussing service was exceptional. So if I had to recommend a place to gorge yourself this would be it.\n\nHIGHLY SUGGEST THE EXPRESS LINE. A 2+ hour wait turned into a 15 minute one. You basically stand in the line for Platinum Players, tack $15 on to each person\'s entry fee and waltz right in--it\'s worth it. The day we went, Friday/Saturday dinner was at $50.99 (show your players card for a $1 discount per person)\n\nProbably one of the better looking buffets on the strip. After the remodel, it resembles a hip, fine dining establishment. Which is good for you in case you want to bring someone special or celebrate something.\n\nFood-wise, selection is the usual except maybe some more culinary masterpieces than you expect at the run of the mill buffet. You\'ve got your prime rib, BBQ, & sausage station--prime rib was flavorful but dry. Seafood--hot/cold crab legs, sub-par oysters. Italian. Dim Sum--amazing, I must have went there 3 times--so delicious + house made chili oil. And can\'t forget dessert: gelato + macarons--that is all.'

S"I've been waiting for weeks to eat here. Even more than that, I've been waiting to mark my 5 stars and add Bacchanal to my list as the best buffet in Vegas. Unfortunately I didn't get to do any of those. There's not a lot I can say bad about this place. Overall, it was a good experience, but it wasn't the best there is. \n\nFirst of all, I parked in the garage and found it difficult to find once I was inside Caesars. There were no signs to the buffet until you're almost there. We asked four employees along the way. One person didn't have a clue. Once we got there, a long line awaited us. On a positive note, we only had to wait 25 minutes. We got there on a Monday at 10:00. I can't imagine what the wait is like on a weekend. The great thing about getting there after 10 is that they start changing the food line at 11. You get the end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch. Hmmm...I believe that is called brunch. Oh....there is a big price difference between breakfast and lunch. \n\nThe facility is beautiful. It is large enough to walk between tables without disturbing others. Yelpers comment about how expensive it is, but I think it is well worth the money. The food was very good. I was stuffed when I left. For breakfast I had bacon (greasy and fatty), red velvet pancakes (just OK), sweet potato tots (scrumptious), biscuit (OK), scrambled eggs (runny), shrimp and grits (OK). I tasted my partner's french toast and it was very good. \n\nFor lunch I had dim sum (all that I tried was very good), paella (good and an unusual dish for a buffet), BBQ spare ribs (smoky). I didn't bother waiting in line for the very small salad bar. I tasted my partner's very good fried chicken. There were a lot of food choices and the food was a little above average for a buffet. There were no signature dishes that would be unique to Bacchanal such as some of the dishes you will find at the Wicked Spoon. Actually, the way that the food was displayed and served makes you think that the designers spent a lot of time checking out the Wicked Spoon as they were designing this place. Unfortunately, they didn't bring over the chefs.\n\nLastly...the desserts. I only had the red velvet cake and carrot cake. They were both very good. I usually hate the nasty carrot cakes at buffets, but the bakery stepped up to the plate and hit a home run with the carrot cake. My friends had different desserts and said that they were all fabulous. The coffee was good. \n\nI don't like to do buffets because I tend to overeat. I can't imagine that I would ever go back to to this one unless I was with someone that insisted upon going there. I'd much rather go the the M or the Wicked Spoon."

S"This is by far my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.\nI've eaten here twice now and I must say that each time was well worth the $$$ and the full stomach. My friends and I decided to try it the first time because it had just opened and we wanted to see if it lived up to the Vegas Buffet standards; it did. Over a year and a half later, I dragged my entire family to eat att this buffet because of the positive experience I had the first time.\n\nIt's around $65 for weekend dinner buffet (that price included tax and 18% gratuity for my 8+ party), but they have such a vast variety of the food and wonderful presentation for each of the dishes that the price doesn't stop me from wanting to go back even as I'm writing this review.\n\nThey have several different types of food stations (going right to left from what I can remember) chinese, dim sum, sushi, made to order ramen, pho, udon, salad bar, cheese bar, pasta, pizza, mexican, the mexican fruit juices (i loved), soup, bread, meat - lamb, prime rib, fried chicken, etc., mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, fresh seafood, and dessert in the center of the restaurant. It's awesome. \n\nThey also gave each of us at the table a complimentary glass of wine which was nice.\n\nLoved both of my dining experiences here and I will definitely be back!"

S"Bacchanal Buffet is definitely raising the bar high for all other competitors.  It is on another level.   I just hope they are able to sustain the service and quality as I've often seen buffets gradually decline with time.  I would easily rank it higher than Wicked Spoon which I feel is overrated....probably along the lines of Wynn. \n\nThe food was ridiculously good.   The lamb chops were cooked perfectly - medium rare to medium.   All of the food stations had general favorites along with more authentic options.   At the asian line, they have a Pho and Ramen station where they serve Ramen from Monta.  It didn't taste on the same level as Monta, but with over 500 items, we're knit picking.\n\nI enjoyed the Italian station where they had a pasta station where you can choose your pasta and sauce.  I went with the bolognese which was delish.  \n\nThe biggest star of the show has to be the seafood line or at least if you're basing by lines.   My advice is to grab a first plate of food to get the first excitement out of the way.  Then make your way to the seafood line for the wait.   You can bring a fork with you too so when you first make your way through the hot seafood items, you can snack on the halibut, salmon, crab croquette, lobster corn chowder.  People may give you weird looks and judge you, but it's only because they weren't genius enough to come up with the idea themselves.   When you make your way around the L-shape towards the STONE CRAB and KING CRAB LEGS, don't forget to ask the cooks to heat them up if that's how u roll.\n\nSave room for desserts!  I enjoyed the tiramisu and the eclectic sorbet with flavors such as Watermelon Mint and Mango Chile Lime."

S"So after weeks of reviewing buffets before my long awaited trip to Las Vegas I decided to try this one out for the first time.  The buffet has a really good selection with all different types of food .  HOWEVER....the quality of food wasn't really any better than say, the Carnival Buffet at the Rio. The price tag was $109 just for my wife and I on a Monday.  Again, the food was good, but definitely not great.  I probably won't be coming back to this one for a while."

S"This is hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas. I've eaten at some of the best, including Bellagio buffeting Wynn buffet, and dabbled in some less expensive ones such as the Planet Hollywood and M buffets, and this is by far the BEST. The food selection is great, as the buffet offers you the range of different cuisines you would expect from a top notch world class buffet. What separates this place from the rest is the quality. The beef brisket was one of the best I've EVER had, including those at buffet joints in the south. The curries are fresh and taste straight out of Thailand. The Italian meatballs are very well made and authentic, rivaling even those of Rao's next door.  For those of you who only come to buffets to eat seafood...this might not be the place for you. The seafood is good but similar to Wynn and Bellagio. For those of you who come for a top notch culinary experience normally not offered in the mass produced mass consumed aisles of the buffet--this is definitely the place to go!"

S'Food coma...must stay awake...must write review...\n\nI\'ve been waiting to try Bachannal and tonight, a few friends and I finally went after shopping.  At 5:30pm there was already a long line.  Since I don\'t gamble, I don\'t have a rewards card so we had to stand in line for 30 minutes which allowed us to chat while waiting.  I paid $54.04 per person and I think it was worth the money.\n\nAs soon as you get in, you\'re greeted by seafood: crab legs, oysters, clams, mussels, shrimps, etc.  Since I\'m allergic to that stuff, I didn\'t bother trying it (one allergic reaction per week is my quota). Then you pass through the American station (sliders, ribs, BBQ, rib eye, sausage, onion rings, prime rib, tater tots, corn on the cob, truffle potatoes, sweet potato fries, etc), Mexican station (salsa, tortilla, etc) and dessert station (macarons, gelato, cakes, cupcakes, tarts, fruits, cake pops, creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, bread pudding, crepes, etc) in the middle. The charcuterie (mortadella, coppa, salami, prosciutto, mocecta and air-dried sausages),  and cheese stations plus Italian (pizza, ziti, stromboli, etc) and Asian (sushi, pho, ramen; salty and spicy fish, bao, shumai, hargao, dumplings and other Chinese dishes) stations are in the back.\n\nI was so excited about the pho and ramen.  I ordered a bowl of pho and I asked the two chefs "where\'s the noodles?" and they kept pointing at it and I was like "all I see is broth?" so I gave them back my bowl and shamelessly asked for more - much better.  If I were on a diet, I wouldn\'t be at a buffet.  Also, try the salty and spicy fish.\n\nLet\'s talk about desserts...they have mini vanilla cupcakes, mini chocolate cupcakes and mini red velvet cupcakes (with extra tart cream cheese frosting), chocolate brownie tart (skip the tart and just eat the chocolate brownie on top), cake pops and tiramisu were nothing to write home about.  The chocolate and passion fruit dessert was not good.  I give them A for effort on the macarons.  They\'re not fantastic.  In fact, the pistachio, orange and rose all tasted so artificial and only the vanilla and chocolate macarons were good.  They\'re hard to make though.  The desserts I did enjoy were chocolate creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, fig & balsamic gelato, baklava gelato and Aztec chocolate gelato.\n\nNow the best buffets in Vegas in my opinion include: Wynn, Bellagio, Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan and Studio B at M (my favorite).  For having pho, ramen, unusual gelati, macarons, charcuterie, salty and spicy fish (YUM!!!), crepes and juicy sliders - Bacchanal deserves 5 stars.  The quality of fish they use for their sushi isn\'t as fresh as Studio B\'s.  Just imagine this, if Wicked Spoon (single serving plating) and Studio B (delicious variety) had a buffet baby...Bacchanal would\'ve been it.'

S'I usually go to Bacchanal during every trip I take to Vegas. Overall, I do think this buffet is relatively comparable to the other buffets around, like Wicked Spoon. The lines can be really long, unless you are a Platinum/Diamond member, which you can use the "fast pass" line for. If you come in the middle of the day, not during lunch/dinner hour it is also a shorter wait.\n\nI really like the variety of food they have here. They have all sorts of dishes, ranging from Italian to prime rib to Mexican and Asian cuisine. Pretty much a flavor for everyone! They also have a fantastic seafood bar from which you can get crab legs. I recommend not getting too much food at once, since it can turn cold at the table. Instead, get small portions of what you find interesting, and go back for more/other samples once you\'re done. I\'ve gone enough times to know what I like getting there now, so I tend to stick to those things. They have a nice mix of carbs, meat, and veggies.\n\nWhat\'s really fantastic- and I\'m sure most people look forward to this part- is the dessert bar. They can make crepes for you there, and it\'s a huge station all on its own! I love the chocolate-covered strawberries here, and sometimes they have flan as well. If you are unsure about what\'s on the menu but really want something, just call and make sure that they have it before you go!'

S"Hmm, overall I rate this buffet as the 3rd best on the Strip.  First being Bellagio, Cosmo second, and Wynn 4th.\n\nMe and my buddies arrived at about 8pm and were in line for an hour.  We even paid the extra $15 for their express line.  So damage was $65 each.\n\nIt is a good buffet because it has 7 different stations with each station catering to different palates.  These stood out for me.  You could get the crab warmed up.  A rep is there ready to take your empty plate and quickly cover it with warmed crab legs.  I think it was snow crab and not king crab although I like both.  I really liked their roast duck in the Asian station.  It wasn't dry as my friends had feared.  The best item at the buffet was clearly the steak--very flavorful!  Better than the 6 month dry aged steak I had at Carnevino the following night.\n\nI liked this buffet, but all things considered and with the extensive wait time and better buffets on the Strip, I probably won't schedule another visit here.  Would only come here if it were a consensus within my group...."

S'Hands down, best buffet in Vegas. Haven\'t tried it? What are you waiting for!?\n\nFOOD: Selection is overwhelming in a good way. Love how they separate the "hot" crab legs in a different section which helps with the lines. A few highlights, the Asian soups are surprisingly good, for example the Pho. We all know how long it takes to make the broth and Bacchanal is on point. The best prime rib still goes to the Wynn and Bellagio though, Bacchanal lacks marbles. Also, dessert bar is amazing. Mochi ice cream ftw. \n\nAMBIANCE: Nice decor, not over the top but effort was made. Casual dress with a casual atmosphere. \n\nSERVICE: I love their new ticket system. Prior to it, you had to wait in a fat gigantic line ranging from 1-3 hours. Now, it\'s like the Disneyland fastpass system. Walk up to the machine, grab a number, and come back when it\'s your turn. From that point, it\'s another 20 or so minutes (depending on time of course). \n\nPARKING: Never stayed at this hotel, but all Vegas hotels have free parking. \n\nOverall: If you had one buffet to go to in Vegas (or anywhere for that matter), make it Bacchanal.'

Since we had time to waste we got us an appetizer from Cheesecake Factory and then went to the miracle mile shops to look around. At 4:30 they text us to get back in and pay, we got back their around 5 pm checked in, got in line and paid. We sat down to eat around 5:55. \nNow to the food, it was great.

Unparalleled carving station (prime rib, ham, turkey, SLAB BACON, and an assortment of sausages/links - there's also TWO..the other one is around the corner next to the pasta/pizza). Bacchanal also has a mexican food station - making some fresh tacos - yum! \n\nThe Chinese food was also on point. There's even a noodle bar with ramen, pho (yes, pho) and udon! But, they also had a good assortment of guilty pleasure food - tater tots, waffle fries, fried chicken w/ sweet potato fries.

You'll find better at mid priced Asian buffets in California. Grilled meats and seafood bar were very good as was the dessert station. If I had to wait two hours, then it would have not been worth it. New system when l where you register and come back later worked well. No wait to register and we paid and were seated with 10 minutes of return.\n\nOverall, for the price I'd say 3.5 stars but with the short wait for a Saturday, I will round up to 4 stars."

S'Pre-visit to Vegas, I had my heart set on finally eating at Wicked Spoon. My friends however, heard about the amazing new Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar\'s Palace - recently renovated and bomb food. Why have I not heard about this such buffet? The Yelper in me was disappointed in meself.\n\nMy girls and I stopped by on a Saturday around 1:30pm, waited on the line and got in just after 2pm. Total damage per person came out to ~$54. What the what? $50 pp for a lunch?! Luckily, my money savvy friend asked the cashier and found out that $50 included bottomless mimosas. Ohhhh. Yessss.\n\nThe interior of the buffet is refreshing and neat. There are three separate sections that have three distinct decoration themes. Our party of 10 was given a choice to sit near the food or a bit further away in our own little private seating area. Private seating area it is - VIP baby! Our seating area was perrrrrrrf, save for the clear tiles separating us and the hallway next to the buffet where a ton of drooling patrons, wandering babies, and people judging us, walked by the entire 3 hours we were there (it\'s a 2 hr max btw, but they aren\'t super stingy).\n\nOur waitress came out the moment we sat down and got our orders for 10 mimosa, OJ, apple juice, and waters out ASAP. She was super sweet and patient, always clearing our dishes without fail and juggling our needy orders - 18% gratuity well deserved. The only thing she did incorrectly was take away a friend\'s plate before she was finished - including her utensils! I\'d liken that to a blessing in disguise since my friend was able to fit some other things in her tummy ;)\n\nNow let\'s get dizzown to bizznazz - how was the food? How about... everything we ate was spectacular? Surriously, not a single thing offered a "meh" out of anyone\'s mouth. \n\n- The buffet starts off with an amazing seafood spread of cold or hot crab legs, mussels, and oysters (we sat down at 2pm, dinner started at 3pm, so we got the best of both worlds for a lower price!). \n\n- Next came the little metal carts of fried food! Potato cakes garnered approval from much of the group. I especially LOVED the fried chicken, HOW DO THEY KEEP IT SO DANG JUICY?! Mmmm. \n\n- Then you will come upon the glorious meat station!!!!!! There was a line for this station the entire time we were there, but it moves semi-quickly. Woulda moved quicker if the people at the station weren\'t so busy hamming it up with the meat man! Alas, I\'m guilty of this myself...but the dude hooked it UP with the fattiest piece of delicious smoky brisket and rarest part of the prime rib there was. Don\'t be hatin\' ;) Pick up a wagyu slider on your way back and let that all dat meat melt in yo\' mouth (that\'s what she said!)\n\n- Following the meat station is the Mexican, Italian, Charcuterie, Japanese, and Chinese stations. Highlights from the above include the pulled pork from the Mexican station, tuna poke from the Japanese station, and the meatballs from the Italian station. Om freaking nom.\n\n- Dessert station was so abundant with selections I didn\'t even know where to begin. I picked up a banana and a pistachio souffl\xc3\xa9 STRAIGHT out of the oven, chocolate covered strawberries, and some toffee ice cream to wash that ish down.\n\nTo be honest, the food was so dang good that I didn\'t even TOUCH my mimosa for fear of getting too full from the bubbles. This is coming from an alcoholic. Legit! \n\nThe food was so dang good that my friend would not stop stuffing herself, despite being in so much pain, and ended up peeing, pooing, and puking herself in the bathroom. \n\nThe food was so dang good that my feet fell asleep while sitting on the toilet later. TMI? ;)\n\nI don\'t even want to TRY Wicked Spoon now that Bacchanal has stolen my heart. I will never cheat on you and your scrumptious ways - promise!'

S'As buffets go bacchanal would be hard to beat. The food was good and of course plentiful. I especially liked the cheese station. Deserts were good. \n\nThe biggest downside is the eternal wait to get in.'

S"The GF had never done a Vegas buffet, so we ended up here after a bit of googling and determining that this is apparently the leading contender for Best Buffet.\n\nWe came on a weekend night, meaning it was just over $50 each, and a 90 minute wait.  \n\nThe choices are almost overwhelming, and they had pretty much everything you could want.  \n\nThe real thing that sets it apart from other buffets I've been to (I live in Reno, so a fair amount of experience with them) was the lack of large chaffing dishes.  Most items were cooked in single services - e.g. individual baskets of chicken fingers for kids, small, single-serve cast iron pans of lasagna, etc.  The stuff that wasn't in single serves was in really small dishes, maybe a dozen items.  Many of the items were things that I felt could be served as a regular menu item at most other restaurants.\n\nOther things that set this place apart were the fresh shucked oysters, a choice of hot or cold crab legs, and probably close to a dozen choices at the carving stations.\n\nThe one miss for me was the sushi - this was an exception to the individually prepared items - large trays of nigiri and rolls, and reminding me of a Todai or something.  Quality of the fish was just meh, the rice was not well seasoned, and the cuts of fish were sometimes not properly aligned with the grain of the flesh.\n\nI don't think we'd go back, but that's because we've had the experience, and for me, once is enough.  \n\nI think if you are looking for that big, grand, Vegas buffet, Bacchanal is probably the epitome of it."

S'I cannot write a fair review for the food because we did not try it but I can say that they need to reconsider their price structure.\n\nWhen we arrived to the cashier she informed be that the bill for, 3 kids and 2 adults, was $298.00 including tip.\n\nNow, considering that the kids were 9, 11, 13, I will consider the price outrageous even for Las Vegas standard.\n\nFor this price, nobody will ever be able to convince me about anything positive for this place.'

S'Not worth the $55 per person which we paid last night.  For kids under 10, it\'s half price, $35 I believe.  As some other reviews indicated, I concur that it\'s not worth waiting close to an hour which we did.  Supposedly, a text will be sent once you get a ticket (kind of like the fastpass system at Disneyland), but as the receptionist explained, everybody showed up with tickets a little earlier than they were supposed to, so she had "no time" to text people.  Of course, it might have been that we showed up around 6PM on the Saturday prior to Xmas.\n\nI\'m not much of a seafood eater, so I was able to avoid another line waiting for seafood once I made it past the initial line to pay, and then the secondary line to wait to be seated.  However, even at the carved meats section, there was another line.  Just out of principle, I refused to stand in line, but my daughters and wife were kind enough to do so for me, while they were getting stuff they wanted to eat.\n\nSo I ate from the Chinese/Asian section where there wasn\'t much waiting.  They did have ginger ale to drink, and the mango juice from the Mexican/Latino section was great.  The dessert section was awesome too, but that\'s really the only thing that impressed me.\n\nSo if you basically only eat cooked land animals and like dessert, paying $55 is probably not worth it.  And as far as the "fastpass" system is concerned, I think everybody gets a ticket now, so it\'s not exactly like an advantage.'

Everything you can imagine. I was completely stuffed and then I discovered an entire room of food I hadn't even touched! Next time I go to Vegas I'm not wasting any time with other buffets. I'm gonna park myself at Caesar's Palace and have somebody roll me to my room when I'm done. Great value, great fun. If you only can go to one buffet, go here!"

S"They get 2 stars because our dining service was good.  Went here for a friend's birthday because she was excited about a full blown extravaganza for her birthday dinner.  The only thing full blown about the place is the price. \n\nIt was less busy than most people have experienced but because there were 5 of us, after we paid, we had to wait for about 15 minutes before we were seated.  We get seated and I looked around and realized how small this buffet is compared to others.  And every section seems to have a line and those that don't for their particular foods, have a line in front of them for another section.  Some of the lines just to get the more popular food took more than 15 minutes to navigate.  \n\nThe sad part: It isn't all that good.  The desserts were tasty but the actual FOOD... not so much.  I had cold food that was warm and warm food that was cold.  Bread that had been left out for too long and was stale.  One of my friends had a couple of the sliders and pushed the rest of her plate away.  \n\nHonestly, it is a 1.5 star place.  One star for the service, .5 for the desserts.  Had I paid for just a dessert buffet, this would be a different story.  But since most of us went away hungry because the food was not good, I cannot recommend this buffet to anyone.  I honestly feel like people like it because it is expensive.  They feel like they must be eating some really upscale food.  But here is a note:  the food still has to taste good.  One does not need to eat it just because it is expensive."

I like the comfy chairs. \n\nService: hm..my water stayed empty til the end. \n\nFood: average for the price of $44 for brunch. No real stand-out dishes. The hargow was terrible. So fake. The sweet buns were good. I love bacon so the breakfast area with bacon was cool. Hashbrowns were tasty. Sushi was sushi, not bad. Mac n cheese shouldn't get messed up, but they did, not that flavorful. I think my fave dish was the au gratin potatoes, it tasted like there was truffle cheese. I don't know because there was no label. I was expecting more macarons too but no luck. Dessert was sub-par.\n\nIt was an experience... I'll stick to Wicked Spoon next time."

S"This place is definitely as good as it gets. Yes, it's pricey but it's Vegas and it's a buffet. Cost is to be expected, right? But the nice surprise here is how legit this place is. It's not your everyday casino buffet. The quality and presentation of the food here is top notch. You feel like a kid in a candy store here so trust me, take your time and get a little bit of everything. Seriously, one or two shrimps at a time...you need the room on your plate to try everything else. Their prime rib was tender, crab legs were meaty, oysters were fresh, filler foods (mac n cheese, scalloped potatoes, sweet potato fries, etc.) were all deliciously sinful as they should be. Don't forget that there's a whole other side tucked to the back left corner. It was a whole new world when our table discovered it. Desserts were gourmet quality and the ice cream flavors were fun like french toast, thai tea and watermelon mint. Bonus points for having mochi ice cream at their dessert bar. \n\nService was super pleasant and very fast. We had a great time at this place and would definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas. Enjoy!"

The quality was really good for a buffet. Surprisingly had the best Bbq pork bun in the Asian section. Yes, I said BBQ PORK BUN.

Try it and you be the judge. \n\nIf you like deserts you will absolutely love this place! \n\nService: \nThis is a buffet....\n\nEnvironment: \nBuffets tend to transform polite individuals into crazy pushy individuals who will toss you aside if you look at their prime rib too long\n\nPrice: \nThe most expensive buffet I've been to....but for the quality and variety I guess it is okay...\n\nFood: 5\nService: 3\nEnvironment: 3\nPrice: 3"

Considering it's not their specialty they did good.\n\nCrab legs cut in half reduce the mess, and the flavor; catch 22 there.\n\nThe dessert is mega bomb. Hit the lava cake a couple times, that one is a well made chocolate deliciousness. \n\nThere's plenty to eat here so go easy on the meat, otherwise you will be a gassy mess a few hours later. It's delicious, but not the second time around. \n\nThis place is worth the 90 minute wait on a Saturday night once.  Only once.  You can pay $15 to skip the line, but that makes your meal $66 for a buffet.  If you're a baller, fine, spend that money, but that's $15 you can use betting on black, or food for your hamster.  \n\nEnjoy."

S"WE ACTUALLY GOT ASKED TO LEAVE BECAUSE WE STAYED TOO LONG!!!! Hahahahahahha. I never knew buffets had time limits.... Although it was a bit embarrassing, I guess we stayed so long because we enjoyed it so much. \n\nSo my friends and I decided to buffet it up after three nights of clubbing... so yes, we definitely needed to recover. Wait time was only 15 minutes, so we were seated in no time.\n\nI'll admit - this is my first Vegas buffet, but damn, everything I put into my mouth was amazing. Here's some of my favorites!!! - \n\nMini deep fryers containing fatty goodness - corn dogs, tatertots, onion rings...\nFresh juices in cute little bottles\nRoasted duck + plum sauce\nOysters, mussels, shrimpies \nOyster SHOOTERS!\nPrime rib\nRib eye\nTruffle soup - i still have dreams about this\nKorean short ribs\nSalmon\nCorn on the cob\nSliders - soooo goood. \nPotato gratin - must try!!! I ate 3x of these. \nLobster bisque\nGelato, gelato, gelato! Try pistachio and baklava! Or everything \nCalamari with this coconut rice(?)\nDIY Crepes!!\nCreme brulee\nBroccoli & Cheese\nMac & Cheese\nAll the sushi\n....\n\nI'm probably missing a lot... but as you can see, we enjoyed everything! Every time we took a bite of something, we would sigh in pleasure or encourage each other to try it.  My vegan friend even broke her veganism that fine afternoon because the food was THAT good (sorry I'm not ratting you out!). \n\nService was good as far as I remember. The man cutting the meat was extremely polite and patient, which I liked. The gelato lady was kind, friendly, and didn't mind giving me several samples. Our waitress seemed nice, except for the part when she said there was a two hour time limit. Well, I'm sorry!! What if we all just had really really big appetites?\n\nPrice is reasonable (~$35 for lunch)! That filled me up for the rest of the day, so I thought it was worthwhile. I would come back, but probably wont stay as long. \n\nSo if you're DTB (down to buffet), I highly recommend this place!\n\n4.5 stars!"

They didn't even serve steak so I had to settle on pork chops also that were very cheap in quality.. just the list goes on and on of just miss after miss of trying to hit the spot on quality and selection.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this place is that my greeter was very nice and gave me a quick tour of the place and the server was a very nice gentleman which I tipped him accordingly but other then that I'll never return."

We waited about 10 minutes, so not too bad. \nIt\'s a little on the pricey side, $47.99, and if you don\'t have a HUGE appetite, this might not be the place for you.

No added salt. Perfect\nShrimp that even Forrest Gump and Bubba ( the movie, get it? ) would be proud of.\nSushi, Sushi, Sushi\nSashimi that melts in your mouth.\nRaw oysters\n\nCheeses:\n\nBlue cheese chunk tasted as if the master made it.

S'This is one of the better buffets in Vegas.  The foods are better quality.   My favorite thing to eat here are the oysters and crab legs.  They have really fresh oysters and I like to dip it in the jabenero salsa from their salsa bar.  I also liked that they served their crab legs cold or hot.  Also if you are a meat eater, this buffet offers great selections lambs,  prime ribs and etc.  The only bad thing that I have to say is that if you are not a platinum reward members then the wait is really long.  Also be prepared to spend some money cause the price is pretty high for a Vegas buffet.'

S'My father and I came here right at the end of lunch service on a weekday and paid around $35/person to get in and stayed for dinner (saving money). The place is well decorated, but not gaudy. It has a more modern, restaurant feel to it rather than a buffet. There are 9 stations each with different styles/ethnic food (i.e. Mexican,Chinese, American, & Italian) and a big island of dessert. The staff were attentive and nice, and plates were cleared out very quickly. But on to the food.\n\nI think the buffet tries to bring a more foodie sense of eating to diners through their variety and offers. Do not expect there to be king crab leg on a weekday as they only serve split snow crab legs. There are 3-4 selections of shooters (soups in shot glasses), all of which were pretty good. The raw oysters are decently fresh, but usually hacked up due to the speed at which they\'re prepared (they go fast, so once you see them putting the oysters out you should go for it).\n\n(GOOD)\nThe prime rib was decent and the cuts were very large. The lamb lollipops were good, with every piece I got coming out to medium-rare/rare (you should tell them how you want it so they can find the piece that\'s closest to that temp). They brought out a thing called a "veal ship" later in the service which was good too, but at that point I was going to explode. The sweet potato fries and tater tots were very good (though greasy) and were probably one of the best things at the buffet. There\'s a thing called the "chef special" which was scallop that day, which was very good as well. The cheese and charcuterie are decent for a buffet, the salad line is pretty extensive, and there is a dedicated bread section too.\n\n(BAD)\nThe Asian line should be completely avoided. Everything there was bad, including the hot and sour soup, which my father commented on as containing "nothing but corn starch". The sushi was "meh", as expected. The fish dishes were consistently overcooked and dried out so I didn\'t even try them. I avoided the Mexican and Italian stands as there were a lot of carbs there, pasta is almost 99.9% going to be mediocre-bad at a buffet, and I\'m from Texas so I\'ve had great Tex-Mex & authentic Mexican food already (no point in trying something I know will disappoint).\n\n(GREAT)\nSave. Room. For. Dessert. Between plates of other food I\'d stop by the dessert station to grab a couple sweet treats and bring them back to the table and we still couldn\'t get through it all. There is a station that makes crepes to order (and you get to put on your own fillings/toppings), there\'re macarons, many tiny dessert plates, and a dedicated ice cream,sorbet, and mochi ice cream bar. Honestly the dessert bar is better than more than half the stations in the buffet.\n\nThis buffet was good, but very pricey. I\'d probably come here after winning big at the tables or for a celebration, but that\'s about it. I hinted to it at the beginning of the review, but it\'s more worth it to come near the end of lunch and get in at lunch prices for dinner. You simply graze a bit while you wait for them to shift gears. And just a tip, the lamb lollipops, veal ship, and other dinner menu items came out later at around 5-6 so don\'t think that what they have at 3:30 is the only thing they have for dinner.'

S"We went here yesterday on Christmas Eve. We didn't know that the lunch price was twice the regular price.. $50/person + tax!!!  But we already waited 2.5 hours to get in and plus the Yelp reviews already gave the place so much hype so, FINE... Let's see what this was all about!\n\nI was very disappointed at the Bachannal. It was our furst time here and I don' think we'll be back again. The quality of the food was real BAD. The prime rib was dry and chewy. They even ran out of au jus, which was weird. Beef brisket was too salty, so were the fried chicken and scalloped potatoes. The crab legs were FROZEN! There was still ice on most of the crab I got. The Mexican foods station was a mess. So were the bread and cheese station. The Chinese and Dim sum area looked okay, but for $50+ price tag, why would I go for those?! I also didn't care much for the pizza and pasta.\n\nOn to desserts... I was looking specifically for the macaroons and red velvet pancakes. But there's none! I went back 3 times to the dessert station, still none. So I asked one of the servers there and she said they ran out. What? Seriously? But but but it was ONLY 2pm, how could they already run out? And why would they even run out of those items?! That is sooooo unacceptable!\n\nAs for service, it was okay. The staff was fast and friendly, and several servers help you on your table. The first waitress who came to our table took our order for drinks then went away. Then, as I looked around us, I noticed most people were having champagne and mimosas. Another new waiter brought us our drinks, so I asked him if the champagne was included in the buffet price. It turns out that it was! Again, a disappointment. We should have been told early on. If I didn't ask, I don't think they would have told us. The people from the other table heard me ask and it turns out, they weren't informed also. So lesson learned, just go ahead and don't be shy to ask.\n\nSo again, overall,  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE BACHANNAL. If I can take my  $50 back, I would just skip the LV buffets and, instead, find me a nice sit-down restaurant where I can have a nice 3-course gourmet dinner which I will truly savor and enjoy.\n\n\nP.S. If anyone reading this happens happens to love brunch buffets and gets to visit SF and the peninsula, I would recommend the Cliff House champagne brunch ($45+). If you really really want to treat yourself and you definitely deserve to splurge now and then, go to the Navio for brunch in Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay ($100+)! The Navio is the BEST top-notch high quality brunch I have ever had. Every dollar is really definitely worth it!!!"

S"All I really remember about this buffet was standing in line. \n\nStanding in line for seating. We spent the extra $15 for the express line. Was it worth it? Yes...during peak times. It probably saved us an hour. \n\nStanding in line for the food. The way that the buffet is built requires everyone to stand in lines to get to any of the popular food stations. It was a nightmare, but probably also a strategy by the designers to get every one filled up on the cheap food. Because guess what is at the end of the line? The most expensive food...crab legs, clams, oysters and shrimp. By the time we actually got back to our seats with the food, most of it was cold. Eek. But the best way to get through the lines is to pair up and have one person hold a place in the line while the other person puts the plates full of food on the table. Repeat. \n\nThe food: Prime rib and lamb chops were dry, clam chowder was super salty, sweet potato tater tots were delish, kobe sliders were ok, crab legs were ok, shrimp was huge and fresh and everything else wasn't too memorable. \n\nBut...since I paid $65 for this buffet, I was going to get the most bang for my buck. The oysters! My friends and I originally grabbed a bunch of oysters in the shell, but then realized we would get the most out of the oysters shots, which are at the very end of the buffet line. We didn't even have to wait in line, we just kept grabbing the oysters shots from the counter. We poured the extra tomato juice out and just kept eating. Needless to say...a delicious overdose of raw oysters. =P\n\nFor dessert I really liked the macarons, the creme brulee, the watermelon mint sorbet (so refreshingly clean), and the fig gelato were delish. Also, they serve FRESH squeezed orange juice and watermelon juice here. Just ask the waiter. Loved. \n\nOverall, there are some high points, but I consider this place average when there are competing buffets in the vicinity with less lines, lower prices, and more unique dishes."

The wait and $ was so not worth it, a huge disappointment.  The line for seafood was long, the meat looked like it had been sitting around,  lots of labels missing so you just don't know what stuff is, very sad."

S"This place is an experience. We walked up on Super Bowl Sunday and hot brunch. It is about $55 a person with tip. \n\nIf you judged each individual item, about half would be below a B-  that being said, the compilation of items as a whole is more like an A-  \n\nDesert bar was very impressive. \n\nThe defining characteristic of this place is the shear mass of food and it was good. Oh yea, Mimosa's included in price. \n\nIt was well worth a visit. I would not do it often though. I spent 2 hours and 15 minutes eating like a glutton."

S"What a buffet! I've come here for both lunch and dinner after the revamping.\n\nI'd say overall, dinner is probably more worth it than the lunch. With dinner you get the seafood, like oysters, oyster shooters, and ceviche. The lunch instead comes with melon juices and melons.\n\nGood: Oysters and oyster shooters! So good and there are always tons of oysters. My only complaint is that one time, a waiter basically stole an entire full plate of untouched oysters from our table while I had my head turned. Also, there really should be small sauce cups or something for hot sauce to top the oysters.\n\nMeats are also very good! The prime rib and brisket are pretty awesome. The bacon was decent.\n\nDesserts are very good. There is gelato (flavors are hit and miss but mostly hit), a crepe station, and various small cakes/pies/candy.\n\nPineapple juice and free mimosas!\n\nHot crab legs are also amazing. They should put the butter closer though.\n\nAsian duck is really good.\n\nAt some point I lost all dignity and was pigging out only with my hands.\n\nBad:\nWatermelon juice was meh. Grapefruit juice was terrible.\n\nThe Asian besides the duck overall wasn't too impressive. The sushi is not very good as well.\n\nCold crab legs are terrible. Crab legs that were only partially heated up aren't very good either."

S"Waited for 30 mins before discovering that you can pay extra $15 and get in express line.  When I told person at the counter she did not even offer to expedite our entry.  We kept having to wait behind the VIP's.  Really amazing that after waiting in initial line we had to wait an ADDITIONAL 30 mins before we were seated.  I was really surprised that no one made mention of this until the other day stating it took 90mins to get seated.  Really irksome was that we called ahead and were told it would be around an hour wait, but when we talked to the manager he said it was really taking more like 2.5 hours.  \n\n**What you really need to know is that a server told me that on Thanksgiving the wait is 4-6hours, and the price is $75.  What?!?  Who is waiting that long?**"

S"We came at 3:30 and we had missed the lunch buffet which ends at 3 pm. When we arrived, there wasn't that infamous line that Bacchanal is known for. We didn't have to use the kiosk as there was no line to get in. After paying $55 each, we were whisked away to have our picture taken. Hmm, I guess for some it may be a memento that they dined at one of Vegas' great buffets. \n\nI had high hopes of eating at this grandiose of a buffet. I'm sorry but our experience was just mediocre. There was no lobster tail, instead they offered steam snow crab legs. Bummer! I had some of the crab legs, basically the same crab legs I would find at any other buffet. I tried the lobster chowder, bland and cold. Hubby had a couple of slices of prime rib, just ok. The ribs were nothing to write home about. The lettuce wedge was bland as well. As a matter of fact, most of the food was quite bland and either cold or old?! The fried rice at the Chinese food section was dried out and looked unappetizing. After having so many misses with my food, I found that they had Tonkotsu ramen! Ugh! The noodles were mushy and overcooked. Matter of fact, nothing stood out in my memory as spectacular. It was just another buffet. \n\nAfter being there for an hour, I noticed that there were some people who really enjoyed this buffet. There was a group of about eight people and three of them were asleep in their chairs while others were getting endless plates of food. We could see that they got their money's worth because there was a mess of plates on their table. Seriously, if you are gonna take a nap, isn't it time to call it quits?? Go back to the hotel if you're gonna sleep, people! \n\nAnyway, Bacchanal failed to impress me, it was more quantity than quality. I had high hopes, but the food was just mediocre. I would have rather eaten at a fine dining establishment at that price. To me, it was a lackluster experience, but so glad I got it off my bookmark!"

S"Ever since moving to Southern California, we've been frequent visitors of Las Vegas and we've tried many buffets.  If you are ever visiting the Las Vegas Strip and you only have time for 1 buffet, then this is one to go for.  You should definitely go here at least once in your life; it's totally unforgettable and well worth the money that you are spending.  By the way, you can save on the cost if you get the total rewards card.  Not to mention, for all the crab that you can eat, it's well worth the $45/adult!  Ages 3 and under are free, while ages 4-12 cost like $23.  There's also Asian cuisine here, which is actually pretty good.  There's a lot of good meat here; in fact, the meat was so addicting that I got diagnosed with gout shortly after eating here last time.  It's okay; now, I eat meat again."

S"Beware, DIMINISHING QUALITY coupled with increasing prices.  Utter disappointment.  Just finished dinner on Sunday night at $57 per head.  No king crab legs, only snow crab. Not to mention the most watery not sweet puny stone crab claws I've had.  My Gf said the oysters were too sandy so she had only one.  Dishes are not in individual portions like they were in the past but like all low quality buffetts, dishes sit in large vats getting mushy and overcooked. This effect made the clams and mussels all dried and rubbery. Crab croquettes and crab fried rice no longer available.  All corn and no lobster in lobster chowder. Carne asada tacos chewy and not even close to par with King Taco.  Real gelato no longer served but instead sub with super sweet cheap ice cream with fake plastic props in display case.  Total waste of money. Food was overall too salty (pho, bbq )or too sweet(ice cream). And really?! Displaying decorative seashells instead of awesome fresh seafood that used to be in the seafood station. Real gaudy."

S"This buffet was okay, but personally I think the Wicked Spoon was a lot better.  We used the new virtual line system and put our names in at 4:30pm.  We had a party of 11 and were told to come back at 5:51pm to enter the main queue to get in.  We got into that line and ended up waiting until roughly 6:45 to actually get seated.  It was pretty ridiculous.  I would recommend going a little earlier if possible because the VIP members were getting a high priority holding up the regular queue.  Once we were seated, we got up and ate.  \n\nThe first noticeable difference between the Bacchanal and the Wicked Spoon is that there is much more variety here than at the Wicket Spoon.  Although the quality of the food seemed significantly lower.  The food here wasn't very exciting, but they had a lot of the typical things you'd expect from different food ethnicities.   The food was just average, it wasn't as adventurous as the food you'd see at the Wicked Spoon buffet.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n-Virtual wait line might save you some time\n-Large Variety of Food\n-Seafood is pretty good\n\nCons:\n-Seat time varies depending on the VIP members in line\n-Despite the variety, none of it is particularly memorable"

Those 2 staffs served only their "DIAMOND" guest. The rest, just keep waiting, they don\'t care!!! \n\nWhen I complain to one of their staff, she complain to manager, who standing and do nothing, I just got bluffs back that he will kick me out from the hotel!!!

There's a seafood station, a meat station, Asian food station, and pizza! There was also an area for just cheese!!! We caught the beginning of dinner and was able to eat a lot of their dinner items. There was sushi also but sushi was only ok. Here's a list of what I thought is good:\n1.  lamb chops\n2.  cocktail shrimp (these were jumbo sized shrimp!!)\n3.  snow crab legs\n4. clam bake\n5. non-baked cr\xc3\xa8me brulee \n6. mochi ice cream (sesame flavor was sooooo good!)"

S'We were excited to try bacchanal after reading the reviews here. We got there around 9am Jan 23 2013. There was no one manning the omelete station so I grabbed some scrambled eggs and hashbrowns. The eggs were dry and the potatoes were ice cold. \nI grabbed a mini quiche in the cast iron skillet. It was so overcooked it could barely be scraped out of the pan. The guacamole was greyish and tasted like pure lime juce.\nThe bagels were ice cold and there was nowhere to toast them.\n\nI asked the waitress for a drink menu because I had just arrived in Vegas and my wife wanted a mimosa. The waitress (an older african american lady) stated "this menu only has alcohol and it\'s 9am" We said we wanted to order it anyway, the waitress rolled her eyes and stated  "you\'ll have to pay me for the drinks because they are not included" We already knew that but were dismayed by her snotty attitude.\n\nMy wife got some pancakes off the buffet but after searching neither of us could find any butter. We asked our waitress for some and she said "it\'s on the bar" and dismissively waved her hand in that direction. I went back up to the pancake section of the bar and there was none so I asked one of the cooks.\n\nHe grabbed a giant sysco tub of margarine, and scraped some into a cup with his fingers and handed it to me without a word.\n\nMy wife and I were disgusted at this point. We had cold food, the prep stations were unmanned, the other food was unseasoned and inedible and the waitress was rude, snotty and unhelpful.\n\nI wish I had gone to the buffet in the Paris.'

S"This was my second visit to Bacchanal! The first was 25 year ago, then it was amazing and mesmerizing. It was my first BIG VEGAS Dining experience. I remember that long walk back to that corner and those steps that are now gone, boy that was a fun night! I ate so well and drank wine, service was so good and kind, I felt special, and have always loved Caesars Palace since!\n\nToday I had lunch at the new Bacchanal, I have had it on my short list for some time and although dinner wasn't in the cards this trip lunch today worked out just fine.\n\nLets start with me breaking the cardinal rule of no pasta, but I couldn't help myself because I had some BBQ in front of me. both were missteps. The BBQ sauce was off and the meat was too smoky. It was tender and generous, and the mac was grainy and overcooked but still an awesome effort from any buffet. \n\nThe salad bar had been devastated and almost all of the veggies gone and not replenished but I had some arugula, field greens and Maytag Bleu Cheese from the next station, and red wine vinegar, it was stellar.\n \nOther stand out Items included Chinese BBQ pork, California Roll, although the F&B manager would be proud of the amount of rice used (lots). I enjoyed the Shrimp and crab but not the lobster corn chowder from the seafood station. The Deserts are very cool and all bases are covered. The Peanut butter and chocolate pop was my favorite, but the Oreo mousse was also delish!\n \nI had 6 small plates including desert all were good or better, service was efficient and friendly, what more can you ask for. As far as value it was fine, I knew the price and never felt cheated.\n\nWill I return, you bet, only for dinner! and we shall have wine and celebrate the abundance of food before us!!!

S'We were on a return trip to LV and becuase we had some friends who loved this buffet we decided to give it another try, maybe it was "grand opening" issues that they worked out.\n\nI will say the lines were not near as long, we went this time on a Sunday night.  The meat station still had a line that you had to wait in, in my opinion this is becuase all the meat is centered around a 6 foot carving station unlike other buffets where they may have multiple carving stations.\n\nThe food quality was as good as Wynn or Bellagio but I wouldnt say heads an shoulders better for the price.\n\nJust OK in my book.  I wouldnt say no to going back but I think I would be just as happy at the others.'

They have over 500 items to choose from several culinary backgrounds such as American, Mexican, Asian, Japanese, Italian, BBQ and my favorite Seafood! The line for this buffet is very long, thanks to our high roller in our party, we got the expedited line. If you time it right, you can pay lunch price and get all the dinner entrees. We came around 230 pm so we still paid $38 for the lunch price, so by the time we were seated we got to try the end of lunch entrees and the new dinner entrees coming out. \n\nThe King crab legs are served over ice and are sweet and tasty. Fresh Oysters on a half shell were delicious especially topped with the vinegar sauce. The cooked shrimp were humongous! Prime rib was excellent, cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The lamb chops had a really great flavor but over cooked for my taste. There are also many different varieties of desserts. My favorites were the green tea cream br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, carrot cake and lava cake. Definitely come hungry so you can try all the different yummy varieties of food.'

Dessert station was INSANE. there were like, 16 varieties of sorbet, several kinds of cake, pastries and fruit.. oh god, I'm drooling just thinking about it. \n\nHave a large (6+) Party? They have a multitude of tables to accomodate your party, and if you're a 7-star or Diamond club member, you get your own semi-private rooms/seating areas (though unfortunately you'll have to mingle with us common folk in the buffet lines. \n\nYou HAVE to eat here at least once. :) Definitely coming back."

S"Bacchanal -- IMHO -- rates a solid Meh (or three stars). Part of that may just be my problems with buffets. I don't enjoy overeating and hate to see food wasted -- which it is by the plateful here.\n\nDoes it represent good value for the money? If you're eating breakfast or lunch, the price is much more reasonable than dinner. And it seems to be pretty easy to get in at those times (zero wait for me at 11am on a weekday) so you save on the added cost of excessive waits that others have written about here.\n\nService on my visit was friendly and prompt. No complaints there.\n\nBacchanal is probably a good bet for the chronically undecided, those with fussy children, or those with enormous appetites.  Otherwise, I think you're better off spending a few moments thinking about what you'd like to eat and seeking that out at one of the multitude of places on the strip. You'll probably pay less and have an all around better experience."

S"It's a welcome change for Caesars to introduce a new buffet for us. The old buffet was very forgettable and small. I tried it once and never went back again. So this new buffet has plenty of hype and a long ass wait on a holiday weekend. \n\nWe waited for over 2 hours. It went from a late lunch to dinner once we got seated. I'm sure it's not too bad on a regular weekend but this was unbearable.\n\nThe layout is very sleek and modern with plenty of glass and silver accents. The size of the place is also pretty spacious with plenty of walking room.\n\nI'll go over some of the highlights of the food stations as best as I can remember:\n\nAsian\n-They had a pho/ramen station. The pho was above average for a buffet.\n-Typical Chinese stir fries, BBQ meats, sushi, and dim sum selections\n\nSalad\n-Very simple salad station with limited choices\n-I like the idea of salad dressing in plastic bottles, much easier to use\n-Pre-made salads were good (Try the Watermelon and Feta Cheese)\n\nLatin\n-Street tacos made fresh on one of those rotating platters\n-Good salsa bar\n-Pozole (I didn't get to try but it looked good)\n-Tamales\n\nItalian\n-Various kinds of Pasta and Pizza (I didn't get to try this station)\n\nAmerican/Meats\n-Prime rib and Rib Eye Lollipops which were delicious! The beef was tender and flavorful\n-Sweet potato fries and tots (Good but salty)\n-Sliders (They were dry)\n\nSeafood\n-Very long line\n-Cold and Hot crab legs (Cut in half so it's easy to eat)\n-Raw oysters\n-Stone Crab Claws\n-Seafood Gazpacho\n\nDessert\n-Crepes made on the spot\n-Exotic flavors of gelato (Chili Mango for example)\n\nThere were a few more stations which I don't remember...I recall a cheese and bread one.\n\nService is very prompt and your empty plate is usually gone when you get back after a round. The food overall is above average. Some of the items were excellent, some were subpar. But more good than bad.\n\nWould I come back here again? Only if there's no wait. There are a few other buffets I place above Bacchanal at this moment. But that can change if they improve a few minor quirks."

I only marked it 4 stars for the simple fact that the quality of the food was inconsistent.\n\nIt did take quite a bit from paying to the time we sat which had me a bit disgruntled, but I'm certainly not going to ding any points for that. The layout itself is quite massive. There are literally stations everywhere and just when you think it's done there are.....You guessed it.....MORE STATIONS!\n\nI tried to sample anything and everything that looked appealing, but still found myself hovering around the seafood station and slider areas. I was a fan of the shrimp as it was both soft and did have some great flavor to it. The hit seemed to be the kobe slider, but for me it hit a sore spot. The first one I had showed me why I waited forever as it was moist and tasted like I hit a jackpot in my mouth, but the second time around all I could taste was char and couldn't eat another bite. \n\nAs I said it certainly pays off well beyond the price tag if done the right way. There is great selection and I'm certain something for everyone. The etiquette of the people in line could use an improvement, but that certainly is not the fault of the staff nor Caesar himself."

The food selection is a bit more gourmet than some of the other buffets in town, although it's certainly not french food, and the quality is a bit better too.  They offer a pretty wide selection of Mediterranean items as well as the usual buffet fare like salads, prime rib, pastas, etc. As for the desserts...it's all about the crepes!"

The only food I liked from this buffet was the salmon. The price was really high. So I made a reservation around december 1st and on that time they said the price will be 30 dollars but when we got there they said 35 dollars and that is the holiday price! anyways with the reservation we did not have to wait in any kind of lines and as soon as we got there we went through VIP door. don't go there If you don't have any reservation because there will be a huge line and long waiting time! The waiter, Tram, was a really nice guy and he did his best to provide the best service."

S"Le Village Buffet (Paris)\nLas Vegas Strip, NV\n9am Tuesday 6th August 2013\nFour Stars\n\nNo matter the day or how early we get up, there is always a line which is sort of a testament of how good this brunch buffet is.  After 30 minutes in line, we paid $22 for the Buffet and $12 for AYCD (Mimosas/Bloody Mary's).  I ate 7 types of meat (Bacon, Turkey Bacon, Canadian Bacon, Smoke Bacon, Ham, Andouille, and Corned Beef), 4 types of Potatoes, (Regular Hash Browns, Triangle Hash Browns, Potato Lyonese, and Hash, and 3 types of eggs (poached, scramble, omelet).  I also enjoyed an asparagus, chicken, cheese and tomato crepe with a garlic cream sauce.   I love Buffets because you can make your own unique food.  I took one of their mini waffles and topped it with a poached egg, Hollandaise, and Corned Beef & Hash.  \n\nThe service was slow on my mimosas, I only enjoyed 4 flute glasses worth."

It seems people in this city prefer quantity over quality. NOT my thing.\n\nBUT Then came La Village Buffet...the answer to Vegas mediocrity had been infront of my eyes all along in my very own hotel! (The hotel I was staying in I dont own Paris Paris...I wish!) \n\nWhat got us to give another buffet a go once again?? Two things!!\n\n1. We were famished..\n2...$5 all you can drink Mimosas...... need I say more??? ;) No...I need not.\n\nIt was a breakfast paradise and I am the kind of person who typically just has coffee and a pastry for breakfast... but this was enough to turn breakfast into my favorite meal for a day! A Crepe station, build your own bagles and lox, all sorts of eggs and fresh fruit lovely potatoes and hash......turkey and chicken sausage and bacon.....It was all great quality food as well and choice cut meats\n\n.... this was really the best buffet in Vegas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nSo I just read my own review after about a year and... I think the company and the Mimosas really heightened the experience that night...\n\nStill the best buffet I had in Vegas without a doubt though.'

The Best Buffet in Las Vegas is in Paris - Le Village Buffet. I agree that if you are craving for steak or Chinese, definitely this is not the location. However, if you are just craving for delicious good quality food... this is the place!!! \n   \nIf I don't go to this one, I go to the Rio Buffet for a change sometimes.

S"Best buffet food I've had, to date. Le Village Buffet offers a wide variety of French inspired dishes that are freshly cooked with very little in cost over the average resort buffet. They had everything from fresh crab legs to a vegetarian bar (which, although I am not a vegetarian, had a great selection!) The prime rib was five star for a buffet style restaurant. \n\nThe minor reasons I gave this buffet a 4 and not a 5 was for the following reasons; There was a severe lack of claw crackers or tiny forks for the crab legs/claws, which just seems sadistic given the freshness of the meat. They appeared to be seating 'non-diamond' customers in a separate room, alway from the actual buffet. I don't have a problem with preferred customers getting faster seats or discounts, I just felt like I was in some sort of containment camp for poor people. And the sushi was just average, if your going to serve sushi, serve it right. The rolls were boring (cucumber & california) and I couldn't find a small cup or dish for soy sauce, which means I would just have to pour it over the rolls and that is just wrong!\n\nAll in all that is a great buffet for the money, and really spices up the standard buffet selection. Last but not least, save room for desert! The desert section is more impressive than some restaurants have, only time I've ever done seconds on a buffet dessert table."

Once we got to our table it was all good. My wife and I ate probably about $200.00 worth of crab legs alone. The mashed potatoes, mixed veggies, prime rib and everything else that I could not remember was really good. The buffet area is really large, but the only down side is that you have to leave the buffet area to use the restroom. It was all good. I know there are a bunch of other places to get a good buffet in Vegas, and we will probably try a different one depending on where we stay next time. We gave it a try and we were not disappointed. We would eat here again and would recommend anytime to anyone.'

S'New Year\'s weekend... crazy lines... of course! But luckily I\'m Asian and therefore have a family of gamblers who have platinum players cards... so that means SKIP THE LINES!\n\nThe service at the buffet was definitely great, we had come for dinner on New Year\'s eve night only to find that the place was PACKED! They have a pretty good selection of meats, a few pastas, and of course they have a carving station.  I was slightly disappointed that when certain foods were out, some weren\'t refilled as quickly as I had hoped.  It was definitely a plus that the crab legs were slightly already cracked for you, but claws and such were a bit hard to eat (and the claw is my FAV!).  I do believe that it\'s pretty pricey for what it is, especially when there are other buffets that I think are just a tad better.  Their dessert station was also only "okay" for me - though they do get a thumbs up for having creme brulee!!\n\nI hear brunch is fabulous... I definitely need to go back for that!'

($11.99 per person) The Buffet costs $36 to start you think they would include this. As it turned out they re-nigged on the mixed drinks. The prime rib was cold and dry and tasted like it was a reheat from the day before. I tried 3 different shell fish dishes and all were cold, they were supposed to be hot so was a little worried about temp control. The crepes were not good at all kind of doughy.

No one was around to even ask for refills, and when we asked for a crab cracker the lady said they didn\'t have any, after she brought in another table that table got the crackers. So I pulled her aside and asked her for a nut cracker and she was like "oh yes, I suppose we got some in today" This was my WTF moment. I had to ask 3 different people for extra napkins or even a refill because the first 2 would forget. It was just horrible. \n\nThe Food was not great for a nice hotel like this.

S"I've only enjoyed this buffet for breakfast, but it was excellent!\n\nArriving around 9 AM, we were the only two guests there under the age of 60, which gave us a chuckle.  Why we were up and at'em that early in Vegas is another story altogether.  Anyway, we did have somewhere in the vicinity of a 20-minute wait to be seated, but it was worth it.\n\nThe buffet is broken up into multiple stations, each offering different regional French fair.  There are obviously your standard breakfast items available, but the more abstract items really drew our attention.\n\nThey have $10 bottles of wine (yeah it was breakfast, what of it?) and a great crepe station.\n\nI highly recommend this buffet for breakfast."

S'This is one of my favorite buffets in Vegas, but why did I only give this place 1 star?!? Because of the AWFUL experience I had in March 2011. I took my girlfriends here to eat on a Saturday afternoon, excited to fill my stomach with some French delicious-ness. We got through the line and we waited at the front to be seated. I felt that we were standing there for an eternity before we got seated at an awkwardly placed table that faced the line. Basically, everyone in line could stare at us as we ate. We felt uncomfortable and asked this waiter named DANRICK (tall, dark Philipino male) if we could move to a more secluded table under the faux trees. DANRICK gives us a look and tells us that the area we requested was reserved for VIPs (which was understandable). He then goes on to say that we can go back to the end of the line to request to be seated in the VIP section. I said, "No, that\'s not necessary," but he continues his tirade by picking up our receipt and pretends to take it to the front so we would have to go back in line. I repeated that we were fine where we were and eventually he went away. I have never been so UPSET at the service I received. I even complained to our waitress, who acknowledged that he was like that and she apologized for his behavior. DANRICK\'S behavior was inexcusable and intolerable. He ruined our day and he needs to be fired.'

S'muy delicioso y no quiero comer nada mas! i don\'t know why, but when i get really full, spanish becomes my first language (although i have no latin blood whatsoever, must be from a past life)! \n\ni\'ve been to paris\' buffet three times now, and this third time was THE BEST! i\'ll never forget the sugar-free raspberry chocolate mousse that forced me to ignore the pain and anguish but rather to keep going \'til the last forbidden bite...and then get up and grab another one. \n\nseven of us took our sweet time, made our br rounds, let loose a few buttons, smuggled a few chewy cookies, and even my friend "eskeleto" got up for 3-4 plates and was deeply pleased with the veal (i don\'t do veal, but to see her skinny famished ass enjoy it so much made me smile big). \n\nwe definitely got our money\'s worth...$25 for a painfully never ending tummy pleasing feast. marathon diet starts NOW (okay, after the weekend, here we come mario\'s)!'

S"I thought this was awfully good as Vegas buffets go and not too pricey. Being the hotel is named Paris, they have some items loosely labeled as authentic French food. Authentic? Not really, but hey this is Vegas and it is what it is. For the roughly $20 cost, the handmade crepes and coq au vin was pretty darn tasty and authentic or not, I frikkin stuffed myself on it. Other good choices were the carved prime rib, eggs benedict, decent sized peel and eat shrimp and the mini creme brulee. It was packed most times we went but the line moves quick and the table service was prompt. We were so happy with this buffet, we didn't bother going out to sample the other hotel's buffets."

S"Le village buffet dessert has a 33% acceptable rating per Jon. The creme brulee was at least brulee'd here; however the creme lacked body and flavor. Cheese cake was the usual central kitchen fail. The \xc3\xa9claire was stale and creme was the same failed concoction in most of their desserts. The only acceptable dishes offered was their macaroons and flan. Macaroons were soft and moist with good flavor. Flan had body and was covered in light simple syrupy that doesn't over power the flan. This concludes the dessert review of le village buffet"

S"Of the buffets I tried with the Buffet of Buffets Pass, Le Village Buffet was my favorite (went there for breakfast and dinner).  Not only do they have a good selection of pretty decent quality food but I love the theme of this place.  As with the rest of the Paris shops area, Le Village Buffet is decorated to make it seem like you are literally eating inside a village and going to various houses/shops for your food...super cute!\n\nBreakfast included lox and bagels, various cream cheeses, mini quiches, made to order omelets, different flavored yogurts, fresh fruits, muffins and pastries and dessert crepes.\n\nDinner included not only French fare but there were also Italian and Middle Eastern dishes as well as sushi.  There were also tons of crab legs and cocktail shrimp as well as raw oysters.  However, my favorite was definitely the desserts.  I tried their creme brulee, flan, tiramisu, fruit tart, chocolate cake and a pistachio cookie bar thing and they were all delicious.  I probably got my money's worth with just trying their desserts...lol.  The desserts alone are enough to entice me back...yum!\n\nP.S. Our server introduced us to palmers (tea mixed with lemonade) and it is soo good and refreshing...you have to try it if you go!"

I'm not usually impressed with buffets because quite often they are mass produced food of poor quality. I was upset though at the fact that they started putting lunch out before their time for breakfast was supposed to end - isn't Vegas all about staying up late and sleeping in??

S'I went for dinner to the buffet. It was $27.99 per person, not including the alcohol pass.\nThe food was just okay, sure you get as much as your glutenous heart/stomach can desire but a lot of okay isnt as good as just enough of great. With so many options on the strip for dinner $30 per person can get you some pretty amazing meals.\nThey have a lot of italian and french inspired foods to choose from. Yes they have crab legs, but they are cold and not that big. Also prepare to bring you ingenuity because they dont provide crackers or those handy small forks. Even the roast beef and steak are on the lukewarm side.\nThe pastas are decent but again the quality of the selection of food is only okay at best.\n\nLook around for a better quality of food buffet or more than likely an actual restaurant. Plus then you can avoid all the people running into you while your trying to pile your plate high.'

The buffet has a huge variety and is satisfying to all palettes that may be in your party. It\'s a bit pricey but if you\'re in Vegas you should have known you were going to come out of pocket for just about anything there is to do here. The restaurant is designed in a very "beauty and the beast this provincial town" way with an occasional Parisian singing troupe performing on the cobble stone streets in front of the restaurant yet very lovely and charming for the nearby ching ching environment.

S"We tried the buffet at Le Village in Paris Paris on a friday night. We were smart to get the Groupon that came out recently so it was a good deal. I did see almost all the people pay retail $$$. The line was crazy, we waited almost an hour. \nFirstly, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. I get that the ambience of the place was nice, but apart from that I wasn't impressed. The French ambience does make the experience a little nicer, as the buffet is organized by food from different provinces in France. That was the only interesting part , the food and service were really average.\n\nFood - I wasn't impressed by the variety, It contained only French varieties, and no delicacies. In Vegas, one does walk in expecting some level of opulence, delicacies and surprises, especially if I am paying $40pp, which were missing. Of course, since it was only French menu, the few dishes they had were well prepared. However, as a vegetarian, there was barely anything tasty to eat. The made to order crepes were the saviors. Although, they were very nice, delicate and well prepared, I have had better cr\xc3\xaapes in food trucks in Austin. Apart from that, all there was, were 4 different kinds of potatoes to eat! Really, after All the hype about French cooking, I was expecting some nicely prepared vegetarian options. Even the bread collection was so mundane, you can find those in your local cafeteria. \nThe macaroons were the highlight of the dessert section, but again, what if they're flour less and delicate? A cookie is still just a cookie, bake me a nice cake! No cheesecakes, no tortes, no ice cream.\nThe seafood collection seemed ton be nice and people were enjoying the crab legs. There was a decent grilled chicken in a so called Mediterranean section, but nothing else looked interesting. I saw shrimp, clams but nothing seemed grilled or spiced. Probably the worst hummus I've had was here. Even the usual suspects, like pizza, Mac n cheese which are kid friendly were missing or scarce.\n\nThe drinks and Service - we had the bottle of wine with our package, but didn't feel like having it then. The server said, their policy was that they had to open it! Bummer. We got the red wine and it was a nice balanced Cabernet. There were other drinks like ice teas, sodas, mimosas,beers etc. The server didn't return for the remainder of our dinner and never asked to refill our drinks or bring any other. They have waitresses dressing up in old French maid costumes but they are really old and cannot keep up with the tables. There were so many empty tables, but they couldn't get them cleaned in time to get guests seated.\n\nI'd say, forget the French hype and go for a more traditional buffet next door at pH."

I didn\'t eat a lot of the stuff on my plate because it just wasn\'t good. The crepe bar was nice, but that\'s a given considering we\'re in "Paris". Very average buffet that I probably would not go to again.\n\nHowever our server was extremely friendly and kind. +1 for that =) I didn\'t think it was worth the price for the dinner buffet.. I would think it\'s better for a lunch/brunch. It\'s probably worth a stop if you buy the Buffet of Buffets (~40 for 24 hour buffet pass at 7 buffets) which is what I did the next day.'

Live cooking stations representing the regional cuisines of five distinct provinces of France are on display. Be prepared for a lot of cream and butter-rich dishes and an overwhelming amount of baked goods, potatoes and other starches.

You're way better off spending a few more bucks to go to the Bellagio buffet.\n\nThere is something very depressing about the lighting of this faux village. It is like perma dusk, but ugly. The limited food options do not make up for the environment. Among the offenses:\n\n- This place promotes its crepe bar, but it shouldn't. Le Village Buffet managed to do the impossible: It ruined Nutella. They slather on way too much Nutella for their crepes. There are no fresh fruit options available. My friend took a banana from another part of the buffet, cut it up and asked them to put the banana in a Nutella crepe. They didn't understand this and instead put banana inside and Nutella outside.\n\n- The only real seafood option was tiny shrimp that looked like it came from a freezer bag. You also had to shell the shrimp yourself.\n\n- Things like broccoli and tortellini were dry and undercooked. Even the pears -- something that requires no cooking, just putting out for people to take -- were so unripe they were inedible."

If you could think of a breakfast dish, it was there -- and it was well made. \n\nImagine our disappointment to discover that our beloved buffet has become nothing but a laden trough of processed dishes that taste at best--average.  \n\nSeriously, it all tasted like it had been bought from Sam's Warehouse. \n\nI give it two stars since they still have the freshly made crepe station and the service was good, but honestly this is not worth waiting in line for in anyway. \n\nIf you have eaten there before 2007 and remember it being awesome, you are in for an extreme let down."

Maybe the weekends is more; not sure.\n\nThe reason I didn't give it more than 3 stars is that I've been to better buffets in Vegas; and also their dessert selection wasn't all that good. and you would think that being a french buffet it will be all about the pastry!\n\nThey do have a crepe station which is a big plus; but still I've been to much better places in other hotels."

The line is ridicuously long to get in and we were all starving by the time we were finally seated.  You would think I would've given this a 5 star since everything always tastes better when you're starving!  But everything I tried was just Ok, and there were only a couple of really tasty items.  My favorite was the prime rib.  My piece was perfectly pink and juicy.  They didn't have as much of a selection as I had hoped....a lot of their selections are your standard breakfast fare like eggs and bacon, waffles, toast, etc.  Lots of fillers, so I passed on all of them.  Things to note were the crepe and omelette stations which were both fantastic but those lines are always pretty long so I just tried a little of my friend's.  Dessert station was pretty good, but choices were nothing special.  We did spot some macarons which we loaded up onto our plate, but they use a type of raspberry jam as their macaron filling and it was just WAAAY too sweet.  We ended up opening up the macaron and scraping out the jam...for every single macaron.  And that was still their best dessert.  The creme brulee came in a close second, but they were always out! \n\nI took off a star for their meager selections and long lines, and another one for the lack of preparedness...if you're running a buffet, the first rule of thumb is to ALWAYS stay up to date with your buffet items! Never let the items run out!"

I could not get a server to refill our waters and orange juice to save my life, and what we were given was warm. I hate warm water, soda, juice, milk, even coffee. I like my drinks ice cold, so that bothered me. \n\nThe food: Eh... it was okay. It was not worth the $25 per person cost, that's for sure.  Several types of eggs and potatoes along with bacon, sausage, mini French toasts, mini pancakes, croissants, muffins, bagels, fruit, etc... is what they had.  I think the only reason to come here and pay this price is if you plan on eating several full plates, which we didn't. We didn't eat that much at all because it was mediocre at best.\n\nEXCEPTION!!!!! The one exception is I did decide to try a crepe.  I got the #1 which was nutella with bananas, hazelnuts, and whipped cream. Okay, this thing was f*****g Delicious!!  With a capital D. It's the only reason I'm giving the two star rating. However, I'm sure you can find a restaurant that is much cheaper and get a wonderful crepe.\n\nAlso, after we left my boyfriend started feeling really sick and had to make several trips to the bathroom throughout the day.

Between the first and second rounds a MOTHER EFFING CURTAIN ROD fell from the wall above us, swung down and almost knocked the life out of my friend (whose skull was spared because I motioned him closer to say something at the very instant the rod came crashing down). \n\nMeal refunds, a switch from unlimited mimomas to straight up champagne (which our server kept pouring), three rounds of food, and a year later, WE WENT BACK. \n\nIt\'s THAT good. \n\nGranted, after the whole curtain rod debacle, we were terrified to be seated in one of the "indoor" areas, but the food drew us back in. The meats are cooked really well and are good quality- so are all the other hot dishes. The bread selection is exceptional, which is to be expected of a french buffet. I wish I could\'ve had more of the dinner options, but was out there was great (just can\'t remember what I had). Lastly, the dessert and crepes lent to making it one of the better buffets for sweets (this coming from a person who hates most buffet desserts). \n\nI haven\'t been back for a while since Studio B and M stole my attention, but this ranks high amongst my choices.'

The ceiling was all painted with the blue sky look and the servers, although experienced, were dressed in fairy tale costumes.\n\nThe food here was on point. The creme brulee was excellent as were the macaroons. All the other food exceeded my expectations for a buffet. The smoked salmon was very fresh and the crab legs were excellent as well. I like how the crab legs were sliced in half, so that I was able to merely scoop the meat out with a spoon. I was surprised to find out champagne was included in the meal!\n\nI should have come back again within 24-hours, but I wanted to give the other buffets a try.

I had huge expectations for this popular Vegas buffet, but I was disappoined. \n\nThe food wasn't bad, but I didn't sense the quality. I also expected much more variety. I felt there was too much of the typical, cheap, hot breakfast buffet food. They did have crab legs and carving stations and other meats and goodies, which was decent. I was super happy they had a crepe station, but the line was so long, by the time I got to the front, they ran out of the fruit I wanted! =(\n\nThe bottomless bubbly with my buddies redeemed my afternoon :) Gold stars for our wonderful server!

The food was good, although the crab was pretty salty and cold. I kind of wish I'd gotten a crepe, seeing as how I was in the Paris hotel and all, but I was trying not to fill up.

S"Where do I begin? Sadly, we were only here for breakfast, but even that and a hint of some lunch items was enough for me to give it four stars. I'm pretty sure that it was $21.99 per person for the breakfast buffet, which came out to $51 something. \n\nI'm not going to lie; sometimes, I felt lost maneuvering through the buffet because the d\xc3\xa9cor was a little overwhelming, and made it a little hard to find the food. that sounds a little dumb, but there was at least once where I didn't venture over to an area because I didn't know it was another station full of food. what i'm trying to tell you is that you need to walk around. some tucked away areas looked like they were just for dining, but there was even more food! what?!?!? \n\nagain, we were there for the breakfast buffet. I've never seen so many plates of eggs and potatoes, and potatoes and eggs! there was plenty of bacon and sausage, as well. They had brioche, waffles, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy. This review is getting hard to write because I really can't remember all the food that they had out! haha. Faves? Lyonese potatoes, and a pasta dish with truffle oil and asparagus. \n\nTheir dessert section had a LOT of croissants and other pastries, carrot cakes, cheesecakes, and cr\xc3\xa8me brulee. Faves? tiny chocolate cake, and creme brulee.\n\nThey had a made-to-order crepe station and omelette station. The hubby loved the two crepes that he loaded up on: caprese and mixed berry. I, on the other hand, tried an omelette with mushroom, ham, and eggs, which was yum. What i probably loved most about the buffet was that the two people who were operating these two stations were sooooo pleasant. They didn't seem to hate their jobs even though they were the only ones there to help their line of 10 to 15 people. I'm a sucker for great customer service. \n\nOk. On the contrary, our first server had a serious attitude. So much so that she was actually arguing with the table next to us. I'm not going into that too much because she was replaced by another server, who was able to smile and not throw straws or napkins at our table. \n\nAll in all, this buffet was probably the best we've been to in Vegas. The ones we've visited within the past two years have been such a disappointment and waste of money. Next time, we'll have to come back for dinner! Hopefully, the line isn't long, though. We got lucky coming here at around 9 AM-ish; line was practically nonexistent."

S"So after eating at all the popular buffets in Vegas, I was so disappointed in this one! We arrived at the buffet pretty late (for dinner) because we didn't want to wait in the huge lines, but our plan failed. After getting into the dining area, I was shocked at how small and limited the stations were. The seafood selection there totally sucked; the crab legs were tasteless and didn't even hold before chewing....All of the meat selections were extremely dry and hard to access because of the lines and positioning of the food. The best thing this buffet has to offer is their roasted vegetables, and deserts. That's it. I was craving a nice salad after eating so unhealthy and they only had one type of salad with about 3 toppings. \n\nThe waitstaff was pretty friendly but they were overwhelmed by how many people were in there at once. We even had to come back to a couple of stations that ran out of food because there wasn't more prepared to be put out right away. For $25, I would not recommend this place."

Nice buzz every time when eating brunch here, love it.\n\nI think this buffet deserves better ratings. I have been here many times and never had a problem with service, I find all the waitress to be friendly and very down to earth. The ambiance is quite dark and it may not be fancy schmancy looking like the Wynn buffet but I love the food.\n\nMy favorite is the prime rib, very tender and tasty. The made to order crepes stuffed with bananas or fruits of your choice are another highlight. Yes, they also have unlimited amounts of long crab legs as I know a certain population only go to these buffets for the crabs. You know who you are!\n\nCan't go wrong with the brunch buffet here especially with unlimited champagne and mimosas."

S"I was in Vegas last month and had heard about the incredible buffets, so I decided to give it a try. Everyone knows Caesar's is supposed to be the best but this place also had a great reputation. Key word is had. Don't get me wrong, there are still lots of good things about it. But there were also some things that could stand serious improvement. First of all, the meats were not good, kinda dry and just bleh. If you are charging this kind of money, you better have mouth watering prime rib and roast beef to start. Also, some of the side dishes were bland and uninspired. Yes, there was alot to choose from and the atmosphere was nice but for the price they are charging, they need to do more. The highlight of the meal was dessert. Creme Brulee was out of this world as were some of the pastries. The Crepe station knocked it out of the park. It was just sooo good. But the highlight of a pricey meal should not be dessert. The rest of the meal has to stand up on it's own and this just didn't. That being said, it was still better than some of the other major buffets on the strip. I should mention that the service could also stand improvement. Everytime I needed my waitress I could not find her. The dirty dishes piled up and I literally had to get up to get someone's attention. That should simply not be."

S'LOVED this buffet. We got access through the $59 for 24 hour access deal and ate here twice, one dinner and one breakfast. They had a line for fresh made crapes, as well as all the usual buffet staples. There was plenty to sample with every empty plate, that looked delicious (and mostly was).\n\nOne thing I will say is they do not staff wisely there. I tend to eat late, so 4:00 (which was my lunch) was a perfect time to just walk in. But just a half hour later the line spans down the block of Paris. All of this while the restaurant is half empty, they should really get more staff.\n\nSo of the buffet of buffet deals, this was by far the best of the four restaurants I tried.'

I had crepes, various meats, including a fantastic prime rib, mac and cheese, and chocolate croissants done closer to French style than American style. The service was excellent.  The chocolate croissants would probably have been better earlier in the day since by the time we showed up they were a bit old, but still tastey.  Would definitely go back.  Well worth the price, especially if you get it as some sort of deal.  I have spent more money on food with much poorer quality.'

S"If you're looking for a buffet on the Strip that offers a difference experience (in both food and presentation) from ordinary buffets, definitely try the buffet at Paris.\n\nThis buffet is a great reminder of what can be great about Vegas; dining in Le Village will immerse you into the feel and charm of eating in a nice village in France. From the setting to the waiters, and of course the food, the ambiance certainly sets Le Village apart from other contemporary buffets.\n\nBut the food. That's what we came here for right? And believe me, it won't disappoint. Beyond offering some of the more traditional stuff you'll see at every buffet, Le Village has French-influenced food (surprise surprise) which was a big hit for me. I definitely loved the selection and was able to try different things. And perhaps the best part of it all is that there's a crepe station to fulfill all your sweet-tooth desire. But be forewarned, the crepe line can get mighty long, so if there's an opening, it might be smart to grab one real fast. \n\nOverall, I've been here on a couple occasions and I had a stellar experience each time. Definitely recommending Le Village if you're looking for a buffet that's not at the Wynn or Caesar's."

Pastries, pie, and mousse galore! Divine! This is their specialty!\n\nThere are a lot of French specialties for dinner, which is really nice, and the layout of the buffet is super-nice. The different stations are set up to represent a different region of France (Bordeaux, Nice, Provence, etc.) and of course, different parts of the meal (salad, dessert, main courses, sides...)\n\nOf course, they have many buffet staples, which were also delicious.\n\nThe decor is lovely, it feels like you're in a Parisian courtyard.

I could not find any tasty to eat because everything was too filthy.\n\nHow did this place get an A?

That is an exaggeration.\n\nThe food stations have many things littered along the dishes and the counter.  I can't believe that there is no one here to pick up the scraps around the dishes (probably from other customer not being able to work the tongs correctly).\n\nWhy is the seafood right next to the fresh fruit?  That doesn't sound right.  The risotto was hard.  Everything has a french twist and that's what made the food taste nasty.\n\nThis is due to failed execution.  Why does the crepe look like a diaper?  Is this highlight of the buffet the crepes or the frozen custard machine?  That was the most enjoyable dish.\n\nTake an ice cream cone and get some frozen custard.

S'I\'m a little bit crazy, in that I generally don\'t eat at buffets...unless I\'m in Las Vegas. Yeah, I know. Weird.\n\nANYWAY, there always seemed to be a really long line for Le Village, so we avoided it in the past. However, I was recently in Vegas for a work event, and was gifted with Diamond status for the Harrah\'s "family" of hotels and casinos, so I was able to use my VIP status to bypass the line, go through the fancy area, and get seated right away. YAY!\n\nThe ambiance of the Le Village buffet gets 4 stars. They really try to make you feel like you\'re in a little courtyard somewhere in France, which is cool with me. Especially when I was coming down from a stressful weekend and just wanted to relax, eat, and drink. I didn\'t feel like I was in Vegas, which totally worked for me. Our server was really nice, and had iced teas and mimosas (YAY, mimosas!!) on the table right away, and our mimosa glasses really didn\'t ever get empty. I\'m a big fan of free unlimited mimosas, so I was a pretty happy girl from that standpoint.\n\nNow, the food. Honestly, from the ever-present line and a lot of the reviews, I was expecting to be wowed. And I really wasn\'t. I mean, the food was good, and this buffet is definitely better than some, but there wasn\'t anything terribly French. Or many things that I couldn\'t get at any other buffet, really. But there were some pretty good dishes that I did break my one plate rule for and went back for seconds: bacon and brie pasta, spicy mussels, garlic mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, lamb tips, shrimp (oh, shrimp. How I love you.), and the antipasti plate. The creme brulee for dessert was nice, but nothing to swoon over. The rest of the desserts didn\'t do it for me, which was probably good, after the second plate of the things I mentioned above!\n\nThe price was comparable to other Vegas buffets, and for the quality of the food, a better deal than at some of the other hotels. All in all, was it good? Yep. Was it my favorite Las Vegas buffet? Nope. Would I be back again? Yes, but I wouldn\'t wait for ages in a line. It\'s a solid option, though, and like I said...the ambiance is worth it, especially if you want to feel like you\'re not in Vegas for awhile.'

Their Brunch Buffet is much more of a standout. \nTherefore I'm rating it 4 stars for what i remember of the Brunch buffet and not rating dinner as very good, at least compared  to other buffets on the strip like the Wynn and Bellagio. Brunch, however, is a standout. Get in line early though! And no matter what, prepare to stand in line for a while- their service is slow and understaffed! Happened both times i went to this eatery., \n\nJust think French Breakfast and that that should get your mouth drooling. I miss how I had unlimited champagne for a time period which was included in the brunch package. And at that time, there were yummy berry platters and amazing cheeses.  Dont bother with the fruit crepes, however! The buffet uses canned fruits which make the crepes soggy and unappetizing.  Instead,  go across to Le Creperie which uses real fruits and the batter of the crepe tastes amazing!. \n\nOther good dishes at dinner:  they had a beef tips dish that was really yummy and excellent grilled veggies.

I have my go-tos, like the chili edamame and the truffle fries. They're all so yummy.  I have to say, the Ronin burger is also so yummy. Decently priced always helps too!"

S"So here goes my first review since I moved back to Vegas..... Bachi Burger failed to impress me the first time I was here almost 2 years ago. I was staying with a friend the other day who lived nearby and we decided to go here for a late night dinner.\n\nI was extremely happy I decided to give this place another try. The food is amazing and the service was excellent. My buddy already went back last night to pick up food to go. I ordered the truffled parmasean garlic fries and the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. My friend ordered the Chili Fried Chicken and Kiki's Burger. No complaints about any of the food. I was surprised at how good the Fried Chicken was. I wasn't a fan of the sauce served with the fries, but not a big deal.\n\nThe reason I don't give them 5 stars just yet is I'm still a bit disappointed in the length of time it takes for the food to come out when there is nobody else in the restaurant. It was much quicker than the first time I went (took 50 minutes then). But I guess good food is worth waiting for. Also, I still think they could improve the atmosphere of the place a bit. It still feels like a strange cross between a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant when they could be so much more. With food that good its a shame they are not busy all the time. Maybe it's the location, maybe its the atmosphere... I'm not sure.\n\nAnyway, I look forward to going back to try more delicious burgers! Hopefully I can bump this up to 5 stars in the future. Another plus was that the manager had reached out to me and apologized for my poor experience the first time around. That was probably the main reason I gave them a second chance."

S"Love this place! I had a miyagi-san, a wagyu burger w/ crispy onion strings, bacon, a fried egg, and an awesome BBQ type glaze. It was on a soft, eggy, sweet roll. Bangin burger! And cheaper than anything comparable you'd find on the strip \n\nThe truffle parm fries were some of the best I've had. They porcini mushroom sauce on them is soooo good. And the roasted red pepper aioli is the perfect complement. \n\nThe fried chicken appetizer was also awesome! Everything we had was so good! I'm definitely hitting this place up again when I'm back in Vegas!"

S"So we arrived to vegas a bit late and craved burgers. I've heard good things about bachi burgers and the pictures have always made me drool. Finally we got to try it and I wasn't disappointed!\n\nI'm not sure why so many people had such bad service, but we must've came on a good night. The service was great for us and the guy was really funny. \n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries - Definitely loaded w/ black truffle flavor! It was enough to share between the 4 of us. Nice and crispy, not oily at all\n\nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Their most popular item, presented beautifully! The over easy egg on top made everything delicious. Again, fries were cooked perfectly crispy, but I do wish they added more oxtail. Not that the fries were bad, but I actually prefer the truffle fries.\n\nShogun Burger - $25 for a burger?! My bf ordered this and I got to steal 1/4 of it. It sounded like the ultimate most delicious burger ever w/ all the ingredients listed: wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, miso butter, peach YUMM. Unfortunately though the flavors were all lost in translation to me. The only thing I could taste the whole time was the unagi...This burger isn't worth $25 imo\n\nKiki burger - I love shrooms! (I know it's vegas, but I'm talking about food here people not the other kind of shroom lol) There were 3 kinds of mushrooms in this burger: shiitake, enoki, and eryngii. Instead of angus beef, I paid extra to get the wagyu beef patty. The caramelized bacon and mushrooms made the burger stand out. This was my 2nd favorite burger\n\nMiyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - My 2nd favorite burger!! Again, that fried egg w/ the oozing yolk made this burger taste its best. The crispy onions & furikake added the extra oomph to it. For first timers I would recommend getting this to start!\n\nSpicy Miso burger - It's not spicy at all. The burger wasn't bad, but flavors didn't pop or stand out compared to Kiki & Miyagi-San.\n\nThe patties here were all requested to be cooked medium rare and they came out good/juicy. I really like the taiwanese sweet buns here which makes the burgers unique. However, after trying Gordon Ramsay's BurGR in PH, I believe the burgers there are a lot better. I wouldn't mind coming back though next time I'm in vegas and craving asian fusion burgers"

We came around 6:30pm on Saturday and we didn't have to wait.  It is a little difficult to find because the sign blends into the building.  \n\nThe service was great and place was clean.  The food was awesome, quite possibly one of the best burgers I have had.  I recommend the Spicy Miso burger.  The Oxtail Tail fries were awesome.  Who knew that a fried egg on top of the fries would be oh so good.  \n\nLoved this place!  I hope they open a branch in LA one day!"

The service was really great and we were a group of 6 so they gave a lot of good menu suggestions. We all ordered something different (not on purpose) and we were all satisfied when we left. I ordered the shogun burger which was really good and was extremely filling on its own. I shared the truffle fries with a friend just to see what they tasted like and i was not disappointed, i recommend them. Overall a great dining experience and DDD was right again."

Make sure to get the pickles appetizer, it's really good.  And all of the edemame are fantastic! Oh, and go for the regular fries with the pineapple ketchup--so good!  \n\nI downgraded one star because I've been here 6 times over the course of the past two years and never once has my order been 100% correct.  It's never anything major, but it's always enough of an annoyance that it needs a mention.  And I think it's kinda weird that they charge an extra $1 for additional ketchup for the already pricey fries."

S"Bachi Burger. I don't know what it was about you, but when I saw your sign it instantly intrigued me.\n\nMy sister's recommendation solidified my decision to give this place a try. When I went, it was during their soft opening. The waitress told me they had just opened and hadn't had a grand opening yet. Despite this little detail, the place was packed! And up till now, every time I go to Bachi, it's always full. This unfortunately can be a problem. Seating is limited and I once waited 30 minutes to get a table for 2. They did offer to put in our order so the food would be ready by the time we were seated. This also relates to a second problem I have with Bachi: the wait time for food. It takes longer than average to get your food once you've ordered it. But if you're patient, you'll be rewarded. Don't let impatience ruin your Bachi experience.\n\nDespite these few issues, Bachi Burger is awesomely delicious. I've had the opportunity to sample almost every item on the menu and everything is good. I appreciate the creativity and flavor combinations in the different specialty burgers. My favorite happens to be the Bachi fish burger (fish? at a burger place? i know...). With all the specialty burgers, I have had several family and friends choose the original bachi burger as their favorite, exhibiting that this burger joint knows how to make a good, simple, but very tasty burger."

S"I make a stop at  Bachi Burger whenever I am in Vegas, even when it's a matter of hours and not days. I am still in love  with the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, but my go- to burger lately has been the Ronin. They renovated the inside and it looks great, much more inviting. The drinks are always interesting and delicious, it's never the standard fare here. I really appreciate that, because who wants to pay for a meal that they can make at home? I can make a cheeseburger, however an Angus Beef burger patty with Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu Citrus Aioli is not as easily done. So the Ronin is a delicious meal that I highly recommend. I always leave Bachi Burger full and happy."

S'My friends took me to this off the strip burger establishment and i enjoyed it thoroughly.  How come the three stars?  It\'s because of the service unfortunately.  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries; this is probably the only place that has this dish!! It was amazing; if you have not tried stewed oxtail this is the place to taste it; unfortunately when brought out the fries were lukewarm and the waiter said "oh we forgot to cook it" Who says that?!?!  Well they took the dish back in and heated it up in the oven and it still still turned out marvelous.  For my main course, I had the Banh Mi Burger which was a spin on the vietnamese sandwich.  The burger meat was cooked perfectly and it had two fish cakes with the vietnamese fish sauce.  It was great.  We also had fish chips (divine!), parmesan truffle fries, and salt and pepper fries.  Unfortunately the service did not match up to the food.  At one point they did not have enough cups to bring us our green tea beverages.  The service put a damper on the great food, but this can be improved.  Keep up the good work with the food! I would come here again though and give them another chance.'

S"I guess since I'm the Duke of Bachi Burger (as of 9/11/2014) I should relinquish my duties as Duke, whatever those might be, to finally write a review of this place.   It took 60+ visits for me to come on here and officially proclaim: Bachi Burger is the best burger joint in town.\n\nI read all of the 3 star and below reviews and I feel sad for those reviewers.  Not because they don't have good taste, but because they clearly haven't experienced the Bachi that I've come to know and love over the years since it opened.  I will say that even though I am blessing it with 5 stars, I've definitely had moments where I questioned that rating, be it from visits where I experienced awful service, undercooked burgers, or the terrible, terrible practice of their writing down my credit card info every time I make a take-out order.  All of those are forgiven though for me due to the 85% of the time when everything is flawless.\n\nI've had almost everything on the menu.  My absolute favorite order is the Black and Green burger.  When they nail it, they absolutely nail it.   The Wagyu beef, bacon, blue cheese, spinach and mushrooms all form together like Voltron to make one of the best burgers I've ever had.  But there are 70 other reviews where you can read about that.   I also really like the Lonely Bird when I'm not feeling like red meat, which isn't too often.   Miyagi San, Banh-Mi, Ronin, all solid as well and belong in my rotation.   \n\nOne thing I rarely see mentioned or see people take advantage of is the build your own burger feature.  I've actually had several times just a straight up Bachi Burger with a Wagyu patty which comes standard with Lettuce, Tomato and Onion and anything else you want, but it doesn't even need anything else.  It's nice to know that they're not just putting lipstick on a pig, or in this case, a cow, and that the meat can stand on its own.  \n\nI hinted earlier at undercooked burgers and I will say that in my experience Bachi tends to cook on the lower end of the spectrum.   Medium-Rare which is how I would normally like it has come out too rare for me and Medium often comes out the way I'd normally expect Medium-Rare.   So I stick with medium for the most part. \n\nFor fries they do a decent sweet potato fry, and oddly enough I just don't get the hype over the oxtail chili cheese fries even though I've had them 5-6 times, once done over sweet potato fries which I think is a special order type thing.   Fries, oxtail meat, and egg sounds like my death row last meal, but each time I found them underwhelming and prefer to just go the Salt and Pepper Garlic french fry route.   The fries aren't at all what keeps me coming back here and I'd like to see them experiment more with different varieties, but it seems to be the same ones from the first day I went there and I'm guessing that won't change anytime soon.\n\nDrink-wise they do a mean sake sangria which I find irresistible, although pricey and they have Rogue Hazelnut ale, so I'm normally happy either way.   \n\nService can be inconsistent, usually due to how it's ALWAYS BUSY, but there are several very solid individuals who work there at the moment and they treat the Duke with respect, as they should."

We really wanted to sit outside but they wouldn't allow it because they didn't have enough staff. How do they not know how to properly staff for a Saturday at noon? When my name was finally called for my party of 3, they wouldn't seat us because my friend wasn't present, like its some 5-star fine-dining establishment. She was literally in the parking lot and I could see her in her gold Prius pulling in to a spot when my name was called. Then, when my friend got inside they didn't have enough menus for us so they couldn't seat us again! How does a restaurant not have enough menus? We were rushed the entire time and they kept asking if we were done 3 or 4 times while we were eating and kept trying to take our plates because they wanted our table. \n\nThis isn't a fine-dining restaurant!

S"Bachi Burger is a little drive from the strip, head towards Henderson. It's not too far but if you don't have a car or don't like to drive out of Vegas, then you're potentially missing out on an awesome meal. Even though this restaurant is away from all the city lights and sounds, it's still pretty well known as it should be. It seemed like a good amount of their customers were locals. Random out of towners like us would pop up probably either by word of mouth or Yelp of course. We arrived around 1-2 pm and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The interior is clean, nothing fancy, simple designs and decorations, but the food is another story.\n\nService was quite on point. Our waitress was cheery but not overly fake-friendly. She returned numerous of times to check up on us and to make sure our drinks never dipped below half way. Even the manager(s) swung by to ask how everything was. All that was missing was for the chef to come out and greet us which I didn't expect would happen anyways. \n\nBachi Burger seems like they're a mix combination of Japanese and Korean entwined with a fusion/gourmet twist. I saw both cultures' ingredients on the menu. To start we ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - with garlic aioli and a fried egg ($11.50). If you haven't figured it out by now, we Asians love to put a fried egg on everything: rice, noodles, burgers, and apparently now chili cheese fries. Forget house fries; order yourself one of these bad boys. You can easily share it between four people but if you're like the Craig R. who orders EIGHT items for two people, then this may not be sufficient. Check what he ordered in his review. The colossal mix was addicting and the skinny fries are a perfect blend. Then again, I'm biased against fat fries. When the server attempted to take the dish away to make room for our main entrees, I caught myself snarling at her because I wanted to eat the remaining four pieces. \n\nI was seriously stuck in between two places when it came to ordering my burger. Either Kiki's Burger ($9.5) - Angus beef, saut\xc3\xa9ed shiitake, enoki & eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli (doesn't it all sound heavenly) or the Kalbi Burger ($9) - Angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made kimchi, ko chu jang mayo. The Kalbi Burger won this time, only because Gooch who recommended this place to me told me to try it. Although I have full confidence in the Kiki's Burger, my Kalbi Burger was instant gratification. The mixed blend of Angus and kalbi sauce with the kimchi made me feel like I was eating at a Korean BBQ joint. To knock it out of the park for a grand slam, they should've or maybe I should've asked for them to throw a fried egg in it even though that might have be a little over kill. You can't go wrong with this burger. However, if I was to return I'd like to try Kiki's Burger to compare the two.\n\nI got to sample the Spicy Miso Burger and all I have to say about that is that it's not spicy at all. Also, my Kalbi Burger already had the knock out 1-2 punch so it would be unfair to say that this miso burger was mediocre. At that point, I was already mesmerized with my order.\n\nIf you have a car or willing to travel a little out of the Strip, then venture off to Bachi Burger for an appetizing meal. They do close late on the weekends: 2 am, so you have plenty of time to plan your visit. The prices are reasonable, the food is sick (& great presentation), and the service is superb.\n\nGood looking out Gooch Y. for recommending this spot!"

S"I was disappointed by my visit to Bach Burger for the first time. We took out of town guests here telling them how great it is. We waited 45 minutes for a table. I m so confused what happened to the Spicy Miso burger. I have had it a couple of times at the Summerlin location and loved it! This time the burger was smothered in a red sauce that tasted very similar to the sauce on the Kalbi burger. My friend got the Kalbi burger and although I love spicy, kimchi, and kalbi, that burger just did not have a good flavor. The sauce was something like a Sriracha sauce but overpowered the entire burger. \n\nAlso, I have tried the Truffle fries here and don't like the taste. The salt and pepper fries have a strong pepper taste and among 4 people we did not even finish 1/3 of the fries. The sweet potato fries are the best among the fries choices but the dipping sauce it comes with is gross. Way too sweet and strong of a taste, not complimenting it at all. \n\nI don't know if it was an off night or the chefs are just not as good or ingredients used were different. I really don't know why the experience was so different from the Summerlin one. We are big Bachi Burger fans and tell people we meet everywhere to try it and it's too bad this was a bad experience for the high price."

S"Premium burgers with lots of fixings at affordable prices makes this place a Vegas must-try!\n\nAfter hearing so much about Bachi Burger from fellow Honolulu Yelpers, I added this to my list of Must-Try's when visiting Las Vegas.  I've heard that the restaurant's owner originated from Hawaii(?), hence the menu's Asian and local influence.\n\nUpon setting foot in the restaurant, I noticed that majority of the patrons were Asian.  Not to be stereotypical, but it seemed like a good sign to me as a fellow Asian...haha\n\nMost of the burgers are very affordable, in the $10 range, though I did see a $25 burger which came with foie gras to justify its price tag.  The downside is that all burgers don't come with fries, which we had to order separately for about $4 per order.\n\nI think what makes these burgers so awesome is the unique variety of toppings/fixings you get on your burger:\n\nI got the KIKI'S BURGER which is an Angus beef burger with saut\xc3\xa9ed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli.  Supposed to be a popular choice.  As a mushroom lover, this burger was pretty bomb.  Not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but definitely up there!  The burger was juicy and the toppings were delicious and offered a variety of textures and flavors!   And the bun was heavenly soft yet still with enough substance to guarantee proper bun to fillings proportions.  My only complaint is that the burger was cooked in that sweet onion marmalade which was tasty, but a bit too sweet for me...\n\nKIKI'S BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ\n\nMy BF got the MIYAGI-SAN BURGER which is a grass fed wagyu beef burger with a fried egg, bacon, crispy onion rings, chili mayo, and furikake.  Also supposedly a very popular choice.  He really REALLY liked his burger.  I didn't get to try it myself since I was getting way too full from my own burger and fries, but it definitely looked like a burger any man (or woman) would love!\n\nMIYAGI-SAN BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#aMTZaqmcmkR_sifO0NEgtg\n\nWe also got sweet potato fries and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  The truffle fries were pretty good but the cheese made it a little soggy.  The sweet potato fries were also very good, but didn't justify the price tag for me.\n\nSWEET POTATO FRIES - $4.50 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#qcyiyggpwYcyI4XJdNihiQ\n\nPARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - $4 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#7erf_MxA6MMN-ueKQkzcUg\n\nService was just okay, though I may be influenced because a bowl of ranch sauce bounced off the floor and some of the sauce got all over my legs, shorts, and in my BF's eye when the waitress was taking away our plates.  Obviously not her fault, but she could have been a little more accommodating about it...\n\nBottom line, delicious burgers with unique ingredients and flavors!"

On our entry, we were promptly greeted & our generous hostesses had us seated right away. I say that in plural as one was in training & the other the trainer, which was very good of the "trainer" to inform us. \n\nOur very capable hostess, skated in & out of the kitchen with her pupil in tow, teaching as well as liaising between kitchen & customer.

S"Bachi WAS my favorite restaurant but I'm sad to say it's off my list for good. I've been an avid diner since their opening. It's literally a block from my house and has very unique eats. The service has always been hit or miss, but I've always returned because the food proved to be on point. With that said, my last dining experience was terrible - service and food.\n \n1. Our beer glasses were delivered hot and dirty.\n2. Our fries were delivered cold.\n3. Their burgers are served medium, so I always ask for medium well. My boyfriend asked for medium. Mine was served bloody and his was served well done. He ate his unhappily but I could not stomach mine and after we had to literally flagged down the waiter, I sent mine back. He brought back the same burger (which I had cut into) with the meat cooked to well. Again, not medium well. I found it to be odd that they would just reheat the patty, but oh well, I ate it. Mind you, this was delivered well after my boyfriend had finished his burger (I told him to go ahead because I did not want his to get as cold as our fries). \n4. Nothing was done to make this right. I posted on Facebook, tagged them, and sent a comment to their fan page ... and nothing. \n\nI realize dining experiences aren't always perfect; however, they should have comped my burger or offered a free dessert. This is why I turned to their fan page on Facebook and still nothing was done to rectify the situation. I'm saddened to say, we will not return to our once fav spot to eat."

The servers were very nice and prompt, the wait wasn't too bad but it would be great if they could fit in more chairs or put benches outside.\nNow the food. Every single thing we tried was delicious. We started with the chili chicken appetizer and it was crispy and sweet while the chicken remained so juicy. Combined with the sauce that accompanies it, it tastes almost like eating hot wings. I ordered the Miyagi-San burger which was insanely good. The fresh buns are the softest I have ever held and my burger was cooked just how I wanted it. The fries are crispy and addictive and all the dipping sauces pack a flavor punch. Lastly, order a cocktail because they are all so delicious and make the experience."

Yes we could've gone somewhere else when we heard it would be an hour wait, but we decided to stick it out, because if we had gone anywhere else, it would've been the same.  I was referred here by a co-worker. \n\nWe had the Oxtail chili cheese fries, which we alright, you don't really taste the oxtail, it's a bit sweeter, than just regular chili fries. \n\nWe also had the Waygu and Black & Green Burgers. Which were delicious! I have to say the best part of our experience here. The drinks were watered down. Even though it wasn't that busy by the time we got our tables, it took a while for us to get our servers attention.  Even with the vents on, it got really smokey inside the restaurant too. \n\nOverall it was alright, would i go back? Yeah, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."

S"This was one of my favorite meals while I was in Vegas last week.  I cannot forget Bachi Burger.\n\nI usually eat Asian food 95% of the time.  Until I went out to Vegas.  Coming from San Diego, I'm used to eating some pretty darn good Asian food which I haven't been able to find around the Strip.  I was talking to my cousin and he suggested I tried Bachi Burger.  He said that they had some pretty good Asian inspired burgers.  Hmm.  Asian fusion burgers.  Sounded interesting enough for me to drive there from center strip area.\n\nOk, now this place isn't close to the strip but its definitely worth it.  We came here on a week night at around 6pm.  I had the Ronin burger and my GF, the Kalbi burger.  I was impressed as soon as I saw my burger.  Wow, this thing was a mini-monster.  I loved my Ronin burger.  The Kalbi burger was pretty good too but the Ronin was definitely a winner.  Oh and the parmesan truffle fries... awesome!  I wish they came in a larger size.  4 bucks is a lot to spend on fries but the taste was bangin.\n\nI wish they opened a Bachi Burger here in San Diego.  I'd be a regular customer, no doubt.\n\nnote.  Weekday late afternoon traffic on LV blvd past the airport is a ______ !!!"

S'Well, first the wait was long, so I figured there must have been a good reason. There were many tables open for so e reason though.  We stayed, and got some drinks at the bar while we waited. First, my husband got a milkshake and thought it would be cool if they could put a shot in it. Since it WAS a bar and all. Well, the bartender obliged, but all the while telling all of his coworkers how crazy it was and weird and laughing about it. Making us feel pretty bad.  So we sit down, it\'s freeeeeeeeeeeezing cold inside. People are visibly shivering. We get our meal, I got the no meat burger, the consistency was so weird and mushy,it just feel apart in my hands!!( I\'ve had plenty of \'.no meat\' burgers that at least had the consistency of a burger!!!!!)  The waiter was supposed to deliver us our fries with our burgers, but he comes back to our table, when we inquire about them and acts as if we NEVER ordered them!!!!!!!! He said it would be another 5 or so minutes.. By the time we would have gotten those fries my burger would have been STONE COLD!!!!! So I said forget it, lets just go....... It was an awful experience, never going again. Honestly, I felt like I was in that show "Kitchen Nightmares".... Get a new manager for real. \nTHIS PLACE IS HIGHLY OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!'

The perfect crust is formed holding in a succulent specialized mix of ground Certified All-Natural Chuck and 21-day dry-aged ribeye"...GOOD GOD!\n\nBachi Burger is located in a small strip mall on the south side of Vegas. Bachi is a decent sized joint with a chill, relaxing vibe. \n\nThe menu is made up of burgers, steamed buns, sandwiches and salads, all made with Asian inspired ingredients. My honey, Eugine Y, recommended Bachi to me and boy, my baby boy was right; it was SO worth the drive.\n\nSince I don\'t make it to LV often, I went balls out at Bachi. This is what I ordered:\n\nMiyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake, caramelized bacon, & crispy onion rings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg                \n\nMr. Ho\'s Burger- Angus beef & pork patty, green onions, cilantro ginger, garlic, Hoisin Mayo, Lup Cheong, saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms, mizuna & a TARO Bun  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=aMy63-xKofPONtJqkZTVqg  \n\nRonin Burger- Caramelized onions, Japanese Cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ & Yuzu citrus aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=buuw6JhKpiwkp5ShWAqGqg \n\nPork Belly Steamed Buns- Pork Belly, cilantro scallions, radish, boiled egg, Chinese black vinaigrette & five spice Hoisin BBQ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dbB6j3SqnngaPORSemc2yw       \n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries- Parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=EI77DnK2YetftJkN_EnR0A\n\nDipping Sauces- Sun dried tomato aioli, pineapple ketchup, Yuzu citrus aioli & garlic chili aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dzbNYbrAZdjErCp-T5F8kw\n\nPortuguese Donuts- Coffee ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=u4J7iFwsi2cqeHtoxfcCcg\n\nWatermelon Milk Tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=M7ZF6_JdMOdCoDxqZnpfkA\n\nWe started with the pork belly buns and fries, both were amazing. The PB was so juicy and fatty and the steamed buns were perfect. The fries, because of all toppings, had an awesome taste. The dipping sauces were all tasty too. But the burgers.. oh their burgers were unlike any burger I\'ve ever tasted. My taste buds were in a state of euphoric shock. The intense flavors made me smile from ear to ear. I can\'t begin to describe how phenomenal each burger was. The patties themselves were so juicy and each had a glaze on them that tasted fabulous. And the toppings... so good, so fresh.  The donuts for dessert were great and their watermelon milk tea was easily one the best milk teas I\'ve ever had. \n\nPrices here are great. Everything was surprisingly reasonably priced. The service was great as well. Each employee we spoke to loved to talk about their food and told us all about how things are made and so on. \n\nSeriously, if I lived in LV I would be a regular here. I know I only visited Bachi once but I\'m so ready to call it my all time favorite burger joint. It was amazing. Please, if you like burgers check it out. It\'s worth leaving the strip for. TRUST'

S"4.5 stars. If I didn't eat at Holsteins a couple days prior, I would probably give Bachi Burger 5 stars. But in a head to head competition between Holsteins' Rising Sun burger and BB's Ronin burger, I'd have to give the edge to the Rising Sun... but not by much.\n\nThe Ronin burger ($9 - caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, sweet bun, yuzu citrus aioli on the side) wasn't as sweet as I was expecting, which let the savoriness of the beef shine. The other star was the onions, which provided most of the sweetness I tasted, along with the dressing and BBQ sauce. It's a messy burger after biting into the egg so prepare to use a few napkins. Even with all the ingredients it was a compact burger that held up well after each bite. There were no issues with stuff sliding out the back and falling apart, as can be the case with other burgers with a million ingredients.\n\nOne area where Bachi Burger beats Holsteins is with their fries. They're excellent and highly addictive. Truffle parmesan fries ($4) topped with parmesan reggiano, black truffle, chives, a light gravy drizzled on top and a side of sun dried tomato aioli.\n\nThey also have an interesting array of non-alcoholic drinks. The jasmine strawberry lemonade ($3.75) I tried was like 3/4 lemonade and 1/4 strawberry slushy on top. Not only was it a great looking drink, the light floral flavor mixed with fruit was incredibly refreshing.\n\nI should have ended the meal there. Instead I ordered one of their specials... an ice cream sandwich ($4) - vanilla ice cream and house-made whipped cream between two chocolate cookies. The cookie was soft, but not soft enough. When I tried to cut into it all the ice cream and whipped cream came shooting out the back. The cookie tasted decent enough, but as a whole the dessert wasn't in the same ballpark as the rest of the meal.\n\nDespite that dessert, this place is highly recommended. It's a great bargain when you consider going to a similar (or inferior) burger joint on the Strip will cost you an extra $10-15 more per person."

So still why the terrible review...its courtesy especially when eating with people you havent seen in quite some time to wait for all the food to arrive at the table to begin chowing...2 of our parties food took 30 minutes later than everyone else's to come out. appetizers came in too fast which were fantastic (sweet potato fries) huge gap in between that and the entree. the waitress kept telling us the kitchen was behind and that the burger was being made. 10 minutes later she told us that they forgot the order. finally after 30 minutes the burger comes out. i dont care how many orders you have, the next burger should have been ours but no...we watched tables come in and sit down and get their food faster.\n\nwhen coming to visit vegas, my friend told me this place was great and he wanted to try it. sadly i was a little disappointed not by the food. but its not always bad food that ruins the experience."

S"Bachi Burger is an absolute gem, offering tremendous value and tasty food in a very unassuming location.\n\nWhen entering the restaurant from the parking lot, you probably won't be expecting much.  I know that I was expecting to see a basic burger menu and not much else.  I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nThe menu is best described as Hawaiian fusion comfort food, which made a lot more sense when I read that the chef came from Roy's.  In addition to standard burgers, the menu has some unique Asian burger twists as well as tasty options such as pork buns.  There's also a nice selection of fries, a huge boba menu and an eclectic selection of beers and sake.\n\nI went with the most straightforward menu option to get a feel for what they could do with a basic burger.  I ordered the American Wagyu burger with cheddar cheese and bacon added.  The verdict: delicious and incredibly well crafted.  The bun was golden and perfectly soft, and the burger itself was certainly high quality and savory.  The fries added to the enjoyment, especially the truffle fries with a magnificent aioli for dipping.\n\nOh, and I haven't even gotten to the best part... the value.  The Wagyu burger comes in at an almost unbelievable $7.  Add cheese and bacon and now you're talking $9.  Truffle fries come in at $3.50.  These prices fall in line with restaurants like Applebee's, and the quality difference can be measured in miles.  I didn't get to indulge in any of the desserts (which sounded like they should be on the menu at a Michelin starred restaurant) but they're all $5.  This could be the best value in the entire city.\n\nI've seen several reviewers here bring up Burger Bar, and I respectfully disagree with those that say the Bachi Burger is superior.  However, my favorite customized Buffalo burger at Burger Bar is over twice as much money but not twice the quality or taste.  And the convenience of the location makes it that much more attractive.\n\nBachi Burger deserves to be a huge hit, and I highly recommend that locals check it out once.  Your taste buds and your wallet will be thankful."

I have read on some reviews that the service is slow... it\'s a busy place!  You can tell they take their time in prepping their food so that makes it slower, which is fine with me since I wasn\'t there for a "fast food" type burger.\n\nIn the two trips I had there I had a couple of burgers that were beef/pork combinations and they were fantastic!\n\nDon\'t leave the place without trying the pork belly steams buns as an appetizer or you have missed a real treat.\n\nThis is a place I would be a regular at working my way down every item on the menu.'

S"Went here on a lazy Monday afternoon. The place wasn't very busy (only three other tables seated). Had to wait a few minutes before being greeted at the door, but it wasn't long enough to complain about. \n\nOur server was very friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable about the menu. \n\nKiki burger, spicy miso burger, and Parmesan truffle fries were all pretty decent (even though the spicy miso burger literally had no hint of heat).\n\nThe only disappointment is that our server forgot to put in the chocolate peanut butter souffl\xc3\xa9. The dessert takes 20-25 minutes to prepare and we ordered it at the same time as our food. He said he would put it in five minutes after our food comes out so that it would still be hot by the time we were done with the burgers...but obviously forgot to do so. \n\nI guess it was an honest mistake, but we were really looking forward to that souffl\xc3\xa9 and waiting another half hour for it after our meal was not an option. Again, it wasn't even busy at all so I don't know how he forgot. \n\nAnother girl had taken over our table for him and ended up giving us a peanut butter chocolate milkshake to make up for the souffl\xc3\xa9. She was even considerate enough to put some berries in it so it was like the souffl\xc3\xa9. \n\nAs a side note - I can understand some of the other negative/impartial reviews about service. Not all of the servers were attentive/friendly. We did have to keep waiting for refills on our waters."

They fixed the cashier,  It seems to be a little pricier or I\'m just more broke lately. Fries could have been hotter but not cold by any means. Lonely Bird is where its @. I think they have made it sweeter more sugar in marinade. The pickles are super fun.'

S'Is it? Is it the best burger in Las Vegas? On the strip, you are definitely not going to find the best burger in Las Vegas. Trust me. I tried looking -- this means I spent a lot of cash paying for subpar burgers. Luckily, just before you hit Vegas on the 15, exiting East Windmill Lane, you have Bachi Burger. The Asian inspired burger joint was showcased on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives, and I immediately made plans for a Vegas trip -- I made it my first stop.\n\nWe started things off with the oxtail chili cheese fries. Most times, chili cheese fries or poutine has fries that are left soggy from the sauce. I liked how the fries were still intact and crisp. The ox tail was tender and was almost chili like -- cooking for hours helped make it into a mush of things. The garlic aioli and fried egg made everything so creamy and smooth. I liked the edition of the cilantro. It gave the dish such a freshness and helped with the richness of the oxtail. With the help of the jalapenos which were quite spicy, the dish was complete.\n\nThough the oxtail fries were good, we all came here for the burger. Morse specifically, I came here for the Ronin burger. This burger had angus beef, caramelized onions, jalapenos, coleslaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli. I know that seems like a lot of ingredients, but all of the flavors worked. I am a firm believer that a good burger has to have gooey melted cheese or a strong cheese presence -- cheese is always a must. I was surprised that this Asian inspired burger, with no cheese was so delicious. The beef patty was cooked perfectly medium rare with a nice crust and pink in the middle. The spicy jalapenos and the sweet bbq and citric aioli all bounced around and filled my mouth with flavor. If you were to get one burger at Bachi, this is the one to get.\n\nNot feeling like another burger, we decided on the pork belly steamed buns. Filled with an irresistable duroc pork belly, the meat was cut thick. The skin and fat on the pork melted in your mouth and created such an unctuous flavor. The boiled egg added more richness to the steam bun. The cilantro, scallions, and radish helped balance the rich fatty pork belly. Interestingly, the chinese black vinegarrete and hoisin bbq sauce gave the salty and sweet flavor of the mini sandwich.\n\nAs a dessert, and to send us off in a proper manner, we ordered the malasadas. To me, the Portuguese fried donut balls were out of place. To go along with the Asian style burgers, they should have an Asian style dessert. To me, the fried donut balls were a bit stale and not "melt in your mouth" enough. With the help of the delicious coffee gelato though, the dessert was passable. I wouldn\'t have minded if it were just the coffee gelato by itself.\n\nBachi Burger is a Las Vegas pit stop for sure. Next time, I will have to give the decadent Shogun Burger a try. That one has foie gras and is $25. Though not on the strip, it is a perfect spot to eat for lunch on the way in or on the way out of Las Vegas. Even if you want to kind of step away from the busy strip, it\'s not far of a drive to go to Bachi Burger. The inside has all tables and no booths. You just find a seat, grab a beer, maybe a nice sake to compliment your burger, and have an awesome meal.\n\nFor those who are in Los Angeles, well, Bachi Burger is coming! It will be in West LA, on Sawtelle. Not quite sure when it will open, but I will keep an eye out for you.'

S'If you live in Vegas, you NEED to come here (and damn you for being so lucky!).  If you\'re visiting Vegas, you NEED to come here.  It\'s seriously worth the little distance you drive from the strip.  And if you don\'t have a car, CAB it here, it\'s worth it, I promise!!!\n\nBH took me here because we needed a break from all the celeb chef restaurants on the strip and wanted something a little more low key with dishes at reasonable prices.  What I did not expect was that the food would be as good as the $$$$ restaurants with a $$ price!!  \n\nThe restaurant is very clean, spacious, and nicely decorated.  The waitress we had was very helpful and awesome.  We sat down and perused the menu, and we immediately spotted about 10 things we wanted.  We whittled the list down to a mere 5 dishes. . .the foie gras appetizer, the oxtail chili cheese fries, the kiki burger for BH, the Ronin burger for me, and a side of truffle parmesan fries. We finished it ALL.\n\nThe foie gras appetizer is only $12.50 and comes with salty mushrooms, sweet golden raisins, a beautiful reduction sauce and plump, juicy figs.  The foie gras was seared perfectly so it was crisp on the outside and soft and luscious inside.  Each bite rendered pockets of fragrant fat to explode in my mouth and coupled with the sweet raisins and juicy fig, I was on cloud 9.  The pieces of foie gras were also quite big. . .and for $12.50 I thought it was a steal! \n\nThe oxtail chili cheese fries were my next favorite. . .though it came a VERY close second to the foie gras.  The fries were golden and crispy, and very soft and fluffy on the inside.  The oxtail was so tender and almost melted in my mouth.  I don\'t like beans in my chili but I did not mind the beans in this chili.  It gave it a nice, creamy texture to the crunchy fries that was different from the gooey cheese.  The jalapenos were crisp and gave each bite a little heat, which offset the slightly sweet and salty chili, and the cilantro kept my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  Oh god, it was pure heaven. . .BH and I cleaned the plate and eagerly awaited our burgers.\n\nBH\'s Kiki burger was pretty good.  I am not a big fan of mushrooms but his was very flavorful, the meat was perfectly cooked (we ordered medium rare. . .the meat was browned on the outside and pink THROUGHOUT the entire patty!) the bacon strips were candied, sweet, and chewy, and the bun was soft and pillowy.  BH commented that the bread reminded him of cha shu bao - asian style where it\'s very light and fluffy, golden brown on top and just a tad sweet.  I agreed and felt the bun really made their burgers.\n\nMy Ronin burger was just okay.  I was a little disappointed that it lacked a bit of flavor, imo, but I think it may have been because I had foie gras and oxtail chili cheese fries before the Ronin, so my palate might\'ve been built up to expect something more. However, I think if they put bacon in the Ronin, it\'d made it even better than it already is.  But I think if I had the Ronin without all the luscious apps, I would\'ve thought it was perfect.  The meat, like the KiKi, was cooked medium rare, it was juicy with the soft, golden bun and the fried egg. . .it was a true delight to eat.  BH and I could tell they also put a lot of thought and time into their sauces, which came out very interesting and paired well with the burgers and fries.\n\n\nThe truffle parmesan fries were really good as well.  Like the oxtail french fries, they were crisp, golden brown, and had a nice, subtle flavor of white truffle with a bit of tangy parmesan.  It went with our burgers quite well.\n\nI was so impressed with the meal, I flagged down our waitress and begged her to talk to the owner so they could open a Bachi in LA.  She said the owner is in the works and is hopefully opening one by the end of next year!  I nearly jumped for joy.  She also mentioned that the chef/owner used to work at Roy\'s Hawaiian and just started Bachi.  They plan on opening a ramen house in a few months, also in Vegas.  Ramen is abundant in LA, but I feel we have a lack of great burgers, especially Asian fusion burgers.  \n\nOverall, I felt the burgers were like a combo of Umami (in terms of creativity and presentation) + Bun Bun (for the Asian- fusion style flavor).  Bot Bachi blows both out of the water. . .by far. \n\nThe bill was just a little under $50.  BH exclaimed that it "wasn\'t right" because he felt he was somehow cheating them.  $50 for 5 dishes. . .each made with such precision and skill as a $$$$ restaurant???  It was the best meal EVER.  I understand prices in LA might be a bit more, but I don\'t care.  I just want my Bachi!!!'

This past weekend while in Vegas I decided to head down there to give it a try. Omg! This place is legit, I actually ended up ordering the Ronin burger and truffle Parmesan fries and a 1/4 of my wife's Kiki burger, also so good! Lastly, we ordered the souffl\xc3\xa9 which was more like a lava cake with vanilla ice cream but so damn good too. Only bad part was the 25 minute wait for the souffl\xc3\xa9; but all in all, I needed to be pallet jacked out of there cz I was so full. Definitely coming back!"

S'Let me start by saying the food is very good but by the time you get it you will be so pissed off you won\'t be able to enjoy it. Now I\'m a complainer, I\'ll be the first to admit, but I\'m also a complimenter (which is why most of my reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star). That being said, I cut Bachi Burger quite a bit of slack on my visit because I know they might not have the experience in the business yet to know how important something like, I don\'t know, having glasses that AREN\'T chipped is (also I took a Xanax so that might have helped their case).\n\nOur server was pleasant, but like others, she disappeared after our order was taken. We all ordered a specialty drink and when I got mine I noticed the bottom was extremely chipped. I flagged down a second waitress (Jordan) and asked for a glass that wasn\'t chipped (you know, so I don\'t ACCIDENTALLY DRINK GLASS AND DIE) and she went to the counter, pulled one glass out, saw it was also chipped and came back with it to my table. "Well, all the glasses are chipped," she said, "Is yours sitting on the table weird or something?" Nope, it sat on the table just fine, I just didn\'t want to have to sue her place of employment when I cut the crap out of myself.  Whatever, I let it go and drank out of the chipped glass as I watched her walk to a table in the corner, sit and take her break for ten minutes. I drank out of the chipped glass as I watched a very tall gentleman, whose only job I observed in the 90 minutes we were there seemed to be macking on the waitresses, come over and chat her up. Fine, everyone is allowed a break, just maybe, you know, NOT in the dining room where everyone can see you including the 10 people waiting in the lobby to be seated. The rest of our meal went pretty much like many of the other reviews listed: food brought out in a seemingly arbitrary order, drinks going unfilled for 10 minutes or longer (at one point I actually went to the counter, took the pitcher and filled my drink myself), burgers that were requested medium rare coming out medium, etc. I had to go up to the counter again to order flag someone down to take my desert order and Jordan, the "Is it sitting on the table weird", came over to take it. Then ten minutes later our actual server came over again to take our desert order. It was just very chaotic and frustrating. \n\n Obviously the management at Bachi Burger KNOWS of these issues. They clearly read the yelp page and I\'m clearly not the first person to complain, but they\'ve done NOTHING to fix it. Maybe they just don\'t know how or just don\'t care because enough of us come back anyway, even with the poor service.  I would really like to see this restaurant shaped up Gorden Ramsey style. Whoever the tall gentleman I mentioned previously was I didn\'t see him do anything the entire evening. Strike that, he leaned on things and flirted VERY well, but unfortunately that didn\'t help us get our food. Everyone else, even the manager/owner, was running food so I don\'t know if they are just short staffed or poorly managed or inexperienced or all three. I give them two chipped stars.'

S'As I savored a bite of the Kiki burger, I looked at my husband and said, "Dare I say it? I think this may be the best burger I\'ve ever had."\n\n  "Those are bold words," he said, taken aback.  He took a bite out of his Banh Mi burger and, nodding approvingly, said, "...but I think you\'re right."\n\n We have scoured the Las Vegas Valley trying to find our premiere burger joint and always came so close but no cigar until Bachi Burger.  \n\n We started off with edamame and it wasn\'t the typical steamed appetizer you usually get a sushi joints. Their edamame is stir fried with chili and garlic.  We also had the truffle parmesan fries and were blown away.  It was such a great way to tease our appetites.\n\n My co-workers strongly suggested that I order the Kiki Burger.  After reading the description, I knew it was the one for me.  Everything was perfection. The meat was juicy and tasty, the bun toasty and crisp, the bacon and onions caramelized... all of the ingredients created a harmonious experience. The husband ordered the Banh Mi burger and it also didn\'t disappoint.\n\n       I am surprised that other Yelpers experienced bad customer service. We were greeted and tended to by friendly staff and we were checked up on regularly. We received everything promptly.  Timing between each course was perfect.\n\n      The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is really not that big of a deal but is a hindrance nonetheless. I ordered the lychee boba drink and I didn\'t taste a bit of lychee flavor in it. The husband ordered the calamansi soda. If we hadn\'t seen "calamansi" on the menu, we would\'ve thought it was just regular soda. For dessert, I had the fruit tart and the husband had beignets.  Both were good but I\'d probably just stick to the burgers next time.\n\n     I still catch myself daydreaming of the Kiki burger ever so often. I can\'t wait to find out what else Bachi Burger has to offer.'

I didn't get the fried egg on top, because we weren't incredibly hungry, but how awesome is it that you could get one on top!\n\nWe got the Kalbi burger and couldn't have been happier. The only thing that we weren't super happy with was the shishito peppers, we added them to the burger and couldn't tell that they were there. We should have ordered it on the side.\n\nSince we didn't get the burger with the egg on it, we did get the Oxtail Chili Fries with the egg on top. It was really really good. The chili could have been a touch more flavorful, but overall it was super yummy!\n\nWe will definitely come back here the next time we are in Vegas, and you should too!"

S'A buddy had seen Bachi featured on some Food Network tv show. Since I\'m an easy sell and pretty much a sucker for advertising, that was endorsement enough for me to search out this place.\n\nAs soon as I saw the Shogun burger on the chalkboard outside, I knew I had to be an idiot and go for it. (I\'m particularly susceptible to chalkboard marketing, I should add.)  The shogun is one of their specialty wagyu beef burgers with a layer of unagi, pan-seared foie gras (this is what sold me), thin slices of asian pear and miso butter spread. On the side they throw in a yamamomo peach. Not sure why but maybe it helps theoretically justify the $25 price tag.  \n\nBefore we get to the burgers, I gotta say that the milkshakes (all of them) were awesome. Creamy, thick and diabetes-inducing. I liked my strawberry-guava, but everyone else thought the peanut butter one was tops. \n\nThe much-talked-about ox-tail fries were a surprise. The ox-tail "stew" covering the french fries is actually a little sweet and tasted great. I thought it would just be chili-cheese fries using ox-tail but it had a different flavor than I anticipated.  We had to stop ourselves from ordering seconds so we wouldn\'t ruin our appetites. \n\nOkay, main event. So I bought the biggest, baddest burger off the regular menu. Did I love it? Honestly for the price I found it okay. The beef they use for their burger tasted good, and when I bite into a burger I don\'t watch sauces or ketchup to take away from the lovely flavor of cow carcass. The unagi was my least favorite part because its flavor really overpowered everything else (except for sweetness of the pear) and made every bite just taste like unagi. So minus the unagi, I\'m left with a good beef patty, pear and foie gras. It all tasted pretty good, but I wouldn\'t recommend it for $25.\n\nI also tried the Ronin burger which has a little sweetness too from a layer of coleslaw and I really enjoyed it overall. Next time I have to try the pork steamed buns and some of the other burgers as well. Maybe the Shogun didn\'t live up to my expectations, but I still had a great meal and will be back next time I\'m in Vegas.\n\nOh, and that yamamomo peach? Popped it in my mouth (it\'s about the size of a marble) and looked back at everyone else watching for my reaction. I shrugged, "Tastes like candy."'

But not to be derailed by their holiday closing we returned the very next day 37 seconds before they opened. Yeah, cause thats how Tanya S rolls!\n\nWhen you first enter you notice how clean everything looks. Nice tables, lighting ext. The ambiance was on! We were immediately greeted by the hostess who took excellent care of us as well.\n\nWe started of first with the pecking duck buns (~$12 for 3) and they were SO good. The pecking duck was toped with a slice of boiled egg and some greens.....it also came with a dipping sauce that was so tasty.\n\nNext we had to share the Truffle and Parmesan fries (~$4). These were AWESOME! The tamatoey dipping sauce was perfect and the overall taste just won me over.\n\nI had the Ronin Burger (~$9) and it was amazing! It was a teriyaki based burger with fried egg on it, Asian slaw, and caramalized onions. Every now and then I would take a bite and get a little too much ginger for my taste but the burger was amazing! The meat was cooked medium and the bun was so good.\n\nWe had planned to try desert but by this time we were stuffed! So on the menu next time we venture to BB: Ox Tail Soup and the mini doughnuts. \n\nIf I wasn't already taken I would marry Bachi Burger....just saying"

Not so much of rude but just lack of customer service or inexperienced. I think they try to hard to be a little fancy or proper but it just ain\'t happening in this joint. \n\nHowever, on a more recent visit, I dined in with my husband and infant (brought him in with his car seat) and totally forgot about the sucky service! The host walked us to our table and kindly brought over a high chair for my baby. He then flipped it upside down and said for us to place baby\'s car seat on there. My husband and I didn\'t agree with putting out baby (or his car seat) on the bottom of the dirty high chair where it\'s been dragging all over the ground. So I asked if we can just have another chair AND the response he gave me was baffling! He said, "So you\'re OK with putting your baby on a chair where he can fall?!?!" Yes, you\'r damn skippy, I gave him the dirtiest look AND he was lucky I kept my mouth shut. I replied, "yes and smiled (while doing whatever possible to put my baby\'s car seat on the chair the safest way possible)." Seriously, am I that stupid to just put an unsteady car seat on a chair. Anyway, point being, he should\'ve just it to himself. \n\nSo after this experience... I don\'t know if I will be going back unless I really have to!

Eggplant, tofu, red bean and a shitake mushroom patty. Ehhh. but it was surprisingly good, those ingredients went well together, I would have never ordered it for myself, but I am glad I tried it.'

After dining here, I've been telling everyone they must come to this place.\n\nFrom truffles on your fries, Foie Gras, and Delicious mouth-watering Burgers and so forth. I can't say enough.\n \nTheir quality of food is top notch.!!! I am in love with this place. \n\nthis place has also been on the Food Network Channel Dine-Dinners and Dive In with Guy Fieri"

S'The problem with over hyped places? They never live up the hype. Bachi Burger is the exception to the rule.\n\nIn the land of the $10 dollar burger, Bachi sits high above the rest. Tried the Ronin and it was just so damn bomb. Patty was meaty, juicy and perfectly cooked. The soy glaze worked well to bring a tangy, salty-sweet flavor to enhance the meaty-ness. The egg just brought everything together.\n\nOxtail chili fries are just that. "Oxtail chili" - a chili made from oxtail. I was somehow expecting big chunks of oxtail in my chili but I guess they grind the meat. My misunderstanding I guess. Still bomb though.\n\nA definite must try and/or return destination while in Vegas.'

S'Been to bachi and shoku a few times I like that they are one entity. The added bar is a very nice touch. Our server Dan was excellent and knew the menu very well and had some great suggestions. I was able to order from both menus which was a bonus. My oxtail chili cheese fries and octopus pancakes as apps were outstanding. My ramen was to die for. We enjoyed our food soooooo much I had to ask our server for the name of the chef. Chef Don was on point with all our dishes. Thanks Bachi and Shoku we will definitely see you soon'

S"Went here for the first time a few months back. I had never heard of it and had no expectations other than some of my friend saying it was a really good burger place. \n\nWent with a group of about 15 so we had to wait about 20-25 minutes which was fine considering our group took a little while to filter in. \n\nEveryone on yelp and in person raved about the oxtail chili cheese fries. So we got a couple orders to share amongst the group. All I had to say was... OMG!! The chili was flavorful. The fries were my perfectly fried in my opinion: nice and crispy on the outside with the right amount of creamy potato goodness on the inside. The oxtail moist and delicious. \n\nPer the server's suggestion, I ordered the Miyagi-San for my burger. When it came, it looked good. It was a pretty hefty burger. But, nothing will compare to that first bite. I died. It felt like the perfect fusion of a burger and Asian flavors. Perfectly cooked to my medium-rare order. Juicy. Savory. Simply amazing. \n\nA lot of people compare it to Umami Burger over here in CA. In my opinion, I liked Bachi better. But I hear it's a pretty close race and all a matter of preference (much like the in-n-out / shake shack debate). \n\nFast forward to this past weekend...\n\nI took a group of friends who had never been here before. I told them it was definitely worth the price (~$10-$26 for a burger). \n\nWe got a few appetizers because it was our only meal that day. Ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, truffle Parmesan fries, and pork belly buns. \n\nWhile all delicious, the pork belly buns were definitely the hit! The pork belly was so moist and melted in your mouth. For some, these were the highlight of the whole meal!\n\nFor our burgers, a lot of my friends ordered the Miyagi-San per my suggestion and they loved it! The few that ordered something different (myself included; spicy miso, kalbi, and banh mi burgers) still thought they were good, but not to the same degree as the Miyagi-San. \n\nWould definitely recommend this to everyone whenever they're in Vegas! And I hope the one in LA is completed soon so I can treat my stomach to this amazingness more often!"

S"So good, i could die, It's a gourmet burger and you really get what you pay for. It's a great vibe, super nice decor, asian fusion style bugers. I come here everytime because all burgers on the strip disappoint. Ronin burger is a great great burger to start off with, come back and try everything. There is boba so that is a huge plus if you are having that asian craving inside you, I know everyone has it. Service is great and I always leave happy and full. My tongue and heart sing in harmony as a take every bite, and the heavens ring as the joy of my stomach reaches fullness and its enlightenment."

S"Let's just say I'm from San Francisco and I make a trip to Vegas 2-3 times a year and it's now going to be a tradition to go to Bachi as part of our itinerary. THAT, or I'm not leaving until I get my Bachi fix!\n\nIt's SO WORTH the trip away from the busy strip of Vegas. I've always loved Asian fusion burgers mainly because of the execution of pairing Western ideas and concepts with Asian sauces and marinate. I love the Ronin and Banh Mi burger; both had distinctive flavors but was not overwhelming! The burgers had key ingredients that were so proportionate and was just perfect with the moist patties and soft baked buns. I also tried their oxtail fries; yay for the topped fried egg. What isnt better with a fried egg?!\n\nI wish Bachi expanded to Norcal. It would be a HUGE hit! Until then, I'll have to order two burgers each visit in order to try all their burgers. I said it Bachi -- you guys are worth the calories. I'd get fat for ya. \n\nBachi Faithful! :P"

S'I think the most important feature of a burger place is the burger.  The burger I had here, the ronin, was phenomenal!  I ordered mine medium rare, and it came out more on the rare side, excellent!  Everything about the burger was tasty.  Unfortunately, I can\'t say the say about the side of truffle parmesan fries that I ordered as well.  The fries were somewhat bland, and the sauce on top looked as though some one dropped a Cleveland steamer on them.  The Thai iced tea was also a big "meh." My recommendation, stick with the burger and you shall go home happy.'

S"Bachi=botchy! \n\nWe were excited to try their burgers, but in the end everything was really messed up.  I think because we were confused who was our server and they were confused whose table it was yadi yada.  It could have been a quick lunch but in the end it was quite exhausting flagging one waitress down, then another, then another.  Botchy!\n\nFood wise here's the review! \n\n*Oxtail chili fries - everyone else likes it, but I say 6/10.  Are you suuuuure it's oxtail? We didn't have much meat on ours plus I like oxtail because of the gelatinous-y texture and it didn't have any of that.  Also, our egg was well done...we needed a runny yolk to make this mission successful.  Fries tasted alright, kinda like McDonalds.  \n\n*Fish burger - really salty!  I think 6/10.  By the time I was hitting my last few bites, i just couldn't do it.  My tongue was numb.  But the bun was uber soft, uber pillowy.  Nice.  \n\n*Mr Ho burger - hubby rates it 8/10.  The lup cheong and mushrooms tasted really rich and complemented the patty well.  As for me, I thought my first bite of his burger was far too sweet.  \n\n*Strawberry lemonade 10/10!  Fresh, tart, not too sweet.  I could drink gallons of this.  \n\n*Cherry Yuzu soda 10/10!  Same as above! \n\nSo wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but from the airport it was a 5 minute drive and close to Tarjay so it's useful that way."

The burger and fries I ordered were SOOO GOOD.  The only reason I took off one star is because there was a particularly odd fishy smell throughout the restaurant.  I'm not sure what it was, but it was a little off-putting while my friends and I were trying to eat."

S'Our first time we were going to try Bachi Burger, there was a 30 min wait for lunch. So when we finally went back to try it, we were less than impressed . First, the guy who seated us seemed less than happy about having to seat us. Some people came in behind us and asked if we were all together, my husband said "no,there\'s 2". It took the server way too long to figure out that the other people would be a table of 4. As he was seating us, he was yelling at the bus girl about why there was a 6 top set up, pretty rude, all in all. \n\nWe got seated, then the people behind us got seated a couple minutes later, but somehow, the server went to greet those people first. Ok, but then it was another full 5-7 minutes before we were even approached. When Melissa finally came over, we were greeted by overly fake niceness. Never asked if we\'d ever been there before, made any recommendations. She never asked if we wanted a drink to start, so we placed our order. We order the Bachi pickles, which are an APPETIZER, which usually means it comes FIRST. Nope, not at Bachi Burger, we got our fries and then our burgers and then asked if we still wanted the appetizer.  When we said no. Melissa asked if we were sure. The manager did come over and offered an explanation that there was a shift change going on and he offered his apology. Didn\'t actually say "I\'m sorry" but said he wanted to offer his apology, which he never did. \n\nWhen we got our meals, Melissa was kind enough to bring extra napkins. And then more napkins even though we never used the first set of extra napkins she brought us, I took this as an implication that maybe we were slobs, interesting, since we hadn\'t spilled a drop. Oh well. \n\nNot a great experience. Bachi Burger was recommended to us by a friend and we saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and were looking forward to a burger experience. We didn\'t get anything more or special than we would have gotten at any other burger place. We\'ve actually gotten better service and much less $$ burger joints. It was a "been there, done that" experience for us. Not one I\'ll look to repeat anytime soon.'

S"After reading the reviews, what would stop you from heading down to bachi burger and seeing what all the hype is about?\n\nBut no no it's no hype. The food is actually, in my opinion delicious!\nWe started with the oxtail fries, because after so many reviews about it and on top of that who doesn't love oxtail! Seeing the pictures made me want to dive in. Of course I took a picture myself. It was a perfect balance of crunchy from the fries and softness of the oxtail meet that was laid on top and the egg is perfect to balance out all the flavors. I'm not much of a heat fan so I just dismissed the jalape\xc3\xb1os. Btw, this order is pretty big. It was perfect for my friend and I and then some but it was just the two of us so the more the merrier.\n\nThen we ordered the Kiki burger, medium. It was nice and warm when it came out and we took our pictures for Instagram of course. Then we both dove in. The bun was nice and soft and it was toasted on the inside. Veggies looked like a spring mix and that sauce on the side had hints of citrus and sweetness that made the burger even more delicious. \n\nReason for the 4 stars being that the service was not great. I felt like we were being rushed and it took forever to get a refill on our water, I guess it was because it was getting a little busy but that doesn't mean that you start being rude to your customers, even if the food is great. You'll eventually lose people that way or we'll end up going to another location. But the food is the real star of the show. I wouldn't go to this location again, I'd rather go to the other location even if it's further."

We waited a while but soon as we got seated, service was quick and very pleasant. \nSince this was our first time here, the waiter patiently answered all our questions. The burgers are definitely flavorful. I was worried about all the different additions to the burgers but the flavors worked well together.\nThe parmesan fries delicious! And my favorite part was the dessert "Homemade pop tarts" . Usually i\'m too full to eat dessert after a meal but this was a must!\n\nCan\'t wait for the West LA opening! Congrats to Bachi Burger and we will definitely be visiting  you in Vegas each time we go!'

S"Wasn't impressed at all. Got take-out. Ordered simple partially because website menu was down, and I didn't have a menu at work, also so I can measure up to other places. I had a simple cheeseburger(cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion) and the wifey got a grilled cheese and an order of the parmasean fries. Like I said simple. Burger was good. Nothing special. Wife was disappointed. The picture of grilled cheese on this site looks nothing like what she got. The picture looks like a panini pressed grilled sandwich on a white type bread. She got a hamburger bun with some melted cheese on it. She said it didn't taste too bad, but wasn't what was expected. Fries were good. My burger was ok. Not the best I've had, but not the worst I've had. I will try this place again, and order something a little more exotic next time. Will update review then."

S'Ok, let\'s see what the hype is all about!  I had been hearing so much about this place for a long time.  We decided to check it out.  I had to see what all the yelps were saying and what I could gather is that the wait is pretty long to sit down.  I figured that I heard so many good things about the burgers so it was worth the chance of a wait.  You walk into the the narrow restaurant find some big comfy couches in the front.  I thought, great there has to be a wait if they have these couches.  So we put our name and sat down with my 2 year old grabing Las Vegas Weekly and Seven magazines and piling them on the couch.  We didn\'t really wait that long and were seated pretty fast.  \nWe sat down and now the next hurdle.  What do we order?  I didn\'t know where to begin. I scanned the menu and the only word that stuck out was "Kimchi."  I had to order the Kimchi burger.  My wife ordered a regular angus burger.  We ordered fries with the variety of fries.  I think we got my daughter a grilled cheese.  \nwhen the food came it was awesome.  The burger had many flavors.  Try to go early if have a large group because when we were eating a large group was waiting for some time.  Bachi burger is in its own class.  I recommend! Cheers!'

I had garlic fries that had jalopenos on them. not the best. the truffle fries were very good. Had a build up burger, wagyu, blue cheese, onion rings and bacon. rings were sad, bacon was hard, both came out in pieces. to much cheese, over bearing. burger was kind of mince consistency, way to much sweet flaver and inconsisitant thru the paddy. Needs more salt and or spice, white pepper or something for my tastes. Price was very good on fries, $4. burger started at $16 and ended at $18.50. too much. burger size was good. bun was good. \ndont think I'll be back. strip burger does it better for less.

We were seated right away and told about the special of the day, fish tacos! \n\nI we decided to go for the Miso Burger and the Ronin Burger. We also ordered the pork belly steamed buns, fish tacos and sweet potato fries. Our burgers were cooked I perfection and were AMAZING!! One of the best burgers I have ever had. The fries were so good I ordered another helping along with another helping of the steam buns. These things are so unique an full of flavor. Reminded me of the pork belly sandwich I got at Burroughs Market in London. \n\nNow let's talk about the sauces they have for dipping! They have a hoisin sauce for the steam buns which was to die for and also they had a pineapple ketchup that I just wanted to swim in!!! Thy had a few other sauces that were amazing too and all fresh made!!!\n\nFor dessert I ordered a chocolate peanutbutter shake. The waitress asked if I like chocolate or peanutbutter more?

S"My ex told me about this place right before I left  and said I have to try it for him lol! It was on the food network and it's off the strip so no one really wanted to take a cab just to eat a burger with me. Luckily on my last day here I found someone who was willing to try it with me. There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad. We shared the oxtail chili fries and split the Ronin and Banh Mi Burger. Both of them were delicious! I liked how mine came with fish sauce and the patty had beef, pork, shrimp mixed in the patty. Definitely worth the trip so make sure you come here and try it!"

S'I had never hear of this place, but it was close to our hotel in LV, and had a good Yelp rating. Apparently it was featured on a cable food show. My wife and I stopped in on a Sunday evening around 6. When we arrived, seating was available, but shortly after being seated, the place filled up and there was a line at the door. We ordered the Bachi Pickles, and found them delightful. My wife had the BBQ Bachi Angus burger, and I ordered the Ronin Burger. We split an order of Sweet Potato fries fixed in the Parmesan Truffle style.The food was served in an appropriate amount of time, and it was hot and delicious. The portions are quite large, but the food was so good we stuffed ourselves. \n\nOur server was friendly, competent and knowledgeable. Although the restaurant was full, and there were families and kids, the noise level was not overly loud. We were able to carry on a conversation without straining to hear each other. It was a very happy and fun experience, and we do plan to return when we are in Vegas again. Highly recommended.'

S"Went here with my boyfriend on a Thursday [5.27] & heard about this place from my coworkers about a month earlier. It was a bit of a drive for me, but hey~ they're open until 1am! Definitely worth the drive because this place is going green & sell local art that they have as decor :) They also have a flat screen tv by one entrance & a lounge/couch area right by the restroom by the other entrance.\n\nI wanted to try the mango or honeydew boba, but the server said that they were powdered flavors :/ I ended up getting the green milk tea with boba & that worked just fine.\n\nI ordered Kiki's burger; sauteed shitake with mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili with aioli on the side. This burger was awesome~ everything about the description made it sound great, & it was! The buns for the burgers are sweet, definitely a good size portion because all of my buddies know that I'm a slow eater.\n\nI ate half of the burger to save room for dessert; Portuguese donuts that had Vietnamese cinnamon & coffee gelato. This really hit my sweet tooth & I'm not a super sweets kinda person, so I let my boyfriend inhale most of the donuts while I ate most of the coffee gelato :9 \n\nThe service was good, since they are still a new restaurant I noticed that once in a while another employee would be shadowing &/or supervising the server. I know she wasn't knowledgeable about some of the questions we had about the menu, but it's totally understandable because I know that they're training for success! This place is doing great so far & I know that they will open one soon on the southwest area! *nudge nudge :)"

Come, sit, have a beer and some pickled vegetables.  \n\nSTEAMED BAO (Duck) - Delicious, savory and tastiest part of duck between steamed pillows and onion\nBLACK & GREEN BURGER - Soft, puffy toasted bun, grass-fed beef, sauteed mushrooms, spinach, bacon, blue cheese and roasted garlic... omg i'm gonna drop everything and head over there now!  \nCHILI EDAMAME - disappeared sooner than later\nBRANDY SHAKE - brandy in a shake.  perfect dessert!  can i have a double, to go?  it's legal to walk around Vegas with alcohol, right?  \n\nSeated at small table right in front of kitchen doors, register, middle between bar and the rest of restaurant, we were never short of attention or water.  Busy busy time this evening, we were definitely not ignored, but would have enjoyed another table without the servers rushing about us on either side.  Monkey's a loyal customer and will definitely save up to return."

S'Bachi Burger is always on my list of places to go when I am in Vegas. Went around 10pm on Saturday and of course we had to wait, that is never a problem since the food is always so good. Once we were seated, our server came pretty quickly and was nice. That was the best part of our terrible service! Our server took about 10 minutes to bring our strawberry lemonade to the table and after waiting over 20 to 25 minutes, we received our food but never received out appetizer. When we mentioned it to our server, he said that he would get it put in right away. We opted not to get it anymore as we had seen many other tables that came in after us receive multiple things before we received anything. Our server looked as if he was on drugs, very jittery as he attempted to show us his pad of paper showing us our order and saying it was not his fault. Mid way through our meal, we ordered food to go, we sat and waited for over 20 minutes and finally was approached asking if we have received our food. I proceeded to tell the other server that we were waiting for our to-go order. As he walked away, I saw him go up to the register area and find that our to-go order had been sitting in the counter. I could not believe how terrible the service was at Bachi burger! The food is always good, but I felt like the server should never have been serving people food! He made mistakes on every single table he was helping in our area and instead of apologizing, he made excuses!'

Anywhere between 10-30 minutes. \n\nDon't get any of their boba drinks, Thai tea boba was pretty gross. Burgers are amazing and great size for the price though! I got the miyagi-san and it was so good! I also took a bite of the kimchi kalbi and that was good too. A little spicy but good.\n\nI do recommend it for a different burger joint!"

S'I came to this location last night at approximately 6:30 pm. Approaching the host stand, a tall brown-haired host told us the wait would be about 45 minutes for a party of 2, which is fine, considering its a busy place on a Friday night. After about 10 minutes, we were trying to decide if we wanted to stay or go somewhere else so we decided to see if there would be a table sooner considering parties of 2 are the easiest to seat (I work in a busy, upscale Strip restaurant, as a host).  I told my boyfriend to go check with the host and we were treated with complete disrespect. The host said,"Well, since you waited 10 minutes and I told you 45, that means that you have 35 minutes left. Do the math in your head." \n\n\nWow, right?! \n\n\nIf I said that to my guests, I would not have a job.\n\nI also called the manager today and told him what had happened and he did not seem to care, at all. He just listened, then said "thank you, have a nice day." \n\nTheir burgers are good but not that great to be treated like that.'

However, I thought it was just an average dish. The oxtail was there, but the taste wasn't.maybe I'm wrong, but it was too salty for my liking.\n\nPork Buns: fatty and delicious! I don't think I even need their dipping sauce. The sauce that was in the bun was perfect. The pork was juicy and savory\n\nMiyagi-san grassfed wagyu burger: the patty itself was very succulent. The whole burger was amazeballs. Furakake is naturally salty, but it wasn't overpowering in this dish. Like I said, amazeballs.\n\nOverall, I would come back for the burgers and pork buns. Service was good. Just expect to wait around 20-30 minute wait during peak hours."

Burger came with raw onions not grilled, he was told by server that he needed to order caramelized onions. Plus the staff disagreed with him about grilled vs caramelized onions. I guess they've never heard the customers always right??? I ordered mixed seasonal salad with free range chicken. The salad came and it was arugula, radicchio, sliced carrots and 4 cubes of chicken with skin on it. When I questioned the server I was told can I get you anything else. The kitchens been slammed today. I said no just charge me for the side salad. Not worth the wait!!!!!!\nIf you have to wait then the food/kitchen service suffers......"

S'Awesome gourmet burger bar.\n\nI just ate lunch there and am in a food coma.  I had the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries and a Dogfish Head 22oz My Antonia Pilsner.   Everything fit together perfectly.  The burger was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing.  The fries were crisp and covered in jalapenos and cilantro with hawaiin sea salt and had a chili dipping sauce that fit together perfectly.   The beer was the perfect accent to the meal as well.  You can always count on Dogfish head.  \n\nOverall this place was great, service was great and I will highly reccomend to anyone looking for a great burger experience.   The prices I feel are good for what your getting.  My entire meal was $30 and change.   \n\nBachi Burger is not too be related at all with fast food, In & Out or anything of that nature.  When you come here you are getting the sushi of burgers.  Nothing is spared in the pursuit of perfection to get you to burger nirvana.'

S"Their Momotaro strawberry white peach soda is crack! It's been two days and I'm still thinking about it and wishing for more! I WANT IT, I NEED IT, NOW!!!!!! too bad I live in California :(\n\n- Oxtail chili cheese fries: Perfectly fried fries topped with sweet oxtail chili, jalepenos, fried egg, and cilantro. The chili was a little too sweet as if there was too much bbq sauce, but still good! \n\n- Pork Belly Steamed Sandwiches: Glazed pork belly, hardboiled egg, and cilantro stuffed in a steamed bun. YUM, although the bun could've been a little softer.\n\n- Miyagi-san grass-fed wagyu burger: grass-fed beef patty, cheese, onion rings in toasted buns. I loved that this came out hot and steamy! Although the beef patty was cooked to medium-well even though I asked for medium, it was still very juicy. However, I felt that it lacked flavor and I wished the onion rings would have been crunchy to give the burger more texture.\n\nI would definitely come back here again because it has so many burgers that sound delicious! However, I give this four stars because I think they could've done with all their entrees."

S"I love it here.  It's one of my favorite burger places, especially good because of the asian inspiration they inject into each of the burgers.  The food, mixed with the atmosphere and friendly wait staff make it a good experience.  \n\nMy favorite thing to get here is the Kiki's burger.  Absolutely delicious.  I love everything about this burger.  The meat is always juicy, it has onions (good!), bacon (better!), cheese (best!), and this aioli dressing that is fantastic.  About once a month, I get a sudden craving for this burger and have to go back.\n\nThe kalbi burger is also something that should be probably be noted.  It's not just a burger with some kimchee on it or something.  The meat has so much flavor infused into it.  Very good, thumbs up.\n\nI love the buns they put the burger on as well.  Its those buns that you can find in china town that's super soft and kind of sweet?  Even my cousin who said he despises those buns said it was good.\n\nI always get the truffle parm fries.  In my opinion, its best NOT to share these.  Get your own!  =)\n\nAt about 8 bucks a burger and 4 bucks for the fries, its reasonably priced and well worth it.  I'll be back next month when my Kiki's burger craving comes back."

S"I've been here many times, mostly after work so around 1am. I always have a good experience.\n\nMy first visit was marked with the Ronin burger with a fried egg. I'm a sucker for eggs and it was delicious. The truffle parmesan fries are great but the garlic truffle edamame is the best appetizer. \n\nAll the burgers are solid and creative. But I regularly get the pork belly steamed buns or the duck steamed buns with fresh shrimp chips along with at least two glasses of the Apple Yuzu soda, that stuff is addicting!\n\nI've also tried the oxtail chili cheese fries. Sounds good on paper but the ratio of soggy chili fries to normal fries was out of proportion. Too much chili and not enough oxtail. You wanna get a soggy fry, normal fry, chili, cheese and a piece of oxtail in every bite and that just wasnt possible. \n\nDesserts are forgettable, which is fine cuz I go there for the food. \n\nWednesdays are industry nights for locals, I think this is a recent thing so take advantage while you can."

The wait is kinda long as there aren't that many tables inside but since the weather was nice, it wasn't a problem. I'm not sure how I would feel about the wait if I was hungover and standing outside in the summer vegas heat though lol\n\nSince I had peking duck buns at the Wynn buffet the night before, we opted for the pork belly buns instead and they were delicious. The oxtail fries were quite good, not standout-ish but a nice change of pace as far as fries are concerned. The Miyagi wagyu burger was tasty, and maybe a little messy but the strong flavors were there. The egg was nice but I prefer smaller pieces of bacon. I definitely recommend sharing a burger though with someone (especially if you're planning to order other things) because the fries are a huge portion and the burger is also big enough to be shared. \n\nDefinitely worth taking friends that have never been before."

And after extensive research (not really-- we just looked at Yelp photos), we opted for Bachi Burger over Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. We went right before they opened, so no wait! \n\nWe were seated immediately and ordered some beers. My boyfriend ordered a Guinness on draft and I ordered a White Ale. The White Ale was very light and tasted similar to that of a Blue Moon. \n\nNow onto the food! We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries since it seemed like a popular choice-- and it was amazing! The oxtail chili, jalape\xc3\xb1os, garlic aioli and a fried egg on top of a bed of French fries made for a delicious starter. My boyfriend ordered the famous shogun burger and I, the Miyagi grass fed burger. My boyfriend loved his savory burger which included unagi (eel) and foie gras. My burger was nice and juicy-- both burgers made with beef wagyu and cooked medium rare. Perfection!\n\nIn addition to the amazing food, we had a wonderful server. Great value for the food.

Apparently if you order a Wagyu Burger Meat (Their specialty meat) its $16 alone + whatever it is you are ordering. But the meat itself was cooked in a way where it was really juicy but also made me think of a house bbq with good company except the meat is much more marinated in its own type of flavor. Not overly juicy but not super dry. The perfect burger as I would describe it. It came with a small pur\xc3\xa9e peach just to clean your pallet before taking an enormous bite into that burger.\n\nPork Belly Buns:\nIf you love pork.. You are definitely going to love this bun.

S'I\'ve been wanting to come here since the episode of Triple D aired. The thing that grabbed my attention: Oxtail Chili Fries.\n\nSo the parking lot is a good size, its in a decent sized strip mall. We got there around 11am and apparently just beat the crowd, cuz as we were leaving the line was out the door. \n\nFirst thing I ordered - the Oxtail Chili Fries (minus the onions & cilantro). Now with that out of the way - lets look at the burgers. I decided on the Miyagi-san burger, which consists of Chili Mayo,Fried Egg ,Furikake, Caramelized Bacon & Crispy Onion Rings. I also got a soda to wash it all down with -which the waitress forgot to bring to us til halfway thru the fries cuz I asked again. Anyways - the fries are good. The oxtail is shredded and the the chili has a slight kick to it. The egg while its looks good, actually gets in the way. No one wants to be the first person to cut into it and if it were up to me - I\'d pop the yolk and let it run into the chili! \n\nThe Burger - SO EFFIN GOOD! The first thing I noticed was that the buns are actually the same as the baked chau siu bao. Golden brown with a slight glaze. The burger itself was nice and juicy. So juicy that it runs down your hand and arm while holding it. So make sure you get extra napkins. The bacon and furikake was a nice addition! Possibly the best burger I\'ve had.\n\nOverall - great food. Service is good, minus the waitress forgetting our sodas. Totally coming back when I\'m in Vegas the next time. \n\nPS - They should totally change the name of the place. The word "bachi" and being in Vegas is not a good thing. Its a good thing I didn\'t gamble much after eating here.'

We couldn't finish it because it's just so much food along with the burgers but we did not regret ordering all that we did. The fries  started getting a little soggy so I wouldn't want to take it back to my hotel. \n\nService was just okay and the night wasn't very busy.

S'Me and my friend ate way too much but it was freakin\' worth it. We show up around 2pm and there was a 25 minute wait. Plus this is way off the strip like close to the desert off. It was a $30 cab ride from the strip but $10 to the airport. \n\nAs appetizers we got the pork buns and the oxtail chili cheese fries. Holy crap they were so good. The buns were soft and not heavy and the pork belly had enough fat that melted in my mouth. It had the hoisin sauce on the side for dipping which was super tasty and great sweetness to it. I think its not as good as Momofuku\'s pork buns but its still up there. Probably my second favorite. The oxtail chili cheese-fries was bangin!! It was so heavy because of beans and sunny side up egg but still so worth it. The jalapenos were to hot to eat because of the 113 degree weather but any other day it would have been fine.  We could have stopped eating and that could have been all we ate. Of course we didn\'t and made ourselves look like fat asses when ordering the burgers. \n\nHe had the Ronin and I had the $26 dollar Shogun burger. The Shogun burger was so rich and soft because it literally melted in my mouth. If I was 76 years old with false teeth and couldn\'t eat burgers anymore I would be in heaven. It is made of Wagyu Beef & Unagi \nPan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach. The bun also  soft and sweet that I really felt that I wasn\'t eating a lot at all. I think it\'s over priced by like 3 bucks but I would still recommend it because of the very rich flavors. We tried finishing it all but we realized it was too much food. \n\nIt was funny our waiter Mark was like, "So you will be having the pork buns as your main course.." and I stopped him and was like, "Haha Hell no. I\'m getting a burger also." And he gave that look like I did not know what I was getting into but sure enough took my order. \n\nService was really good.

Cooked nice and juicy and seasoning was just on point. They also had a very cool beer selection of a lot of imported japanese ones you can't find anywhere else.

It was so busy that the wait was 45 minutes so we ended up just ordering to-go. But even the to-go took 30 minutes. At that point we just wanted to leave and go home. I ordered the regular bachi burger and it was alright. I wouldn't say that it is a must have. With the price I paid, I'd rather go to In N Out and have a whole combo with a drink and fries honestly. Maybe it was because we ordered to-go instead of sitting down for the meal and having drinks as well, but I think Bachi Burger is just okay."

But, it was truly love at first bite. \n\nGot the Kiki because it was recommended by my fellow Yelpers (thanks guys!)  The bun was nice fluffy and sweet (like Hawaiian bread). Loved the dipping sauce that came with it! Burger itself had a hint of sweetness and I'm assuming it's from the carmelized onions. Bacon, mushrooms, lettuce, carmelized onions, and of course a tender patty nestled in a bun of perfection! \n\nSecond time my table ordered:\n \nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.50 - I could only really allow myself to have a few bites from this. Definitely massive enough to feed at least 3-4 people for an appetizer. Topped with a sunny side up egg and mixed in with chilli and bits of oxtail pieces. It was okay..definitely a good hearty app for the boys, but I probably wouldn't take the initiative to order it again. \n\nPork Belly Buns $10-  Comes with three. Buns were nice, soft, and fluffy, and pork belly was cooked perfectly with a sweet glaze and topped with raddish and parts of a boiled egg. Definitely yummy and filling but I don't know how I feel about it being $10. \n\nManga Burger $13 (?) - Their specialty burger with scallops and crab? It was ...satisfactory..definitely not memorable enough for me to go into extensive details about it.

S"In all honesty, I was not expecting to love this place so much. I love burgers, but had not heard much before trying the restaurant. On the same trip to Las Vegas, of course this was another one on the list for me to try. And I am so happy I did! I went with two other friends, both foodies as well, both love burgers too! Again, the wait for this place was long, 25 min. but worth the wait. I've found the trend that long lines, means good food :)\n\nThe three of us decided to each get a burger and share. The ones we decided on were the Shogun Burger, Kiki's Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. We started out meal out with two tasty appetizers in the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns. Both were Amazing! Great start to our delicious meal.\n\nThe first burger was the Shogun burger...$25. Yes, pretty pricey...But we went all out as foodies! This burger was so mouthwatering and delicious I could not believe all the flavors coming out in the first bite! The Wagyu Beef & Unagi was so soft and just melted in your mouth as the buttery miso helped smooth it out even more. There was a sweetness that hit me as well, not knowing what it was at first, I quickly recalled it being the peach and pear. Best tasting gourmet burger I have ever had!\n\nKiki's Burger was a delight as well! I have to say all the burgers were soft and tender and mouthwatering. Just the flavors varied depending on the ingredients...which were high quality. The last on was the Spicy Miso Burger. And of course I enjoyed this one as well because of the spice, still not that spicy, but had a kick to it. And of course the fried egg and garlic making a great taste combination.\n\nWould highly recommend for burger lovers. The flavors of the burgers are Asian inspired, and work very well. Want to go again soon!"

S'Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.\n\nWait time: Always a wait\n\nAmbiance: Not laid out well. You are sitting in a row of 50 other people eating 2 feet next to you. It feels like a school cafeteria. Last time we came they were going through a remodel. Maybe they added a few barstools.\n\nFood:Fries brought out 15 min before the burger. They were soggy when they brought them out. Ordered the burgers medium/well because my girlfriend just recently had food poisoning so we didnt want to take any chances. Both of our burgers came out COMPLETElY RARE on the inside. Its was seriously cold uncooked meat in both of our burgers. \n\nStaff: This is the absolute most horrible part about our experience. I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. We first sat at a table and after no one saying a word to us for 5 minutes, we decided to move to the bar in hopes of getting some service. Sat at the bar for another 5 minutes until a gentlemen named John who I later found out was the manager came up to us asking if we needed anything.  I answered "yes we have not been helped yet, we\'re ready to order". This guy gives me the most blank stare like he was stoned out of his mind and says "ok one second". He proceeds to go behind behind the bar and walks over to this kid with  mo-hawk like hair who\'s busy making drinks and points at us while telling him something. The mo-hawk guy shrugs his shoulders and the manager walks away. A few moments later a girl with blonde hair comes over an takes our order. Fries come out first. Soggy and not good. We look around for the waitress or manager who are both nowhere to be found to send the fries back. Here comes the most crazy thing I have ever seen in a restaurant in my life. The manager walks behind the bar, grabs a bottle of Fireball Whisky, and pours 2 shots in to shot glasses. He taps the mo-hawk guy on the shoulder, hands him a shot very sneaky like and starts walking towards my girlfriend and I. Right when I was about to open my mouth to say something about the fries he bends down right in front of us pretending to tie his shoe or something and takes the shot. He literally stands up with the most disgusted look on his face (as all people have when doing fireball). My girlfriend and I both sat there with our mouths dropped open. He knew instantly that he was busted. (stealing alcohol and drinking while "managing") He disappeared in the back room and the mo-hawk guy went back to making drinks. Our burgers came out a few minutes later. We both checked to make sure the burgers were plenty cooked. Cold rare meat. They were slightly seared on the outside. I figured The girl didnt hear me right and rang them up as medium/rare on accident. When she came by the bar I flagged her down showing her the burger and the uncooked meat. She asks us if we want the burgers remade. I said politely to her "no thank you, we\'ve actually been having a really bad experience. Nothing to do with you." Her only answer to that statement was "OK" then she walked away as if she was upset for some reason? I didnt know what that meant so I sat there for another minute when she came back to the bar and says to me "Well I checked the order and I put it in medium/well how you asked. Sorry you didnt like it". She then drops the check on the counter and walks away. I was very surprised that she not only brought me the check for food that we didnt take one bite of, but she didnt even bring a manager out or address our concerns. I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar. The blonde stared at me and looked at another server who said to her "John" implying that he was well aware of John drinking on the job. They told me that he was the only manager there but the nice male server agreed with me that I shouldnt have to talk to a drunk manager about my issues. He gave me the name of the owner "Aaron" and let them know I was not paying for food I didnt eat and I wanted to talk to the owner tomorrow to let him know about my experience. I could show him all the problems with his restaurant starting with his so called "manager" who stands around doing shots instead of trying to help the business flow better. This place needs to go on bar rescue. I hope the owner sees this and does something about it. He needs to get some real staff in there with rules and that know a thing or two about customer service.'

S"I love this place. I've been here about 4 times and every experience was pretty nice.\n\nI would recommend coming here for brunch and breakfast. It's relatively cheap (about 40 dollars for two people) and the food is good. Recently, I ordered the french toast which was really good (about 12 dollars).\n\nDuring dinner, for two people the bill was about 200 dollars. However, we ordered quite a lot, including oysters, steak, duck salad, lamb (I think), sparkling water, truffle fries and dessert. The ambiance is dark and romantic, but honestly, I believe there's better value for dinner elsewhere and the food good, just didn't have a wow factor. That being said, I still had a good time and the service was excellent. \n\nOne bonus is that at night, after dinner you can take a little stroll through their pool area right outside Buchon. It's quite nice and quiet.\n\nOverall verdict, come here for breakfast and brunch. I don't believe they take reservations for brunch."

S'DISAPPOINTING.  Maybe it was because it\'s a holiday weekend, but the service was very poor...  As expected, it took about 30 minutes to be seated, which we were fine with.  Our waitress was quick to approach us and we put our orders in 5 minutes after being seated.  We then waited...a and waited... and waited. It then took us 35 minutes to get one pan au chocolate.  35 minutes for a single pre-made pastry? Come on!  At about 50 minutes in, we asked about the status of our courses.  We were then told "o, the chicken and waffles take some time to be made."  If it truly takes an hour for them to make chicken and waffles, they should put a warning on the menu.  That being said, we saw plenty of other people get their chicken and waffles in under the 1 hour it took us to get ours.  We also got a croque madame an hour in that was so-so.  By the time our food came we werent\' hungry any more.  We ate, paid our bill, and left.  Of the 2 hours we spent at Bouchon, 1.5 hours were spent waiting.  We rarely saw our waitress (although we saw our servers plenty and they were very helpful).\nThat being said, the chicken part of the chicken and waffles is good.  Howevere, I do not pay more than $60 for brunch just for good chicken.  I expect a better dining experience.  I almost would prefer dennys.'

S"We came here for Sunday brunch before heading back to LA. The wait was about 45-50 minutes but it seemed to go fast. \n\nWe were started with some bread, plus butter and blueberry jelly. I really liked the blueberry jelly. Perfect sweetness of the natural blueberry flavor. It was delicious with the bread.\n\nI ordered the corn beef hash with over easy eggs and was able to try the croque madame. The corn beef hash was excellent! I didn't expect the corn beef to be thick diced chunks because I'm so use to the canned corn beef. It was a nice surprise. Cutting up my leaky eggs were a perfect combination with the potatoes making it just soft enough. Not soggy. Great flavors of pepper and a hint of salt. Corn beef had a good coriander taste but not overbearing. Excellent pieces of meat. \n\nThe croque madame was yummy. It was quite filling from one bit. Very generous with the ham. The cheesy sauce drizzled on top put the whole sandwich together. I liked it very much. Bonus, the dish comes with fries. \n\nGreat service.\n\n-Give it a try!\n\np.s. Bouchon restaurant is located on the floors of the Venetian suites. If you can't find it ask so you don't waste your time looking around for it."

Took a while to get our waiter to bring some salt & pepper for it.\n\nStrawberry tart, meh.  Was bitter as the orange pate sucree had too much rind.  Johnny cake cobbler had a very strong flour taste, yuck.\n\nThe Bouchon cocktail at the BH location is better.  Plus the butter here isn't honey butter.\n\nStill... Overall not bad, especially for Vegas.  The Julia Child promotional prix fixe was a good deal.  The pork portion was huge, almost disgustingly so.  Desserts were also quite big."

S'I read an article a few years back, and the writer asked Thomas Keller what he thought of Yelp, the restaurant mogul was unfamiliar with the site.  After reading many Yelps for Bouchon, many diners are spreading their love for Keller, which was why we chose to dine at Bouchon on our holiday.  We walked into a pretty vacant restaurant, and were seated promptly.  This place is very "fine dining" but because it is located in a hotel you get all sorts of tourists.  Lets say Thomas Keller might not approve of a diner wearing cutoffs and running shoes, while choking down a $22 breakfast, but hey, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.  My sis and i  both ordered the the breakfast plate that came with  two eggs, potato croquettes, toasted brioche & applewood smoked bacon.  Moments later our food arrived, and my sis took one bit of her bacon, and pulled a face, the food was cold.  We debated just eating it, but if Keller can make oysters and pearls, can he not make bacon and eggs?  We told our server our issue, and she seemed shocked that there was an issue, and returned it to the kitchen.  Our plates came out again, this time they might have been 1 degree warmer.  We didn\'t want to send our food back for the third time, so we sucked it up.  The manager was very generous accommodating us with a box of pastries for the trouble.  \nOverall i wouldn\'t go back, I think Thomas Keller has stretched his name a bit too thin, and this restaurant is not dishing out the same quality of food that he would oversee at The French Laundry.'

The atmosphere and view of the pool make you want to just sit at the table and talk all day. \n\nThe brioche French Toast is always amazing ad we got an order of that to split. It is a great consistency, with the soft apples and cinnamon between the stacks. Our waitress was very informed about everything on the menu and suggested a customized version of the *Croque Madame" which was amazing. My other half had the Sandwich de Charcuterie which was among the best sandwiches I have ever had. Idk if it was the combo of the pepperoncinis and the balsamic or what, but the sandwich was incredible. We actually switched entrees because i loved the sandwich and she loved the Croque.  \n\nOverall great service, atmosphere, and amazing attention to detail on everything including the food.

S"I'm spoiled now Mr. Keller and thanks to you, I can't eat normal breakfasts anymore. I'm such a breakfast brat!\n\nI came into Bouchon with plenty of expectations knowing that its Thomas Keller and the reviews have been out of this world. I walked out incredibly satisfied, wanting more, and even pleasantly surprised despite all the rave and reviews about it. \n\nMy party ordered the: Croque Madame, Breakfast Americaine, and the Crab Gratin. All three were absolutely amazing. I found virtually everything that we had from the entrees to the brioche itself perfectly executed and fulfilling for my timmy too. The portions look small, but everything was very filling. The Breakfast Americaine is a bargain because you get: 2 eggs, sausage, bacon, brioche, a choice of pastry, juice and tea or coffee for $22. I enjoyed my Croque Madame so much. I'm picky when it comes to eggs and in all honesty, I hate fried eggs. A lot of times I just hate the taste of yolk on its own, I know, crazy, but I do. However, this Croque Madame was too good to be true! The Crab gratin was amazing! To have cheese, scrambled eggs on top, and truffle sauce, but still taste a strong crab flavor is amazing! There were small pieces of crab all over, but the small sizes were packed with flavor. So yummy, I'm salivating writing this review.\n\nThe kitchen also gave us some courtesy raspberry beignets which were divine! Nothing like biting into a beignet and seeing mouthful of raspberry jam ooze right out! We also had an apple croissant which was absolutely delicious! We ended up going to the bakery the next day and bought 3 to take home with us. \n\nService was very attentive and fast, no snobbish attitude"

She was extremely polite and made some excellent food recommendations.  \n\nAfter ordering, our food came out but they accidentally forgot my friend's chicken and waffle plate.  When they realized their error, our server apologized profusely.  Then,  the manager came over and did the same.  He even comped my friend's meal and asked us if we wanted to get our dishes remade (not even reheated!) so that we could all eat our fresh meals together.  We didn't ask them to do that because the lag time was probably only 5 minutes and we had already chowed down.\n\nThe food was delicious and our meal ended with complimentary coffee to go.  \n\nWe will definitely return!"

S"My hubby and I are vacationing in Vegas and on our list of must eat restaurants, was Bouchon. \n\nToo bad our experience was a big disappointment. \n\nWe arrived for our reservation on thursday, excited about the upcoming culinary experience... The hostess was friendly, seated us and then about 15 mins later a man, who never introduced himself asked us about our water preference. We only realized later, when he came back, still never making eye contact,  he was our waiter. This was probably one of my worst restaurant experiences ever. \n\nWhen i asked him about the chicken dish- i was expecting some description on the preparation or even his opinion ( which I love to hear from waiters!), instead he pointed to my menu and read it line for line. That was about the most interaction we got all night\nHe never came to check on us, his eyes always looking at his colleagues, no smiles, just seemed bothered to be there\n\nIt's one thing to be ignored when the restaurant is busy-- but literally be forgotten when there are empty tables surrounding you, is too much. He never bothered to check in on the apps or entree were. \n\ni would have overlooked all of this, if the entrees were as good as the appetizers. Endive salad and onion soup were delicious (and the reason  i gave this place two stars) Steak frites was just ok. My hubby didn't even finish it, which is surprising for him....my Chicken was cooked well, great crisp, but  again, only ok.\n\nAll in all, the wait staff needs some training... Smile, talk to your customers, a little eye contact and fake small talk will go a long way with tourists and maybe even yield a good tip!"

S'Wow.\r\n\r\nI can\'t believe how incredibly bad this place was. I wish I could rate this place zero stars.  I was there as part of a group of 11 and have never experienced service this bad at a restaurant so highly rated. I clearly got the sense that the waiter (Corey J) knew that his 20% tip for large parties was in the bag and just didn\'t give a damn.\r\n\r\nDetails that a restaurant like this shouldn\'t miss often were: not clearing bread crumbs before setting down appetizers, leaving water glasses empty, etc. The waiter would disappear for large periods at a time. He often didn\'t know who ordered what.\r\n\r\nThe food was also lackluster. Although my mushroom soup was fine, the steak I ordered was prepared with a shallot sauce that wasn\'t listed on the menu. When I complained to the waiter he said that he was "fairly certain" he described the preparation to me because he usually does. He later brought out a replacement that was bloody red, not the medium I had ordered. I ended up paying $35 for a steak I barely touched.\r\n\r\nI also tried some of my friend\'s gnocchi and it was extremely sweet. Around the table, the best anyone rated for food quality was "OK". \r\n\r\nThe place had a lot of promise - nice atmosphere, I liked how the menus were presented.'

Our party of 12 had to wait for about 40 minutes. Not too bad I guess, considering how big our group was. But really...there weren't that many diners in the restaurant. There were plenty of open tables inside AND out. Eventually, we were seated in a private dining room in the back. The thing that annoyed me most was that the front desk hostess kept giving us false time frames on when our table would be ready. \n\nSo, let's talk food. Our waitress was a sweetheart and she knew how to sell the menu! I was salivating when she described the dishes to us. Eventually, I settled for the sourdough waffles with fresh strawberries. YUMMY and definitely filling. It came with a side of Tahitian vanilla bean butter!! Yes!!!  I couldn't finish my plate, but perhaps it was because I was was feeling queezy from the night's booze fest. A popular dish at our table was the corned beef hash. Again, large portions. Their beef was a bit dry though. \n\nDon't miss out on their drink menu...it's quite unique and tasty!"

S'Two of the best meals I\'ve ever had were enjoyed here at Thomas Keller\'s Bouchon. Many thanks to a great colleague who HIGHLY recommended it {It\'s one of her favorite places & she\'s a big-time foodie!} as well as my entree!\n\nI made reservations a few days before me & my husband\'s arrival in Vegas, fully preparing for what would hopefully be a great dining experience. As soon as he & I found the restaurant {which was a challenge for us the first time, as it\'s located a few floors up in the new tower of the Venetian and we didn\'t realize it} and were immediately greeted by a friendly concierge, we knew we were in for a treat :-) Especially when we walked past their seafood display - wowza, I though the Hub\'s eyes would pop out of his sockets when he caught a glimpse of those oysters on the half shell!\n\nAs we took our seats, we also took in the lovely brasserie setting - perfectly tiled floors, sumptuous fabrics and of course, chalk boards announcing the day\'s specials were spot-on to the brasseries we visited in Paris two summers ago... so lovely!\n\nThe meal was to die for, each component better than the last. Beginning with some kind of fabulous "French" cocktail, that had a hint of lemon and served perfectly chilled in a martini glass. Then, that fantastic, super-crunchy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside, French bread & butter - served ever so casually, right on our butcher-paper lined table. We then moved on to those oysters and the French Onion soup. I\'m not usually a bit fan of this type of soup {except for the crisp cheese on the edge of the bowl} but the depth of flavors in this one were phenomenal, and not to be missed! \n\nI greatly enjoyed the steak frites for my entree, however, I could have done with a bit less of the shallot butter on top - every other aspect was divine. The steak - even if a flatiron cut - was an ideal medium rare & perfectly tender and who could go wrong with french fried potatoes?!? \n\nAll in all a fabulous meal, great service & an all-in-all unforgettable experience {which I did repeat on a more recent trip, ha!}.'

S"Hey it's my 200th review, glad I saved this review for my landmark moment.\n\nI've always had a fondness for this French bistro in the heart of Vegas (yes I know the original is up in Napa, but who has time to go there?) and yes 4 stars may be shorting it slightly, but if yelp allowed half stars, I'd easily give it a 4.5.\n\nBouchon was my gateway to the culinary world of Thomas Keller and I first went there for brunch back when I was a relative food ignoramus and enjoyed their much praised brunchtime meal with an assortment of breakfast meats and some chicken & wafflers, Keller-style.  \n\nNow I've returned nearly 2 years later with a bit more taste, perspective and experience under my belt, and having eaten at many french influenced places, bistros and brasseries, I can say Bouchon still does it right and maintains its well deserved reputation.\n\nComing here for a late dinner on a Fri night due to a friend's delayed plane flight, the management was gracious to let us arrive later than our arranged time and to be honest we might have been the last diners of the night coming in the door around 10pm.  Getting to the restaurant is a relative maze and fortunately having been their before I helped guide us thru the treacherous mazeways that is the Venetian hotel.  Taking a dedicated elevator up to the 10th floor, you walk down an ornate and sumptuous hallway leading to the restaurant entrance, hinting you are in for some kind of occasion.\n\nWe sat down and starting attacking the menu with a series of orders that go something like this:\n\nMarinated octopus salad with grilled eggplant, cucumbers, parsley & mint vinegrette - This was a pleasant surprise as the octupus tentacles were sliced, cooked to near perfection meaning  they were tender to the bite, not rubbery in the least and unless you see the suckers you would have no idea you were eating mollusk meat.\n\nEscargots in puff pastry - I'll be honest, while I always order escargot, its not because I love or even like snails that much, its because of the rich, buttery, garlic sauce that I soak up with the accompanying puff pastry and any bread that maybe leftover on the table.  Ah what a delicious heart attack in a mini baking tin\n\nCod brandade beignets with tomato confit & fried sage - I had no idea what to expect but these weren't like the beignets I've tried before, almost like a light, crispy potato or taro fritter and also really good.  Something reminiscient of Indian pakooras or samosas but much more delicate.\n\nKurobuta pork loin with summer stone fruit - Juicy and tender pork loin, I love pig, this is prepared very simple without and excess of sauce and garnish.  \n\nWhite sausage with potato pur\xc3\xa9e & French prunes - I'm a fan of boundin noir, french black blood sausage so I decided to give its mirror counterpart a try.  Again, fantastic and with a totally different flavour to black sausage it tasted quite meaty like any good breakfast sausage and something I could see myself enjoying with eggs and a french toast.\n\nSteak frites - Now I've been to NYC Brasserie Les Halles which prides itself on its steak frites, but to be honest theirs seems like an overcooked, flat piece of meat compared to what Bouchon serves up, good lord, you get a surprisingly thick and juicy piece of steak for surprisingly not a bad price.  Sadly the pommes frites are cooked in peanut oil and not duckfat like the NYC counterparts are.  Gotta love the lardons canard...\n\nI feel like any Vegas trip should be crowned by one destination meal if budget allows and Bouchon certainly did the trick on this trip.  Wonderful for a casual or more intimate meal with friends or loved ones, highly recommended."

S"This is a breakfast review, so be prepared for baguettes...\n\nThere's no better way to start a relaxing day in Las Vegas than with a magnificent breakfast at Bouchon.  The space itself is vast, yet warm.  Huge vaulted ceilings were eye-catching and beautiful in the natural sunlight that poured through the windows.  The service was excellent, with a pair of friendly hosts greeting us and an excellent waiter taking care of us.  Her recommendations were delivered painstakingly and with pride.\n\nI started with a cheese danish that ranks as one of the finest I've ever eaten.  I then moved on to a nicely presented smoked salmon and baguette platter.  The portion was generous and of high quality.  I washed it down with tea from their vast selection, and walked out refreshed and ready for a day of burning through my savings.\n\nBravo to Bouchon.  You're exactly what you should be."

S'My biggest memory of Bouchon is the fact that it\'s so overwhelming, and by the time you get upstairs and go through the indoor-outdoor garden and to the restaurant, you easily forget what city you\'re in, which is pretty hard to do in Las Vegas.  No fanny pack crowd with a giant cup of slots winnings and a comp voucher here.\n\nI\'m never very impressed with French bistro food, and I don\'t know why. I can appreciate the quality, but I never eat at a place like this and say "wow, that really hit the spot."  That said, I got a roasted chicken that was pretty decent.  And I could eat their bread to the point of explosion.\n\nService was not bad.  The place is very open and bright, so I would not categorize this as intimate dining, but it\'s still an impressive space.\n\nOverall, I was more impressed with the experience of the place than the actual food on the plate, but it was so over-the-top that I\'d recommend it, if at least you want to escape from the buffets and be teleported away to someplace completely different.'

S"After a couple of nights of stuffing ourselves with four course dinners, my husband and I were delighted to go to Bouchon and just have a salad and steak frites.  Perfectly cooked and delightful in every way.  I have eaten at all three Bouchons now, plus the French Laundry and Ad Hoc, so I guess that makes me something of a Thomas Keller groupie.  I've never had anything less than a great meal at his restaurants."

S"Came here again for dinner and it was superb\n\nGot the duck dish and sampled portions from the chicken and salmon. The chicken was all right, the duck decent, but let me tell you, the salmon was AMAZZZING!. I've never had salmon prepared so perfectly before, very moist on the inside with a perfect amount of crispness to it on the outside. It was definitely delicious. And the sauce?  I caught my friend sopping up the sauces with the bread cause it was so delicious.\n\nTypically I don't like to return to the same restaurants in Vegas because there is such a wide selection, but I definitely will be returning to this one! Oh and a big thanks to my  yelp friend Vinh H. who treated. Gotta love a friend that is generous!\n\nAnother note: We had asked if they had flavored butter, and the waiter joked that the butter was already flavored. I thought he was only joking, but he was right! Very nice intense butter flavor, only good quality butter tastes like this!\n\nGood quality food from a very fine establishment!"

S"Everyone kept saying...come here for breakfast blah blah blah and what did we do!?! We came for dinner!! And you know what, i'm glad we did!! \n\nTheir menu wasn't as extensive as others but it was still pretty good. We ordered the petite plateau ($59) for appetizer and it was a platter full of mussels, clams, oysters, and lobster! I ordered the saumon  aux artichokes (sauteed salmon with artichokes, $29.50) while my boyfriend had the pan roasted trout. The trout was very creamy/buttery. Good if you like it like that. Our other friends ordered the flatiron steak ($35), which came with a mound of french fries that were sooo goood. I could have just ate the fries!\n\nI also had a glass of The Bouchon $10 (skyy vodka with a slight citrusy flavor), that was 90% vodka! It was STIFF with a capital S T I F F! Since we were pre drinking in the limo before dinner, I was a bit scared of topping off, so I chose not to finish my drink.\n\nGreat experience. Great date place."

S"I've been to the original Bouchon in Yountville and enjoyed every minute of it. I loved the experience at the Las Vegas Bouchon just as much! We sat out on the terrace which was warm and beautiful with the calming noise of the fountain and pool behind us.  The menu was filled with an endless amount of food goodness. We started off with oysters on the half shell and the warm frisee salad with bacon and poached egg. I've attempted making this at home but will never be able to master Thomas Keller's savory bacon vinaigrette.  Although the steak frites would have been a sure winner, I decided to try something new I'd never had before - veal breast.  The veal breat was slow roasted and pulled from the bone, then formed into a flat piece and breaded on top and browned in the oven. What came out on my plate was a whole lotta goodness! The meat was tender, juicy and succulent paired with the wild mushroom ragu. Instead of polenta, I requested the frites. How could you dine at Bouchon and not have the frites. Although these ones were loaded with slightly too much salt, they were still one of the best fries I've ever had. Thin and crispy and absolutely addicting!  Also a delicious entree was the lamb loin - very tender. And the steak frites that are a classic of this restaurant featured a flavorful and thick piece of flatiron. \n\nIt was so much food so no room for dessert. Although they have the Bouchon Bakery downstairs so you can always save room for that later."

S"The annual firm dinner was held in one of the private dining rooms, and I must say, we had the most exceptional service and an unforgettable meal.\n\nWe had an array of appetizers to start:\nQuiche du Jour - creamy and not too heavy\nCharcuterie plate - one of my favorites, I love all kinds of charcuterie plates and Bouchon's had a wonderful array of cheeses and salumi\nMarinated Olives - not a huge fan of green olives, but these were nicely presented and tasted, well, like salty green olives\nSalmon Rillette - melts in your mouth, simply amazing and I don't even like salmon\n\nFor my entree, I had the their renowned Poulet R\xc3\xb4ti. This was SO GOOD! I never thought roasted chicken would blow me away like this. It came with chanterelle mushrooms, caramelized figs, pickled ramps & their chicken jus. This sauce just brought everything together so wonderfully.\n\nFor dessert, I indulged in one of their port wines, the Fonseca. By this time, I was probably 2-3 glasses of wine in from dinner, so needless to say, the port wine ended my alcohol streak on a nice and sweet note.\n\nThank you to Mike and his colleagues for the wonderful service and charming anecdotes."

S"I had to go back here for brunch as the l enjoyed it so much the last time.  We wound up over-ordering again as we did the night before...well, Vegas is all about excess!  We started off with the sampler of pastries: beignets, chocolate croissant, cheese danish, and cinammon bun, with the cheese danish being the best of the bunch.  They were definitely much bigger than expected though...we were already kind of full before our savory orders came in!\n\nSince we did a lot of drinking the previous night, we all felt like some eggs.  I got the croque madame, which is absolutely the perfect hangover food with the fried egg and sauce on top, and fries on the side.  Nothing like fried starch and fatty food to get rid of that hangover!  I had a taste of the quiche and the omelette as well, but I liked my dish better!\n\nI have to say I was a bit disappointed by the bellini...it just didn't taste as good as it did the first time I went here.  There's more juice now compared to the bubbly, and it seems like the bubbly they use isn't as good quality. \n\nService was pretty good, considering there were a ton of people there.  I would still go back on future visits, though I'd probably stick to only the pastry or the eggs and not both.  Who says French food has teensy portions?  Apparently that isn't true in Vegas!"

S'Most everything was good, some things even great. But there were plenty of service missteps, awkward moments, and food fumbles... not exactly the kind of memorable meal I expect from a Thomas Keller establishment. \n\nOur waiter was sweet, but not ready for prime time. As C said: "He has the raw skills to be a great waiter, but he\'s not there yet." Awkward check-ins, stammering recitations of the specials, and a rather graceless handling of a bar mistake... plus one outright "WHA?" moment, when he described "soubise" to the couple next to us as "kind of like a risotto." Um, ah-no.\n\nThe space suffers from a lack of coziness. I know, I know... it\'s Vegas, but the high ceilings feel less like the Grand Hotel and more like the Grand Canyon. On the positive side the decor is cute without dipping into cliche, and the host staff and managers were right on top of things, both as we arrived and as we departed.\n\nThe food, alas, was similarly hit and miss. After placing our order, shatteringly good bread and a welcome bowl of pistachios accompanied our drinks, a signature Bouchon cocktail for me (slightly overdone on the peach liqueur for my taste -- but hey, it\'s their recipe) and a glass of Sancerre for Mr. C.\n\nMoving into the appetizers, C\'s onion soup came out of the kitchen terribly undersalted (and, of course, no salt on the table meant he had to ask our gawky waiter to bring some). My frisee salad was top notch -- perfect egg, lovely lardons -- but slightly overdressed. \n\nWe both opted for nightly specials for our main course. C\'s dayboat scallops were perfectly seared, served in a creamy but not too heavy sauce gilded with tender pieces of crab, and accomplanied by a light-as-air potato gratin. (Sounds impossible, I know... but true.) My pave de veau featured meltingly tender veal breast, assembeled into a cube and crisped up with panko bread crumbs. Underneath: Lovely roasted brussels sprouts, a slightly overpowering soubise (an onion-infused Bechamel sauce not at all like a risotto, thanks), and slightly odd but definitely tasty chestnut "pain perdu" sticks on top of the stack.\n\nFor dessert, we chose after-dinner drinks and an order of beignets to share. The pastries themselves were cold and leaden, like they\'d been made well ahead or service, and their cream filling turned out pasty and too heavy. An unbilled scoop of chocolate ice cream was the dessert\'s saving grace. \n\nOur waiter stopped back after our dessert arrived to let us know it would be a few minutes before the bar could serve my requested glass of Poire Williams, as they needed to get a bottle from storage. I didn\'t mind the delay, but his fumbling and stumbling around the whole episode left me more annoyed than the actual missing drink.\n\nAll in all, it felt more like a meal that should have cost closer to $150 than the $230 we spent, even adjusting for the Vegas Factor.'

S"Sunday breakfast brunch at Bouchon started with a soy latte. My first thought was - hmm, it's alright.\n\nNext was the house bread, and I loved it. You can't beat any bakeries, warm and crispy like fresh out of the oven.\n\nThen, raw oysters and bloody mary. Raw oysters are... raw oysters and there wasn't much exciting to mention as long as they are fresh. Blood mary was spicy and refreshing. It went well with the oysters.\n\nMy main course was pan fried trout with roasted almonds and french beans. The flavor was influenced by butter used for frying. Other than that, it wasn't made with complicated spices, and was kept simple. Roasted almonds were crunchy and kept with the aroma of almonds.  French beans were soaked into the butter sauce used for frying. This is a nice offering for brunch because it was not too heavy, yet too light.\n\nBouchon is definitely a place I'd recommend, especially sitting outdoor for lunch/brunch on a warm and sunny day."

S"My boyfriend always like to try these fancy dining places with famous chefs so we decided to try Bouchon for brunch. Seating took about 10-15 minutes which wasn't too bad for a Sunday. As soon as we sat down we ordered our drinks (bloody Mary and bellini) and those were pretty quick. The drinks were okay, nothing special. Small and way overpriced (12.50) for the amount you get. We were given some bread and butter with jam. After looking over the menu and trying to pick between the salmon baguette or quiche I settled for the baguette. It is a build your own sandwich kind of dish. When it came out I was happy. There were capers and chives&cream cheese in their own small dish. Then I had lettuce, onions and tomatoes. The smoked salmon itself was slightly oily but sooo good. Instead of making one sandwich I made two open top sandwiches. Very refreshing and light. My boyfriend ordered the omelette Du jour which is the omelette of the day. It was prime rib with mushrooms and cheese. It came with a lot of bacon on the side (you can also choose sausage or ham) and this really distinct toast. The edges were flaky and crispy burnt. I usually don't eat the crust on bread but this one was addicting. The bill came out to about 63 so it's quite a pricey brunch but it's nice to try it once for an experience. They also had oysters and seafood on the menu but they were pricey. I would like to try their dinner eventually. The scenery is nice because it overlooks the Venetian garden that is on the 10th floor (the restaurant is on the 10th floor itself). Now I want some more smoked salmon."

I chose a glass of Pinot Gricio and regrette not having taken notes on what kind it was...even though I developed a snobby taste for mainly red Syrahs and Zin's I loved this Pinot G.\nMy friends had the: Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde:\nMaine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine,\nmustard & saffron, served with french fries, which was very delicious and plenty of food and the lamb is to die for:\nGigot d'Agneau\nroasted leg of lamb with a ragot of coco beans,\npiquillo peppers, merguez sausage, & lamb jus\n\nUsually I don't order salmon in a restaurant because I got disappointed many times but this one was fantastic with a nice seared crust on top.\n\nI drank a muscat for dessert which was a perfect finish for my taste buds:)"

S'I\'ve come here several times for brunch and each time hasbeen fantastic. I\'ve tried a bunch of different things, waffles, the quiche, even the Breakfast Americaine is wonderful. And of course the pasties are out of this world. I am a tremendous fan of Bouchon Bakery, I\'ve been to the one in Yountville, Columbus Circle and the one at the Venetian and all three are fantastic. The restaurant is decorated very authentic like a French bistro and during the daylight it really looks spectacular. \n\nThe only reason why I don\'t giveit five stars which I know in my  heart it truly deserves it because of one time I came for dinner with a friend. I ordered the steak frites which was wonderful and I ordered a glass of red wine (cannot recall which one) and tyhe waiter said he "did not recommend that one, he would not clean the floors with it". What? I kid you not. Totally uncalled for, I had not even asked his opinion. I said I wanted it either way. This was some years ago ago and to this day I have not returned to dinner. \n\nI\'ll do brunch here, the sunlight seems to keep the staff happy.'

S"Thomas Keller's inimitable relationship with his fish purveyors warranted at least one fish dish, so I went with the salmon rillettes, which had a consistency similar to a crab cake, bursting with both smoked and fresh fish pieces. The duck confit appetizer was served with brussels sprouts to lighten the dish. The last starter we ordered was the charcuterie - a generous offering - including meats cured in Yountville, as well as a few imported from Italy. \n\nFor the mains, we went with the black pudding, lamb leg, and short rib. The succulent banger did not have an off-putting irony aftertaste one normally associates with black pudding. The lamb leg was cooked perfectly pink. The prodigious short rib, defined by its fork tenderness, sent us all into a blissful state; the polenta-cranberry cake, however, was unappetizing. \n\nFor dessert, we split the meyer lemon tart and per our server's suggestion ordered the bouche de noel, an ornate Christmas special replete with gingerbread, meringue, peppermint, truffles, a glazed sugar cookie, smoked almonds, and a Valrhona torte. Meyer lemons have a distinctly robust acidity; with the dense pork's peppery finish still lingering on my palette, the tart was a judicious selection. As for the bouche de noel, it was huge, too big to conquer, but we enjoyed its playfulness."

S"After coming to Bouchon for our friend's birthday a month ago, my wife and I knew that when we came back for Valentines Day weekend, we would go back. Both occasions, we had brunch. Even though they don't take reservations for weekend brunch, the wait of approximately 30 minutes, didn't bother us at all when waiting in this gem, housed in the Venetian. \n\nOrdered the chicken and waffles on the waiters request, and it was absolutely delicious. Pair that with coffee and finishing the meals with the beignets have our day a perfect start. \n\nService, quality and the feeling of not feeling like we are in Vegas, makes Bouchon a must visit every time we do visit Vegas."

S'Bouchon is apparently the best breakfast place on the strip.  I somewhat agree but breakfast is just breakfast.  How great can eggs & bacon get?  So why the 4 stars? Please keep going. \n\nThe restaurant is located on the 10th floor of Venetian.   It\'s pretty easy to find because there are security guards scattered all around in the hallways on the way in.  The outdoor dining area was closed because it was summer and too hot.  It was beautiful though - with fountains and all.  You can see people swimming further back in the outdoor area as well. \n\nI had the eggs, bacon, potato croquette, and toast.   The toast is amazing.  Perfectly toasted all around.  I\'m sure you\'re asking "how good can TOAST be?"  Just try it.. You\'ll know what I mean.  The bacon was nice and crispy.  The eggs were okay (1 poached and 1 scrambled).  Potato croquette is def. worth the try! Crispy on the outside and super creamy on the inside.  The BF loved it. $13\n\nI also had the French Toast with my breakfast.... It is definitely NOT your typical French Toast.  It tasted more like a big bread pudding topped with caramelized apples, bananas, & powdered sugar.  It was way too sweet for the BF but I loved it.  I wish it had more of a pastry texture though.... Kinda tasted TOO much like just pudding - which ended up feeling way too heavy.  There was no way we could finish it.. $13\n\nThe BF had the corned beef hash and eggs.  The corned beef wasn\'t grounded and were cut into cubes. The beef was slightly tough too.. I think cause of the way they were cut up.  I liked it overall but I wish it came with more hash potatoes.  He wasn\'t too impressed.. But I\'m sure he was being picky cause he expected it to be perfect.  $18'

S'There are only a few places in Las Vegas that I\'d shell out for a good meal, and Bouchon is one of them.\n\nIf you \'ve been to the Bouchon in California then the first thing you\'ll notice is that the deco is exactly the same: high ceilings, art deco furnishing, black and white tiled floor with splashes of tall greens here and there. It is a delight admiring the attire of the servers who are all uniformly dressed in black satin vests over the pressed-white dress-shirts.  The look is accented with a full piece of ankle-length, clean-white clothes secured on the back with an elegant twist.  \n\nThe lovely maitre\'d whisked me to a table and I was quickly served with the same grain-shaped, freshly-baked bread accompanied by fluffy savory butter.  My server\'s name was Brendon, a hearty gentlemen adorned with those old-school glasses like in Mad Men.  Having eyes that are always too big for my stomach and with a greedy heart of wanting to sample everything, I turned to him for recommendations.  \n\nWithout hesitation, Brandon recommended the foie gras (2.5oz), and decided on the tomato salade to freshen up the palate before we move onto the entr\xc3\xa9e of the day.  \n\nThe 2.5oz foie grais with sea salt came with neatly-stacked and golden toast strips.  To my surprise it was served in a small container where the top is covered with a thin layer of fat.  The server scooped out the surface fat and left me alone to enjoy the dish.  Scooping out the foie gras required a bit of a maneuverer since it was chilled in solid form, but the little pieces of it that fell out of my spoon quickly melted into, for a lack of better word, fat, on my plate.  It is truly a delightful indulgence - a smooth, rich, flavorful piece that fills your mouth.  This dish is best to be shared between two people. \n\nTomato Salad is comprised of fresh tomatoes of various sizes and colors are cut in half, tossed in light vinaigrette and plated beautifully on a grand piece of \'melon\'. \n\nAll the staff was very attentive and my water glass was never half-full.  The server came around to take away the pistachio shells (did I mention they were warm and toasty when they were served?).\n\nThe last dish was the special of the day: Plum sauce with basil infusion and dabs of fresh young goat cheese surrounding the tender....I almost burst into tears when I had this.  Everything was married together perfectly in a joyous dance. \n\nJust as I thought the dinner was done, Brendon came around and placed a dessert spoon on the table: "Got something sweet for you." I widened my eyes in disbelief, wow! Compliment of the house! The dessert was Pot-de-Cream with lemon jelly coating accompanied by two short-bread cookies dusted in fine sugar. My heart leaped up when I had the first scope; like the foie gras, silky smooth and full of flavour.  And for contrast I alternated between bites of the cookies and scoops of the pot-de-cream.\n\nAll in all, I look forward to the next time I dine at Bouchone.  If you get there before me, please say hello to Brandon.  \n\nBon appetito~'

Even thier butter is the most amazing butter Ive ever tasted. \nI love the service there, It is immaculately clean everytime, never really loud, and not as uptight as you would think. I have never been dissapointed EXCEPT when I order "specials" because you cant go back and get them when you want. If they offer Cauliflower soup, I highly reccommend. As is the Shrimp and Grits. \nDinner is perfect, and the portions are bigger than you would expect. \nThis is the perfect place to take Mom or Grandma for lunch! \nIf you want to get laid take your date here for dinner! \nShe will definitely put out!\nI really love this place, I could eat there every day if I could. \nThe only negative thing I could say about it... Im not fond of the french bread they offer the table, it is way too french for me and I prefer a more airy fluffy bread, \nThe location in the hotel from parking garage is a pleasant little walk..\nThis is a MUST for anyone visiting Las Vegas.\nIve also been to the Bouchon in Beverly Hills for dinner, and toured the kitchen, and it was exactly what you would expect from Chef Keller. A very quiet peaceful kitchen, everyone is very matronly, focused and the back of the house was spotless.'

S'I was not feeling good after a night on the town.  My insides were rearranging themselves and I took a shit in their bathroom that made me weep for my soul.  I had a 4.5 hour drive back to LA to look forward to and I was just not feeling the classy, upscale vibe of this place.  But my girlfriend was.  The things we do for the people we love.\n\nThank fucking God I sacked up and had brunch here first.  I swear that it saved my life.  It was reasonably priced and the food was outrageous.  They serve complimentary baguettes and butter/jam.  Seemed like every tiny loaf came fresh out of the kitchen with a mother\'s love baked right into its crust.  I got the breakfast americain, which is exactly what it sounds like - a man\'s fuckin breakfast.  Eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, and a pecan roll.  Fries on the side.  My girlfriend got the pan-roasted trout which was light and fresh. Everything was decadent without being too rude to my wallet.  \n\nOne of my pet peeves is how slowly it takes some places to refill your coffee, especially when you\'re battling a hangover that is trying to force you to come to terms with your alcoholism.  These motherfuckers were right on the money.  Refills so fast, I barely had time to think "Hey, coffee would be nice," before they were at my elbow, helping me pump caffeine into my system for the ride home.  Excellent service.'

S"This review only covers breakfast/brunch, we've never been to Bouchon for Dinner.  \n\nThis is _THE_ place to have breakfast in Las Vegas, hands-down.  The atmosphere is great, indoors and out. The service is exceptional, and the food is incredible.  We've had the bread pudding french toast, the waffles, the waffles and fried chicken, the corned beef hash, the omelettes and a few other items from the menu over the course of our 10+ visits.  Each item is exceptional, and dare I say, best-of-class.  This is the only place we insist on eating in Las Vegas almost every morning we're in town."

S'So we\'ve all heard of Thomas Keller and Bouchon (at least us from No. CA). I wasn\'t sure what to expect when I dined at the Las Vegas version. It was fantastic!! We flew into Vegas, our flight was delayed, we called and easily changed our dinner reservations (we were at 2nd seating). Our service was professional and non-hurried. We had a great leisurely meal. The Cod Beignets were fantastic! The Atlantic Fluke with lobster Hollindaise was really delicious.\n\nThe best part was when they found out it was my hubby\'s bday, they brought out some profiteroles with a candle and just very classily left if and wished him a Happy Birthday. Additionally, my hubby wanted to take home a menu, they not only gave it to us (it is only just paper) but sealed it one of those postcards they seal your wine label in. \n\nGreat service, great food.\n\nOnly complaint - pain in the ass to find inside the Venetian hotel. You definitely need to know where you are going (it is not located on "restaurant row") and when we asked several people who worked for the Venetian where it was located, we got mixed and poor directions. Bouchon has a separate elevator, off the parking structure, I believe it is on the 10th floor, and allow about 10-15 min to find it if you walk through the Venetians main doors.'

S'On the last day of my stay in vegas, my friends and I decided to go eat brunch at the bouchon, thinking it was going to be extremely expensive because it was French. We were seated immediately next to the window looking out to the venetian pool outisde. The view was enough to make me happy that morning. We ordered the mussles, steak with fries, chicken and waffles and I had the white sausage with eggs and a crossiont. We were served warm bread with butter and apricot jam i think. The jam and bread was to die for. It was so delicious and delicate. After that we recieved our orders. I did not know what was in my sausage but it was soft and tastey along with my warm flaky crossoint and eggs. The mussles were juicy and tastey. The chicken was roasted I think along with some bacon and chive waffles. The waffles came with a sauce and syrup and was very tastey. The fries were okay but the onion topped steak was so juicy and tender it melted in my mouth. It was a very nice meal before we left. Nice and paradise like environment for friends to talk and enjoy the vegas lifestyle.'

S"I have to admit, when I was trying to find a place to eat for a nicer dinner on our last trip to Vegas, I felt that finally being able to eat at a Thomas Keller restaurant would be putting my name on the fast track to earning some hardcore foodie street cred. Granted, it wasn't Per Se or the French Laundry, but one has to start somewhere.\n\nWe had a reservation for a Sunday evening, late enough that we were hungry but not so late that we still couldn't enjoy a later show. We were seated promptly, though strangely we were not greeted for several minutes. The cocktail list is pretty on-par in terms of Vegas pricing, and considering that these are actually well made drinks, as opposed to watered down slushies in plastic cups, this was a welcome change. I do wish that they had more wine offerings under $50 a bottle, because there were essentially none in this price range, however my Bouchon Cocktail was dangerous and fresh, and my husband's Manhattan was excellent.\n\nMy husband ordered the steak and frites, and I ordered the scallop special for the evening. The couple dining next to us felt their steak was tough, and although my husband didn't find it tough, he did feel that it was cooked more than he was expecting. The frites, by the way, tasted exactly like McDonald's fries. Not a bad thing, but interesting.\n\nMy scallop special was good, though not outstanding: the scallops were well seared and obviously cooked well. The dish came with tomatoes, eggplant and zucchini, which were cooked amazingly, considering I do not often like 2 of those vegetables. The dish also came with some incredibly unremarkable shrimp, whose purpose I couldn't identify, and a savory herbs de provence pain perdu, which was heavenly. I would have been very happy with just the seared scallops, the pain perdu and the vegetables. The shrimp, as well as the broth the dish sat in, didn't say much to me.\n\nFor dessert, my husband ordered the chocolate and burnt orange dessert, which we both enjoyed. I got one of the cheaper wines by the glass, and was incredibly pleased with it. I'm thankful and happy we were able to eat here, but would definitely choose somewhere new the next time I visit."

S"I am a huge fan of Thomas Keller's, so I was excited to try Bouchon for brunch.  My husband started out with the special corn soup (an incredibly smooth and subtly sweet concoction) and I had the seasonal berries with fresh cream.  For our brunch entrees I enjoyed the hearty Croque Madame and my husband had the dungeoness crab omelette.  Everything was wonderful and seasoned to perfection.  I also enjoyed their perfectly made bellini!  Service was stellar and can't wait until our next visit back at Bouchon."

S"Delicious breakfast! I had the apple brioche French Toast, but it was more like dessert for breakfast--but Vegas being Vegas, going a little overboard in the morning, it doesn't seem like you can argue over that. Service and atmosphere were nice, too--very attentive but not overly so and bright and airy inside. This place is hard to find, it's in the back of the Venetian, past the check-in desks, take an elevator, then down a long hallway. Seating is also first-come first-serve."

S"Headed to Vegas for a friends b-day, Bouchon was his selection.  I must say GREAT selection!\n\nAs many others said, the location is a little confusion.  It is not in the regular area with the other Venetian restaurants, but rather next door in the Palazzo (about a week before the offical celeb intoxicated opening), and the signs were not that great.  Anyways, we found it an upon walking in it was so beautiful.  The decor was amazing, I loved it!  \n\nThere was a party of 5 of us seated in a booth that most likely is for VIP....we had a view of the entire room.  (Quick back story....my friend made reservations for 4 and then the day before it changed to 5.  Well upon calling an additional guest was not possible.  However, the additional guest has a few connections in LA and therefore Vegas and she was able to get a party of five in.  Basically, what I was told after we left is that the restaurant thought one of our guests was writing a review).  Like another yelper, I also loved that the menus were cleverly wrapped around the napkins\n\nFirst, let's start with the service.  For a party of five, we had about 5 different people waiting on us (and sometimes all at the same time, really it was a blast!).  Our waiter was great!  He was extremely personable and easy to like.   (I am not into the pretentious dining experience).  The sommelier was helpful and suggested great wines for the table.  And every plate was delivered and cleared with perfection.  The wine glasses were always full and bread always replenished.  Every single person that helped us was great.  \n\nThe food was amazing as well!  We were brought some of the best bread, fresh from the over (still warm).  There were so many great choices on the menu.  Instead of a main course, I decided on the endive salad (beautifully presented and just as delicious), French onion soup (overflowing with cheese, the best part) and roasted bacon brussel sprouts (amazing) I was not disappointed in the least bit.  Other ordered the fish (salmon, I believe), chicken dish and of course the steak frites.  \n\nOf course the dessert was not to be ignored.  Although we each ordered a different dessert, somehow we ended up with 3 extra at the table (again, I think it had something to do with the rumored review).  I personally picked the creme brulee and was 110% happy!  This is one of my favorite dishes so I order it ALOT, and this may be been the best I ever had.  I forgot the other desserts, but I know there was not a morsel left on any of the plates! Everyone walked out very happy (and a little tipsy!)\n\nThe bill was very reasonable, I was actually shocked!  While I like to have a variety when heading to Vegas for restaurant, I would have no problem returning!"

S"Delicious!!! We came here on our first wedding anniversary. My husband ordered the leg of lamb and I ordered the roast chicken. He declared it was the best lamb he has ever tasted and I said the same about the chicken. He also loved the wine but was disappointed that he couldn't purchase a bottle anywhere because it was made especially for Bouchon. We also had the mussel appetizer which was steamed and served cold with 2 sauces. So simple yet SO delicious. Didn't have room for dessert though. We live in SF so we will definitely be visiting Napa's Bouchon when we get the chance! Service was very attentive. The only thing I was bummed out about was that a large party of adults allowed their kids to play all over the place. They caused a ruckus and were running and rolling all over the floor behind us. Parents didn't say anything and I thought that was really rude of them."

S'Awesome vibe. We hit Bouchon for brunch and their menu was fantastic and there was literally something for everyone. \n\nThe place was crowded for a Sunday morning, but even with the amount of people, I still felt like we had room. It is spacious and overlooking a beautiful outdoor patio area. We sat inside because it was mega hot out, but everyone outside seemed just as satisfied!\n\nThe service was great. Our waitress accommodated every request. Even though they were out of their blackberry jam, she brought us every other jam they had available! \n\nThe presentation of the food and quality is definitely something to brag about. It may just be my new favorite brunch spot!\n\nI honestly cannot think of anything bad! Even getting to the restaurant from valet was convienent.'

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, our server was great, and the food was plentiful. For $22 I received coffee, pastry (chocolate croissant, yum), fruit cup, and a plate of eggs, potatoes, toast, and spinach. Well worth the price. My wife got fancy banana waffles with a side of bacon and she enjoyed it as well.\n\nWe'll be back on our next trip, but maybe we'll head over there for lunch or dinner to see what else they have to offer."

S"I came here on my last day at Las Vegas for a trade show. I was really craving for french toast. So I got the Bouchon French Toast which is not your typical french toast from other restaurant. It was bread pudding style with warm layers of brioche, custard & apples served with maple syrup. The sweetness of the dish was perfect. I wanted more after I finished it. I started eating off my friend's Breakfast Americano dish. His dish was a good deal - two eggs any syle served with bacon, country sausage, pommes frites & toasted brioche include your choice of a breakfast pastry, fresh juice & Bouchon blend coffee. I finished his pastry. I was on a carb and sugar load =). Also, Bouchon was too good to be leaving not feeling full."

S'First off, we got very very good service because we had booked the private dining room for our party of 10, which came with a personal waiter and busboy team and direct access to the kitchen, so no problems on service.\n\nWe started off with 3 orders of the chocolate dusted beignets, that arrived freshly fried to order with a side of two sauces: nutella and a rasberry jam. Fantastic. Fresh and airy, lightly dusted, and with sweet sauces (save the sauces for the bread you\'ll get later). Which by, the way, is also very good. \n\nWe also ordered a variety of fresh baked goods. i went with the cheese danish (which was a little thicker than I was used to, but still fantastic with creamy cheese in the center), we also had the sticky buns, which was just ridiculously good. Not too dry, not too sweet, perfectly sticky.\n\nOur table ordered a variety which included the Sourdough Waffles with Strawberry, the French Toast (signature dish), the chicken and waffles (with bacon infused batter, which basically tastes like cocaine), and the tuna salad sandwich. Everything was served with decent portions, well executed, clean, and very tasty. I found the sourdough waffles to be light and airy, served with strawberries that were sweet but with that hint of tart, so good that i didn\'t even have to put syrup on my waffles!\n\nAlthough I found the prices to be a bit steep ($13 for mimosas and champagnes, although try the French 75 and the hibiscus champagne), we got out of there, with gratuity included, for about $40 a person. The entrees themselves are REALLY affordable, under $15 for most dishes (including $12 for french toast or waffles)\n\nAll in all, Bouchon is one of those splurge for fantastic food that borders on art experiences that define Vegas. While I found that everything was excellent, I wasn\'t completely blown away by anything particular that said to me "this is the best ____ I\'ve ever had". Still, definitely come here and give it a try!'

S"We always make sure we stop at Bouchon if we go to Las Vegas. Getting a reservation was easy using Open Table even on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe house bread is delicious because it's always fresh and warm. For an appetizer, we usually get the Salmon Rillette. I saw it on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and decided to try it. I don't regret it! If you love salmon, it's an amazing spread. My sisters love the foie gras here, but I can pass. I'm not a foie gras fan.\n\nDepending on the specials, my two go to dishes are the flat iron steak and the duck confit. If you love stuck, you can't go wrong with the flat iron and the price is reasonable. It's tender and very flavorful. As for the duck confit, I can actually order it as an entree. I usually stuff myself over appetizers that the duck is a good size for me. The preparation changes depending on the season. This time, I had it with fresh mustard and Brussels Sprouts. Nice and crunchy! Last time I had it, I had it on top of mashed potatoes and it came with some wine sauce. It's always good!\n\nAll in all, great restaurant, very consistent. You can find it in the Venezia towers at the Venetian! Until next time Bouchon..."

S'As much as I loathe this city, I took a weekend to spend it with Mom for a girly weekend.  Mom loves this place, so I had to take her again for another try.  It was my first.  \n\nThe place is beautiful.  You do not feel like you just walked out a stinky casino.\n\nThe service...no more than terrible.\nOur server was completely intrusive and at times intentionally rude.  I think he was trying to be funny, or amusing himself at our expense.  I do not think that you come to a Keller restaurant to be absolutely annoyed by a passive aggressive waiter.  I could pay my local dominatrix the same price I paid here and get heaps of aggressive rope burn without the passive weenieness.  I almost called him a dick like 5 times.  I used to work in restaurants for a long time, so I have a bit more patience with service than most.  \n\nI don\'t know if that effected the way I ingested, but the food was not what I was expecting.  In fact, it was just OK.  I ordered scallops, and there was so much grit, I sent it back.  Of course, (I\'ll call him "Eugene") Eugene looked at me like I was a Hitler Youth for suggesting that what he was serving was sub-par.  \nHe took it off the bill and acted as if he was doing us a favor.\nIdiot.  \n\nI think I may try French Laundry another time.\n\nNEVER again with this place.'

S"Yum yum yum, this place was wonderful.\n\nBouchon is everything you expect from fine dining, without the pressure of acting snotty and getting super dressed up.  It has the kind of service you'd expect when paying approximately $50 per person.  I never had an empty water glass [they leave a bottle of water on the table, but you never have to fill it yourself.... they keep coming to fill up your glass].  They clean the bread crumbs off your table between courses.  They make suggestions for food and drinks without pressuring you or up-selling.  All in all a wonderful experience.\n\nThe food--exceptional.  My fiance started with their onion soup and then had their entree special, braised short ribs.  It was served with some kind of potato gratin or something, which were wonderful!  The short ribs had some kind of glaze that gave it a very rich flavor without being overwhelming.  I had their tasting plate of cheeses [sadly, I didn't pay enough attention to find out the names of the cheeses] which were different, but all good.  For my entree, I had their croque madame which brought me back to Paris.  I felt like I was back at that little cafe next to Notre Dame.  Yum-o.  Sadly, my beau and I were too stuffed to try their desserts, but we would definitely come back, so maybe next time!"

S"On a bachelorette party trip to Vegas, I think we ate every meal at Bouchon!  Must haves include:\n\nSourdough waffles-  Umm, why don't we have these in San Francisco?  I don't even like waffles. The vanilla bean butter made these feel like dessert.\n\nFrench toast- dessert for breakfast.\n\nCroque Madame- Amazing grilled cheese (it better be at $19). So good it is on the brunch and dinner menu.\n\nKir Royal- The best adult beverage of your life, blackcurrant champagne fizz\n\nWarning: The coffee may cause you to found a new religion or branch of philosophy.  No matter how hung over, you will not be hanging out by the pool after a cup of this Joe!\n\nFor dinner,  Salude de Poulpe- I have a soft (not rubbery) spot for octopus. \n\nFollowed by Truite aux Almandes- picture almonds, lots of almonds, over a bed of  green beans and butter.  \n\nNo dessert this time.  \n\nTo make the weekend last for the rest of the week, I brought home Macaroons in neon colors.  Each one was  essence of pistachio, coffee, strawberry, lemon, vanilla or chocolate that melts in your mouth.  Perfect with my morning coffee.  \n\nCan't wait to go back."

S"Just can not wait to return to Sin City for another visit to Bouchon. Granted there is a Bouchon here in L.A., the service just doesn't match that here in Vegas. The service we received was very professional. Some highlights were the Sourdough Waffles with fresh strawberries, scrambled eggs which were so rich in flavor, and the sausage.  Obvious, started with the Bellini, could have had like six of those, and finished with espresso. I really recommend dining al fresco. Especially in the middle of summer, in the morning. It is so peaceful. A truly pleasant way to start the day. The only disappointment is that the chicken and waffles I was so looking forward to, ( thanks for all the teasing Yelp!) is only served on the weekends. Unfortunately we were there on a Monday morning. Would love to try a dinner here also! Can be a challenge to locate if your are unfamiliar with the layout of Palazzo/Venetian properties."

S'I really enjoy having breakfast at the Bouchon restaurant at The Venetian.  \n\nOne of my favorite things to do is to get a table overlooking the fountain and slowly revel in a selection of croissants (Pain au Chocolate and regular) while unhurriedly sipping a cup of coffee. \n \nMy husband usually orders the French Toast.  While the French Toast is probably one of the most calorie-enhanced dishes on the menu, the its taste is worth a few extra hours at the gym - the dish absolutely melts in your mouth while drowning your senses in the ticklish spender of warm custard and apple-tasting layers of brioche.    \n\nThe service is prompt, dependable, courteous and professional.

S"Any time I even hinted that I was going to Vegas the first words uttered out of someone's mouth was Bouchon. I truly wish I would have went here for their brunch because that is what seems to be spectacular about this place.\n\nFirst off the service was amazing. Our waiter made fantastic suggestions and joked around with us. He made the meal just that much better.\n\nI honestly adored the way they bring out the fresh baguette and simply place it on the table. I've never been to France but in my vision of a small cafe, this how they would do it.\n\nThey had introduced a new menu about a week before we arrived, probably gearing up for fall, which doesn't show it's face around Vegas. \n\nWhile we waited to be seated we watched the chef's prepare the raw bar. It was amazing to watch how much lobster flew out of this place. \n\nNaturally , after seeing everyone else indulging in the raw bar we ordered oysters. Unfortunately they did not impress us.\n\nWe also ordered the olives, they were completely amazing. Do yourself a favor and order them.\n\nMy parents ordered a salad- Salade Fris\xc3\xa9e aux Lardons et Oeuf Poch\nfris\xc3\xa9e lettuce, fines herbs, bacon lardons, a soft poached hen egg & toasted brioche. I was utterly jealous. This looked and sounded amazing. This made me wish I went back to eating meat for the night.\n\nMy mom and I both intended on ordering the gnocchi. I sat back and wondered what the hell we were doing at Bouchon eating gnocchi, so at the last minute and with the encouragement of our waiter we changed our minds.\n\nI ordered the mussels and frites and was promptly told that if I was going to eat seafood I needed to get the trout. My response? Really trout? I grew up eating trout, ok here goes nothing. It was amazing. I just can't eat a lot of fish because I'm not used to eating it, but I'm happy I tried it. It made me appreciate trout in a new light.\n\nMy mom ordered Poulet R\xc3\xb4ti, roasted chicken with quince,charred radicchio & truffle emulsion. She was very happy she ordered this dish. The chicken just melted in your mouth, well according to her. This dish also made me wish I ate meat. \n\nMy dad decided to order to appetizers as his entree because he couldn't choose between them and nothing stood out too much as an entree. Veau Brais\xc3\xa9 en Cr\xc3\xa9pinette, braised veal tail with forest mushrooms, soft polenta & sherry vinaigrette. And Confit de Canard, duck leg confit, French green lentils, matignon of root vegetables & red wine duck jus. Once again I cannot comment because I do not eat meat. \n\nI think the fact that I expected so much because all I heard about was Bouchon it did not live up to my expectations. It was really good, but nothing about it really knocked my socks off especially for the price. \n\nIf I were in Vegas I would try Bouchon for brunch, but I don't think I'd ever go back for dinner."

S'CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.... NOT SERVED ON WEEKDAYS!! I\'ll just get that one out of the way, right away. Being a nice French restaurant located right on the edge of one of the Venetian\'s pools, I was expecting much more from Bouchon. We were very promptly seated on the patio after being asked twice if we were sure we wanted to sit in the heat. We were fine with sitting outside, but being sat almost directly in the sun when there were empty tables still completely shaded was a little bit of a head scratcher. (No biggie, brush it off) A server then brings a glass of orange juice to our table and the girlfriend and I look at each other, confused. Is OJ complimentary at this fine place? Answer: No. OJ was then taken away after our server being made aware. Then comes the C & W fiasco. Oh, Chicken and Waffles, how I so looked forward to devouring you this fine Vegas morning......(Screeching halt) "C & W is one of our most requested dishes during the week, but our chef likes to serve it as a specialty item on weekends" was the response from our waiter. So... you tell me how many times daily that $12 is wasted on a cab ride to NOT eat C & W on a weekday? (Yes partially my fault for not doing my research, but c\'mon man) Breakfast was just OK, my corn beef hash was served first and started to get cold as we waited about 5 minutes for the girlfriends dish to arrive and her\'s still wasn\'t warm? Girlfriends food was snatched from her before she could finish. We had to ask every time we needed our coffee refilled. Not impressed. Won\'t be back'

S'This is a review for Sunday Brunch:  I really hate to give another review from my Las Vegas trip low stars, but they really deserve it. \n\nUpon arrival we were asked to wait 10-15 minutes for a table.  I enjoyed the space and the service/ cappuccino at the marble bar. (Moving forward I would recommend this portion for drinks only!) However, while we were at the bar, no one ever came to inform us of our table. My bf asked the host and there was no record of our name!  \n\nWhen we were finally seated, we ordered two breakfast entrees and a beignet starter( i was envisioning tasty puffs with powder sugar- like new orleans). The "doughnuts" were an inch round, undercooked and there were 3 on tiny plate for $8! boo.  When the meals arrived our table was still packed with plates and appetizer mess.....which was originally ignored and forced onto our cluttered table anyways.  It wasn\'t until I spoke up and pointed that we had no room to eat, that any of the wait staff saw it necessary to remove anything.  The food was very bland and unimpressive once we dug in- I had the boring waffles that sound fancy with vanilla bean butter, and my BF had the croque madam with is really just a plate of french fries and a burnt sandwich covered up with a salty bernaisse. \n\nI really feel like a tool for picking this restaurant as I have been a fan of Thomas Keller for quite some time. The one thing this place does have in common with a French Bistro is the snobby \'tude and "our food is the best in the world" mentality, when it clearly is not.'

S"My husband and I went here for breakfast during the first day of our honeymoon. We were considering visiting Napa and I really wanted to go to one of Keller's restaurants , so eating here was high on the list for dining in Vegas for me.\n\nI ordered the sourdough waffles and a side of bacon, my husband the breakfast american with a strawberry croissant, one of the daily specials, as his pastry. We both got coffee and his meal came with juice.\n\nThe coffee was good but didn't stick out in anyway other than tasting relatively freshly brewed. No burnt coffee, yay! The waffles, served with syrup, vanilla bean butter, and strawberries, were fantastic. It was especially glorious to have all three together on a bite of waffle, the flavors melding together. The effect was a light sort of sweetness that wasn't too heavy or overwhelming. Possibly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The bacon was...bacon. And there was a lot of it. It was actually bordering on too much bacon.\n\nI got a bite of the husbands croissant, which was also incredibly delicious. It had a think layer of strawberry jam and was topped with a crumb topping and served warm. The fresh, tart flavor of the jam kept the pastry from being overwhelming rich. It was really tasty and I wish we had brought some home. Husbands eggs were over easy, cooked perfectly, and he said the flavors in his sausage were very good too.\n\nWould have gone back a few more times were it not so damned far from our hotel."

S"Chimay...on tap! Enough said, that's worth it alone! \n\nMy wife and I had a fabulous time at Bouchon last week. Everything we tried met or exceeded our already high expectations of the restaurant. \n\nDrinks: 5 stars - As mentioned before, Chimay on tap! My wife had a Bouchon martini that was fantastic. \n\nStarters: Beignets and escargot. I'll give this 4 stars. The escargot was fabulous, but when you're having puff pastry with all that butter, how can it not? The beignets were excellent too, but not in a blow your socks off type of way. A very solid dish. \n\nDinner: Croque madame and glazed pork shoulder. I'll give this 4.5 stars. I absolutely love croque madame's, and I've had a lot of them! Overall, I'd rank the dish up there with the better ones I have tried. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was certainly better than most. The glazed pork shoulder, however, was absolutely fantastic. Easily the best pork shoulder dish I've ever tried. \n\nDessert:  Little brownies sprinkled with nuts and peanut butter ice cream. 3 stars. Just an okay dessert. This dish was the odd man out because there wasn't anything unique or special about it. \n\nService: 5 stars. Very prompt, informative and friendly. Couldn't ask for better."

We started off with a simple salad, which was good  - fresh vegetables and minimal dressing.  My entr\xc3\xa9e was Steak and Fries, which was really good...while it was good, I can't say it was great.  Others at the table ordered the Roasted Chicken, which was incredible!  The chicken was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasonings and remained moist and juicy...the skin was actually the best part since it was rich and crispy (butter maybe?).  I really should have had the chicken!  For dessert I had the Dark Chocolate Mousse, which was awesome - velvety and creamy, this was a perfect dessert and a great way to end the meal.\n\nThis place is pricey and fit for special occasions so make sure you dress appropriately."

I thought the food was going to be good, but I was really pretty disappointed.\n\nI got the steak frites cooked medium rare.  The steak wasn't particularly well cooked, didn't have much flavor, and my biggest gripe about it was that it didn't have any sort of sear on the outside of the steak, it was just kind of mushy all around.  It's really pretty expensive which makes sense considering it's in a nice hotel in vegas, but the food was just not good.\n\nI would definitely not come again, and I expected much more from a Thomas Keller restaurant."

S"Thomas Keller's Las Vegas version of Bouchon is pretty much that - a Las Vegas version of the Napa Valley eatery.  It's bright, massive and it's in a pretty swanky Las Vegas Hotel Casino.\n\nThe hostesses were a little spacey, (they seemed like trainees) but were very nice and we technically didn't run into any difficulties being seated.  They even dialed Pinot Brasserie so we could call and cancel our reservations.\n\nFood wise, I was satisfied.  Four stars satisfied.  I think I'm a little harder on my restaurant scoring because I've dined at a lot of places in Asia and America so I've got a pretty good idea of fabulous dining.\n\nAlthough my party did not sample the much hyped raw shellfish selections, I did take time to notice the prep and display area.  A large sushi kitchen circular glass case with two (I think) sous chefs working away.\n\nGiven my critical rating, these four stars are well earned.  Our server was quirky but knowledgeable.  Our sommalier was friendly and very helpful - pretentious is not a word I would use for any part of this experience, even though the service and presentation was nearly first class.\n\nAn old french favorite of mine has always been French onion soup.  Yup, old reliable.  As commonplace as [it] can be, I've definitely has my fair share of screwed up FOS.  Bouchon does not screw this up.  Both of the required cheeses were adequately layered and baked on top.  The broth was salty but not moisture drenching and there was the perfect amount of breading.\n\nThis review is for a dining experience exactly one week ago and my entree is a little fuzzy (I'm sick right now).  I do remember that I definitely wanted chicken but they definitely didn't have a sauce compatible with my allergen list.  The waiter switched the sauce and used the duck sauce which worked out quite well and my fuzzy memory is one of happiness and content.  Although salads should be bullet proof, they  too can be weak or ruined and I remember being impressed with the ingredients and presentation.\n\nAs a wrap up, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone that is looking for a reliable fine dining establishment away from the noise and the crush of the Venetian restaurant row or for anyone on a mission to sample the establishments of America's finest chefs across America.  Bouchon Las Vegas will not let you down."

S'"The secret to happiness is low expectations."  I lived by this mantra for a very long time, but allowed myself to slide a little bit when I booked a table at Bouchon.  I\'d been to Thomas Keller\'s slightly better known restaurant in California, and had been so completely blown away that I figured Bouchon should offer something damn good in its price range.\n\nNot quite.  We had an attentive, polite, and gregarious waiter who made us feel very much at ease and gave enthusiastic recommendations.  There was nothing he could do to deter us from ordering the half lobster (which my friend wanted to try) and the foie gras (which after two outstanding experiences at FL was a must order for me) and he recommended the halibut entree also.\n\nHe warned us that the foie gras was large and a terrine rather than a single fried piece, and suggested we order not too much more.  I should have listened.  Somehow 5 oz of foie gras didn\'t strike me as a massive amount, but it was, as in enough for a table for six.  And not particularly good.  It tasted more like patee than the foie gras.  Serving a massive overpriced portion of mediocre food goes completely against what I understand TK\'s philosophy on food to be.  Keller says you should give customers not quite enough of something, so that they can enjoy just a taste of several things while remaining hungry for additional offerings.  But this was easily the least rich, least buttery foie gras (including terrine) I\'ve ever had, and there was just way too much for two people.  In fact, there was enough that we gave the rest of it to the couple next to us, who dug into it with enthusiasm, and they still left more than a third of it by the time they were done.  Instead of making their best waiters hedge to the customers on the foie gras, they should just take it off the menu.\n\nAnyway, the lobster was excellent albeit pricey, and was served with a buttery mustard sauce that was simply a perfect match.  This was by far the most successful savory dish that we tried.  Again we were reminded of the not-quite-top-quality dining experience by the amount of fighting required to extract the half lobster from its shell.  I\'m not the world\'s slickest guy with a lobster cracker, but this got damn messy, as in almost for our neighbors too.\n\nWe also ordered the halibut on waiter\'s suggestion which had a nice texture but near zero flavor on its own.  Fortunately, it was served on top of some vegetables and a sauce that matched it nicely, and brought the flavor into detectable range.  \n\nAs for the complimentary bread and highly not-complimentary house blend of red wine, both were reasonably pleasant.  The bread didn\'t stack up very well in terms of flavor or freshness compared to what we\'d enjoyed at Olives earlier that day.   Upon our request, they also brought out some locally carbonated water they made using that special Norwegian machine.  For fear of sounding like a yuppie @$$hole I usually don\'t go bonkers about water, but this water tasted particularly crisp, clean, and cool.  Is this psychological or is it actually better?\n\nWe finished with a wonderful creme brulee dessert which had the perfect level of sweetness and crispiness.  The top layer seemed thinner than usual, and this was a good thing.  Bravo.\n\nAnyway, despite the heroic efforts of our waiter, Bouchon scored bigger failures (foie gras, halibut) than successes (water, creme brulee).   This is no tragedy, but given the $200 cost including two glasses of wine and tip it\'s tough to justify going back.  Mon Ami Gabi and Olives both had more knockout items at a substantially lower price.  TK, I believe in you!  Fix this!'

Service was flawless.  Love the bread on the table.  Like right on the table  Salmon fans, try the Salmon rillette.  Amazing.  So good, my wife and I had to take our mothers the next night.  Also tried the Lamb, Sole, Steak Frites.  All good, but they had trouble cooking my steak at medium rare.  But because of the overall service and quality of food it is still a 5.

S'Pretty big disappointment. We arrived around noon on a Saturday in time for brunch. First come first served. Host told us it would be a 45 mins wait which turned into an hour wait. When we were finally seated, the waiter took a while to take our order and it took over 20-30 mins for the food to be served. To make matters worse, my quiche was lukewarm and didn\'t even taste that great. I always finish my desserts, but in this case, I didn\'t even eat half of the cheese danish. My fiance ordered the american breakfast which came with an orange juice. I asked the waiter for the oj and he said "oh instead of brining you the oj, I decided to not charge your friend for his oj". WHAT? Who does that??!?! Will not be back anytime soon.'

S"Bouchon fell flat for me.  I put off writing this review for a few weeks because I feel a bit guilty for dissing the restaurant of someone who is considered one of the best chefs in the country.  But, the purpose of Yelp is to give real unbiased reviews, so here goes...\n\nThe positive:  The host staff was great.  My boyfriend and I were meeting his friend for dinner, and another restaurant won by popular vote.  But, as it turns out, they have a ridiculous reservation/cancellation policy so we bailed on that one.  Next came Bouchon.  We weren't given any hassles, and they were very accommodating when we called to say that we may be a few minutes late for our reservation.  \n\nThe decor of the place was beautiful, and the paper on the tables was a nice touch.  It was a nice mix of French elegance and casual sensibility - which I guess is what a French bistro is exactly supposed to be.  The bus boy deserves a mention as well.  He actually was the highlight for me..  he accidently filled my glass with tap water instead of bottled (this was not a big deal to me - I would've been fine with that) but he felt so bad and was so apologetic that he kept bringing us fresh bottles throughout the night to make up for it.\n\nNow for the negative.  \n\nBoth items I ordered were under seasoned.  The meal would've been 10x better if salt had been invited to the party.  The onion soup was the first offender - I love onion soup, and was really excited to try it here as well.  I was disappointed to say the least.  I should admit that I'm not the biggest fan of veal (or veal stock) so I'm sure that added to it, but I just didn't think it was that good.  At all.   I ordered the roast chicken as my entree, and had high hopes for this as well.  Keller's  brine recipe gets rave reviews, so I thought this was going to be the most delicious roast chicken I had ever tasted.  It wasn't.  Again, it needed salt.   The chicken itself was very tender and had a nice crispy skin, but the corn and potatoes it was served with were a big let down.  There wasn't enough of a difference between the two in flavor and texture to make it an winning dish.  Lardons and mushrooms were also in the mix, but to me this dish was just boring.  Chicken, corn and potatoes.  My mom can make that, and she doesn't cook.  \n\nThe service also lacked.  Our waiter was mostly absent, and when he was around he didn't really seem to want to be.  My original thought was to order the gnocchi, but I second guessed myself (gnocchi in a French restaurant?!) so I asked his opinion and he said to go with the roast chicken, hands down.  That's another strike against him, haha.  \n\nIf I could do it over again, I'd skip Bouchon for dinner and maybe go for brunch instead."

S'My love loves this place. We basically come here for brunch every time we come to Vegas. I love their patio, their service, part of their food. I don\'t like the wait, and the other part of their food.\n\nFirst time I came here was over a year ago, I was looking forward to their brunch since my love was telling me how he raved about his dish and how they have chicken and waffles. I admit, I didn\'t hear a single word except "chicken. and. waffles." Unfortunately, I didn\'t get to try it. Their chicken and waffles were only on their weekend brunch menu. We went there on a Monday, so I opted for something off of their daily specials. I could not remember what I had there but I remembered what my love had ordered. It was such a plain and simple omelette that I don\'t remember eating, I don\'t recall anything. He had this overly sweetened french toast in a cylindrical shape with apples and syrup. He isn\'t a sweets lover, so it might be reasonable for most. He liked the texture but the sweetness was too overwhelming. \n\nFew months ago, we went there again, choosing the right day of the week. Dealing with an hour long wait wasn\'t cool, but for a group of 6 without a reservation, it\'s reasonable. They had these little pastries in the front for the people waiting for a table and you can always order a mimosa and drink your day away. I am happy to say that I finally ordered their CHICKEN. AND. WAFFLES. served with both gravy and syrup. Chicken wasn\'t deep fried like southern style, and my waffles had bacon and chives in it. I don\'t really care for bacon but this darn thing was so delicious, that I had to stuff my face immediately with table manners. For the first time I enjoyed the taste of syrup more than gravy on my chicken and waffle. The sweetness of the syrup was balanced out perfectly with the chicken and waffles. My chicken tasted like honey grilled wings (except it was a chicken leg and a breast) and the bacon and chives made this dish into more of a savory course rather than the confused-wtf-are-you-eating dish. Because my sauces are served separately, I don\'t need to worry about my waffles turning soggy. The waffles were so plump and fluffy, I was gonna die. \n\nI fell in love with this dish right there, right then. It will be hard for me to come back here again to try other things. Their daily special almost did it, they had shrimp and grits that day, it was one of my toughest decisions to make in Vegas other than to bet on red or black at the roulette table.'

S"If you were only allowed to order two things at Bouchon, let those two things be their cheese danish and their french fries.\n\nWhile having a lovely brunch at Bouchon on a Saturday morning (after I learned the hard way that they're not open for brunch on weekdays), I stuffed myself with their house french baguette, two different kinds of beignets, a cheese danish, waffles with strawberry and whip, THEN I proceeded to indulge in my boyfriend's plate of delicious french fries that came with his steak pomme frites.  My fingers and hand were stuck in a repetitive motion that circled from his plate to my mouth until his plate was virtually left with nothing but crumbs.\n\nNow let's talk about their cheese danish.  If your mind is envisioning the flat cheese danish from your local starbucks, snap out of it.  Mr. Keller kicked it up ten notches when he created the flakey, muffin-size pastry dressed with a generous dollop of a decadent vanilla bean-cream cheese.  Pick one up from the Bouchon Bakery downstairs if you'd prefer to eat yours on the go.  \n\nDon't get me wrong... almost everything I tried was delicious.  But what sticks out in my mind a month and a half after my visit remains the cheese danish and fries.  \n\nThe restaurant was filled with character and charm on a bright spring day atop the Venetian Tower.  Service staff was plentiful and friendly."

S'Perfect place for sunday brunch and its been a traditional that we come for sunday brunch after a crazy saturday night. love that they have fresh squeeze juice because that is the only way i like my juice. the beignets are so amazingly good and what better than housemade jam and nutella to go with. it was breakfast heaven. of course the oysters were fresh and ohhh so yummy mmmmmmMMMMmmm. i had the special for that day and everytime ive come ive always ordered the special and it was always spectacular! however that leaves me unable to eat the regular menu which i have been wanting to do everytime im there. unfortunately once the waiter/waitress starts telling me about the special of the day its so hard not to order that. still want to try the chicken and waffles and the french toast OMG that will be the goal next time im there. Last time here i treated myself and two others and it came out to 150. not cheap to eat but anytime your at a thomas keller establishment this is the kind of price tag you are looking at but you will definitely get the most bang outta your buck here. food wise at least lol.'

S"I liked this place. The service was excellent. The bread way amazing.\nThe outdoor patio was great, it was a perfect evening in Vegas.\n\nWe had a couple of their specialty martini type drinks, they were all excellent with fresh juices and mixed perfectly.\n\nThe oysters were so fresh they seemed plucked straight from the ocean! I had my doubts ordering oysters and being in Vegas. But I had heard Anthony Bourdin has first pic flown in fresh daily, so I was confident they would be fresh, and they certainly did not disappoint.\n\n The asparagus/prosciutto appetizer was strange, it sounded better than it tasted, I probably would not recommend ordering that due to some sort of odd seasoning they used.\n\n I had a daily special appetizer, which had pork belly. I have never had pork belly so I decided to go for it, it was my favorite, quite delicious! It had crispy squares of pork with some sort of custard sauce in a pie crust with micro greens and white asparagus. The crust was addicting!\n\nFor main courses, I had the roasted chicken. I love roasted chicken, I make an amazing one myself, so I had to try what they did with it. Well, it was a huge disappointment. It was bland, flavorless, and dry. The sauce was so weak that came with it, well I could not tell what type of sauce it was. I would NOT recommend ordering this dish to anyone unless you are on a special diet that restricts seasoning.\n\nMy friend had the steak and frittes, and WOW that was so good! The steak was the best I have ever had. There was some sort of butter herb onion marmalade topping on the steak. The steak was so tender that it melted in your mouth, and with the topping, well it was sheer perfection!\nThe frittes (aka fries) were crispy and delicious! I would highly recommend ordering this!\n\nI ended up filling up on my friends steak and ditching the dud of a chicken dish.\nFor dessert we had the profiteroles, I think. We gobbled them up so quick even thought we were stuffed that, well, I barely remember seeing them.\n\nSo the grand total with tax and tip was $230.90! \nThat was an awesome deal for the quantity and quality, and let's not forget being in Vegas! \nCheers to you Bouchon!"

Service was impeccably good. Waitress checked on me often, but not too much, just enough to let me know she was around if I needed her :-).\n\nFunny thing is, to get to the actual restaurant is a trek in itself (Elevator to wedding chapel floor, walk down seriously long hallway that seemed like the hallway in "Poltergeist" that kept getting longer & longer), but I guess it was because I was hungry that I found that kinda annoying.

S"This is one of the restaurants my husband really wanted to visit while on our Vegas vacation last week.  We were just going to grab some pastries to go so we could munch on them at our leisure; however, we decided to go full-on breakfast at the last minute.\n\nFirst of all, the restaurant itself is just lovely.  Elegant, blue decor puts you at ease as soon as you walk in.  There is also a very nice outdoor seating area if you are so inclined.  Service was great.  Our server was very expeditious in taking our order, bringing our food, and checking on us throughout the meal.\n\nThe first thing we did was sample one of their pastries on special, which was a chocolate almond croissant.  This was absolutely amazing.  The perfect way to start out breakfast.  They also have a special deal where you can get 4 pastries for $13, which sounds extremely cheap compared to most of Las Vegas.  We had them box some up to-go for us, which made us anticipating the next morning's breakfast in a hard-core, can't wait, stomach growling sort of way.\n\nI chose the Brioche Doree for my main meal.  This was a delicious French toast served bread pudding style, layered with custard, caramelized apples and bananas, drizzled in maple syrup.  It was so delicious.  Comforting, moist, soft, oozy - all your favorite food adjectives rolled into one.  I ate all of it, and I never ever ever eat all my food.\n\nMy husband ordered the Petit Dejeuner Americaine which was two eggs any style with bacon, sausage, pastry, brioche toast, juice and a Bouchon blend coffee.  Out of all that, he was mostly in awe of the toast.  He took a bite, then sat back and kind of zoned out for a bit.  Said it was amazing, which is kind of an odd thing to say about toast.  But I suppose it is brioche that is made at Bouchon, so it probably IS amazing.\n\nWe split a side of Lyonnaise potatoes, and I highly highly highly two thumbs up suggest you order these with your meal.  Ugh.  So good.  In fact, I could've used a whole plate of these.  Like a huge, ginormous plate.  In order words, don't split this side.  It is definitely a single serving and you'll want them all for yourself.\n\nWish we were locals so we could go back and try lunch or dinner.  Cuz if breakfast is any indication of what they're capable of, I have no doubt we could eat here all day every day and never feel it necessary to leave."

Our coffees tasted amazing (I went down to the bakery to buy the beans right after) and was possibly the best blend I've had. My friend's waffles came out perfectly (crispy with generous specks of bacon and chive) and her chicken was so moist. I loved the maple syrup and vanilla bean butter that came with it. The ligonberry jam and butter that came for my brioche was really high-quality (I noticed it and wouldn't normally notice my butter and jam!) and my eggs were the most perfectly fried eggs I've ever seen - evenly fried, not too greasy. Fresh grapefruit juice, 6 crispy strips of bacon, and two sausages later, I felt sufficiently but not overly full, and appreciated the fresh and expertly cooked taste of each item we had."

I watch all these cooking shows on TV, I know the name of all the hot-shot chefs, but I've never, until now, been to one of their restaurants.\nIt's safe to say that after the experience we had at Bouchon, I am inspired to visit more high-end restaurants like these once in awhile.\n\nBouchon was a big treat for us, we don't normally splurge quite that big for dinner, but we were out celebrating our birthdays, we were going to see the Blue Man Group and so I ended up making reservation at Thomas Keller's Bouchon.\nBeing that we never splurge like this, we had decided that price wouldn't be a concern, we knew it would be pricey but to order whatever dish we wanted, it was a special treat after all.\n\nAfter running in circles around the Venetian we finally found Bouchon!  We were greeted very nicely and promptly seated at a table where we immediately were served water and introduced to our waiter who explained every dish so that our mouths were watering before even having seen the menu!\n\nWe ended up ordering a gnocchi with chicken and some kind of cream sauce, along with a carrot soup (well it had a fancier name than that....it was kind of like a vichyssoise.) and I, of course, HAD to get the french onion soup.  Why dine at a top notch french restaurant without finding out what a top notch french onion soup would taste like?\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Bouchon steak it had, for a lack of a better common term, something reminiscing of potatoes au gratin, but the potatoes were shaved and stacked into a square with sauce between .... (I'm not fancy chef, so I can't remember the term for everything lol....).  My husband had the flank steak with french fries.\n\nNow, before we even got to the food, they served us fresh baked bread, it was delightful!! Soft in the middle, crispy crust.... just like it should be! Butter came with it AND warmed pistachios!  I'd take a warm pistachio, eat it and then eat some bread and the flavor from the pistachio carried over to the bread, it was divine. Can't stop dreaming about it ;-) lol.\n\nThe rest of the food was also magnificent.  Have you had french fries that melt in your mouth??? Never! (Well, now I have.... thanks Bouchon!) Steaks, of course cooked to perfection.  \nFor dessert, they happened to have my very favorite one on special for the day, Creme Brulee!   It was perfect.  Sugary top that cracked when we poked our spoon through it, cream velvety vanilly goodness overflowing..... \n\n\nThe service was of course impeccable. Every time I took a drink of water, the glass was topped off again.  After awhile I almost felt bad drinking any more, because the poor guy kept running back with the water jug after each sip! :)\n\nPricey? Yes. But we went for the experience of tasting a master chef's cuisine and for the atmosphere.  For one night and one night only, we didn't care much about the bottom line.  If you come to a fancy eatery like Bouchon, do yourself a favor and forget about the price.  Order what you want to taste because THAT is what you will remember for the rest of your life.   \n\nI would definitely come back, I do recommend that if you are out to try an upper class type of restaurant with good food, Bouchon is a good one for sure :)\n\nSo put your blinders on for one night, make your reservation at Bouchon and treat yourself to a mouthful or two of Thomas Keller's excellent cuisine.  You will enjoy it."

S"Came here with a group of 12 for a birthday dinner. Waitstaff and service was excellent. bread and butter was the highlight of my night, lol. \n\nOrdered a variety of dishes...\n-steak and frites was so average. Are you kidding me? No au jus sauce for the steak?? I couldn't believe it. So I sat there eating a fairly dry steak, not fun. The entire point of steak and frites is so you can soak it up in all the juices!  \n\nI wouldn't recommend this restaurant for a fine dining experience in Las Vegas. Check out Michael Minna's restaurant in the Bellagio for better food."

S'The signs proclaim "Best Breakfast in Las Vegas".  In a town where every show purports to be the "Show of the Year", Bouchon lives up to the hype.  \n\nDisclosure: we were on the VIP list because my girlfriend works for the chef\'s brother, however, we paid for our entrees and I saw the other tables get the same level of service that we did, so the only difference between the VIP treatment and the unwashed masses is a plate of pastries, a yogurt parfait, and a charcuterie plate.\n\nBut that pastry sampler is an excellent place to start.  The cream cheese danish was something that I\'d happily roll around naked in.  The pastry was light, airy, and flaky.  The cream cheese was light, and more like a sugary custard than the filling that you might get elsewhere.  The GF loved the sticky bun.  You could make a meal out of the pastries alone.\n\nThe yogurt parfait was kind of lost on me.  It was sweetened with fresh strawberries, which I\'m sure would make most people happy, but since I don\'t eat that fruit, it didn\'t move me.\n\nOn the suggestion of the waiter, I ordered the Chicken with Waffles.  This is a dish that I would normally pass on (what does chicken have to do with waffles anyway) but the waiter\'s description intrigued me and I\'m glad I took the advice.  It\'s a good balance of savory and sweet, with chives mixed into the sourdough waffles and a half chicken.  Tip:  let the maple syrup mix with the sauce that you pour over the chicken.  It\'s awesome.\n\nService was top-notch.  Granted, we were on the VIP list, so they were sucking up to us and we had a team of people swarming over our table from time to time, but looking around, they did that for everyone.  And for the price you pay at Bouchon, you deserve that kind of treatment.\n\nThe restaurant is easy to find if you\'re arriving at the Venetian by cab (the elevator is right off the main check-in desk), but if you\'re walking in from the strip through the casino, you\'ll probably get lost.'

S'My boyfriend made dinner reservations to eat at Bouchon while we were on our Vegas trip. He knew about the chef, Thomas Keller and his other restaurant in Napa (French Laundry) and wanted to try this place out. \n\nEverything from the service to our entrees were impeccable! Our waiter (which his name escapes me) was incredible. Very charming, greeted us respectively and warmly. He let us know some info about the restaurant and the specials of the day that we ended up deciding to have. \n\nWe trusted the waiter\'s palate for the food, so for starters, we tried this pork belly dish that was HEAVEN in your mouth. We also decided to try the oysters that they get shipped daily. If I can remember, he said they have 4 types of oysters and we tried the best two. You can taste the ocean in each bite!  Entree that i picked out was veal chop sous vied with grilled cremini mushroom while the boyfriend got the grilled sturgeon with trio of beets and ramps. We were both floored when we tried the veal... one of my favorite dishes of all time! The sturgeon was perfectly grilled, great texture and better without the sauce IMHO. As for the sides, I liked my boyfriend\'s beet trio and ramps over the mushroom and "something else". \n\nDesert was hard to avoid... they had a selection of deserts varying from cheesecake, creme brulee (my favorite), to ice creams and sorbet (which we chose). We had the mango and passion fruit sorbet which needless to say, was a perfect ending to a great meal. \n\nNow to try French Laundry...'

S'I come here for brunch almost every time I come to Vegas. I always end up splitting the following two dishes:\n\nThe CHICKEN and WAFFLES!!! Its a chicken is cooked rotisserie style and is juicy, moist and flavorful. The sauce with the mushrooms and bacon is heavenly. The waffles are made with a savory chive batter. An upscale version of chicken and waffles that is worth trying. A very memorable and tasty dish.\n\nCROQUE MADAME is also very good! Excellent frites!\n\nCame here for my birthday with a bunch of my girls and they gave us a HUGE basket of pastries on the house! Then after we ate they gave us complimentary cream puff desert with candle!! Love this place!'

S"I have been to Bouchon in Yountville and knew the food would be delicious.  Again, was blown away by the delicious food (Steak Frites and large raw seafood platter).  But what really made this trip to Bouchon memorable was how well we were treated with two tired toddlers in tow.  We arrived on a Saturday night at 10 PM without reservations (we just arrived in town, starving, otherwise the kids would have been in bed) looking for a good meal.  Our hostess greeted us warmly and even gave our oldest a Ratatouille coloring book and crayons.  That is how I knew they were truly welcoming to children - great for a French restaurant to take that little step to welcome children!  Tables were spaced well so that when the inevitable meltdown occurred it wasn't disruptive to the other diners (or so their smiles and kind words said).  I left Bouchon even more impressed than before, with plans to visit again soon.  It is always a challenge to find an upscale restaurant with delicious food that will welcome young children.  Already a favorite due to the excellent cuisine, Bouchon may be my new favorite restaurant after how well we were treated.  I will definitely be back.  (And those fries on the Steak Frites dinner - probably the best I have ever had.  Like County Fair fries perfected.)  Mmmm.  (And on a similar note - try Bouchon Bakery for some amazing cookies - the ones fashioned after Oreo's and Nutter Butter are delicious, as are the macarons.)"

S"When I found out that Thomas Keller had a restaurant in Vegas we were excited to try this place out. We heard great things about French Laundry but still have not had a chance to visit so this was out next best option. Unfortunately, our meal was only mediocre when compared to others in its class. \n\nWhen we dine at fine, upper echelon restaurants we try and compare it to others in the same class. We have been to many fine restaurants including Alinea, Brooklyn Fare, Per se, and Le Bernadin just to name a few. So I believe we know what good food is and what great food is. The meal we had here was good and I would definitely eat it again but I don't think that it really stands out in a city that boasts restaurants by Robuchon, Guy Savoy, Nobu, and Gordon Ramsay. \n\nThe restaurant is a little difficult to find and you have to take a special elevator to get there. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to find the place and don't hesitate to ask for directions if you get lost. As you walk into the restaurant you pass the oyster bar where you see chefs preparing seafood platters that look amazing, but we did not partake. We were seated and given menus that looked like they were printed on butcher paper. I really wasn't impressed with this and know they were going for a more casual feel, but I was more expecting more traditional menus given the Thomas Keller name. \n\nThey didn't have a tasting menu, something we were really wishing they had so we ordered a la carte. The food we had was average for a fine dining establishment and the service was on par and good. I'm hoping that we went on an off day and would come back again but given the many different restaurants in the Vegas area, it may be sometime before we return."

If you're looking to dine here purely for the food, you can find better values elsewhere in Vegas. On the plus side, it's a nice space and it was fairly easy to get a reservation even during peak hours. Lastly, our server was really nice and packed us a bunch of extra rolls when we took home the leftovers, which was great for the next day."

S'It was worth the hype. Came here for dinner last week and the service was great and food delicious.  We ordered the mussels, pork loin special, chicken dish, and the halibut.  Of these theses, the mussels were the best in my opnion with the saffron white wine sauce.  We also ordered the beet salad, wilted spinach salad and a salmon pate-type dish.  The spinach salad was their special that night and it was very good.. mainly due to their sauce. It came with quail egg, some type of citrus zest, nuts... For dessert we had the signature Bouchon cake with the 3 flavors of ice cream/sorbet. \n\nAll in all, the food was clean and had a lot of complex flavors for being so simple.  We had the frites that came with the mussels and they were good although not sure if it was the "best" as anthony bourdain once described it as... \n\ncan\'t wait to go back for their brunch..'

S'We stayed at the Venetian so Bouchon was just an elevator ride and a short walk away. It was brunch hour and we were able to use a 15% off coupon for their Journee menu. My wife got the Les Oeufs which she got with scrambled oeufs, bacon, brioche toast, and awesome potato croquettes. I got the sourdough waffle with strawberries, pecans, maple syrup, and I ordered a side of bacon (which ended up being like 6 strips.) For dessert we had beignets, which were amazingly prepared... Crisp yet fluffy and served with hazelnut spread and jam.\n\nAll the food was delicious, although a bit on the pricey side for breakfast. We would definitely eat here again.'

No steak tartare. As Queen Victoria once said "No pudding and no fun"\n\nI can\'t complain too much as we walked in prime time Saturday evening with no reservations, got a space at the bar and enjoyed oysters and a corpse reviver.\n\nWe went back for a final breakfast Tuesday a.m. before getting out of Dodge - breakfast was good, and the boudin blanc was decent enough ( but boudin noir it ain\'t !)- but it took almost an hour to get the food.\n\nI think in the last 10 or 12 years the rest of Vegas has caught up with what was once a stand-out.'

I never loved pistachios so much in my life - they tasted amazing warmed up! It was so addictive I couldn't help but go back for more. From now on, I'm toasting all my pistachios!\n\nFor the main, I got the steak frites but substituted the frites for fried gnocchi. Steak was super tender and delicious but I wasn't a fan of the fried gnocchi.. It tasted like soft fried dough. \n\nI got the pear tart for dessert which I didn't enjoy that much either - the tart wasn't very flaky and the dessert tasted a bit dry. The sorbet tasted amazing though!\n\nOverall it's a great place but I would definitely come here for a special occasion."

S'I have not felt worse about a dining experience.  Let\'s start with the easy stuff; the food:  everyone at the table (all 10 of us) were pretty careful about not upsetting the great vibe we had that night at the table. \n\n However, the next day, only one person said they liked their dish.  I cannot remember what everyone had, but here is what I can--- onion soup was unbearably salty, the poulet roti was dry and over-cooked, the steak bouchon was tough and wayyyyy too fatty (exactly----how does a fatty steak become tough) and the mussles were tiny.  That said, the trout was pretty good.  \n\nSo here is the main reason I think I need to leave only one star.  Way over-rated, and the waiter was absolutely awful.  He took our cocktails away when we were not done, tried to pull some very shady shit with our bill.  Then this DB proceeded to make sure to collect each person\'s receipt before we left the table----and checking to see if we added an additional tip. Hence, the "Eek!  Methinks not."\n\nStay downstairs or visit the one in Yountville.'

S"I've been super lazy in writing reviews but it's time to finally catch up. \n\nWe came here for brunch around 11-12? and it was pretty packed. I think we waited for a good 30 minutes or so but in the end the wait was totally worth the wait. I was totally drooling when we were waiting to get seated because I was looking at the menu that just makes me wanna get everything. In the end I didn't get anything from the menu and got their special. \n\nI thought the decorations looked great and there was an outside view where you can see the pool and stuff. I really like the environment of the restaurant. I thought the weird part was the music that went along with the place...It just didn't fit well. \n\nThe service was pretty good. I think the guy was on top of his guy in terms of explaining all the specials and he always seem to have a smile on his face. He refills our water every so often so in terms of service I thought he passed.\n\nI only tried 3 things in the restaurant and that would be the Croque madame, Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard & saffron served with French fries, and my pork belly BLT. Yes I said it...P-O-R-K B-E-L-L-Y B-L-T....I don't know about you but my eyes sure lit up when I heard that was the special for the day. \n\nCroque Madame: What is there not to like about a fried egg on top of a toasted ham and cheese on brioche. It's sounds so simple but it's just simply delicious. The combination of such simple ingredients can bring out such a wonderful taste. If anything I think the fries that came along with the dish was the EH part. I don't know...I just keep finding the fries to be a bit salty to me.\n\nPork Belly BLT - Personally I loved my dish because it's so unique. When have you ever heard of a pork belly BLT. It just sounds so epic and delicious. I think the worst part of the dish is figuring out how to eat it. Since there poach egg on top of the whole dish, I couldn't even hand-held it and eat it. So I decided to cut it but at some point I would cut the poach egg which will let out the yolk out(not that i mind but it can get messy :p.) The combination of lettuce,tomato, poach egg and sliced up pork belly made it pretty darn amazing. I thought the pork belly was made well because there are restaurants that make the pork belly really dry and it makes the pork belly disgusting but I find it to be the right texture here so it went along well. :)\n\nMaine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard & saffron served with French fries - This is what my friend got and I personally loved this dish. I think this was my favorite dish that if I ever come next time I think I'm gonna get this dish myself(not that Pork Belly BLT isn't good). You get so many mussels for only 25.50?! I mean come on that's already a big steal...I couldn't even count how many mussels were in that bowl of wonderfulness! The white wine sauce was simply amazing and when you can some of that sauce in that mussel and you can suck it out...Just AMAZING!!! I seriously recommend getting this dish because the mussels that they have is really fresh. The french fries that went along with it...I saw my friend dipped it in the white wine sauce and she kept doing it and i was like HMM let me try. Later on...I found myself super thirsty because I couldn't stop eating the french fries dipped in white wine sauce. I REALLY LOVE THIS DISH.\n\nI would say it's something worth getting for brunch if you happen to be in vegas! :)"

S"Ever since I read about Thomas Keller in Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential, I've wanted to try his food.  Bouchon provided an accessible way to do so.  My husband and I had dinner here two nights ago for our anniversary.\n\nThe space is large but warm and beautiful.  I think the tiled floor is gorgeous.  The restaurant is on the tenth floor of one of the Venetian's towers, removed from the casino, so dining here is not noisy or crazy hectic.\n\nService was fine; we had a 9:30 reservation and were seated promptly by a serious-faced but efficient hostess.  Our waiter was cut from the same cloth.  He recited the specials carefully but without a smile, which detracted somewhat from our sense of festivity.  Anyhow, whatever, on to the food.\n\nWe had the beet salad with apple and horseradish cream, gnocchi a la parisienne (capsules of buttery potatoes and a few vegetables), the spareribs special served with some delicious greens and a cranberry pain perdu (a bit odd) with cipollini onions, and the chocolate bouchon dessert with three ice creams: mint chocolate, vanilla, and hazelnut.  The couple at the table next to ours had the scallop bouillabaisse special and the poulet roti (which the woman raved about).  Other tables ordered huge icy towers of fresh seafood.  The food was beautiful and delicious.  Not transcendent.  Just delicious.\n\nN.B. Be careful ordering the specials.  They sound good but the prices are not listed in the menu or on the boards.  My husband's dish was 25 dollars.  My special was 44.  Holy merde!"

S'Blah! Small portion sizes, tasteless food, limited menu options & a hefty price tag to sour your mood after a terrible meal. Skip this place & go somewhere- ANYwhere- else for dinner. I asked for pasta & the server initially said they didn\'t have any. Then I saw it on the menu as a side dish to a rabbit dish & asked if I could have just the pasta (I don\'t eat Bugs bunny) & after talking to the maitre\'d, they finally agreed. BUT they charged me for the rabbit dish! So essentially I paid like $40 for 6 strands of plain fettuccine pasta, minus ANY sauce. And instead of steamed veggies on the side, they gave me steamed FRUIT. Yes, really. Steamed apples, pumpkin...it was disgusting. I specifically asked for steamed veggies like asparagus, broccoli, spinach etc bc I\'m pregnant & need my daily greens. The server said ok, and brought out soggy fruit without any explanation or apology. I was pretty surprised by the bad quality of food & inattentive service, from the soup to the main course to the dessert. My friend got the merengue for dessert and she said it was too soft & overwhelmingly sweet. My husband got the gnocchi and it was actually really tasty. But it was $26.50 so buyer beware you\'re going to pay like $4 per bite. The French onion soup was basically a finger bowl of salty melted cheese, so I had to send it back. We were out for a good time so I didn\'t really mind that the food sucked so bad, and work picked up the tab so I didn\'t really care how much things cost, but it did irk me that after a $1,500 meal for 11 people, we still had to catch a midnight snack just to feel satiated. I get it that French food isn\'t really made for vegetarians but just bc I dont eat meat doesn\'t mean I don\'t have a refined pallet for taste. And even the meat eaters at the table agreed that the food was blah. BTW I initially asked for Mac n Cheese (the only vegetarian dish on the menu) and was told they could not make it with easy cheese bc it\'s all pre-made & heated. When I asked for a variation on some other dish (can\'t remember which one...sorry I\'ve got pregnancy brain), I was given the same unappetizing response: sorry our food is pre-made, all we do is heat it up when you order it. Jeez, for $40 an entree I\'d like more than a microwaved meal please. Other meat-eating patrons were very turned off by this information. Should Bouchon really call itself " fine dining" when all they do is re-heat food that\'s been prepared in the morning? Hmm.'

S"I went here with a rather large (12) group of friends. I live near Thomas Keller's other restaurant (French Laundry) and was curious to see how Bouchon in Las Vegas stacked up. \nFirst of all, the service overall was fantastic. Our waiter was very attentive and engaged with our party. We ordered drinks, which included an absinthe drip for 4. The absinthe drip was a huge hit, and it was easy to convince a few other friends to try a glass of the wonderful stuff. Definitely recommend! \nNow, the food. \nI opted for Cobia as the main course, which was one of the specials of the day. I am not sure if its a regular menu item or not, but I loved it. I have never had Cobia before, but I would certainly order it again. The best way for me to describe Cobia, is a more moist, fattier swordfish. \nFor anyone planning to eat at Bouchon, I would highly recommend they try the Pork Shoulder was well. Lucky for me, my friend sitting to the right of me, order this. After a few bites of his meal, I nearly had food envy! \nLastly, I finished with a sorbet mix, complete with warm waffle triangles. \n\nAlas, even though the cards never seemed to go my way this last trip to Las Vegas, at least my taste buds were able to come out ahead!"

S'I came here with very high hopes only to be disappointed..\n\nThe service was not great. We ordered a ginger ale at the beginning and and did not get it until my entree came cause i had to ask again.. I mean considering there was a server and a trainee youu would think SOMEONE would have caught it.\n\nThey served bread just on the table.. with no plates... it was soo weird.. and messy.. and randomly we got warm pistachios.. odd\n\nWe had the onion soup... it was BITTER grosssssss\n\nWe ordered the special pork belly.. it was SO oily and disgusting.. it actually made me sick afterwards... We also split the chicken and it was SO salty..\n\nI was not impressed.. i still will go try the one in BH hopefully that one is better'

S'I cannot believe Thomas Keller has his name on this restaurant. I visited this restaurant with a co-worker on the evening of 1/10/14. I chose this place because it was a Thomas Keller restaurant and am a bit of a foodie. My co-worker agreed to go with me even though she is not a big foodie and would have been fine with us having dinner at our hotel. What a disappointment, I wish we would have stayed at our own hotel for dinner. \n\nFirst we were sat in the middle of 2 huge tables (one table was a large family of 12+ members and the other table was a group of 7 guys which I could touch them from my chair and hear their entire conversation). The waiter had to keep walking behind us to get to the table of 7 which was ridiculous! Our server was one of the food runners because we could never find our server to ask for bread, water or our check.\n\nI ordered a glass of chardonnay and it was disgusting. I cannot tell you anything about my wine because my waiter never told me the name, region or anything on my glass. This of course was brought by a runner. \n\nFor an appetizer I order a beef carpaccio which was that nights special. BLAND. Of course the toasted baguette that accompanied this appetizer was good. \n\nThe bread that brought to the table before our dinner arrived was delicious. Thank goodness this was good otherwise we probably would have left starving. \n\nThe dinner specials were nothing fantastic so I ordered the chicken...my thought was this was supposed to reflect Thomas Keller\'s favorite dishes in France and when I think of France I think pastries, bread & chicken. Well I have made better chicken in my own kitchen than what I was served. Thomas Keller needs to go here and take the salt out of this kitchen because whoever is cooking there is using WAY TOO MUCH SALT! The chicken was atop some greens which you couldn\'t really taste because of the overwhelming amount of saltiness in the dish. \n\nOf course I would have loved to order dessert but was never even asked if we wanted any.... maybe they don\'t serve dessert. Who knows.....\n\nThe manager (at least I think she was a manager) brought our check to me and I decided to share with her my experience in this "Michelin" starred restaurant. To say she was aloof would be an understatement. Maybe I am dense but to me a Michelin starred restaurant should be about the experience and you certainly should not have to ask for water or bread at one of these establishments. Of course the wonderful manager did comp our wine off our bill, but not a word about any of the other points I brought to her attention. I felt since we were only a table of 2 what I thought did not matter to her or obviously the waiter who spent his entire time at the large family table. \n\nSince returning to Texas after this short work trip to Las Vegas I have figured out two things have really bothered me about my experience. \n\n1. I have contacted the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group requesting to speak to someone about my experience and as of today 1/23/14 nobody has bothered to contact me by phone or email.\n\n2. And I think this is the most disappointing.... one of my "Bucket List" items was for myself and my husband to visit "The French Laundry" and have the full experience of this culinary master\'s food. But now I wonder would I be as equally disappointed in that establishment too? If I know a dinner will be $1,000.00+ I expect the food to be impeccable, but if you are willing to tie your name to the restaurant I just spent $75.00+ for my single meal (not including my co-workers meal) and tried to share what a horrible experience I had and felt like that did not matter I think I will have to rethink where this bucket list dinner should be at.'

S"There's something about brunch that I love, it's breakfast combined with lunch, okay and besides the fact that I get to sleep in and still be able to have breakfast items at a restaurant. \n\nBouchon in Vegas is like staring at the statue of liberty at NYNY hotel. It's just not quite the same as the real thing. Not to sound disappointed here but the food we ordered was mediocre, I expected more.\n\nWe ordered the croque madame and corn beef hash. The corn beef hash definitely stole the show. Croque Madame, a ham sandwich topped with a sunny side egg with a huge side of fries. Corn beef hash... well, is corn beef hash. It was chopped up potato and corn beef, great for sharing. Must try the fries, absolutely addicting, oh and the coffee. \n\nSo my advice is to visit the Bouchon bakery at The Venetian instead. Grab a croissant, coffee and some macaroons."

S"I'll admit to my Thomas Keller fixation: I've consumed at French Laundry, Bouchon (Nor Cal) and I've now moved onto his cookbooks. \n\nSo of course, when the opportunity for Bouchon Las Vegas presents itself...\n\nThe most remarkable difference between Bouchon (Nor Cal) and Bouchon (Las Vegas) is the staff. No, not the staff that takes your orders, brings your food and caters to your dining whims: the folks at both locations are friendly, efficient and supremely competent. \n\nIt's the set of folks at door. Unlike the pleasantries you might be greeted with at Bouchon (Nor Cal), the Bouchon (Las Vegas) entourage might greet you with confusion or disdain. \n\nDuring my first visit to Bouchon (LV), I chalked this up as an aberration. But now I suspect that Bouchon (LV) might be hiring from a pool of TAO rejects..or graduates. Which is worse? \n\nIf you can put that first minute of the Bouchon LV experience aside, you will be rewarded. \n\nThe muscles and fries are always phenomenal. The wine list is always extensive and superb. Again, 5 stars for service. \n\nBouchon (LV) is an oasis of authenticity in a sea of Vegas sheen, once you get past the door."

S"As I walked in I felt like this place we very fancy but the people were not pretentious at all. Their service was excellent and their food was yummy.\n\nThis place is great for groups since they have quite a few round tables like Asian restaurants or smaller more intimate areas for couples etc. \n\nI came in for breakfast and so that is all I can review them on. The hostess recommended the Croque Madame... and I was not disappointed. It is a fancier version of a eggs benedict. I usually do not order benny's but the differences were enough for me to order and enjoy it. A bit oily but since you are in LV... do it!! \n\nA trout for breakfast? That was all I could think as my friend ordered this item. As common LA folk (hahaha) we didn't know hwat all the facny words meant but basically it was a trout with green beans and almond pieces. While it doesn't sound amazing (and it has its head, not a fillet if you are squemish) it was very good. \n\nFlorentine quiche with a side salad was amazing! I never like quiches but this savory custard melted in my mouth. Oh my goodness. Get it if you do not like fried items like the croque madame. \n\nOver all our bill was 98 for four girls and 5 glasses of various juices. \n\nThey also serve a special bread with butter and a special preserve. You must try the preserves even if all you want is rich butter! It is quite tasty and different... like a secret mix of spices and fruit. Not quite strawberry and not quite orange marmalade. Sadly, the bread was no hot... and I was disappointed more so when some of it was ice cold. \n\nBut being hungry/hung over/tired this is a eloquent place to eat."

They make it quite clear Mark Hopper is the chef. \n\nThe drink menu was superb and I greatly enjoyed trying a few concoctions. I also loved their cheese plate. But this is where my love affair ends. I ordered the beef tenderloin for dinner and it was awful. I literally ate 3 bites. The fries on the side were my savior. Most places, especially if they are nice, would notice that I had only eaten 3 bites and ask what was wrong. But our waiter did not. He simply removed the dish, which was pretty much untouched. For a $35 entree, I would at least like an inquiry. \n\nI don't think I would eat here again, but maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."

S"This is my third review of the place and I am starting to get a little depressed. The review keeps sliding lower and lower, which saddens me in that Thomas Keller is such a culinary hero. I ascribe the issues to management at this unit.\n\nAnyhow: we went for breakfast and the place was quite busy. Service was pleasant enough. We all ordered champagne cocktails of various kinds and found them to be quite small. We then ordered pastries and food. The pastries came promptly and while the croissants were gold standard, the nut rolls were just ok. Then there was the L O N G wait for the breakfasts... about 45 minutes of waiting after the pastries. Sadly, when breakfast arrived, it was quite ordinary. My wife's omelet was completely boring, and that is the benchmark for a great french breakfast. No one in our party thought any of their breakfast dishes were better than average.\n\nIt is still a gorgeous space, but I truly wish that management would work harder on pulling it together."

S'French food is as indulgent as it gets, and this was a clear choice for three of my closest girl friends and I for an indulgent, celebratory dinner on our last night in LV. We rattled off orders of sparkling wine, a tender duck appetizer cooked sous-vide, the roasted lamb, the sauteed salmon, the roasted chicken, and sides of truffled mac and cheese, all of which were prepared impeccably.\n\nOur entire meal was eaten in near-silence. All you could hear were really heavy sighing noises while we imagined what it would be like being married to Thomas Keller (or "my dearest Tom-Tom").\n\nAfter our dinner, one of my friends asked me if  I wanted to share a dessert with her. I laughed at this ridiculous question. And then enjoyed a creamy, delectable creme brulee all to myself.'

S"Yet another must stop for my boyfriend and I due solely to the fact that he's a huge Thomas Keller fan.  We came for dinner and I started with one of their speciality drinks called The Bouchon.  It was tasty and well priced at $10.  We then ordered: \n\n- a mix of 3 cheeses.  All I can say is order the hook's cheddar!  It's amazing and after we had it we went to a cheese shop and bought 1/2 a pound to eat at home.   \n\n- I had the roasted leg of lamb on a nicoise olive chickpea socca with peppers, arugula, and jus.  I ordered it medium and thought it came out a little overdone even though it was still slightly pink.  I loved my dish and would order it again if given the chance.\n\n- My boyfriend had the roast chicken on a puff pastry round with ratatouille, garlic chips and jus.  He liked his dish at first, but there was a layer of pureed tomato that killed it for him.  It overpowered the whole thing making it almost inedible as time went on.     \n\nOverall I would say service gets 5 stars, ambiance 4, and the food 4.  I would happily go back, but there are so many other better restaurants in Vegas that I probably never will.  Thanks anyway Bouchon....."

Granted it was the late afternoon so I wasn't sticking out like a sore thumb in a crowd of nicely dressed diners, but that still gets this place bonus points.\n\nHint: If you're on a budget, come here anyway and drop 8 bucks or whatever on the french fries.

S"I was disappointed. I am a fan of Thomas Keller but found this Vegas outlet to come up short. Service was great, atmosphere was lively, and the place was designed well like a classic bistro. \n\nThe food is where things came out short. Nothing was terrible mind you but hardly the standard you're expecting at such a name brand restaurant. The best was the salmon roulette which was interesting and unique. The French onion soup was tasty and the broth much thicker/more flavorful than I've had anywhere else.\n\nThe oysters were pretty run of the mill. The frisee salad with egg was good but nothing special. The table bread was fantastic though.\n\nThe real disappointment was the main entree - Steak Bouchon for $62. The meat was properly cooked but the quality (and quantity) of the meat just wasn't on par with any real steakhouse. Maybe it's unfair to compare but for $62 at any great steakhouse, you'd get a lot more food and much better taste. The frites were generous in portion though.\n\nI'd give the restaurant group a shot again but didn't leave impressed for my first experience in the Vegas location."

S'I hate giving less-than-stellar reviews, but if I go by the Yelp star code, well, I\'ve definitely had better than Bouchon.\n\nI\'ve been here in my pre-yelp days and never had a bad word to say about the place. Sadly, my last experience wasn\'t up to par.\n\nThe atmosphere here is lovely and our server was nothing but pleasant. I started with a cup of the French onion soup and my friend had a salad - no complaints on either.\n\nI was actually looking for a rib eye, but since there wasn\'t one on the menu, I went with Steak Frites. A pan-seared 9 oz. flat iron, caramelized shallots & ma\xc3\xaetre d\'h\xc3\xb4tel butter served with French fries. When it arrived, it looked and smelled wonderful, but upon first bite I could immediately tell something was wrong.\n\nThere was a very strong and very unpleasant metallic after taste to that first bite. My friend gave me a bite of his NY strip and it tasted the way steak was supposed to. Then I thought maybe the butter or shallots had burned and that\'s why my bite was off. So I scraped everything off the piece of meat and went in for another bite. Same story. Odd, off-putting taste all over again. I hate to use the word "rancid", but well, that\'s what it tasted like.\n\nThe waiter came to check on us and I ended up sending the steak back. As my waistline will attest, I have never sent anything back in my entire life. The waiter was very nice, though I think he may be new as he was a bit flustered and nervous. I was glancing at the menu to see if there was anything else I wanted to try and though he was trying to be helpful the waiter offering to wait for me while I selected another entree felt a little pressured. I hurriedly ordered the salmon and while it came out fast and was tasty, it wasn\'t really what I wanted.\n\nI was surprised and disappointed by the experience here. I know this place can be great, but with such a huge variety of fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas, I think I\'ll have to move on from Bouchon.'

I probably can't add anything new to this slate of almost 700 reviews on here, but if I came back again, I wouldn't do it any differently: start with a couple cocktails, oysters and steamed mussels, move on to french onion soup and a bottle of burgundy, and then finish with the poulet roti, perfectly roasted and juicy chicken served over some kind of potato and apple (?!) slaw sitting in jus.  It was all amazing.  Also, the spaghetti squash with honey glazed cranberries, while not exactly the highlight of the meal, tasted exactly like christmas.  You'll know what I mean, even if you're Jewish.\n\nWe got out of there for around $120 a person, and I have to say I feel like as far as fine dining goes in Vegas, we did alright.  If there was a Bouchon in Chicago, I'd be back in a heartbeat."

S"Thomas Keller should shut this place down if he wants to save his reputation. This restaurant is mismanaged and the food seems like it's right out of the microwave. I visited Bouchon back in 2009 but didn't remember the name when my friend made the reservation. I didn't like it in 2009 and things have gotten worse.\n\nIf Yelp had negative stars, this is the place to award it.\n\nWe had a party of 13 last week. The waiter raved about the fresh oysters and how they were flown in daily. We ordered 3 each for apps and 2 out of the 3 oysters were horrible. We were nice and didn't send any back. However we provided some candid feedback. \n\nThe main courses were all $35+ except for a ham and cheese sandwich. I'd the veal which was so-so. My friends had other specials like salmon, steak and fries, etc. Again, nothing special. They all tasted like food from a chain like Chili's. \n\nAt the end of the meal, the waiter grabbed the plates and spilled food residue on my head and didn't even notice he had done so. I'd to call him back to tell him. The waiter didn't offer any napkins or anything to help me clean up. He said sorry and left. When I demanded a manager, the manager again only apologized on behalf of the waiter. The manager kept asking me what I wanted. Common now... What I wanted then couldn't be fixed because my hair is dirty, my shirt is stained, and my whole dining experience was ruined. I could have told him I wanted a shower, new clothes and a ride back to my hotel... but it wouldn't be reasonable. \n\nIf this place was run by a professionals and wanted to be a high end restaurant, the manager would have immediately offered compensation instead of asking me what I want. The manager would have offered a discount or a cab back to my room to clean up, etc. After scolding at the manager, another person came back and waived my $35 plate. Essentially saying we'll feed you if you let us spill dirty food all over you after you've finished your meal. \n\nSo if you want a real dining experience instead of getting abused and dealing with amateurs, go across the street to the Bellagio's Picasso or any other restaurant."

The food... leg of lamb, scallops, deserts all amazing...only complaint here is the amount of mussels unopened with the half order as an appetizer. Wine...Sommelier Paul was a true professional and recommended one change in our selection...he was spot on...delicious!!!\n\nThe menu wrapped around the napkin is cute but impossible to read when it's a little dark. If we ask for a light or you see 2 people at a table trying to read the menu with a candle please bring the larger white menu immediately not 5-10 minutes later.\n\nWe were comped our wines at the bar but a little disappointed with the greeter/host.

S"Judging from the hundreds of glowing reviews here, you don't need me to tell you that this place is awesome, but I will anyway. \n\nI was recently in Vegas to celebrate my birthday, and decided this would be the best way to start my actual day of birth. So we showed up (kind of on the late side for brunch) and put our name on the list. Though the host said it would take us 50 minutes to be seated, we were seated in more like 10-15. (Yes, he said 50. Not 15. I checked.) Nice surprise!\n\nAfter inspecting the menu, we had to go with some of the more famous brunch dishes on the menu. My boyfriend chose the chicken and waffles, and I went with the mussels and frites. We also couldn't resist the salmon tartare appetizer that was on special that day.\n\nFirst off was the salmon and a couple of mimosas. Both were extremely tasty. The salmon was super fresh, and served with bits of egg, red onion, capers, along with a bit of toasted bread. My only complaints was that we didn't get quite enough toast to eat everything and the small pieces of eggs and such were kind of difficult to get on the bread. The taste was fantastic, though.\n\nThen came the main courses, and they were as good as everyone says. The mussels were a nice variation on the usual preparation, as the mustard in the sauce gave it the kick that it needed. The fries were nicely crisp and perfectly seasoned, definitely in the top five of best fries I've ever had. And the chicken and waffles? I got to try a bit, and it was amazing. The waffle was nice and fluffy, with bits of bacon and chives in there. And they serve it with roasted chicken that was perfectly cooked. Perhaps most surprising were the portion sizes, which were enormous. I wasn't particularly hungry for the rest of the day.\n\nThe service was top notch and the atmosphere was nice and laid back. A+++. Would brunch again."

Boyfriend had the croque madame and he wasn't a fan (it was good, but not something to keep coming back for).\n\nThe service was a bit slow the morning we went and our waiter was a bit clumsy (spilling juices, dropping menus). Overall, the experience wasn't worth $90 for our food that did not blow us away.\n\nOur minds might change once we get the opportunity to try from the brunch menu. As of right now, I stand by my 3 star rating."

It has a very clean, french bistro interior, but without any snobbery. The wait staff and friendly and helpful. They're attentive without being overbearing. \n\nI had brunch twice over two days at Bouchon. Both exceeded my expectations. The croquette madam was insanely good. Buttery, cheesy goodness with an egg on top. The bread pudding style french toast- wow. wow. wow. Day two- Steak and eggs, a generous sized prime sirloin with perfectly cooked eggs and garlic potatoes. And my boyfriend had the sourdough french toast with vanilla butter. \n\nWe also shared a starter each day. Day 1 we had the pork belly. It was lusciously fatty porky yum yum surrounded by white beans and confit apples - absolutely delicious. On day two we had raspberry filled donuts which were airy and dense in all the right places. \n\nBoth days our bill came to around $60 before tax/tip (we did not have any alcohol).

I wanted to take her somewhere fancy, and she is a Keller wanna-be-groupie (ain\'t easy getting into Fr. Laundry). Being poor, we went with the breakfast. It was resonably priced, quite good, and pleasantly informal.\n\nNothing leaps off the menu as "holy crap that sounds great!" It\'s just simple things done really well. Perusing the menu allowed several fills of the bottomless superb coffee. I ordered quiche, which was spectacular. The filling was essentially custard, that gave way to an extra-tasty egg/spinach layer, and a structured but yielding crust. The crust edge was just on crispy edge towards burnt. I\'ve always thought of quiche as dough with egg and veggie scraps thrown in, but this was a masterpiece of the form.\n\nWhen you take the mudane and make a subtle masterpiece, that\'s impressive. Kudos. Only four stars because my GF got the oeufs au gratin, and it was in the pedestrian realm. Alas.\n\nThe bistro itself is elegant but unpretentious, and the patio to the bizarre 10th floor pool lobby is a fine environment. Strangely, the prices were included on both menus.

The fresh bread and maple preserves they bring to the table are quite tasty.  I had the Chicken and Waffles. Best I ever had. My husband had the Croque Madame which was also really good. I think the apple juice I had was made in-house. Delicious!\n\nI highly recommend this place! It's a bit pricey but worth it. They really need to come to DC."

S"How it pains me to write this review just to drop a star off my last review. \n\nI love Bouchon. I really do. I frequent the Bouchon in Beverly Hills, but we came here on my last Vegas trip. We were seated on the outside patio and service was completely LACKING. A good amount of time passed before our server even popped up. We placed our orders and she dropped off some jam and butter shortly after. What was missing was the bread. I'm also not sure why we didn't have bread plates because I've always had them on my table on prior visits. Our bread came way later and just a bit before our entrees. My chicken and waffles were great as usual (they've changed it a bit since my last time ordering them. They add bacon and chives to the waffles now). But back to my main point, water glasses would sit empty for a good amount of time before being refilled. It was hard to catch someone's eye to get their attention. We sat around waiting to grab someone's attention just to get a box. I'm not sure if service would have been different inside, but it was extremely lacking at this location compared to my previous visit about a year and a half ago (or to their other locations for that matter).\n\nI'll have to give them another chance since I seriously adore their food if I'm in Vegas again, but for now, I'm sticking with the Bouchon in BH for my weekend brunches.\n\nNote: They do not take reservations for brunch at this location either."

S"wow, this place is fancy. i came for brunch and we were seated near the fountain. this was my first time at a thomas keller restaurant so i was pretty stoked. i ordered the chicken and waffles and they were... different. instead of fried chicken, it was a single grilled chicken leg. the waffles were ho-hum and the syrup had a strange odor. we spent a few minutes trying to figure out what was in the syrup. turns out it was a chunk of bacon, haha.. maybe it's just me but i think fried chicken goes better with waffles."

S'Bouchon has great food and excellent friendly service.  My girlfriends and I felt like queens here.  We ordered the Grand Plateau which has a lobster, crab, oysters, clams, mussels, and shrimp on a two tier iced rack.  Unfortunetly, the time we went they ran out of crab and were couteous enough to substitute with not one lobster but two lobsters!!!  I also recommend the corn cream soup.  It was sweet debaucery.'

S"One of the most amazing brunch meals I have experienced to date was enjoyed at Bouchon Bistro in Las Vegas. The Croque Madame leaves me without the proper words to describe how beyond perfect the sandwich is. The brioche bread grilled with exactly the right blend of butter and cheese, making it slightly crunchy and not too crisp. The ham and cheese are melted together impeccably. The sandwich is topped with a fried egg, which I requested over hard, and finally, the rich mornay sauce brings the dish together. One of the largest servings of French fries I have seen accompany the meal, crispy and flavorful.\n\nWe visited Bouchon a few days prior and I enjoyed the Quiche Lorraine. This dish was also exquisite, beautifully creamy and rich. The side of bacon arrives in its own dish, and deservingly so, as it is a huge serving!\n\nService at Bouchon is pleasant and attentive. The ambiance of the restaurant is comfortable, and not excessively casual. I enjoyed our visits to the restaurant and am happy we do not have one local, otherwise, I'd be in trouble!"

S"Don't get me wrong...when in Vegas, loosen up that belt and hit the buffet scene. However, quality not quantity should also be on the agenda. My friends and I decided to try Thomas Keller's Bouchon bistro restaurant at the Venetian. Unfortunately, we were not able to have what the state of California regards as an illegal substance, Foie Gras. Only a large serving was available at our late dining hour...unsure if the rest of our party wanted it, so we passed on it. My family and I had the Fennel soup, Escargots in a puff pastry, Mussels, Steak en Frites and what every foodie can't do without...Macaroni and cheese...well my 6 year old had to eat something. Nonetheless, this M&C definitely did not taste like something out of a blue and yellow box...the different cheeses used made for a very tasty mac n cheese that any adult wouldn't mind having. The fennel soup was very good and the escargots were very tasty. Mussels have never really been a favorite of mine but my wife said they were excellent...I did try one or two and the broth it came in and I must say it pretty good. The steak I had was great..tender, lots of flavor and yes, it was actually cooked medium as I liked, but many places do not seem to get right. A very good dinner indeed...next time Foie Gras no matter what."

S"When you can't see much inside a restaurant because of its very dim lighting, then you know you're in for some upscale dining among fine individuals with night vision (read: Predator).\nTucked away in what seemed to be another time zone in the behemoth of a casino, Bouchon indulged me with French fare in an intimate, classy setting.\nMy party of 3 were seated promptly and we started off with escargot (perfectly buttery and chewy).  \nThe house bread and PISTACHIOS are bomb diggity.  I love anything bread and butter so I was in heaven. The pistachios were a bonus ;) C'mon, where else can you get pistachios?!  Indeed, I am a sucker for novelty. \nI ordered an iced tea and our server brought it out in a carafe, which I thought was and refreshingly...refreshing.  My only gripe with it was that the carafe was not large enough, as I am a bottomless pit for tea.\n\nI have had their lamb so I tried their steak frites, prepared medium rare.  I forget the cut of the steak but I will say that it was one of the best cooked steaks I've ever had!  The center was pink and juicy (no innuendos here!) and every bite of it left me wanting more!  I didn't care too much for the fries; I wish I had substituted it for  something else. What a waste of fries...\n\nMy only gripe with the establishment would be the cramped seating between tables.  It can get extremely awkward taking my seat, wiggling my rotund derriere in between tables to get to my destination.  Most of the time, the company directly next to me are not within earshot; but, when they are, then I'd find myself biting my tongue, trying not to spew out my vernacular of special four-letter words. \n\nOur server was superbly nice and accommodating and our waters were always filled to the brim.  I've always had a great experience here.  The wait staff had greeted us on the way in, which set a precedent for great service and food.\nOh, Bouchon, I will be back."

S'First thing\'s first, ask to sit in Adam\'s section. He is the best at what he does. Attentive, polite and entertaining. Ask me again if I want Baileys in my coffee and I\'d probably say, "Yes, pour it up, pour it up." Almost had to go all RiRi on him.\n\nSecond thing, ladies/gentlemen/pool go-ers, you will not be served by the restaurant if you are not actually wearing clothes. Aka, bikini tops/bottoms, tankinis and midriffs are not allowed. The host will probably tell you to go back to your room and change. \n\nOkay, now to my review of my overall experience.\n\nWe got to the restaurant on a Sunday at around 12pm to have brunch. Like a boss, we were seated within five minutes of arriving. ***DISCLAIMER: THERE ARE NO BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS HERE.*** Kind of the first thing I look for when I go to any Sunday brunch, nowadays. Don\'t worry, I don\'t have a problem.\n\nChocolate croissant: Flakiest chocolate croissant I\'ve ever had with slivers of almond and a drizzle of chocolate on top. Absolutely perfect.\n\nRaspberry beignets: Not my favorite of the selection because the raspberry jam within the beignet was too sweet and the entire thing was just coated with sugar, so too sweet for my taste, but hey, who\'s to say this won\'t be the perfect fancy donut hole for some other brunch go-er.\n\nSteak Frites: Those frites tho. They are probably the best I\'ve ever had. Next to anything with truffle oil on them. So, take note, Bouchon, I like truffle fries as much as the next person. Can I get an \'amen?\' Steak was cooked perfectly and covered with onions. Now, if you\'re weird like me and don\'t like the taste of the onions, then refrain, refrain, refrain from ordering this. Or you can ask them to omit the onions, but I\'d rather get the food the way that it\'s supposed to come. \n\nChicken and Waffles: Bacon, bacon and bacon. Whaaat? Yeah. If you\'re looking for greasy fried chicken, you\'re not gonna get it with their version. It is a roasted half chicken with a side of chive waffles. And you guessed it, there\'s also bits of bacon in the chive waffles. Also comes with a side of gravy that comes with plenty of, you guessed it again, bacon. I was halfway expecting the maple syrup to be bacon infused. But I didn\'t even use the maple syrup, so I guess I\'ll never know. The chicken was moist, the skin slightly charred and the gravy added the perfect saltiness that the chicken needed. The waffles were a perfect balance of sweet and salty. \n\nI, also, ordered a coffee, which they kept filling and piping hot. \n\nThe overall experience was great. I have no complaints. The service is the best. Make sure you ask to sit in Adam\'s section.'

S"Four stars average on Yelp, REALLY??? \n\nWe dined here because it's Thomas Keller's establishment.  Alas, it proved that the negative rumors of his restaurants are true.  Bouchon fell short. \n\nCroque madame: seriously the BEST croque madame?? More like average to decent.  \n\nEggs Benedict: again, way average.  For that price tag, it fell BELOW average. \n\nSo my conclusion is Las Vegas dining does not compare to other places in its class (Chicago, NY, SF Bay Area).  \n\nOh and service was atrocious!  We had to serve our own water because our glasses never got filled. The server scolded us for serving our own water.  I had to walk up to ask for a spoon.  We have to ask for bread, and it was just tossed on the table.  The server rolled her eyes when she dropped a spoon.  Is it because people don't expect good food and service from Las Vegas???  Whatever the reasoning, skip Bouchon."

S'I have delayed writing this review as it has taken me sometime to put my thoughts in order regarding what might be one of the top 3 dining experiences of my life up until this point.\n\nFirst... It is a Thomas Keller restaurant.  Arguably one of the best chefs alive and a true master of the culinary arts.  If you can\'t appreciate this simply fact then you would be better off spending your money at McDonald\'s.\n\nThe atmosphere here is fantastic, if not a bit loud...  but then again, it\'s Vegas baby.  Menu\'s are on brown wax-type paper that will ring your napkin.  Our server was excellent, with out being overly pushy and was quite helpful in explaining questions we had on the menu.  He also didn\'t look at us in disgust when we joked about not being able to order anything in French, due to our limited linguistic abilities.\n\nNow... on to the food.  It was incredible!  I could leave it at that but I wont.  We had a group of five and started with multiple appetizers.  Specifically, we had the Escargot... delicious with the puff pastry on top,The Pork Belly Sausage... I believe the dates in this dish really make for a maple like flavor that is awesome, A selection of Oysters, most from the Pacific Northwest and all extremely fresh and grit free, and finally, the chilled Mussels.  I love Mussels but had not had them chilled before.  Again, they were fantastic.\n\nI had the Steak Frites for my entree.  The steak was excellently prepared and the frites were a golden, crispy, salty, wonderful experience.  The herbed butter on the steak was excellent as well.  My wife had the Roasted Chicken dish and it was phenomenal as well.\n\nTo finish I had the Chocolate Mousse, it was the richest, thickest, creamiest Mousse I\'ve ever had... I loved it.  I was also able to sample the Apple Tart, and Beignets... both we as good if not better than the mousse.\n\nI can\'t recommend this place highly enough... in my mind it is a \'Can\'t miss" while in Vegas.  I am looking forward to buying the Bouchon cookbook and trying out some of these recipes.  If they turn out half as good at home as they did at the restaurant I\'ll be a happy guy!'

Well the food is nothing to write home about but the view and ambiance is one of the best in Vegas. So go for a pleasant or a romantic dinner not for the good food. Next time we will order the steak.

The BFF and I were seated, and I chugged water for a good five minutes. Damn it, Vegas. \n\nI'm a foodie. I love great food and even better drink. I have been planning on Bouchon for weeks and finally made it back to Vegas, and I go so wrecked from the previous night's dinner and fun that I'm in no state to truly enjoy Bouchon's offerings. No problem. It's about the food and the experience....Wonderful, fresh and delicious sandwiches and cheeky, fun service. \n\nI can never say no, and will have to come back to Bouchon to check out the dinner service."

S'eh, nothing special. Maybe I was expecting more from Thomas Keller, but seeing a rather normal breakfast/brunch menu was a little bit of a letdown.\n\nWe had a party of 7 which they sat after quite a wait, even at 1pm on a Saturday. Our server was proper... but not quite friendly or efficient. He brought out the french bread and jam/butter but no bread plates were to be found for at least 10 minutes later. I guess that\'s what they have crumb scrapers for..? so they can save a bit of dish washing? I did enjoy the jam though, tasted like apricot to me.. very pleasant.\n\nI opted for the Croque Madame since a friend told me it was one of their "specialties" and everything else on the menu seemed normal. Other orders at the table: Corned Beef Hash, Tuna Salad Sandwich, Summer Butternut Squash Soup, and their "famous" French Toast. Our waiter said, and I quote, "People from all around the world fly in just for our French Toast because it\'s that amazing." What a way to hype something up!\n\n30 minutes later (literally) our food comes out. My Croque Madame was tasty (toast, ham, cheese, fried egg, creamy sauce served with fries) but WAY too heavy. I tasted a lot of butter with the toast, along with the saltiness from the ham and greasiness of fried egg all drenched in a cream sauce? with FRIES? It\'s quite delicious at first but after a few bites in it gets on the heavy side. Not to mention I think my waist grew an inch after brunch.\nFrom what I heard: All the other meals were just okay. Nothing special and overpriced. Would my friend fly from half way around the world to order to French Toast? His answer: no. Everyone\'s conclusive responses of "meh" summed it up.\n\nOur waiter was pretty much non-existent, letting his helpers do all the work in refilling drinks and bussing plates. So I guess waiters here only take the order and drop off the check? Plus he was guaranteed a 20% gratuity so what did he care? My plate plus an OJ cost $30 alone. Ouch!\n\nSecond French establishment in Vegas that was a semi-fail.. first being Mon Ami Gabi. The theme: mediocre food at a hefty price tag.\nAm I willing to give French dining in Vegas a 3rd try? I\'ll let you answer that one.'

S"4.5 stars.\n\nWhat they say is true about Bouchon and Thomas Keller.  It's amazing!\n\nI read from other yelpers that dinner was not worth it, so instead, I took my friend for lunch/brunch for her birthday.  We both loved our food!  Even though 2 of our friend didn't get the food and taste that they were looking for, but I thought my Croque Madame was the best I've had!  Really reminded me of my visit in Paris.  The other really awesome dish was Chicken and Waffle.  I would totally go back for them again.  Portions were generous.\n\nOur waitress was really friendly, and the decor is amazing because it's inside the beautiful venetian.  Overall, just a relaxing atmosphere for a Sunday to end our trip."

S"Bouchon for breakfast is simply the best!!! \n\nBouchon french toast is basically a bread pudding but there is nothing basic about it. Delicious buttery brioche soaked in a cinnamon custard then stacked and layered with tart apples. Dessert for breakfast...who doesn't love that. Added a side of bacon that was thick, smoky and crisp. \n\nCorned beef hash has nice size dices of corned beef and potatoes along with peppers and onions. Nothing like you get in a diner. The eggs were perfectly poached and completed the yummy meat filled dish. \n\nBut the biggest hit was the coffee. Rich, dark and full bodied but not bitter. Our cups were kept full by the very attentive staff, a very important part of any successful breakfast.\n\nDon't miss Bouchon for breakfast."

S"There are days where I want a nicely prepared meal. And then there are days where I want to stuff my face at a buffet. Our friends chose Bouchon for brunch because we were itching for the former.\n\nI tried a small piece of the sourdough waffles with fresh strawberries and vanilla bean butter. It was very tasty, like a fried waffle. The vanilla bean butter was a nice touch.\n\nThe vanilla bean yogurt with granola was tasty, and boy do they give you a LOT of granola! A bit too rich for my taste, but the granola helped ease it.\n\nThe Cobb salad - didn't take a picture, but it was kinda meh. Limp iceberg lettuce, scarce pieces of chicken, and a small portion to boot for a $17 salad.\n\nThis is a good stop for some carb-loading for any pre-intense-cardio on the dance floor at a club later in the evening. The service is great and our waters were constantly filled.\n\nPrice-wise, it's high for a mediocre meal at The Venetian hotel. I think I'll stop by Grand Luxe the next time around, as their menu contains better choices. Not recommended for those looking for healthy options - everything tasted very rich and heavy."

S'After winning the slot machines, I decided to take my friend and I to Bouchon to splurge. When entering the restaurant, I felt like the host was looking down at us as if we were inferior and didn\'t have money. However, the other staff members were really friendly and helpful. There was a minor wait which didn\'t take too long and we were eventually seated.\n\nIt was Sunday during brunch time so we ordered a "Croque Madame" and the daily special of the day, "Lobster Egg Benedict". I love egg benedict and this was absolutely delicious! The mass amounts of fries on my friend\'s Croque Madame caught us by surprise. They literally put handfuls of fries on any dish that contains fries. I\'m not saying that\'s a bad thing but my friend was too full to finish it all. My friend originally wanted the fried chicken and waffles but they ran out of it! We were sad and even more depressed when we saw the table next to us have one of the few last ones. Another thing that caught me by surprise was the bread they handed out. It was shaped like a weapon used in ancient times. In addition, they lay the bread in the middle of the table with no plates to eat it with. I was carefully eating the bread without leaving crumbs all over the place. For a somewhat fancy place, I would\'ve expected small bread plates at least.\n\nService was average and can be a little better but I still tipped the waiter good. I can\'t justify tipping low unless the service was super bad.\n\nTo sum it all up, Bouchon has scrumptious food and I will definitely come back to either of the locations in Beverly Hills, Vegas, or Yountville.'

We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, and first tried to seat us next to a crowded service area, but when I requested a different table the hostess was very accommodating and  seated us in a large booth with a view outside.  I ordered the American breakfast, because I wanted a little bit of everything; eggs, bacon, sausage, brioche, croissant, juice and coffee.  YUM!  Adult daughter ordered the french toast, and it was delicious.  Adult son wanted a sandwich, and on my recommendation ordered the Croque Madame.  I think he got a little more than he bargained for!  The sandwich had white sauce (mornay sauce) poured over it and a fried egg on top.  Considering he is a fast food junky, I was impressed that he ate it all.'

S"i was really disappointed with my bouchon experience. i came in with high hopes for the food, but was not impressed.\n\ni ordered the french onion soup, and it was below average. like a 2 on a scale of 10. the cheese was tasteless and too hard. perfect french onion soup has cheese that is melting into the bread and into the soup, but this cheese looked like a slice of kraft processed cheese floating on the soup. because the cheese was so hard and unmelted, it was difficult to scoop it with the bread, onions and broth. sad because the waiter had recommended this.\n\nanother dish that has gotten a lot of buzz and that the waiter recommended was the pork shoulder, so 6 out of 8 in our party got that dish. but the pork shoulder was too braised. it was not juicy enough, even when doused in gravy. the root vegetables that came with the pork tasted better than the pork. overall disappointment all around. \n\nservice was spot on, but when i'm paying $35 for an entree i expect it to taste that good. maybe it was an off night but 2 misses means i wouldn't go back."

S'Since I could never snatch a reservation at Thomas Keller\'s infamous The French Laundry in Yountville (2 hrs. from me), I had to try Bouchon all the way in LV to sample Mr. Keller\'s culinary excellence. Even though Bouchon offers more homestyle French comfort food, I didn\'t sense any sacrifice in the quality. My husband and I shared a half dozen fresh oysters, the Steak Frites, and the Cod special. The oysters were served on ice and they tasted super fresh with very minimal taste of "fishiness". They were served with cocktail sauce, a pungent horseradish sauce, and a French-style wine-based vinaigrette. The Steak came with a MOUNTAIN of pomme frittes which were crispy and perfectly seasoned with a bit of salt and parsley. I ordered the Steak medium (which they recommended) and the meat was absolutely melting in my mouth. It must\'ve been a marbled cut for it to be that tender. The Cod was steamed and came with a side of greens, a wheat-like crepe, and some smoked salmon on top. The Cod was moist and was only seasoned by some butter but the balance of the whole dish between the subtle taste of the cod, the smokiness of the salmon, and the saltiness of the greens was done really well. I really enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered and would definitely take advantage of this gem tucked away in the Venetian hotel. The restaurant has a casual yet sophisticated environment with large windows to create a very un-stuffed feel. If it\'s not too hot, try the patio seating for a nice brunch/lunch on the terrace. Then after your meal, head downstairs for dessert at the Bouchon Bakery!'

S"I have tried to get into their sister restaurant in Napa, The French Laundry, for some time with no luck since reservations are required 60 days out and are handled like a radio contest. So since I was given the opportunity to dine here while staying at the Venetian, I figured this was as close as I was gonna get. Reservations here were much easier - opentabled it the same day.\n\nThe restaurant is as beautiful as you would expect and the service is spot on. It is definitely pricey, but that was to be expected. The wine list is original and the menu has a great variety. I had to go for the foie gras and it was one of the best I have had. For my main dish, I wanted to try something adventorous so I opted for the sturgeon. I have never had it before and it sounded great on the menu. Sadly, it wasn't anything special like I was expecting - just an ok piece of fish served fairly plain. I was hoping for something inventive and creative, but it was probably a basic sous-vide with barely any seasoning/sauce. My friend ordered a salmon that was actually very good - perfectly prepared and a tasty sauce to go with. \n\nIt is definitely worth going to, just for the pate even."

This review/score is for both meals. \n\nBrunch- We flew into Vegas on a Sunday morning and went to Bouchon right after checking into our room (around 1pm). There was a 10 minute wait, but that went by in no time. My gf had the Breakfast Americaine which was 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, and a pastry of her choice (we got the sticky bun). I have to admit the eggs portions were tiny, it looked really tiny! The sausage was really good though! The sticky bun was pretty good, it was sweet had pecans all over it. My GF liked her meal overall. I got the Corn Beef Hash with 2 eggs. The Hash was quite good, I got my eggs sunny side up and the were cooked perfectly. When I broke the yolk of my egg and it mixed into the hash, it was heavy but in a good way. The Hash itself was actually pieces of diced meat and not the dog food looking stuff most diners serve. The meal was definitely heavy and would have been perfect if I was hungover! The bread they served with our meal was great and tasted really good with their butter and raspberry/cherry jam. It was a good breakfast overall, a nice start to our trip in Vegas. \n\nMy GF decided to treat me to a Bouchon dinner for our anniversary. We had dinner at Bouchon on a Tuesday night and we were promptly seated for our 7:30pm reservation. It's a really nice atmosphere, and just a nice ambiance. I got the Steak and fries, and my GF got the Mussels and fries. I had heard about these fries based on various reviews, and how Tony Bourdain loved them, so I was really looking forward to the most hyped fries in the world. I got to say they were good! I couldn't stop eating them, they were pretty addictive, they were salty and crisp. My steak was just ok, I guess I am just not a huge fan of a French cooked steak so I am sure it was my tastes and not the way it was cooked. I didn't really like the butter/onion they put on it, but otherwise it was good, cooked really well and to my specifications (medium). My gf liked her mussels and went to work on them like a madwoman. There are quite a bit of mussels in that bowl, she liked them and was quite happy with her meal. The service was really really great! I can't remember our server's name but she was really professional and friendly. The bus boy or I should say bus man was efficient and nice as well. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience both times, the food was excellent and the service matched. I would definitely recommend Bouchon to anybody visiting Vegas and wants to have a nice meal."

S"Finally ate at bouchon for my 32nd (saturday night). I'll start from the top. Got there 30 mins before reservation time to sit and watch from the bar. Good stiff drinks. 27 for a gin tonic and a dirty martini was a little steep for me. 3 bartenders there not engaging at all. Looks like they didn't want to be there. Hostess picked us up at exact time of reservation, but she like the bartenders seemed a little off. No smiling just very matter of fact about her job. Same thing with our waiter. He fired off the specials in a very memorized and harsh tone. Nothing sexy or tempting about the food we were about to order. You see I am a Vegas local, people come here to be impressed and wowed. Tourists are all on vacation hence they are here to have fun laugh, talk, flirt. That's really hard to do with a crew that looks to be counting down till closing. But Im not bashing everybody, the busser filling up our water was real nice and pleasant. Always smiling and helpful.                                                                                                           Now for the food I ordered the Gigot d'Agneau roasted leg of lamb with wild mushrooms, purple baby artichokes, crispy lamb belly & sauce soubise. 33.75 for 5 TINY pieces of roast lamb. I was absolutely shocked. I could tell the waiter had seen that look before. No gaminess no texture. It was just like a roast piece of porkloin. And the crispy lamb belly - chewy and old. Like they had just taken it out from a pickling jar. Just a flop all the way around. My wife had the Moules au Safran  28.50 Maine bouchot mussels steamed with white wine, mustard & saffron\nserved with French fries. Mussels were undercooked. I may be in the wrong here but I like my oyster to have a slippery texture. With Mussels I want a hint of that rubbery texture. We didnt even finish it. The fries were just that, Fries nothing great.  \nI hate to sound mean and all but This was my experience at Bouchon Las Vegas."

S"It's a shame I didn't catch his name, but one of the bartenders there (middle-aged man with a mustache) singlehandedly saved this review from otherwise being two stars. He was sooo nice and came to chat with us as we were waiting in the lounge, and after he heard my friend say she had a stomachache, he came out and surprised us with a concoction he mixed that he promised would cure her queasiness (PS: it worked!) But back to the review, I really wasn't impressed with this place. Our waitress was very knowledgeable, friendly, and down to earth, but the service was just not good. We waited over an hour for our entrees to arrive and other than the oysters (which I didn't have, but heard they were Amazing with a capital A), no one else seemed blown away by their food."

This was my first Thomas Keller experience and I really wanted it to be special :(\n\nThe restaurant is very classy and the service was what you'd expect from a place of this caliber. It's the food that left me disappointed. They started me off with some french bread (too hard) and warm pistachios. I had the crispy frog legs (didn't care for them too much), grilled sturgeon (a lot of flavors that didn't necessarily go together well) and profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce (ok).\n\nThe setting was nice -- outdoor by the pool.

S"Wow, was I excited to have breakfast here! Unfortunately, we didn't have the greatest experience. I've heard so many good things about Bouchon and I expected this breakfast to blow my mind...but no.\n\nWe took a couple of clients to Bouchon for a meeting and to be honest, the waiter was a bit snobby and uptight. He seemed annoyed by us. He was really short and quick with us and didn't seem warm and welcoming at all. \n\nI ordered the French Toast and I was hugely disappointed. It was just not delicious. I can't believe this, but it wasn't seasoned well. It didn't really taste sweet at all. It was just sort of a bland, mushy type of flavor. Also, my french toast tasted like it was pre-made and heated to order, rather than fresh. So sad! \n\nI had a side of sausage, which was okay. They tasted barely heated through as well. Not fresh. My colleagues ordered eggs, hash, etc. and none of them had anything great to say either. All in all a huge let down. I was expecting something reminiscent of the French Laundry, and I got something that didn't even really rival Denny's, sad to say.\n\nNow this might be harsh, maybe I caught a bad dish or a bad day. I'll probably go back, but this was sincerely the experience I had."

S"Never in my life did I expect to succumb to the chicken and waffles craze. But my friend invited me here for brunch and after reading the reviews I had to consider it.\n\nAnd then I ordered it. And oh my was it delicious. Moan with happiness every five minutes delicious. I pretty much had a near religious experience with this dish. The roasted chicken + brown Thanksgiving-style gravy paired with the bacon and chive waffle + vanilla bean butter + maple syrup all sounds like an odd couple, but was absolutely and positively magical. The flavors mixed together so amazingly that I was in shock. Every now and then I'd eat only the chicken or waffle, but would quickly return to the well engineered combo. That's right, engineered - it was clear that this dish was well thought out.\n\nNow that I've gushed about the chicken and waffles to the point of boring you, I must also note that the complimentary bread and butter were also divine. And the house coffee is some of the best coffee I've ever had. Truly an amazing experience all around, and one that I will be dreaming of frequently."

I was disappointed because the amount of veggies and leeks were very minimal. I could have made this omelette myself at home but had to pay $20 for it. \n\nFriends got the french toast (which is supposed to be their signature) wasn't that great. It looked like dessert!!!! It was super sweet and just doused in sugar that it was almost inedible. Why would you ruin french toast and construct it to be like a dessert cake? \n\nI got a side of bacon with my omelette which is the only good thing about the meal because they piled the bacon on. The side of toast was good too, very eggy in flavor. But I don't think I'll be back, it wasn't worth going to just to have mediocre brunch."

S"I was really excited to try Bouchon because I'm a huge fan of Thomas Keller and my life long dream is to eat at the French Laundry. We went for a friend's birthday during a girl's weekend in Vegas. There were 5 of us and we made reservations well in advance for dinner. \nI'm preggers, so no cocktails for me, but the cocktails ordered at my table looked great (an aviator and a Moscow mule). \nThe birthday girl and I started with the foie gras because I had been wanting to try the stuff for years and she had eaten it in Paris years before. It was ridiculously amazing. The 5 oz. that they brought us felt like a bargain (it was $48.50) and we struggled to finish it (the others at the table were not into the force fed goose liver thing) and managed to get down about 4 oz. I had the lamb, which was cooked perfectly (nice and pink) and was served on an additively delicious bean cassoulet. We also ordered fries, which were great and were the best thing ever when dipped in the foie gras! I wasn't that excited about dessert after reading some reviews, but the tarte tatin with creme freche and ice cream was out of this world! \nService was excellent. Our waitress took great care of us (and it was super busy) but the adorable bald busser from Baja was incredible. Water was always full and we went through about 4 loaves of the delicious bread. I can't wait to visit the Bouchon in L.A. for my wedding anniversary this year, and the French Laundry in my dreams."

S"This Bouchon falls below the level of expectation from all the other Thomas Keller restos I've dined in. We ate here for brunch.   My french toast was ok, I expected to be like the bread pudding from Tartine (SF), it was overly sweet and mushy.  My dining companions had the salmon and baguette which they thoroughly enjoyed. Service is friendly but the pacing was off and the servers could do without the fake french accents. Several great items from here (and from its bakery) were the pain epi bread and strawberry jam, coffee and the yogurt parfait. I would probably just skip the Cafe and order something from the bakery."

S"Dinner at Bouchon was good, but not exceptional.  \n\nOysters and clams had shell and sand... hmm.\n\nWhile entrees are well-priced (for a high end restaurant in Vegas) at $17-$35, the specials were significantly more expensive (so make sure you ask) at $39 for the fish and $45 for the veal that night.  Not what you expect when the wait person does not tell you the price but just the specials of the evening.\n\nThe food was not spectacular like you'd expect a Thomas Keller restaurant to serve (maybe I just had high expectations) but was still by far excellent.  My husband ordered the steak frites and I thought it was really well prepared.  I had the trout, which also was cooked well, but I felt that I could make both dishes at home almost as good, if I used enough butter.\n\nWine list was a bit pricy.\n\nI'd go again though, maybe to try their breakfast or brunch menu next time.  And one of these days I'll order the $45 pot of frie gras pate."

S"Breakfast at Bouchon used to be a solid 5, but I feel that there are too many dishes to avoid on the menu for me to give the restaurant an overall 5.  I have also noticed a few changes that bothered me since my last visits.\n\nIt can get quite crowded in the morning.  Breakfast is their thang afterall... which ends at 10:30am.  As long as you get your name on the list to the hostess before 10:30am you are safe.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  The windows are tall and the sunlight pours right in from the Venezia gardens.  You actually feel like you are in a true French bistro.\n\nThe sourdough waffles are always a delight.  I pretty much only order this for breakfast.  The dough is light and fluffy with a slight sourness from the sourdough (in a good way).  They don't over stuff you like most waffles and pancakes do.  Every time that I have had them in the past it has come with strawberries and blackberries.  This time however it came with bananas and walnuts... MEH.  We asked our waitress why and she said that strawberries aren't in season... which makes sense except that I saw the lady next to us receive waffles with strawberries and blackberries on hers!  ARGH.  So I push the walnuts off and only eat the bananas which are a lame fruit compared to fresh berries.\n\nI don't like maple syrup so I ask for whipped cream every time.  Usually it is thick whipped cream but this time the consistency is more airy like the whipped topping on a latte.  Another MEH in my book...\n\nI like to order a side of their bacon to go with the waffles so that I get a little bit of meat.  Their side is about $5 but they give you a lot of bacon.  Worth it.\n\nDo not order the Brioche French Toast... it is not what you expect.  My mother and brother have both ordered this and not liked it.  It is more bread pudding than French toast.  If you are a bread pudding fan then this is for you.\n\nAlso if you like traditional corned beef hash do not order the Bouchon version.  It is the kind where the meat is all chopped up... my mom felt that there also were not enough potatoes to balance out all the corned beef in the dish.  Just be aware of the variations that Bouchon puts on normal breakfast dishes.\n\nI love the baked goods and coffees.  Their vanilla latte is perfect and their cheese danish is something that we always bring back.  You can get baked goods in the bottom floor of the Venetian.  It is also cheaper than the sit down restaurant of course.\n\nI haven't had lunch here but the pomme frites look delicious.  My family likes the breakfast here but just be careful with what you order and make sure you know what you are getting.  The sourdough waffles are a no fail choice."

S"For us, by the time we get up, shower and dress, and then finally decide where to eat, brunch is usually the only option. But, since brunch is the best of two worlds we don't usually complain.\n\nBouchon was a perfect pick for brunch. We started the meal with a mimosa and a peach bellini. Then, we ordered beignets (aka powdered donuts) that came with raspberry jam and nutella. The beignets were perfect. They had a little texture to their outside to give the crunch factor but the inside was perfectly light and cakey. The raspberry jam was delicious with it. Nutella is always good so why not on donuts?\n\nFor the main course, I ordered their french toast and Jeff ordered croque madam. The french toast was this perfect little tower layered with apples and custard all on a maple syrup pond. It was very good, but not what I was expecting. I wanted the big pieces of bricohe with apples and syrup all decadently on top. I guess I wanted more comfort than elegance?\n\nJeff's croque madam came with the biggest side order of fries I have ever seen. I couldn't even see his meal over the fries (although I am short).  The flavors of the sandwich were there, but possibly it had a little too much creme fraise on it.\n\nOverall, the meal was very satasfying. I can still  remember the taste of those beignets. Yum!"

S"On a bright late Sunday morning, the four of us didn't have to wait too long (@20-30 mins), for this caliber of a restaurant.  We went before our flight back home so we had our luggage.  The hostess took our bags and checked them in a separate room so we could eat comfortably.  \n\nThe servers team worked like a well oiled machine.  We probably had 4 servers tend to us, like they worked as a team to make us happy.  As a former server, I LOVE when that happens.   The servers, informed us well on the specials, asked to prepare the foie gras for us, always had our water glasses filled (very important after a Saturday night/Sunday morning in Vegas), and were attentive without being to nosy (love when this happens as well).\n\nFrom the taste and presentation, the food was spectacular.  The bread comes out in the shape of leaves.  Then starting out the foie gras appetizer was decadent, 2.5 oz, would have been enough for us, the mussels were so fresh, and even the olives in the bloody marys had a freshness to them.  \nAs for the entrees, all of us were very pleased with what we got.   I had gotten their signature dish, the prefectly cooked roasted chicken and chive waffles, accompanied with chicken gravy, maple syrup, and vanilla bean butter.  All of it was amazing, except for the gravy, that was just way too salfty for me, and I love salt.  Nonetheless, the meal was delicious and didn't even need the gravy so it was all good.\n\nDefinitely a great place for brunch."

S"I've tried Bouchon in LA and recommended it to a group of friends during our Vegas trip. I think it's decently priced for lunch and a much better alternative to some of the (relatively) more popular places to eat for brunch (*ahem Mon Ami Gabi). \n\nI LOVE mussels, and the ones I had in Bouchon in LA were some of the best I've had. Thankfully, the one in Vegas remains the same. It's a huge portion size that makes the $25.50 price tag very worth it. My trick is to first eat the ones that allow me to dig a little hole and reach the white wine with saffron sauce. Then I can eat my mussels AND dip my french fries into the sauce at the same time! Pure deliciousness. :)\n\nI tried some of the croque madame and smoked salmon baguette which were both outstanding. A friend also ordered the special of the day which was a pork belly BLT. Service was a little slow, but we had a large group and I didn't mind that much. I was amazed at how identical the Vegas Bouchon and LA Bouchon looked. Uncanny!\n\nI really think this is the best Sunday brunch you'll find on the strip, granted you're looking for a French style brunch and not a buffet. The prices are probably a little more expensive, but the food is so, so much better!"

S'High expectations. Had just read about Bouchon in Wine Spectator. I had narrowly missed dinner at Keller\'s  Napa French Laundry before it was famous so I was anxious to see what "America\'s Top Chef" could do. I arrived solo and was seated at a banquette, which I dislike. I had couples on either side and I was closer to the girls than their dates were. The bread was fabulous and the warm pistachios were a nice touch. I ordered the appetizer special, scallops mousseline. It tasted fine but was ridiculously small. It would not have crowded a saltine. My waiter noticed I still looked hungry and offered another appetizer (at full price, of course.) I ordered the French Onion soup after hearing my banquette-mates exclaim goodness. I should have passed. It was very salty (and far below the high soup standard set the day before by Mon Ami Gabi in Harrah\'s Paris.)  The salmon came and it was sauteed on one side until crispy. I was surprised at the level of cooking since I had ordered it rare. It was actually still mosit in the center, buy the crispyness seemed to dissipate most of the flavor. The fish itself was unseasoned and a little salt would have helped liven it. Unfortunately, a saltshaker is not an option on the table. The fava bean, bacon and mushroom sauce was properly seasoned and helped although it was a less than effective compliment to the salmon. My curiosity is now satisfied, but in a negative way.'

We settled on Bouchon as it was an easy walk from where we were staying.  \n\nFirst of all, the atmosphere is great.  Quiet enough to have a private conversation at the table but not so quiet that you feel like you're in a library.  The service was excellent.  I had a hard time deciding what to order (everything sounded so good!), and our waiter made great recommendations (he also picked out some cheeses for us for appetizers).  I ended up getting the trout amandine; it was fabulous.  So soft and buttery, it melted in my mouth.  Other dishes ordered were the mussels and fries (mussels were amazing!), and one of the specials; pork chop-- everything was so tastey!\n\nWe had a great dining experience and everyone in the restaurant seemed to be having a good time!"

The food does not disappoint and I felt that a lot of care was given to how it was all prepared. The sauce for the moules-frites was slightly tangy which was very appetizing and before my husband and I knew it we had gone through the entire dish! Good for my palate but bad for my diet! The veal was cooked to perfection with a melt-in-your-mouth juiciness which contrasted nicely with its crispy outer crust. Our server was really attentive and kept stopping by to give us new plates (for the shells) and refiling our beverages.\n\nAll in all, there's really nothing I have to complain about! Note that the servings are kind of huge so it might be a good idea to just share an entree and appetizer if you don't eat a lot. I left Bouchon full but NOT AT ALL stuffed (you know that horrible greasy feeling you get when you overate? Not this time.) This is a true testament to the well-thought out and executed recipes at Bouchon where all the flavors enhance and balance each other out. I know I will be back for more the next time I am back in Vegas!"

We got up late Saturday but were lucky that they served brunch on Saturday (and only on Saturday I think) so we wouldn't miss out on the wonderful food and atmosphere this place has to offer.  The service was outstanding.  We waited sometimes only three minutes before some of our food came.  We kind of did eurobrunch backwards by ordering a  cheese sampler plate before our meal.  We sampled cow, sheep, and some goat cheese that they had.  All were delicious.  The French toast (as reported by the New York times) lived up to its distinction of being some of the best French toast you can get in the United States!  My traditional boudin blanc with scrambled eggs was also very good.  I loved the high ceilings and authentic French Bistro feel of the place.  It is tucked away in the Venetian complex and not out in the main commerce area so you kind of have to know where you are going to find this place.  Ask a concierge or look it up on a map before you try to find it.  It is well worth it!  There is no view of the strip but there is a view of a nice courtyard and it makes it kind of more exclusive, calmer, and less touristy feeling than my other French Vegas hangout, Mon Ami Gabbi.  I highly recommend both of these restaurants.  I have found a new Vegas tradition!  Be sure to try one of their well made Bellinis or a French 77 as a brunch aperitif!"

S'I have found "My Last Meal".  \nMy wife and I first came to love Bouchon in 2009 while staying at The Palazzo.  We have since been there a handful of times.  It is a must stop for us when we visit Vegas.\nBreakfast and Coffee are exceptional.  I enjoy the Hash and Eggs.  My Wife loves the Beignets.\nMy Last Meal on Earth:  I would start off by ordering an Ice Cold Draft Beer.  Next is the Rillettes aux deux Saumons = Great Flavor and what a way to get started.  I then move on to the Assiette de Charcuterie and another Beer.  Next comes the Oysters on the half shell.  They have a wonderful selection of the freshest oysters you can find, and we are in Vegas.  Finally comes the moment of my biggest delight.  My main course would be the Chicken and Waffles.  They are by far the best Chicken and Waffles you will ever have, and the chicken is roasted not fried. To finish off my last meal I would have one more beer.\n\nMy wife and I are huge foodies and This is my Favorite Restaruant in the States.'

We arrived before 8am and the place was already just about full but we were seated immediately. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food was delicious as expected. My Mom ordered the Pre Fixe Breakfast which included a freshly baked pastry, tropical fruit salad, 2 eggs, Lyonnaise potatoes,Saut\xc3\xa9ed spinach, and coffee for $22 and my Dad and I had the 2 eggs, potato croquettes, and pecan wood smoked bacon for $18...the place was filled with what appeared to be mostly business folks enroute to various meetings or conferences...a very comfortable and relaxed environment surrounded by the beauty of the Venetian decor in the hallways...this Bistro is a little out of the way and not in the main area's of the casino but worth the search."

S"Avoid during holidays seasons!  I came here during Christmas and the line was ridiculous.  We waited in life for 3 and a half hours. I have no idea how I had the patience to pull that off but every other restaurant was just as long and I've been wanting to try this place.  \n\nTo top it off when we got in line, I had to wait another 15 minutes in line for the meat station and when it got to me, they told me they ran out of the lamb and prime lib and to come back later.  I come back in 10 minutes and I see they have meat again so I wait in line again and once again, they run out again.  I come back for the third time, and this time they've run out of prime rib completely.  I am getting pretty fed up with this place at this point as I waited 4 hours in line total and paid 40 dollars for this and they run out of food.  I don't know if this was their first Christmas because I came to the cosmopolitan last Christmas and didn't notice a buffet but they were soo unprepared.  \n\nNow why then would I give this place 5 stars?  Because we complained to the manager about this and  the manager was so nice, he gave us complimentary 80 dollar gift card to use anywhere at the cosmopolitan.  now that's what i call customer service : )  Coming back here again when its not so hectic to give the place another try."

S"2 of the best things that could possibly happen when you have dinner is that its a buffet (lots of choices) and its free.  Well not exactly free but it was a celebration of my niece's graduation from HS (Congrats Megan - Valedictoria and future Hoya alumni).  \n\nThe location for this buffet is inside the Cosmopolitan (a James Bond glossy new casino in the strip).  this is my second visit to the Cosmpolitan but it was not a destination for me for gambling (too pricey) or partying (bit old for that),  Back to the buffet,  Our group was seated in a section separate from the rest of the Buffeteers(?) but we still had to go to each station like a normal customer.  \n\nThe choices were varied like most buffets. I often stay away from the more common items I can get anywhere else so I tried mostly stuff I normally would not find on a my daily fast food meal hunt.  There were a lot of choices that I would enjoy and also was good for my partner who is a pescaterian (he eats dairy, seafood but no red or white meat).  I agree with the other comments on the little pots for some of the dishes.  It really is designed to share and takes up most of the space of your plate.  I found the Gen Tso's chicken good and crunchy.  The ratatatouille was pleasantly steamed without being overcooked but needed a base sauce.  The shrimp miso salad was fine.  The ceviche passable.  The gazpachos bearable.  The prime rib was great with a little salt and the bone marrow as the sauce (yes bone marrow).  I am not a big buffet eater but thoroughly enjoyed the availability of many choices.  \n\nTruly the dessert choices was really good but too much sugar for someone who has to watch his sugar level.  The gelatos (esp pistachio and mango) tasted great.  The custard/flan was fine.    Overall the service and food deserves 4 stars.  The best part was that the place was not overcrowded.  I think the pricing is higher than most buffets but if the selection is good then its worth it.\n\nThe Wicked Spoon was Wickedly Good for the Stomach!"

S'I hate writing long reviews so lets make this short and simple.\n\nI took my dad here for his bday, I had been dying to try this place for the longest time and we finally decided to go. Lunch for my father and I was over $100.00 so I was definitely expecting something great. The food was okay.. nothing really stood out. The way that the food was set out and the way they plate everything was very nice. The food looks delicious and looks like it would taste fantastic. However, it doesnt taste fantastic, it tastes okay. The Buffet was not bad , but for the price it definitely was not worth it. Since I am a Las Vegas local, I would have preferred to have saved my $100.00 go to a Station Casino and spend a lot less and have money left over for a movie, etc., etc., Dont think ill be back.'

S"Wicked Spoon isn't bad at all for a buffet. It averages $30/person. They have a good variety in entree choices but it's their dessert selection that makes this place good.\n\nIf you're a big seafood person, then this may not be the buffet for you because there isn't a big seafood area with crab legs spilling over, shrimp and mussels.  However, they do come out with other unique dishes. And there is what seems like an endless choice in desserts. I loved their chocolate covered strawberries, macaroons, cheesecake bites and gelato. \n\nAnother plus about Wicked Spoon is that most of their selections come in individually portioned plates since that makes it less messy and so you aren't picking around at food that other people touched."

S"Las Vegas is a city that does justice to a buffet.  If you really love this glutinous experience, you can buy a 24 hr buffet pass for about $50.  If you would rather go to one super high end buffet for about the same cost with bottomless mimosas, champagne and Bloody Marys, then Wicked Spoon is for you.  I had read reviews about epic waiting lines, my tip is to go early.  We were there for 9:30 am and walked right in, it was perfect.  We chose to pay $9 for bottomless bevvy's.  They definitely know how to treat you because within minutes our server came over with not one but 2 mimosas each.  We felt like kids in a candy store, there are so many dining options.  Their are light items to start with like yogurt and berries, salads, fruit, and bagels and lox.  After that you can progress into hot breakfast items like pancakes, omelets, bacon, and french toast.  After that they have more brunch type items like fried chicken, braised short ribs, polenta, gnocchi.  Finally you can go over to the dessert bar and pick up pastries or homemade gelato.  I had too many different items to go into detail about each, 90 percent were amazing, a few duds, but that is to be expected.  A few highlights were the smoked salmon, tomato salad with candied bacon, and the braised short rib on polenta.  \n\nOverall, with all of the options for buffets, i was so happy that i chose Wicked Spoon, the quality of ingredients is high end, and not only was there a lot of food, the options were modern and inventive."

S"I'm not usually a fan of buffets, but this one was different and the little details definitely stood out to me. I liked the small portions.. that probably helps with their waste of food from customers.. smart. I also liked the purified water bottles that are environmentally friendly and also cuts down on bugging the wait staff for refills. We came in for lunch and waited about 20 minutes in line for a seat... this place is no joke! I couldn't fully enjoy my meal after a wild, crazy night in Vegas.. but I tried. I really liked the mashed potatoes, mussels in wine sauce, their salmon, pastas, pizza and short ribs. For dessert there was some nice options, including massive chocolate covered strawberries, macrons and other various desserts. I also forgot to mention their wide selection of gelato. I'd definitely wanna come back to try their dinner selections."

The waiter will greet you and take your drink order which we got coffee but then you also get one bloody or mimosa with the buffet. We both got bloodys which were just a ok. They have a huge buffet. Everything from make your own omlets, pancakes, carving station, bagel bar and lox, sushi and asian food, wood fired pizzas and beautiful desserts. The one thing that I did not care for was that they put carrots in the sushi. Too big and takes away from all the other good stuff. Staff is really friendly.'

S"This buffet did NOT live up to the hype. I debated on going here to try it versus going to Aria's buffet again, which I thought was a solid 4-5 stars. This experience was a waist of time and money that I regret having to go through.\n\nFLIES - Came on a Monday night around 6pm and had to wait 35 minutes, which wasn't too bad. The presentation of the food and dining room looked good, until I spotted a couple of small flies flying around over our food and the area we sat at. That's a good sign that there are more of those flies in other areas, prep stations, etc. 1 Star just for sanitation alone, but wait there's more...\n\nLAYOUT - Getting past how everything looked and the couple of flies i had to swat away, I quickly noticed the layout of the tables were horrible. I had to take the long way and walk around tables just to get to my table because chairs were literally back to back in some areas and I didn't want to keep asking individuals to push in their chairs. Another thing I thought was funny, yet disappointing, was that they used a black sharpie on some of the food labels versus just taking the time to reprint the label.\n\nFOOD - I personally look for the higher end items when eating at a buffet, i.e. the crab legs. The snow crab legs here were awful and dry, I hate when they slice it in half. Most crab leg fans will agree and rather receive the crab legs as is and do the work to get the meat out. Plus you have someone serving you 2-3 legs at a time, where all other buffets you can serve yourself and get as much as you want. Seriously, these are only snow crab legs, I could only imagine IF they had alaskan king or lobster, they'd be served by an armed guard.\n\nThe sushi station was a joke, they had more empty platters then they had sushi. When they finally put rolls out, they had 2 roll types spread out in front of 6 labels which didn't match. I even asked the person at that station for a side of vinegar for my very dry crab legs, and they replied, why? Like I said, what a joke.\n\nThe dessert station was disappointing. The selection was very limited and there were a lot of things missing and not replaced in a timely manner. There was even a few minutes where the dessert station was unmanned. The guy with the glasses giving out gelato was rude and didn't understand English or he was just one of the guys that mumbles and doesn't enunciate when they talk. Zero customer service skills, go figure, scooping gelato isn't that hard.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE - The waiters taking plates and giving drinks were like ghosts and had to be called for service instead of checking on their tables like most real buffets do. They all lacked customer service skills, and you could hear it in the tone of their voice and literally see the dislike in working there in their faces. \n\nSUMMARY - The only thing I liked was the pb&j gelato even though they come in very small scoops and I had to interact with the rude gelato server wearing glasses, I wish he had a name tag so I could put him on blast. The mac and cheese station was good as well, however I don't plan to spend another $35 to eat here again and receive the very poor service/customer service I received."

Again, I wish that I could surgically augment my gastrointestinal system with 3 or so more stomachs to contain all that tasty food!"

S'Definitely the most ornate buffet I have ever been to in my life! They really go out of their way to make every single dish have a nice presentation as if it were food made for a nice sit down restaurant. A lot of the dishes were set in cute individual plates or mini pans rather than a big heated serving tray you find at most buffets.\n\nWhen it comes to Vegas I kind of expect everything to be grand and most of the items here we\'re with the exception of the dried out wimpy crab legs :-(. The sushi was also very....simple....basic....amateur? The rolls would consist of very basic ingredients such as "green bean roll" or "cucumber roll" definitely not the place for a sushi connoisseur. \n\nMy favorite part about about this place when it comes to entrees would probably have to be the juicy prime rib & juicy pork loin. \n\nDesert is hands down the best thing about this place. My suggestion? Come here with a bunch of your desert loving friends and do a desert buffet :-).'

The waiters and waitresses give top notch customer service. \n\nGreat food selection no matter what you're in the mood for. They also get bonus points in my book for presentation. I love how they portion their food into little mini skillets and fry baskets, perfect so you don't overcommit to a single dish. They are reasonably priced for the vast selection of foods and desserts compared to other buffets in Vegas. And the icing on the cake, you can add $10 on top of the cost for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. \n\nHere is a breakdown of the cost and hours: \n\nDaily Brunch: Monday - Friday, 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. ($26.00)\nWeekend Brunch: Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m. ($34.00)\nDaily Dinner: Monday - Thursday, 5 p.m. - 9 p.m. ($38.00)\nWeekend Dinner: Friday, 5 p.m. - 10 p.m.; Saturday, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.; Sunday, 3 p.m. - 9 p.m. ($41.00)"

Thai tea was my fav, followed by the pistachio, balsamic strawberry, salted peanut butter and Chocolate! I shd have started with this one first coz by the time I tried it, I had to find space in my stuffed tummy. Then again I won't eat anything else if I started with this.

S"First time bf and I came to this place we didn't have a good experience. That was partly our fault because it was about 10-15 minutes before closing. It was also partly Wicked Spoon's fault because the cashiers notified us that we would still have about 15 minutes to go up to the buffet section and get all of our food. \n\nBUT, after we paid and sat down. We approached the buffet section to find that 70% of the food was already put/thrown away!! What a disappointment considering that we paid about $50 per person (holidays around christmas/newyears). I did get my hand on some delicious dessert! We should have complained to managers on duty that night but decided not to. \n\nI believe the next day, the bf wanted to go back since Yelp Reviews were good..and because we didn't really get to try everything the buffet had to offer. When we went back, the line was super long! We waited for about 1-1.5 hour in line.\n\nThis time, the buffet was fully stocked. I got to eat plenty of crab legs and a whole lot of dessert! The marshmallows were so delicious, they basically melted in your mouth! Strawberries dipped in chocolate covered in toffee were also excellent! I think I hate at least 10 of them. They also offered macarons which were just okay in my opinion.\n\nI also witnessed a manager/supervisor on duty yell at a Mexican/Latino employee/waiter because some leftover food fell on the floor where they bring all the dirty dishes to. felt bad for the guy =("

The best dessert was the handmade marshmellows. \n\nService was also slow and inattentive.

One of my absolute favorite dishes is the shrimp and grits! the best i have ever tasted! The crab legs are also good, not watery tasting like a lot of the other buffets, you can even request them to be steamed if you like it hot. They have a good selection of dessert (gelato is delicious!), i just wish the made creme brule like wynn and bellagio though. If they had that they would be perfect!

It was so unexpected to find such a wonderful buffet at our hotel!  \n\nThe Cosmopolitan should be advertising and bragging about this buffet!  It is completely undersold given how much effort and work goes into this.  The staff working it do a really good job too.  We enjoyed it completely several days in a row.  DEFINITE FIVE STAR RATING!!!'

S"As a vegetarian diner, I felt the price ($42+tax) was overpriced, but I tried to get the most bang for my buck. I got multiple servings of their exotic desserts, especially the sugar-free cakes, mango mousse cake, and pistachio gelato. I really could eat them all day long! The angry mac and cheese gave the perfect kick of hot and cheesy goodness, served in adorable tiny pots with mini-handles! I'd recommend this place if you're looking to try novel foods with interesting presentation, because most other food options here can be found at other buffets with cheaper admission fees on the Strip."

S'So we ate here the last night of a 4 night min-vacation. We went to a late night Korean BBQ buffet (Sura) the first night (not so good despite good Yelp reviews).  We did the Buffet of Buffets the next 2 nights (Bacchanal the first night and Spice Market the next).  Tonight we wanted to try Wicked Spoon mainly due to the good reviews on Yelp. The price is perhaps a tad high ($40 pp).  We had the kalbi beef (very good), Asian BBQ ribs (very good), beef ribs (very good), prime rib (good), scalloped potatoes (very good), mac n cheese bar (very good but too big a serving), crab legs (not so good as they were too small), duck confit ravioli (very good), fried calamari/oysters (too much breading), shrimp cocktail (pretty good), and short ribs on polenta (pretty good).  The desserts overall were very good.  The ambience is pretty upscale for a buffet.  Its hard to compare this buffet with Bacchanal as they were different kinds of buffets. Overall however I liked Bacchanal buffet better.'

S'As a buffet connoisseur (kind of an oxymoron like "jumbo shrimp" or "Walmart snob") and as someone who has gone to Vegas about once a year for the past 20 years, I have been to pretty much every buffet in Vegas, some many times. So how does Wicked Spoon compare to the Bellagio Gourmet Buffet (weekends only), which is still the best buffet in Vegas? Not very well.\n\nWhen you go to a buffet that costs almost $40, you\'re really not looking for variations on, say, chicken preparation. You can get chicken for under a couple of bucks a pound at almost any supermarket. Or at least if you are, you shouldn\'t be shelling out $40 for a buffet - just go to Old Country or Golden Corral.\n\nAt a $40 buffet, you\'re looking for a large selection of relatively expensive foods. At the Bellagio Gourmet Buffet, which I went to one night before Wicked Spoon, there was Peking duck, prime rib, Chilean sea bass, kobe beef, sushi (with actual raw fish), poke (sashimi prepared Hawaiian style), etc. - you can\'t find a single one of these items at more pedestrian buffets.\n\nWhat do you get at Wicked Spoon? Only prime rib that\'s above ordinary and then fairly ordinary ingredients prepared slightly fancifully and presented in uppity small metal containers that are made in France. It\'s just not really close and it\'s only something one appreciates if one is not a true foodie and loves pretense.\n\nGo to the Bellagio.'

S"Very easily one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. 4 of us had decided to go with their Sunday brunch since I had read pretty good things about it on Yelp. Let's get the qualms and cons out of the way before I start praising the place.\n\nQualm 1- You pay first before you start waiting to get seated. There are two lines for payment - normal guests like you and me, and the diamond VIP guests that pay a lot of $$ to get that status. Very often, people don't read the signs and line up in the diamond line. After you pay, you wait in line. Our wait was about 40 minutes [it would be worth it]\n\nQualm 2 - Our server was a nice and sweet middle aged lady. Problem with that was that she was slow and very not sensitive to our plates piling up and our drinks always going empty. We started playing tetris with our plates to make room for new ones.\n\nQualm 3 - The 'galbi'. The 'Korean beef ribs' were mercilessly overcooked and straight up jerky. Whoever crafted the sauce also made it wayyyy too concentrated and extremely salty. There was so much sauce it was almost chalky. I attempted to take one bite, could even cut the meat off the bones, then left it to be picked up.\n\nThe great things:\nI love the design of the plating and presentations. Mini-pots to hold the heated foods, lovely little plates and cute bowls for the small, chilled dishes. I will agree with some folk that the cute presentation and plating of the foods make for difficult carrying, as only a few dishes would be able to fit on your plate. But you know what? That means more exercise. Walking back to the buffet lines = more calories burned. \n\nThe short-rib eggs benedict was AH-MAY-ZEEENG. The short rib was tender and well seasoned, the eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise sauce was just mild enough, but a great mixture to cohesively blend all the flavors and textures together. Sooo delicious. I went back for two!\n\nThey had flat flat flat thing crust pizzas so that the dough didn't take up too much space in your gut. The BLT salad was very tasty and seemingly light. The pesto gnocchi had a very cheesy feel to them yet they weren't too dense or heavy. Very delicious.\n\nThere were 12 flavors for gelato for dessert, chocolate covered strawberries dipped in crushed oreos, dipped in Heath Bar crumbles, and white chocolate covered marshmallows, along with an assortment of flavored fudges. As simple and common as it was, their peanut butter cookie was super duper delicious. You can tell they didn't hold back on the butter, but boy, was it delicious.\n\nFor a $29+tax brunch, I'd say, the selection was very good, the overall quality was there, although there were a few misses on the dishes [i.e the 'galbi']. I saw that there was slab bacon at the carving table that many were asking to be freshly grilled. Something different and new that I've never seen.\n\nI think the Wicked Spoon made its way to my 'must have' list for my 'things to eat when in Vegas'. Loved it."

S"Walked over here from Planet Hollywood to check-off the necessary buffet lunch for our Vegas weekend.  The line was looooong.  You have to first wait in a line to pay, and then in a line to be seated.  We waited about 45 minutes to pay.  And SURPRISE, they could seat our party of 8 right away!  Yay!  Almost $50 for the lunch buffet with bottomless champagne, mimosas, and bloody mary's, including tip.\n\nBest selections: Mussels, macaroni and cheese, fresh berries, sweet potato/pork hash, shrimp cocktail\n\nNot so great selections: Sushi (but I guess I shouldn't have expected...), seaweed salad (bland and flavorless), my cut of prime rib (mine was tough, but my friends' liked theirs)\n...and speaking of not-so-great stuff... No creme brulee :-(  I missed my Paris buffed creme brulee selection.\n\nThe other thing that made this buffet a 3 star, was our freakin waiter.  Oh my goodness.  5 of us had the bottomless drinks, but he was SO slow, would only bring back half of our drink order at a time, favored other tables over us, and was extremely forgetful.  We wanted our tip back.\n\nI did enjoy the champagne.  The bloody mary's were just okay.  A little strange tasting.  I think I had 5ish drinks, so I definitely tried to get my money's worth in that way.\n\nBut the ambiance, space, and cleanliness is good (except for one of the bathrooms - my friend said it was nasty, so I didn't go in it).  Paris buffet is still my favorite."

S'There were so many options of prime food available here. Depending on when you arrive, you will be able to find delicacies such as walnut french toast for breakfast or fresh king crab legs and juicy leg of lamb for lunch and dinner. I do believe they have permanent installations of other food such as korean bbq and american buttermilk fried chicken. But in addition, they serve their sweet desserts around the clock, with their Italian gelato as their keynote. On another note, they also serve a wide variety of vegetarian friendly dishes that one can choose from. The quantity of the food they serve equals the quality of food and service. For each serving station, they have a handful of chefs that maintain the great quality of the food. Their servers will also keep you hydrated with the complimentary drink, and the aforementioned stations can even receive personalized requests. The $42 buffet price is really worth it all. One just better come hungry!'

A group of friends from out of town and I went here New Years Day. It was 40 bucks..... 40 BUCKS! for all you could eat and bottomless mimosas. Need I say more? Well I Will. lol. \n\nWe arrived around, oh idk, 3:30pm. Super late. We thought we had missed breakfast. We didn't. It was perfect because after we went around scrounging for all the delicious morsels of; Bacon, Eggs (Home made omelets), Chicken & Waffle minis, Ham, Home fries..... (You get the point). They started changing the menu over . So for our second, third, fourth.... helping we were able to feast upon their decadently exquisite dinner entrees. Consisting of mouth watering deliciousness ranging from Shrimp Cocktail - Sushi made to order, beef/chicken corn tacos - Mac & cheese, Chicken Breast - carved roast beef. Then to top it off they have HUGE chocolate covered strawberries set up with over 20 other desert options including an Ice Cream Bar filled with Gelato Ice Creams and sorbets. \n\nOk I'm done. I'm Really hungry now. Wicked Spoon anyone?! \n\nP.S. The Hotel it's in is pretty nice too ;)"

I might've over hyped this place as I usually do since I was tired, grumpy, and most likely hungover but I thought the food was decent especially for its price (23$) I love breakfast, so I was overwhelmed when I saw that they had such a nice variety of brunch spread. This place had a lot of potential to be perfect but the food was a bit cold, some stale and what really killed the whole experience for me was how awful their macarons were. I love macarons."

S'This is my new favorite buffet in Vegas!\n\nSo came here last weekend for my annual basketball tourney with the fellas and wanted to check out a new buffet.  I heard about the new Marquee club at Cosmopolitan and I wondered this must be a new hotel meaning...there is a new buffet in town!\n\nOf course like always, I yelp almost all restaurants, bars, clubs before checking them out to see if its worth my time.  After reading reviews from fellow yelpers and saw the 4 star rating...I just had to come eat here.\n\nThe food:\n\nExcellent!  There was a nice variety of food for the price you pay.  $22 for lunch and $35 for dinner.  What I also like was their presentation.  Like half of the food offered came in little pots were I believe the portion was just right cause we all know you have to strategize when eating a buffet  and not overload on one particular food.  \n\nDecor:\n\nModern I would say compared to other buffets.  Nice furniture and they presented their water in a corked bottle instead of just pouring it for us.\nMaybe cause the place was just new.  But definitely stands out compared to other nice buffets like the Wynn and Bellagio.\n\nIn Summary:\n\nFor the price and location of this buffet; I freaking love this place.  The best part about this is, for now at least, there was only 10 people in line when we left at 830pm on Saturday night.  Maybe the word has gotten out yet about this place...only time will tell\n\nHappy Eating!'

There is SO much to choose from, its almost overwhelming - but I wasn't afraid, as I dove right in and loaded up my plate. They have everything from breakfast, to Chinese, to salads, to country-style ham and mashed potatoes. One of my favorite items is the apple walnut French toast - GASP!! For a couple dollars more, you can also have unlimited mimosas and/or bloody-mary's! Their desert options are robust as well - this went extremely well and matched my waistline as the end of my experience - robust. Highly recommend you try it out"

A bit dry since they\'re just sitting in a pile.\n       - Shrimp - There were cocktail shrimps in mini cups (2 per). However, this also made the shrimps rather dry. It was amusing to see some people grabbing 8 little cups and loading up their plates.\n       - Carving Meats - They have prime rib, huge beef ribs, and bone marrow. First time I ever had bone marrow. It was interesting. Everything else, it wasn\'t bad nor was it great.\n       - Mini Pots - A good portion of their buffet selection is served in mini pots or mini frier trays. While the presentation is unique, this also makes them a little dry and not as hot as it should be.\n       - Atypical - They have unique foods like "Cavetelli With Roasted Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=xiR7vw2PipY9vyyS9sTbIw)" and "Asiago Stuffed Gnocchi With Asparagus and Tomato Butter(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=vbE5zidz4UaMEYMFhQkmDQ)." Instead of just plain rice, they have "Wild Rice With Figs, Cranberries, and Smoked Almonds."\n       - Tastiness - Though their foods were definitely different, the yummy factor just wasn\'t hitting it for me. I was disappointed the taste did not live up to the aristocratic names.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I\'d recommend this place if you\'re looking for an interesting experience.

I  love Wicked Spoon.  Although the menu selection isn't as vast as most, the quality of the dishes are unparalleled by most vegas buffets. You can definitely tell they took their time in dreaming up the week's menu. Presentation has also been well thought out. \n\nTheir Prime Rib was on point, juicy, bloody, slight salty crust, delicious. That alone was worth my $40. Oh and the desserts.  Good to the last teensy morsel. Gelato for days too. \n\nI can't say enough how impressed I am with Wicked Spoon.

S'My favorite buffet in vegas! Surprised I haven\'t reviewed this place yet.. Anyway, Wicked Spoon is totally for girls. They serve lots of dishes in mini pan or fryers so all of the foods are presented super cute! It also helps you to not lose focus and grab little portion at a time so you can try variety of stuff at the buffet :)\n\nBut the number 1 reason why I like Wicked Spoon is because of their flavorings. Most buffet food taste "eh" to me. It\'s not bad but it\'s not great either. But Wicked Spoon is different. For example, their fried chicken is seasoned so well! The chicken is coated with crispy peppery spicy skin/batter and the inside of the chicken is SUPER juicy. Their prime rib\'s au ju tasted great and I devour plate full of steamed clam that tasted delicious.\n\nI\'m not a big fan of desserts but I definitely had my eyes on the gelato. I tried both oreo and behold, THAI TEA GELATO. Oreo gelato had nice big oreo crunches and it was great but oman, glorious thai tea gelato definitely topped it all. It taste straight up like thai iced tea but in creamy and cold gelato. How awesome IS that?\n\nLunch is $30 plus tax. The only complaint for me is that Wicked Spoon doesn\'t serve crab legs during lunch time and the wait can be an hour long. Sad story.'

I also tried Le Village buffet at Paris and the Spice Market buffet at Planet Hollywood.I wanted to go to Wicked Spoon for about a year. My sibling recommended it to me. The popularity of Wicked Spoon was definitely spread through word of mouth. \nWicked Spoon served so many delicious dishes that you just couldn't eat them all! I ate three plates for dinner. Two for entrees, and one for dessert. I tried the following for dinner:\n\nKing crab legs\nSeared salmon with capers\nCooked shrimp in grits\nPork tenderloin at the grill\nKorean BBQ beef ribs\nMini burger\nFried calamari\nShoyu ramen\nParmesan risotto\nSauteed greens\nSweet potato\nMacarons\nVanilla gelato\nChocolate mousse with berries \nChcolate covered strawberries\n\nEvery serving was insanely delicious and dazzled my taste buds! I loved how some of the servings were served in little bowls, plates, cauldrons, and saucepans. Everything I devoured was top-notch! Nothing tasted bland. Everything was flavorful! I ate and ate and ate until I couldn't eat anymore. That was how good Wicked Spoon was! I was in Vegas buffet heaven! I never knew the true meaning of gluttony until I came here. \n\nWicked Spoon was so good that I decided to come back the next day for lunch! I tried the following:\n\nYogurt parfait with berries\nBacon\nChicken apple sausage\nPineapple\nSmoked salmon with capers\nPancake\nCrab cake\nParmesan risotto\nEggs benedict\nChinese pork\nMiso soup\nSweet apple tart\nBlack forest cheesecake\n\nI was glad that some of the dishes that they served for lunch were different than dinner which meant that I got to try more dishes. The only thing that was missing at lunch were the King Crab legs. The buffet also didn't serve cr\xc3\xa8me brulee or crepe either.

S'We went on the 4th of July weekend and had brunch at Wicked Spoon in Cosmopolitan Casino/Hotel it was delicious.  The food was fresh and the portion was put in small plates, pots and bowls, so you just pick it up and put on your plates. I have tried many places in Vegas and this is the place that I will go back for sure. They also have the usual station like other hotels. We thought the price would be expensive because the hotel look fabulous and elegant, but it was reasonable compare to other hotels which cost more and the food is not that great.   We have also stop by M Resort before we got to Cosmopolitan Hotel because we have heard that the buffet was good, so we tried it out the food was not that great at all and the price is way to expensive.   So, just drive straight to Cosmopolitan Hotel and you will not be disappointed.'

S"I'm not a huge fan of buffets, but this is THE funnest buffet to dine at. I could not stop gushing about the cute dishware: chinese chicken wings in the mini fryer, meatballs in the tiny sauce pan,  gazpacho in glass cups. LOVE. You know food tastes better with good presentation and this place is not only yummy but pretty, some would say whimsical/cool/fun/quaint. You can get little bites of everything. They're like little packages of YUM and I love that there are different sections. I loved the asian section although the sushi wasn't spectacular. \n\nAlso, yes they have snow crab legs. They also have mussels with your choice of butter like mango butter or lime butter (made when you order). But even better, they have bone marrow (I just wish they served it with broth, maybe with some noodles and scallions which is how I love it best).\n\nThe dessert section has gelato!\n\nI would definitely come back."

S'I was expecting a lot from the Wicked Spoon after reading some of the reviews.  I would have been much better off going in blind, so to speak.  What was I expecting?  I was expecting a much bigger selection of food.  THE BUFFETT of buffetts.  That was my only gripe about the place.  I particularly liked the bone marrow with chimichurri on crackers, the prime rib, and the shrimp.  Mmmm shrimp.  As for the dessert, you have got to try the salted peanut caramel (?) gelato!  One of the best combinations of salty, sweet, creamy ever created by man!!!'

S"You only wish you had 4 stomachs like a cow entering this place. Probably the best buffet I've tasted in my life. Very spacious and lots of different varieties of food available. Pretty much my idea of a gourmet buffet paradise. \n\nAfter doing much research of all the buffets was the best - reviews have told me it was this one. While I have not tried the other ones in Vegas to compare, this did not disappoint in the least bit. If I come here again, I will definitely come visit this place again. \n\nI was so bloated here I could not move for 1.5 hours afterwards. At the same time, the food was so good I could not seem to stop eating.\n\nSome tips:\n- more expensive on holiday occassions, so make sure to come on a weekday not falling on their holiday pricing (it's about $10 more than regular on special dates)\n- go during brunch time (you don't want to be bloated and you can walk off the carbs in the day)\n- don't go for the asian food (eg. sushi, Chinese food - that's not what its known for here so obviously it can't really compare)\n- nice portions of everything allowing you to try everything, so remember to diversify what you choose (sharing is a good way to try things without overeating)\n- order water or juice (pop or alcohol will fill you up faster)\n- don't go for all the starchy foods! (remember to eat salads and fruit in between to help you eat more)\n\nGO FOR: their roasts, they slice it up when you request it and it is DELISH; fruits (very fresh and you'll need it in between everything you eat, they have blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, etc.); add some salads (they come in small portions and are very refreshing after lots of meat and carbs); SAVE ROOM FOR THEIR MASSIVE DESSERT SELECTION (you won't regret it)"

I like how they keep it warm instead of cold like other buffets. Our server was good at keeping our table clear of dishes. I did not like their soup of the day since it tastes like plain unseasoned soup. Their miso soup was too salty. I do like their chocolate covered strawberries :) and the way they present their food was very cute! The salt and the pepper are not on the table, you have to ask for it -__-"

S'Based on breakfast/brunch:\n\nWHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO EAT HERE?!\n\nWhen it comes to buffets, it\'s mostly misses to me. Other than the Wynn buffet, no other buffet has made me take more than 2 trips (2 plates) for food. But this evil little place had me up and about 4 friggin times! Now granted I didn\'t eat everything that I took back to my table. I just mainly sampled and put it aside if it wasn\'t to my liking. Once again, if you have a problem with that, read my review for the Wynn Buffet and then you can shut up about it. \n\nAnyways... they don\'t have a huge selection of food, but the food they do offer is scrumptious and the presentation is seriously unrivaled. Foods have their own little container/pot/serving. I\'m assuming for aesthetics, but it\'s also great for me cause there\'s some kind of portion control. Instead of grabbing two ladles of mac&cheese, you just grab a mini sized pot of it. Very smart, Wicked Spoon. Very smart. \n\nMy favorite part was their Nutella gelato. If you follow my reviews, y\'already know how much I cry for Nutella. So please believe I had two cups of that chocolatey nutty goodness. *drool*\n\nIt\'s weirdly decorated. Well it\'s supposed to look "wicked." They definitely accomplished that. Everything was set off with an orange backdrop of light. Tis a plus in my books seeing how I\'m from the bay and my boys, SF GIANTS, just won the WS so bonus mothaeffin points. \n\nPs. I believe you are entitled to a free mimosa. Free drank? Yes, please. \n\nTIP: If buffet\'s aren\'t really your thing, they do have a to-go option here. I believe it\'s about $16 and they give you a fatty ass container and a free bottled water, you stuff as much food as you can in the box, and go on your merry way. I haven\'t done it myself, but my friends have and they seemed quite pleased (and full). \n\nI will most definitely come back for lunch or dinner. Can\'t wait to get fat.'

S'Very good buffet in the hip and classy Cosmopolitan Hotel. A wide selection of food with many served what they call "tapas" style. Which means served in small pots.\nThe area was spacious, well laid out and decorated. Most of the food was quite gourmet. The stand outs for me was the mushroom soup (excellent), prime rib, assorted fish and chicken dishes, gelato (excellent), chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate covered marshmallows. The one disappointment was the chicken fried steak. One of the top five buffets in Vegas. Dinner price was $34.99.\n\nWOULD I GO BACK? Absolutely.'

EVERYTHING was gourmet.  I almost recommend not eating the entire day before going because it's so overwhelming how much good food there is.  \n\nHighlights:\nWild Boar Sloppy Joe Sliders\nBeef Tongue Sheppard's Pie (my favorite)\nGnochhi\nWaldorf Salad\nEvery single dessert\nFried Chicken\nMashed Potatoes\n\nI'd even recommend working out hard before going to build up your appetite and prepare to calorie-load haha."

S"From all the hype I've heard about this place I was pretty disappointed when I actually ended up eating here for lunch. The presentation of the food is definitely amazing. But it isn't amazing enough to make up for the mediocrity of the food itself. The food is...average. Most of the food was overcooked/dry/poorly seasoned. Yea there is more variety here than most, but I feel like they focus more on quantity/visual appeal than the quality of food itself. But it is a good experience so I would recommend trying it at least once, but I probably wouldn't eat there again. Although I've come to accept that regardless of the price, buffets are buffets, so you can't really expect too much out of the food quality. \n\n **I just have a weak spot for the cute individual servings they have here. Especially the little fryer baskets the fried chicken comes in...the fried chicken itself is meh. That's the only reason I'd probably eat here again. **\n\nI don't know, headed to Vegas again this weekend so maybe I'll decide to give it a second chance...maybe...this or the Wynn."

This is what they serve at breakfast...\nPancakes & french toast - perhaps my favorite french toast of all time. I despise the dry bread dipped in egg most places like to call french toast- this is decadent and delightful- offered with honey butter, whipped cream, syrup and powdered sugar. I even got creative on my next round and poured the special pineapple banana berry juice as syrup! Yum\nEggs Benedict- one with braised beef and the other with smoked salmon. Imagine my surprise when the English muffin was actually toasty and not a soft piece of mush! Score, again! \nStandard omelette bar.\nCarving station- roast beef, ham, sausage, and bacon!!! A slab of bacon. Only needed a taste since it was pretty epic, again, fun little touch.\nSpeaking of fun touches, everyone mentions the individual sized pots with macaroni and cheese, gnocchi, risotto with saffron, creamed corn & polenta. I loved the polenta with mushrooms! There's pizza, too.\nThere's a salad bar station, yes with both Caesar salad and blue cheese wedge! Individual servings, so great!\nThere's smoked salmon and bagels, cured meats, beets with truffle oil, fruits, etc.\nThere's an entire Asian station with 5 spice pork, teriyaki chicken.\nSushi, noodles, fried rice, shrimp, \nThe desserts were all super special. Each looked like a special piece of art. \nThe mango cake was amazing, the chocolate covered strawberries were the best I've ever had, the gelato was creamy I tried 4 scoops in one tiny bowl. And I thought the presentation of the lava cake and cobblers were special too. Get a scoop of vanilla to go with those :)\nFor $27 you also get juice, tea and coffee.\n$39 includes bottomless mimosa, champagne or Bloody Mary."

S"Wicked Spoon can stand up to the best buffets in Vegas.  A long-time fan of the Bellagio and Wynn buffets, I was worried Wicked Spoon was all flash and no substance.  I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nSmall plates are all the rave at Wicked Spoon.  Creative showmanship, like tiny fry baskets with chicken wings, make for a fun presentation and ensure you aren't over-eating.  Plan on making several trips so you can truly get a taste for every item. The atmosphere is fun and fresh, the exact opposite of your typical feeding frenzy buffet.  \n\nI had the brunch buffet, with fresh squeezed OJ, exceptional french toast, and bottomless bloody mary drinks.  I made my way through mouth watering short ribs and homemade sausages, and enjoyed an impressive spread.  Usually I skip the dessert items (or end up being disappointed by the phoned-in offerings), but Wicked Spoon really delivers here.  Their gelato was smooth, creamy, and worth the wait in the small line (The line is what drew me - people waiting in line for ice cream at a buffet seemed out of the ordinary).\n\nFor brunch, there's no better place to spend your money in Vegas.  I'd still look for Bacchanal or Bellagio for dinner, but Wicked Spoon gets my 5 stars for Sunday Mornings in style!"

They have just about the right amount so I think the buffet is definitely worth trying.  They need to add a little flare to their menu though.  I'll come back in 6 months maybe; see if there is any changes.  Good thing is, there is not wait!  One thing they should add: a better seafood selection, like some crab legs, fresh raw oysters, and clams!"

It's not like any other buffet i've ever been to, food wise.  \n\nI looked this place up because I wanted bone marrow.  How great is it that I can find bone marrow in a buffet, and I don't have to go to either a French restaurant or a steak joint for it?!\n\nI love that everything is portioned controlled.  Yeah, it would suck to be their dishwasher and you may only be able to fit 4 ramekins worth of food onto your plate but you won't look like a Fat Assssss for sure (unless you've got awesome balance and a waitressing background and can carry 4 or 5 plates to your seat like ME). \n\nThey have food that I've never seen in any other buffets:\n\nBone marrow - my dad actually makes it better but this was still tasty and I could go back for eighths if I wanted.\n\nFried oysters - YUM!\n\nLobster risotto - YUM!\n\nsupertenderandohsodelicious Short ribs - YUM!\n\nothertenderporkwithcollardgreens - YUM!\n\nKorean short ribs - YUM!\n\nPrimerib sliders - you get the idea!\n\nand like, a shit ton of other YUM! stuff (sushi, pizza, asian fares, bread and cheeses, pitas with hummus or tabouli, salads, tapas type foods, a carving station, full dessert bar).  \n\nTheir gelato in the dessert section alone is worth it.  And it's not even just the usual boring strachiatella or chocolate flavors, they have blood orange, raspberry, strawberry and balsamic.  I died and went to heaven.\n\nOn a side note, a lot of the food was rich in that there is a lot of fat, cream, cheese, fried in oil, type of foods there.  All delicious, of course and not in a McDonalds number 1 kind of way, but lactose intolerant folks and those who worry about the size of their thighs, BEWARE.\n\nYes, Yelp, I *AM* a fan!

S"This is not your typical Vegas buffet. This is a foodie paradise! If you're looking for AYCE crab legs and sashimi, unfortunately you won't find it here. But if you're looking for something fun and new, you're in the right place!  I came for Sunday brunch $29 (which includes one complimentary glass of champagne), and opted to add in bottomless mimosas for an additional $8. \n\nFor brunch, there was an omelet making section, as well as a fully functioning carving station that included prime rib, ham, bacon, and lamb. (The carving station came prepared with all the different sides&condiments needed). They also had pancakes&waffles, benedicts,  meat&cheeses, lots of different soups&salads, pastas, sushi (california rolls, eel rolls, tempura rolls), kalbi, and more. I would describe all their dishes as very well thought out and made wtih much attention to detail, unlike other buffets where food is just mass produced. They also have an amazing dessert section that probably beats out any/all vegas buffets - love the gelato station! \n\nStand out items I had during brunch:\n- Eggs benedict\n- Chicken Apple sausage\n- Creamed Corn\n- Butternut Squash Ravioli\n- toffee/chocolate covered strawberries\n- lots&lots of gelato\n\nNot bad was also the pumpkin pancakes, the chicken pate, seafood salad, kalbi, spicy kimchi chicken.  Most dishes come pre-served in their individual pots&pans/bowls&plates. No item was bad. Service was great! Though drinks did lag, many in our party got bottomless mimosas free of charge.

S"Wicked Spoon, like the Cosmopolitan Hotel it is housed in, is a welcome breath of fresh air in the culinary buffet scene.  While buffets like Wynn and Bellagio have long dominated, Wicked Spoon does things entirely differently....and succeeds.  It is easily the best new buffet in years.\n\nFor $29 ($37 with unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, and champagne), the weekend brunch presents the following:\n\n- selection of cooked items across more ethnic cuisines than any other buffet can match.  Fried chicken, korean short ribs, Vietnamese Shaking Beef, Thai curry, and dim sum to name a few.\n\n- excellent presentation and an attention to flavorful and delicious food, not just quantity\n\n- the best dessert selection of any buffet.  Rather than soft serve ice cream like many places, they have a full on gelato bar here.  Wow.\n\n- Prime Rib, slab bacon, linguica, Rack of Lamb, and Prime Rib Bone are just a sampling of the excellent carving station\n\n- more high-end pasta dishes and artfully presented in small metal pots than I've seen anywhere.  If you like pasta or carbs, Wicked Spoon will clearly win you over.  Gnocci, butternut squash ravioli, Smoked Mac and Cheese and Cavatelli are among the top choices.  \n\n- great salad and fruit bar, again with innovative and new items like gazpacho puree, blt salads, endive salads, and dipped strawberries that look more like a high end restaurant than a buffet\n\nThe only thing keeping Wicked Spoon from 5 stars and possibly not clearly being the top buffet in Vegas is the following:\n\nSushi - California and spicy tuna rolls.  No nigiri, no other rolls, and no sashimi\n\nSeafood - they had cocktail shrimp and smoked salmon, but no crab legs, jumbo prawns (Aria, Bellagio), or lobster claws or any other notable seafood\n\nSoups - could only find a miso soup.  Missed the rice porridge from Bellagio (for the Asian high rollers) and other soup options.  \n\nOverall, I was thrilled with the value and the variety of Wicked Spoon.  I will clearly be coming here again, but for true seafood lovers, I can see them liking Bellagio, Wynn, or Sterling more.  Nonetheless, while not every item was great, so many things were done right and so differently that Wicked Spoon will be one to bookmark for a long time.\n\nWicked Spoon accepts credit cards, including American Express.\n\nMy Buffet Rankings:\n1) Westin at the Bund, Shanghai - $60/person and an excellent selection of sashimi, seafood, roasted suckling pig and fresh hand tossed Chinese noodles.  \n2) Hakone, Oahu - all-you-can eat toro, uni, kobe beef, and amaebi, $60/pp.  \n3) Sushi House Goyemon, Las Vegas - great nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked appetizer and dessert selection for an unbelievable $26/pp.\n4) Navio at The Ritz Carlton - only down a slot secondary to the astronomical price ($88/price) but made up for with a spectacular view, top notch service and great food.  \n5) Wicked Spoon, Las Vegas - great cooked selection, variety, and high end presentation.  Unmatched desserts and gelato. $29/pp\n6) Bellagio, Las Vegas - congee, prime rib, shrimp/crab, sushi $35/pp"

S"Don't usually eat at buffets just because I am such a waste of money every time I go. Either I continuously eat the cheapest not worth it item at buffets or I just don't eat enough! Wicked Spoon was a buffet I had been wanting to try because everyone that goes to Vegas raves about this place! \n\nWe came here on a Sunday and the wait wasn't too bad. Since we came with such a big party, we had to pay all these tips and crap which probably made the cost about $30iish per person? \n\nThe seating arrangements here are spacious and there are event private dining rooms. Like any ordinary buffets there are different stations offering a variety of dishes. This buffet knows how to tempt you into eating everything because everything is plated so nicely. I didn't like everything....I swear I got so many things, took a bite, and then dumped it. My fave items are actually in this photo: \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=r1S_vDd_m9Kg2Mdr1qSeKQ&userid=pmKnNkGVgzhMkwJaTU5apA\nYUMS to the yogurt and fried chicken. Such an odd combo but I had aboue 3 cups of that yogurt! It was just so addicting because it wasn't too sweet, and I felt healthy. \n\nThe Mac & cheese was really good too! I hated the pork belly buns though. I love pork belly buns, but after you've had it 5 star style elsewhere, going to Wicked Spoon for these buns just didn't meet up to that expectation. A lot of the foods here just looked better than it tasted. Kinda sad. \n\nI was going to give this place 3 stars, until I came across the gelato station! After I saw the Thai Tea Gelato, I was AUTOMATICALLY giving this place 4 stars. WTF THAI TEA? The last time I had Thai Tea flavored ice cream was in SF and they got rid of it....so I have been on the hunt for something like this....and it ends up being in Wicked Spoon?! WOW. The macaroons and other desserts didn't look as tasty as this gelato. It was so yummmmmmy I could've eaten more but I had portion control. \n\nBesides the average tasting food, I do give this place props for serving food nicely and maintaining such a pretty environment !"

The wait wasn't even a big deal (they seat first come first serve, not by party size, so we waited for almost an hour for a table for 2). The food selection was very large and impressive, but the actual taste of the food was so mediocre. I give them kudos for all the cool unique combinations and fusions they came up with (Sriracha watermelon, anyone?) However, most of the other dishes were just too salty or spiced an incorrect amount. (Avoid the Chinese food, if you can even call it that). \n\nIn the end, I filled myself up with the mushroom pasta, which came in a cool metal ladle, and the steak. The rest of the items were just disappointing. \n\nThe dessert selection, I will admit, is amazing. Most of the dessert items I tried were quite good. \n\nI wouldn't go back for the price of $41/person."

My group of 8 got there around 5:30 with little to no line! Yayyy! However, they charged us 18% gratuity on top of the $35 cost for the buffet. So we paid about $44 for this place. \n\nNow if I'm paying that much for the a buffet, I at least expect some decent service. Our hostess took our bill and said they would set up our table. We waited.. and waited.. and waited. No one came back for us for at least 20 minutes. There were obviously open tables everywhere throughout the restaurant, yet we haven't been seated yet. It was ridiculous. We even saw our table set up but no one had come for us. Finally, we had to flag down our hostess and she took us to our table, apologizing that she 'forgot' about us or thought someone had taken care of it. UGHHHHH!\n\nEven after we sat down, throughout the night, our waiter was kind of inattentive and MIA. We had to flag him down several times to get our drink orders and didn't look so happy to be here. I mean, yeah, we already paid 18% gratuity, but it was just ridiculous... tsk tsk Wicked Spoon. I don't endorse that message. \n\nBut besides the service, the food does save my review. The prime rib was bomb and the assortment of hot dishes were great. I enjoyed the Asian section a lot, per usje. Loved that there was a DIY Mac n Cheese station. Love that cheesiness. My favorite part of the buffet was the dessert bar! 16 flavors of gelato/ice cream, cheesecake, bread pudding, chocolate cake, chocolate-dipped strawberries. The list goes on and on. \n\nAlso, it's quite a walks away from the entrance to the Cosmopolitan on the strip. Just follow the hanging signs and the buffet is located on the second floor of the hotel. There are escalators you take to it. Enjoy the pretty lights and chandeliers as you walk through the hotel!\n\nWicked Spoon has some wickedly good food and desserts, but seriously? The service was appalling for a place of this calibur. Maybe next time!"

S"Wicked Spoon is the newest buffet on the Strip, located in the Cosmopolitan. The interior design matches the rest of the casino -- modern, chic, and sophisticated. The food has that same style. This definitely ain't your grandma's buffet.\n\nUnlike many buffets in town the food isn't presented in huge troughs that you dig into to serve yourself. Here everything comes pre-plated for individual servings. Although they do have several carving stations scattered about. The food that is pre-plated is served on small square plates, or small pots and pans that make it all look more upscale than your typical buffet.\n\nNot only does the food look good, much of it tastes good. Here are some of the hits and misses.\n\nHITS\n- Steak w/ chimichurri sauce: tender strips of meat cooked to about medium or medium rare. Delicious\n- Huevos rancheros: a single, lightly fried tortilla folded in half and filled with ground beef (I think?) with a fried egg on top. Tasty.\n- French toast: stuffed with cinnamon apples and walnuts. mmmm.\n- Short rib pasta: small chunks of boneless beef short rib with pasta and mushrooms. One of the best dishes of the day (along with the steak).\n- Kalbi beef: savory, sweet and delicious\n- Mashed potatoes: creamy, rich and buttery\n- Fried shrimp balls: not the best, but not bad\n- Mussels: like the shrimp balls, not bad, but not great. \n- Desserts: there were plenty of desserts but I only grabbed a few to taste. Among the standouts were a pecan tart, key lime tart, chocolate covered strawberries, and gelato. The tiramisu wasn't bad. They all looked spectacular and many were topped off with what looked like gold leaf, which was a nice touch.\n\nMISSES\n- Risotto: one bite was enough for me. Funky taste and too mushy\n- Sushi: I've never had good sushi at a buffet. I don't know why I ever bother. There was a California roll and a spicy tuna roll that were average at best.\n- Desserts: not all desserts were good. I tried some sort of chocolate tart which was dry and bland and there was some sort of parfait-looking thing with chocolate, raspberries, and some sort of crunchy stuff that tasted off.\n\nThere were plenty of other dishes that looked good but i just didn't have room to eat any more. The individual chicken pot pies looked good, as did the shrimp, stuffed pork loin, mini sandwiches, and what looked like chili.\n\nThe biggest negative about the place was that there weren't any signs indicating what the food was. So, I had to ask the employees. All the employees were incredibly friendly -- from the cashiers to the waiters and buss boys to the kitchen staff. Everyone was eager to answer questions and were genuinely excited about the new hotel. Our waiter was probably a little too friendly, as he spent most of his time talking to people and very little time getting our drinks.\n\nI'm not sure how much the lunch prices or dinner prices are because we got there at 10:55 am and they charged us the breakfast price ($16 ea.). But, I'm sure it saved us a few dollars.\n\nWhile I still think the Bellagio and M Resort buffets are slightly better, Wicked Spoon isn't far behind. I do think it's better than other buffets I've been to (the Wynn, Red Rock, Palms, and Rio)."

Everything was so delicious, the cheesecake was unbelievable, and the waiter and waitress's were very nice. The price is a bit expensive but what so you expect, it's Las Vegas. I believe the quality of food makes up for the price. It's one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. If I find myself in Las Vegas again, I'll make it a priority to eat there everyday for lunch"

S"I really can't believe how badly off the mark the Yelp reviews are for this place. After waiting 2 hours (!), we were seated in a less than full dining room, where it took another 20 minutes to get one of the all-you-can-drink Bloody Marys that came as part of our buffet. The food? Don't remind me. The pastas were gummy, the meats were gristly, and what minor amounts of seafoods were out were overcooked and tasted off. We started in line at 11, thinking that was plenty of time for brunch, but got in close to 2, which meant nothing was fresh and the dinner foods hadn't been put out. \n\nBottom line:  I would have had more luck putting a 100 bucks into the slots, and I'd feel a whole lot less screwed over."

S'I definitely have mixed feelings about this buffet after coming here for lunch with the lady.\n\nWICKED DISLIKES:\n\nI found the carving station...seriously LACKING for a carnivore. Marrow...and bacon...and sausages...with a "chef" that tells people to wait all the time to the point that people grab stuff themselves? What a joke. [Look, I\'m not complaining that there is no prime rib or slow cooked ribs or a rack of awesome hotness being unavailable...it\'s pretty sad for a meat carving section when I pass by more than 10 times to find the "chef" cleaning his area like he has OCD because he has nothing to serve]\n\nSalad and greens...where are thee? You are missing just like the meat in the meat section! Little-overkill-on-the-dressing-Caesars-salad-in-a-bowl is the only leafy green available?\n\nChinese food...OMFG...you fall under the definition of CRAP. The packaging, which used mini-Chinese-paper-take-out-little-boxes was freaking awesome though.\n\nKorean BBQ [their version of galbi]...easily has the highest turnover for any meat at the buffet since I\'m sure people are trying to get their meat fix one way or the other and have been clearing this mound of meat within 1 min after the "chef" piles it on...well, tastes NASTY [overmarinated, 50-60% fat...just saying]\n\nWICKEDLY AWESOME:\n\nSteamed clams. You\'ll find these beauties in a bowl...lusciously presenting the inner-selves to you with hints of tomatoes and garlic. This became my staple dish during lunch here...and I RAIDED that section (with the assistance of the lady as well)...they put 20 out, we grab 5 bowls...GANGNAM STYLE. It wasn\'t long before the "chefs" got the hint that their clams were a hit at 2 pm and replenished it repeatedly all the way to closing time.\n\nNow here\'s the thing that prevented me from DINGING the crap out of this place when it\'s priced on average higher than most other buffets...\n\nIt seems like Wicked Spoon Buffet forgot to add one word to their name and that is DESSERTS.\n\nI don\'t even eat DESSERTS. I remind most people that I don\'t care about DESSERTS. But I found myself eating a LOT of DESSERT here.\n\nWICKING VERDICT:\n\nDefinitely not a meat-eaters paradise...as this place was created for you freaking SUGAR ADDICTS.'

S'Maybe because Bachannal buffet is so above and beyond, having high hope for the almost equally praised Wicked Spoon, I am fairly disappointed.\n\nTo compare with Bachannal, the pluses are\n- some deserts are slightly better.  Macarons were not available at Bachannal\n- the BBQ and grilled meat, quality and selections are better than Bacchanal.  \n- no one rubbing elbows with you in competition for crab legs \n- more vegetarian dish selections\n\nThe minuses and misunderstandings\n- seafood selections are much better at Bachannal.  They got raw oysters, generous selections of bigger sized peeled shrimps.  While Wicked Spoon has seared salmon, Bachannal has seared sea bass.  Is it not at least a step up or what?\n- I came to Wicked Spoon because I thought they serve smaller portions on all the food and in exchange I had high hope for quality.  This is where my most disappointment is.  In fact, majority of the food is still served just like any other buffets and not much better quality.\n- the desert selections and quality is another disappointment.  They actually reminds me of buffet on a mediocre Carnival cruise buffet, the arrangements are messy. (except the Macarons.). What I thought is so funny are the raspberry chocolate mousse, they put printed raspberries on top the mousse.  Come on!'

S"I have tried just about all buffets in Las Vegas and I know the good ones from the bad ones!\n\nHere are the pros...great customer service, great ambiance, descent food, cute way of packaging food items (see pictures through Yelp), interesting and intriguing desserts.\n\nHere are the cons...expensive prices for what they offer (they raised the prices effective the date I went on June 14, 2013).  Lunch is $26 and kid's lunch is $16.  Not all the food is great.  Desserts are overrated!\n\nI personally believe that everyone should try this place at least once.  The style and layout are unique and intriguing.  I talked with one of the managers named Nicholas, who told me that this buffet is the first place to put items in individual containers.  Nicholas also told me that Cesar's Palace and Aria buffets have copied this style.\n\nStay away from the Asian noodles, which tasted really poor in quality.  The sweet potato dish lacked flavor.  The pizzas were doused with salt.  My personal favorite item was the braised beef dish.\n\nThe food did NOT wow me at all and there are tons of buffet places with better quality food.  Besides the food, everything else about this place wowed me, but I did not come to pay $88 for my family to be wowed by customer service and decor.  Its all about the food and I think this place lacks good quality.  My wife and I agree that half the dishes are good and half the dishes are bad.  That is 50%, which means the price should be at $13.  We will never be back, but it was definitely worth at least trying once in a lifetime.\n\nThe location of the buffet is tucked away on the 2nd floor in the way back of the casino.  I believe as a result of this, the buffet will fail to thrive and they will keep raising prices to compensate for this.  I also think the cuteness of the way the dishes are packaged will die off and more people will enjoy going to Cesar's and Aria buffets more."

S"not a huge buffet person. People always want to eat buffets in Vegas and its the same mediocre crap shoveled into a tray left under a heating lamp till refilled.\n\nWicked spoon was our 2nd buffet of the trip and I was a little unenthusiastic over the thought of more crap food in large quantities.\n\nWicked spoon is a GREAT buffet. Probably the best I've ever been to. Service was pure crap and I never got my ginger ale but whatever. The food is served on little individual dishes perfect for a small tasting so you don't fill up your plate and stomach with bleh food.\n\nI definitely suggest checking this place out. The food is actually delicious, its cheaper than bellagio buffet and the atmosphere is like a real restaurant. Also the chefs behind the food are helpful and extremely friendly (gluten allergies)"

Julia was our waitress the first day and she treated us so well we requested her again the second day. The chocolate covered strawberries are a must but they don't come out until 11am. There is a 2 hr limit from when you order your first mimosa until they will stop refilling you. So go at 9:30 or later to make sure you can enjoy your champagne and eat chocolate covered strawberries :)"

S"Let me first state that, even though I'm a fat chick, I am not a fan of buffets.\nI find them common, over done and nothing really new.  \nSo finding myself stuck at the Cosmo for the HP CES Press conference and my son starving we decided to go to the buffet for a late lunch.  \nI really wasn't expecting much because of the afore mentioned aversion to buffets and the lateness in the afternoon (almost 2pm) \n\nIt's nice, even at age 55, to be surprised.  We walked right in, and got a great seat.  It was busy but not overly crowded.  Our waiter was right there to take our drink orders and to let us know what stations were available. Having survived the 2nd day of CES, I rewarded myself with a mid day cocktail, the Mombo Italiano-- a hand crafted Bloody mary with infused garlic vodka  I'd go back JUST for the drink at 12.00 each. \n\nHere is what sets this particular buffet apart: \n\nThey have, for all of you watching your weight, portioned containers of very interesting food.  With little signs that say how many calories & how many carbs per portion.  Brilliant marketing since there are so many who fail to recognize they have fabulous curves.  I had the Mac & bleu cheese--yum and the wild rice with lamb and goat cheese.  \n\nThe carving stations.  yes multiple.  I could dive head first into the Asian style bbq pork.  It was melt in your mouth.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and made suggestions of what were their favorites.  \n\nI have to say, as I'm writing this realizing the best part of the 2x we've been there, was the staff.  I do like the food selections and the twist with the portioned servings... also made me exercise to walk back up and get another serving... knowing it was 220 calories each.  \n\nI did save room for dessert, a wide selection indeed.  Rice Crispy treats dipped in chocolate? yummo.  \n\nLiving in Vegas, it is only for out of town guests and work that I go anywhere near the strip but last week, with no company and no clients, we opted to actually go to the Wicked Spoon for lunch.  If nothing else, for a Vegas local, that says a lot."

S"So when two Filipinos end up near the strip deciding on lunch, it almost feels natural we'd end up at a buffet to nosh, sit and kill time. \n\nI think I will get to the strongpoints first:\n\nMEAT, especially pork dishes. Seriously, the steamship pork they were carving, miso glazed pork loin, char siu, pork belly steam buns were all tasty and perfectly cooked. Pork is usually a buffet fail, but these are juicy and perfectly cooked. The steamship with a bit of the onion marmalade and chimichurri was worth a 2nd carving. The other meats like the turkey, kalbi ribs and linguica was good too. If I just want to sit and gorge on meat, I would consider going here for $22 than go to a Brazilian rodizio for $40. \n\nSalad- I know, it's just an effing salad but buratta cheese with crushed pistachio served with frisee in red wine raspberry vinaigrette is a winner.\n\nGelato- plenty flavors and well made\n\nDecent- cured pepper salmon, cheeses, farro tabuleh, goat cheese roasted tomato salad, creamy polenta with mushrooms, pizza, clams in a stew (but they really should have just left them plain in butter since the clams were fresh but the sauce isn't good), already peeled shrimp cocktail. \n\nNow onto the fails- \n\nThe concept of little serving plates seem cute and different, but it simply doesn't work especially on the items they are doing. Covered or not, these are items that shouldn't sit so they really need to consider thats in them. They also seriously need to give you like a cafeteria tray. Two of them fill a plate. Risotto- seriously? Rice seizes into itself and gets mushy. Gnochi turns into a gummy mess like a mochi. Cappelli pasta looked mushy so I didn't even try. Mac n cheese got hard on the top. Seafood like poached cod was gross. \n\nDesserts were very pretty but some were spit out worthy. Gelato was the best thing there with plenty of flavors and good consistency. This little mousse chocolate cup was decent, the strawberries dipped in chocolate were sweet. I saw macarons with fruit and I was expecting them to not be great, but they were inedible. It tasted like the purple food coloring and rusted chlorinated water. Some desserts didn't even make fucking sense like a very tart mango puree with chocolate mouse and pearls and fruit jelly on top. This was where the majority of food wastage was since a lot of it wasn't any good. I rather have a big bowl of ugly looking bread pudding from Sams Town buffet than aesthetically pleasing but palette scaring desserts. \n\nService was alright. Plates didn't sit so long, but we didn't get many plates for the time we sat around. I like that they do give you water for the table since sometimes you just need something to drink and don't have anything. They weren't bad on the refills of my tea though. \n\nIt's not a buffet I would recommend for that pricepoint, but I suppose it wasn't terrible. I'm a pork meat person so the large amount of pork cooked right was a definite win. Maybe if I had tourist friends going there anyways, I wouldn't mind going, but I do not think it's a place I'd seek out."

Personal portion dishes (for example, a small basket of calamari or a small skillet of truffle mac n cheese) The dishes are very creative (so not your typical buffet food).

As we were waiting on line both times, we saw that there were plenty of empty tables -many of which had already been cleared and reset.

S'When my friends told me they wanted to eat at a buffet for dinner, I wasn\'t impressed, especially when they told me how much it would cost.\n\nBuffets are places you get bland average food at prices low enough to justify eating bland average food, right?  Not to mention you usually are left with the dregs whenever there\'s a good dish.\n\nWicked Spoon honestly is too good to deserve the word "buffet" in it\'s name.  \n\nYes, it IS a buffet, but a buffet where EVERYTHING they have is served in already prepared perfect portions, identical to each other.  Seriously, you don\'t need to scoop anything, because it comes it\'s it\'s own little pot or container which you just stick on your tray and go.  Amazing.\n\nBut the real shocker was how delicious everything was.  I went from annoyed that I\'d have to pony up for a lackluster overpriced dinner to disappointed that I wouldn\'t be able to eat here on a regular basis.\n\nEvery single solitary thing I had, and tried from everyone else\'s plate, was fantastic.  And they had SO many types of food.  Everything from cajun to chinese to italian to seafood to vegetarian dishes.  The individual portions seem slightly small until you realize it\'s that way on purpose so you don\'t get stuffed after eating 2 or 3 dishes, since you\'re going to want to eat EVERYTHING.  Oh believe me, I tried my hardest.\n\nIs it pricey?  Yeah, it is.  Is it worth it?  No question.  Some of the best food I\'ve had anywhere, all ready instantly, all prepared in a visually pleasing way.  Everyone loved sharing their dishes with everyone else.\n\nIf you\'re in Vegas, you should include Wicked Spoon in your dining plans.'

S"This is my second visit to wicked spoons. I have been here over a year ago and I thought the food was delicious and presentation was nice. I was so excited to go back and was VERY DISAPPOINTED in both the food quality, selection and SERVICE!! I was there for dinner, I paid at 6pm and had to wait in a line to be seated. The wait wasn't bad, was bout 20 minutes. We were seated and I went to see what was good. The only thing that appear good was the crab legs. I got about 5 pieces, the shrimp cocktail looked alittle leftover from lunch. There was no cut fruit, except banana and apple. The Asian food items were combine about 10 items. I tried couple of the items and walked around again and didn't see anything appealing and what I tasted wasn't good. I told my server I wasn't happy with the food and he called the manager. The manager said he can ask the Chef to make something. I honestly lost my appetite after 2 bits of bad food and I only had 30 minutes left cause I only had some time till my flight. \nI told the manager I only had 5 crab legs, 2 bits of some dish. He was quite rude saying I was here for a hour and could not refund my money, I was technically in the dining area for 40 minutes but I didn't barely ate anything. I didn't feel I was offered good service. I said I'm not happy the food and will be leaving. He just said okay because he DOES NOT care. I never complain in restaurants unless it's something BIG!! Sad to say, Cosmo does not care bout their customers...at least that is how they made me feel. \n\nAdvice: if you don't like something, make sure you complain within 15 minutes. Don't me like me to think to wait around for the server. \n\nSo disappointed!!! I left crying because the manager took 2 minutes to deal with me and  didn't care and made it KNOWN they do NOT care!! So go to the older hotels for a good buffet."

S"Dear Chef, please keep doing what you're doing now.  Don't succumb to the bad reviews...they are missing the point.\n\nThis is, by far, the BEST Vegas buffet I have ever been to...THE BEST!\nFor about $29 (tax included) you can eat at a pretty fancy restaurant -buffet style.  The food presentation was awesome.  The variety was unparalleled and unique.  This is some place I would love to take my parents to, and they don't like to eat at buffets very often because they feel gross in the end.  Seriously, where else can you get all-you-can-eat polenta, creamed corn, creamed spinach, potatoes with cheese and bacon, bone marrow, lamb, fresh berries, grapefruit & pomelo, those Chinese sticky rice tamale things, awesome deserts (my tiny key lime pie was lightly dusted with green limey powder, topped with some kind of red jelly and a gold flake) for under $30 in Vegas?  \n\nIf you want volume and stereotypical food from everywhere around the world, this is not the place for you.  But if you want to feel human instead of like a pig at the end of your buffet experience, then this is the place to go.\n\n[VISIT - Jan 30 2011, dinner]"

S"This was probably one of the best buffets I've ever eaten at, let alone in Las Vegas.  At $40 a pop with tax, it is quite expensive, but it was my dad's birthday, so we decided to splurge a little.  There are actually two lines here: one to pay and one to get seated.  Luckily on this Sunday (which happened to be Mother's Day), we didn't have to stand in line to pay, but we did wait about 20 minutes to get seated.  Not bad on a Sunday afternoon at a really good buffet!  Our server had this Texan accent and was a joy to have around.  He was very good about refilling waters and beverages and encouraged everyone to eat heartily and order any beverages in addition to the ones we already had.  \n\nNow on to the food...yum!  They had an omelette station with hardly a line and it was very filling.  They even offered prime rib as an option to add to your omelette!  The meat station had a good selection, and they offered everything from roast beef to Korean short ribs to pizza to crab legs (towards the  end of the lunch period), to eggs benedict, all which were very delicious.  The dessert bar even offered huge chocolate covered strawberries!  My only disappointment was that I couldn't eat more.  I probably ate about $35 worth of food, so it was almost worth it.  But for anyone who wants to eat at buffet and not be disappointed with the selection or service, Wicked Spoon is the place for you!"

It basically accounts for all the portions of food you get, which can allow you to keep a reminder on not overloading your plate.  It's also handy if you're on a diet and need to keep your food in check.\n\n...though if you're in Vegas, why would restrict yourself do a diet?  You're in Vegas, just give it up.\n\nWith that said, the food is excellent, the decor is wonderful.  And though it can be pricey, it is WORTH it."

S'The thing one should know about buffets in Vegas is that the best, cleanest ones are the ones that most recently opened. Wicked Spoon is the latest grand buffet, opened in The Cosmopolitan, so I would recommend going if you\'re looking for a buffet to dine in at Vegas.  I\'ve heard people rave about since it opened last year, especially about their dessert selection; so my friends and I decided to give it a go on our last day in Vegas. Overall, I thought the food selection was mediocre; although their dishes were well-portioned, organized and various. I really enjoyed that most of the food were portioned out into mini steel pots and pans, making the presentation quite appealing for a buffet meal. It also prevented your food selection from forming one congruent blob. \n\nWe visited during a weekday brunch, which is probably why I was a bit disappointed with the food selection (i.e. no king crab legs, lobster). The meat section looked very fulfilling, with the usual roasted lamb, prime rib, pork.  Their roasted personal lamb shanks looked quite juicy and scrumptious. They also had korean barbecue spare ribs, bulgolgi, which were apparently quite good. \n\nPersonally, as a pescetarian, the highlights for me were the:\n\n-Artisan salad bowls (mini bowls to be exact)-their salads were amazing, crafted with various cheeses, fruits, nuts and homemade dressings (including strawberry balsamic!)\n-Thai green curry clams \n-Classic french mussels\n-Baked salmon \n-Smoked salmon and caper pizza (their pizza are thin crust, strewn with loads of gourmet cheese and interesting combinations of ingredients)\n-Gnocchi: gnocchi is definitely not "fancy" food but I was impressed by its homemade texture\n-Taco station: pre-made soft shell tacos with 3 different flavors, and a myriad of condiments \n-DESSERTS GALORE, which includes huge chocolate covered strawberries, strawberry white chocolate fudge, countless french pastries, red velvet cookies, and most importantly---gelato!\n\nIt could possible that Wicked Spoon was overhyped, because I do not eat meat or went during a weekday lunch...but overall, I thought this buffet wasn\'t that impressive. I, however, did like the modern decorum of the buffet; it was much more spacious than the other buffets on the stip, and there were little no lines! Also, for 8 dollars more, you have the option of having bottomless mimosas and other fruit cocktails!'

Everything looked fantastic! I grabbed anything and everything, haha. I honestly really wanted to like this buffet, but Ithought the food was just mediocre. In fact - they were quite bland. There were indeed a few dishes that were quite tasty, but I'd say 80% of the food didn't even taste very seasoned..\n\nAs for dessert - the chocolate lava cake is a MUST have. It was AMAZING! I've also heard that the Wicked Spoon is known for their delicious macarons but I found them very dry! They only come out with two flavors at a time (except during Easter), so I was able to try their Raspberry and Orange(?) macarons but I thought the filling was too sour and was just not as good as I had expected. I had high hopes for this place but it was a disappointment.. don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible or anything, I just don't think it was all that great.

Nice!\n\nI like the individually portioned foods here.  Such as the tacos, gnocchi, mac-n-cheese, and cobblers.  Also, the abundance of fixings that I had pretty much an entire plate of antipasto fixings made this girl super happy!\n\nSome of the food was a miss, but as a buffet, it made it easier to accept because there was much more to choose from!  Though I wish there was someone there to serve the gelato from the bar when we stopped in.  Sad and no gelato for me.  Just stared at me from behind the bar.\n\nHaving been to the so-called best buffet at the Bellagio, I think Wicked Spoon wins in price, presentation and taste over that one!'

S'A solid buffet. It was my birthday so we decided to hit this place for brunch. I\'ve read and heard positive things about this buffet so I decided to give this place a whirl. They have mini pots of gourmet Mac and cheese, tapas inspired servings of everything, kalbi ribs, their mashed potatoes were excellent.   Their buffet is split up into a variety of food stations, a meat station, an asian station (with Japanese, Chinese and Korean) Mexican, "American station, a section for salads, Italian, seafood, and an anti pasti bar. They have bone marrow at their meat station, which I\'m not really into but everyone else seems to love. Had some sushi, wasn\'t particularly great but not bad either... they did have goat cheese panna  cotta, a  pretty tasty ceviche and mini crab knuckles, everything is served in teeny tiny bowls, which I appreciate... And I loved that they had a variety of kale and quinoa salads. They had a pretty dessert station but they didn\'t have macarons much to my chagrin. The pictures in yelp seem to show a bunch of different desserts, none of which were actually at the station. Sigh. I did have a good solid meal.... It\'s kind of pricey, but then what isn\'t in vegas? Def a great buffet- must visit when you\'re in town!'

S"This place is definitely a nice change in atmosphere in comparison to some of the other buffets in Vegas.  I love how the dining area is so nicely decorated and can accommodate to larger parties.  But anyways I'm sure people don't come here for the dining area. My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday and since I had read on yelp that the lines can be long we arrive about 10 min before 5pm (when it opens for dinner).  When we arrived there was about 10 parties in front of us but we were seated quickly.  The food was great and all the workers were very nice and helpful in choosing the dishes.  I hate to admit though that I think the Bellagio Buffet's food is better quality, but the Wicked Spoon's Desserts do kick butt!  I'm a big meat eater and I felt like their carving stations lacked in quality.  Also they have a lot of fillers and food with high carbs.  Not to say that is not expected at buffets but it would be nice if they had a better selection of meats.  One thing I can't deny them of is their dessert bar.  They have a great arrangement of pastries, gelato, cookies, etc. My favorites had to be the Chocolate Covered Strawberries and the Red Velvet White Chocolate Chip Cookies!  Definitely worth trying, ENJOY!"

I loved how everything was plated as individual portions, it made it really easy to share and sample everything. The prime rib was cooked to perfection, I couldn't help going back for more. Everything was delicious and the experience was pleasant.

S'I am not generally a buffet person, but as they say, "when in Vegas"....\n\nBeing the good yelper that I am, I did a lot of research on the important subject of "buffets" before my latest trip to Vegas.  Everyone has their own opinion as to which is the best, but Wicked Spoon looked the most unique to me.\n\nSince it was a holiday weekend, the dinner price was $47.99. I was kind of expecting to get some extras because of the holiday, but it appeared to be the usual fare.  What I found disappointing about the buffet, was that it does not have nearly the selection that I thought it would. It was large for a standard buffet, but I felt it was small for a Vegas buffet.  I have read that the carving station is the best part of this buffet, but I majorly disagree.  The sausage had a weird flavor, the ribs were very dry, and so was the prime rib.  We came early in the evening, so maybe they bring a larger selection of meat out later on...\n\nMy highlights were the salads, the poke, the gnocchi and the desserts.  The food is all presented really well, but that doesn\'t matter if it doesn\'t taste good!  The exception is the dessert, it looks and tastes good.  I was told they have a famous pastry chef on staff, and you can tell.  Save room for the gelato!'

S"The first time I came here was for lunch and I wasn't impressed. However, when I came back during another trip for dinner, I was much happier. While it is annoying that all their individual servings come in all these mini pots/platters/bowls that end up monopolizing your valuable plate real estate, I do appreciate the effort to make everything special. On this particular trip I really liked the cook-to-order seafood station where I got some delicious clams. If there are stations like that when you go, definitely take advantage of it and get in line before the rush!\n\nTip: Go right in the middle of the afternoon when they open for dinner. Beware that they close for about an hour between lunch and dinner service so don't show up during that gap. I believe it's around 3-4 or something. Having an early dinner at 4ish is great because you can take your time, it won't be too crowded, and you can digest somewhat before hitting the clubs at night."

Lots of individual servings, cute little skillet pans and large carving stations for meats. Tons of fresh fruit, salads, breads, bfast foods, chinese food station and desserts galore. The chocolate covered strawberries had heath bar chunks on them! YUUUM! I liked our server, she was really observant, refilled everything as soon as we got empty and noticed a chair at the other table was missing from a table due to a lazy hostess. mmm... did I mention the gelato selection? I got biscotti flavor right after I ate a fortune cookie with a very Vegas message (something about being the middle spoon rather than the big or little spoon), my gelato tasted like the ice cream version of the fortune cookie I just had! I wish I had the appetite to try a little of everything. The polenta was super rich, creamy, buttery; a little too much for me. The butternut squash ravioli was a little too dry from sitting out.

This place gets an extra star for it being only 29 bucks for dinner which is a lot cheaper than what you'd think it'd be with other buffets going for 50 a head. This place is very unique as far as buffets go in that the food is portioned out into little trays, to-go boxes, and pots. It's a very clever idea so that there isn't as much food wasted. The food here isn't as fancy as some of the other big buffets but there is still a lot to choose from which was very tasty. They have all types of foods from Asia, to Italy, to French. One of my favorite plates was the truffle potatoes which was full of flavor and delicious. The desserts here are also a highlight as they have their own gelato area which has over 10 flavors.

S'Hands down, best buffet I have ever eaten at!  I had read so many great reviews that my wife and I decided to go for our anniversary dinner.  A buffet for an anniversary?  We are simple people who enjoy amazing food.  The price was right at $35 each and from what I had heard, the food was great.  We got here at 5 p.m. right when it opened for dinner so there was no line.  The first thing I noticed was the excellent cheese, bread, meat, and salad section.  I love a good cheese plate and I was able to make an amazing one of my own from what they had to offer.  The Caesar, BLT, and Beet salads were awesome and perfectly portioned in the little dishes.  One thing that I knew I had to try was the Bone Marrow.  I had never had it before and the gentleman at the meat station was kind enough to give me a quick bone-marrow-eating-lesson.  Delicious!  Besides the Gnocchi, every single thing I had here was incredibly awesome!  General Tsao Chicken, Braised Short Rib w/ Pasta, Potatoes w/ Truffle Oil, etc., etc.  My wife was stuffed full but could not stop eating/raving about this little chocolate cake drizzled with caramel sauce.  Needless to say, dessert was pretty great as well.  This was a great experience and we have to go back.  We have to go baaaack!'

S'Inebriated, yes. However, I think the selection is as playful as a buffet will get with the food. There is actual presentation with individual pots, dishes, etc. which adds to the appeal in my opinion. I like how you can only fit a max of 5 things which keeps you going back. I like it because it feels as if you\'re eating a personalized plate as opposed to cramming as much food as you can so your lazy ass doesn\'t have to waddle back. I LOVED the leek bread pudding. I wish they served king crab legs as opposed to snow but beggars can\'t be choosers. Oh yeah, the dessert was delicious. There was a cup of passion fruit and chocolate that I absolutely loved. I wish I tried everything. You probably want to avoid the "Asian" section. Subpar and salty. Though sushi is buffet-esque if you know what I mean. Show me a buffet that does sushi legit (besides of course an AYCE sushi place).'

S"I would say it's a pretty damn overrated buffet. I honestly wasn't impressive with anything at this place except the awesome gelato section in this buffet. That was the only thing that I would think about if i ever coming here again. First of all I would say that this place is kind of hard to find because it's hidden somewhere in the cosmopolitan and that was a big uhhhh to me. 2nd of all why do you have to pay when you're in line? It doesnt make sense because what if you wanna get out of the line bc you're sick of waiting so it makes absolutely no sense why you would have to wait in line and pay. 3rd of all if i was gonna pay $45(including tax)  then i could just go to jaleo again for a nice delicious, interesting fancy dinner. \n\nHonestly the hot food really wasn't that great and the only reason why i went all out was because i had to make the money by eating all these prime ribs and crab legs. They weren't delicious but if i was gonna make up for my 45 dollar i have to go all out. \n\nBUT I DO REMEMBER there was one awesome thing about the place besides the gelato and that was the excellent service we got from our waiter. I thought our waiter was extremely patient for a party of 11 people. He always had a smile on and he was really nice when he was pouring our drinks and such. Props to the waiter! \n\nREGARDLESS i don't recommend coming here...it really wasnt that amazing"

S"My high school friends and I came to Vegas during the holidays just cause. After being in Vegas countless times, I wanted to try a new place. The Wynn, Harrah's, Monte Carlo, and other buffets were tiring, and I wanted to try something new.\n\nOne of my friends pointed out the buffet at the Cosmopolitan (a new hotel I hadn't gone to before) was said to be really good and I had heard about this buffet. We decided to trek the extra 0.8 miles and check it out.\n\nWicked Spoon ($40) was more expensive than the Wynn Buffet ($38) when we went for the Holiday price, but it certainly isn't the same quality and food selection as the Wynn. It certainly is overhyped and was mostly a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, the food was really great, but there's so many other buffets nearby that deliver at a higher standard with greater value within a half mile radius.\n\nThe only thing I found fascinating were the plates they were serving the food. It was in these metal plates with handles and it certainly set Wicked Spoon apart from other buffets, but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype that was set."

However, by the time we finished, the line was very long, so be aware and plan ahead. \nIt was very crowed, and we were placed in a weird spot that people constantly trying to slip by us to get to the buffet table. The service was good and quick. The food is like any big name Vegas buffet: good quality, huge selection. \n\nMy experiences with Vegas buffets deteriorated over time, mainly because I become older and can't eat as much as I used to, and the wow factor I had during my first few visits to Vegas buffets evaporates quickly. \nI've tried many Vegas buffets (Bellagio, Aria, Wynn, Rio, Cosmopolitan) during multiple visits. The overall experience is very good, and my recommendation is you should try Vegas buffet at least once. There's no BEST buffet here, I would say you can't do wrong with any big name buffets here in Vegas. They are all vast and they all have a huge exotic food selections."

S"This place is pretty insane. I have been to heaps of Las Vegas buffets and this one is tops in my book.\n\nI signed up tor the players card because we were staying there and we recieved a free buffet in doing so. We also received resort credit for booking online, soooo that equaled two free buffets for my wife and I. We could have enjoyed this just as much at full price.\n\nAs I hope you already know the Cosmo's decor is eye candy. So walking through hotel to get to the buffet is an adventure in itself with many art installations to entertain you along the way. The buffet room itself is also very well decorated with TVs offering fun info about the foods you are eating. As we all know life is in the details and this is where the Wicked Spoon Buffet shines. The vessel for coffee cream for example, is a small steel milk carton. This is just one of the many neat little containers that is used here. My wife loves these types of things. That is one way this place is different from most of it's kind. The dishes are already portioned into these cool little holders for you to just grab and bring back to your table. No messy trays to scoop out of, no taking too much, just enough to try and if you like get another one. Plus it helps with your table neatness until the busboy arrives.\n\nThe food selections were both unique and traditonal at the same time. Crab legs were present, warm and deliciously served with drawn butter. There was a carving station with bone marrow, among other things. Fried chicken in mini fryer baskets. Spare ribs and miso soup and edamame. A mac and cheese bar replaces the omelet station for lunch. I could go on and on.\n\n\nThe desert area was huge. A solid ten flavors of house made gelato. Every killer pastry under the sun. The largest chocolate covered strawberrys I have ever seen and marshmallows on a stick dipped in chocolate and rolled in butterfinger or something like that. Pretty nice.\n\nThe service was on point. So bravo to the Cosmo for this. Just one more thing they are doing well in Vegas. Visit this place if you haven't already"

S"I find Wicked Spoon to be a very stylish buffet at a very chic casino (The Cosmopolitan).  Be warned, it is quite pricey and definitely not casual fare.  If you have a giant appetite and want giant portions to match, you may want to try something less expensive.  But if you aren't put off by smaller portions and appreciate the the ability to sample more exotic selections, then you will love Wicked Spoon!  \n\nThe food itself is very good, and as someone who leans towards eating more vegetables and grains, I think there is a bigger selection of healthy fare here that may make you more mindful of what you eat.  How many buffets have that distinction?  My absolute favorite part is the dessert area, and I highly recommend the gelatos.  The  flavors are really unique (PB&J, Almond Joy, etc.) and absolutely delicious."

S'After reading over the reviews and seeing that it\'s rated 4 stars I decided to bring my family here for dinner to give it a try. But definitely made a mistake coming here for dinner. \n\nI hate to ruin the excitement for everyone since its the new "it" place to eat.. But I would advise you to go to some other buffet. I mean come on! It\'s VEGAS! There\'s a million and one other buffets here! \n\nTo start off- we were pretty lucky to have only waited in line for about 25 mins. We came at 5:30 and got seated around 6. But dinner prices are $35 so we easily spent over $300 for our party of 8. \nWalking in and seeing the decor, it looked nice and very promising. But that\'s where the good compliments end. \nWalking around and gathering food- I realized there wasn\'t that much meat offered. Besides prime rib, lamb, short ribs, and crab- there really wasnt that much of a selection. Which is okay by me if the food is good. But it wasn\'t. The food was either too salty or too bland. There wasn\'t any inbetween leaving me to throw away half of the stuff I got. \nSooner or later I gave up and went to dessert. I was so excited to see a gelato bar and chocolate covered strawberries. But by the time we got in line for dessert the line for it was about 15 mins long. Not only that- but this place doesn\'t have that great of service either. We were constantly waiting for them to refill plates and even when they saw us wait for things- the serves wouldn\'t refill! \nBut I do have to admit- their gelato and their chocolate strawberries are bomb. \n\nSo if you can have a whole meal off of desserts especially gelato and chocolate covered strawberries I would suggest you come during lunch. Otherwise I would definitely pick another buffet. Maybe the wynn or MGM?'

S"On our recent Vegas trip, we didn't spend much of our time in the Cosmopolitan.  Yet we still happened to stumble upon this wicked awesome place.  With that, I'm going stay far away from using descriptive adjectives to describe how tubular this place from now on.  Oh yeah, I brought the tubular!\n\nOn our little walk into the Cosmo, we hadn't eaten lunch and our tummies were growling for some chow down.  We telepathically brain stormed that a buffet was only appropriate.  After following some signs to leading us to our destination of the Wicked Spoon, the pathway of a lobby from the escalators to the restaurant had a really interesting piece of art involving a pack of dogs with confused faces.  The child in me used it as a photo op.  http://s3-media3.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/ojOy5r-DE_KvaGcSGhuMpQ/l.jpg\n\nTo the restaurant we went!  When sat, we quickly surveyed the variety of food available.  To my surprise, much of everything came in little plates, pots, or containers.  It was one of the neatest little things I've seen, a homage to Alice in Wonderland or something out there.  Each selection had its own serving size, and i'm assuming the theme of their title coincides with how they deliver the food to the customer.  \n\nFor instance, their Asian section had pad thai and it was served in little doggy bags.  Now, instead of deeming this insanely tacky; it was creatively prepared well and was surprisingly good.  The pot pie came in little pots reminiscent of my little sister's pretend tea party and dinners of when she was younger.  It doesn't stop there. It was clearly one of the best executed buffets I've eaten.  \n\nThis was by far, me and Bun's favorite buffet on our Vegas trip.  Everything we tried was amazing.  From the little cups of mac and cheese to the moist slivers of fish in a bowls, it was something to be amazed at.  For those who are anti-buffet, this place may turn the tides of your opinion.  The serving sizes allow for the right amount of food without reaching the point of disgust upon sight where some buffets go.  \n\nLooking for a buffet in Vegas?  With a decent price and outstanding food, look no further than the Wicked Spoon!"

No excuse right?  The food HAD to be done well.  Oh it was done well alright...3 hours ago.  \n\nOn the plus side:\n\n- Warm molten lava cakes\n- Great gelato selection (and some creative choices as well like Thai Tea gelato)\n- Foie gras chestnut macaroons\n- Mac and cheese bar (made by a super nice guy who actually seasons food - huge plus)\n- Creative salad and cold station\n- Dessert station was solid and one of the better ones I've had\n- Food presentation was pretty nice\n\nNot a plus:\n- Very weak seafood selection for a top-end Vegas buffet\n- The carved meats were all dry (they needed some love)\n- The meatloaf tasted like a homemade meatball that I stuck in to a microwave for 8 minutes to dehydrate.  \n- Food sat under the light way too long, and if I'm the third table to be sat at the opening of dinner service, that's saying something.\n- Pig ear salad...total fail (you can't even crisp up the pig ears to add texture?)\n\nYea I get it...it's a buffet, but for $40+, I've had better."

S"Just thinking about this buffet makes me want to cry tears of joy.\n\nI came in back in June when the EDC festival was going on with a huge group of friends. I was advised that if I am in Vegas, I have to go to the buffet. I stopped liking buffets for a good amount of time just because the quality of the food is usually not that good for the price but since I was in Vegas with my friend, why not try it?\n\nWe had a group of 18 people I believe and the cost per person around lunch time was between $22-$27 dollars. We had our tables set up in about 5-10 minutes after we paid and after we were seated, our drinks were given to us. \n\nUnlike most buffets that have a gigantic spoon or tong in the heated metal trays, wicked spoon portions their food out in small dishes to ensure that each serving is enough for each person. I found it pretty cool how they served it. It was more clean and less food wasting than just having someone pick out how much they wanted. \n\nThis place literally has everything... EVERYTHING. I walked around and saw how they had breakfast food, korean food, japanese, american, italian... etc. The best part about the buffet for me was the dessert area. Let me tell you about how most buffets are like in my area. 1. they either have vanilla or chocolate soft serve ice cream or 2. crappy cakes, cookies or jello. Wicked Spoon is beyond that childish desserts. Rather than soft serve ice cream, they have gelato that is hand scooped and served to you...GELATO! You know you're in Vegas when they gelato in a buffet! Oh, its not even just vanilla and chocolate too, they have a sorts! Besides that, they have macarons (OMG), mousses (OMG AGAIN), chocolate covered strawberries (DEAD/). I was so amazed by their selection of desserts that I kept coming back to that area while everyone else at my table slowed disappeared back to the hotel.\n\nI really hope I get to go back to Vegas soon. I really want to back here again! D:\n\nPS: Waiters/Waitresses were friendly and attentive!"

S"I hate to say but I'm going to have to report several disappointments with my Wicked Spoon experience. First, this Buffet is WAY, WAY over priced. To come to this conclusion you have to really see what's going on here. They have layed out this buffet In such a way as to save money and short change the customer as much as possible. The Single portions may be cute and all, but if you look at what's there they are skimping on things that cost the most money. Pork ribs with risotto. Large portion of risotto with 3 tinny bits of pork. Interesting! Any dish with rice was 98% rice and almost no meat. This was all over the buffet right down to the extremely thin straws they give you for your soda. The slower you drink the less refills they have to give you.\n     also, the reason I came to this buffet was to try the bone marrow. I made sure to call SEVERAL times to find out if they serve it every night. I was told this was a staple of there buffet and one of the things that sets them apart from other buffets so they have it every night. Guess what they didn't have the night I was there? Of course, the bone marrow. I did talk to the manager about this and he told me they had run out the night before. He then said he would like to invite me to come back to try the bone marrow another time. I'm not sure what that means but I don't think it was going to be for free. I would not have had a problem with it if I didn't call repeatedly and was told they have it every night. \n        I have also read in other reviews that people had a hard time getting refills of soda after there first one. This happened to me as well. It seemed like after I asked the waitress for my first refill she just disappeared and never came around again. Interesting for a buffet that's $38 with tax. \n        I will say, much of the food was very good. I did enjoy most of what I had. The carving station did have some very good meats. The desserts were also rather good. \n        I don't think I will be back to this buffet as there are many in Vegas that I enjoy more and are cheaper. If your out to spend some cash and don't mind getting ripped off a bit give it a shot. You may have a better experience than I did."

S'I would give this buffet a solid 3.5 to 3.75 stars, so I will round up.  As many of the other yelpers commented, I also loved the small servings.  The cute little metal pots looked like something you would use to heat beans when camping.  The individual portions were enough for two to share in many cases.  I really enjoyed the "angry" mac & cheese, cheese sampler plate, french onion pizza, pork shoulder and the desserts.  I also loved the bottled water on the table that was included in the price!  It was great tasting water, even if they just fill up the bottles with filtered water or something...\n\nMy main focus for coming was the crab legs, but I was underwhelmed by them.  They come pre-split in half for easy-eating.  It was awesome that you didn\'t have to open them yourself...but by cutting them in half they dried out and were not as fresh tasting.  I ate there on a Tuesday night.  By the taste, I would guess they were split in half on Monday and we got the leftover...  Who knows for sure.  I wasn\'t into them at all...  Maybe on a weekend they would taste better?!\n\nOur "server", who was basically a buser, was nice but slammed.  We got there an hour before closing and by the time we got sat we only had 40 minutes.  Our server never pulled a single plate from our table.  Once the table next to us left, we just started moving the plates over there.  Pretty annoying!!  But oh well...\n\nOverall we did enjoy most of the food we tired.  The food here is far more interesting than normal buffet food.'

First of all, $44 for unlimited food, mimosas, champagne and bloody mary's is an unheard of deal in Vegas, especially with food as good as the Wicked Spoon.\n\nThe buffet boasts everything from pulled pork benedict, to sushi, to gnocchi, to mini wedge salads. Not to mention, the dessert section features chocolate covered strawberries, cakes, custards, cobblers, gelato, and just about anything else you can imagine. It's rare in a buffet setting to eat such fantastic food, but the Wicked Spoon blows just about every other buffet I've tried out of the water. \n\nThe service was great, as we were constantly brought refills on our drinks. The Wicked Spoon is a must to anyone who visits Vegas! I know this will definitely be a tradition every time I visit."

S"Overrated. Food mediocre not worth the wait!!!\nPreferred Aria's Buffet. \nThe line was too long. You line up to pay then line up again to get a table. Once in, we discovered half of the restaurant was empty. Also didn't like that silverware were dirty. Check them before you put in mouth!\nOK here's the food scoop.\nKorean kalbi (short ribs) were CHEWY too tough for me !!! Watch out if you have dentures.\nChicken wings in small pot was cute & good\nSmoked salmon- too salty\nBut the salmon with mandarin orange on top was good. \nSushi rolls- call it rice rolls not much fish\nWatch out for Berry platter. A lot of squash berries plus some had molds.... Yuck!!!\n\nAs for dessert, they had a good selection of gelato. I enjoyed my pistachio but not the best. My friend had the mint chocolate but it tasted like Listerine. \n\nWe definitely did not get our money's worth. Aria were coming back to you."

S"The place has a nice ambience but was over rated. I'll go over my thoughts on the brunch. They have a huge dessert section which contained gelato and many other pastries. I found this section to be the most robust in flavor and selection. \n\nThen There was an Asian section that consisted of noodles, unlabeled sushi and stir fried options. Another section was the pizza and Mac and cheese which happened to be the smallest but my wife found it to be her fav. Since she doesn't like pizza it's safe to say this might have been their strong point.  \n\nThey also have a meat section with sirloin which was medium to medium rare without an option for further cooking your streak. I was disappointed because I wanted well done and it wasn't available. The other meats were chicken, sausage. \n\nFinally there was a breakfast section for eggs, cereal, toast and everything in between. As usual you can't really do wrong with breakfast due to its simplicity but they did not have any type of jellies except for strawberry. I was kind of irked that they wouldn't have a basic breakfast staple available. \n\nOverall it wasn't what I expected, it was quite small and got packed very easily. I advise coming when it isn't packed, you'll def save yourself sometime in lines waiting for avg food. For 36$ a person I expected better."

We were there around 8 am and in my opinion, there is no excuse for cold food so soon after opening when there was a line to get in.\nGood points were bottled water on the tables and very pleasant servers.\nI'll try it again next trip, but hope it is much better."

We will definitely visit again.\n\nMost of the buffet on the strip are about the same price; Wicked Spoon restaurant and food is more upscale and well-decorated than other buffet. Most of the food here are served in small dishes.That day, the brunch came with complimentary glass of bloody mary or champagne. Lots of selections of western and eastern food; desserts are tasty. \n\nGood value!'

S"Extremely unhappy with the food I got here. Spend your money elsewhere!! The food was SO BAD that it spoiled half of my day in Vegas. I haven't had such bad food in a long time.\n\nMy fianc\xc3\xa9 and I had went to Wicked Spoon a few years and it was my favorite buffet in Vegas at the time, but it has gone downhill since then. We paid 88ish total for the two of us. It's definitely hard to get your moneys worth here unless your fine eating crappy tasting food. \n\nFOOD:\nThe two most expensive things here are probably the crab legs and the prime rib. I don't really eat much cooked seafood, so I didn't eat the crab. I love steak, so I loaded up on the PRIME RIB. Unfortunately, it tasted like DOG FOOD. That spoiled my appetite and I couldn't eat much more. \n\nThe rest of the food offered was super cheap stuff like hometown buffet-esque. I had some cheap chicken wings, pasta, etc. Everything tasted very subpar. \n\nThe gelato used to be pretty good, but I think they get it from somewhere else now. It's much worse than before. It tasted very cheap and low quality and the texture was kind of melty. I had some lemon meringue and orange white chocolate cake that was pretty decent, but thats the only thing I semi-enjoyed. \n\nOverall, I DO NOT RECOMMEND Wicked Spoon. Service isn't very attentive either. SERIOUSLY take your money to a nice restaurant and get yourself a high quality or steak or something. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!"

The bone marrow was good- but thought I was going to break a tooth if I ate the toast you're supposed to eat it with.Is it really supposed to be that hard?!!! the desserts weren't that good either, cakes were dry! I ate at the Paris buffet and their food was better during breakfast than this place at dinner! We ate here againthe morning we left, on a saturday morning and it seems like they wait until the weekend to really get the good stuff out.

A good place to try a bunch of different stuff.  Not as much option for the size of the buffet area alot, of wasted space.

S"I went here on recommendations from several friends who swear by it. The plating is great. They use small pots and pans to serve the food. Its very novelty, but functional as a way of portion control. I went on a friday for lunch\nUnfortunately I didn't find the quality of food acceptable...\nI grabbed a piece of fried chicken and discovered upon returning to my table that there were still feathers in the chicken...battered, fried and all. Not just one or two, but about a dozen.\nAdditionally, the water they server is a filtered water delivered to your table in a glass bottle-- It had floaties. It looked like someone had backwashed into the water they were serving us. \nAlso, just something that irked me was at the dessert counter. The plates (as with the rest of the buffet) are kept warm under heat lamps. Unfortunately when you grab a piece of chocolate or some ice cream, it instantly melts. Not very gourmet to slurp lukewarm ice cream sludge. A room temperature plate would have been nice.\n\nAfter all of this I spoke to the manager. I explained the problems one at a time. His response was to give us complimentary cocktails. A nice gesture, and it cured my sour mood, but this is not a fix to the problem. He offered no apology or explanation, nor did he make any indication that this would be fixed. \n\nMy opinion of this establishment is that they care more about appearances than quality. It would definitely recommend AGAINST eating here."

S'I was surprised how there was absolutely no line (maybe it was because the Mavericks just won game 6). \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty chill. As you probably already know from a lot of the other reviews, a lot of their food are served on individual mini dishes. This had its pros and cons. PROS: Sanitary and Aesthetics. CONS: Although they are mini, the proportions are pretty sizable ( ended up wasting a lot of food) and you can only fit maybe 3 mini plates on your giant plate. \n\nFood was delicious especially the selection, they had prime rib, lamb, crab legs, and ribs.  A certain highlight if you are a carnivore. As for the dessert. Interesting flavors at the ice ream bar, but the cones were a little on the tiny side. Had to get 3 or 4 to equal one regular size cone. \n\nStill trying to search for reasons of the name "Wicked Spoon". Maybe it is a metaphor....'

We beasted on Sunday morning. They served Eggs Benedict in a tiny carry-around pot and fried chicken in a miniature carry-around faux deep fryer.\nAnd the salmon??? Shut..it..down. This place is great because not only is the food good, but they went the extra step with great plating. \n\nIt also helped that they were playing Janet Jackson\'s "Control" when I walked in...just sayin...'

S'This is the newest buffet place at the newest hotel on the strip, the Cosmopolitan. It\'s kind of hard to find as it\'s not called the "buffet" and it\'s in some second floor corner of the hotel, but just follow the signs for "Wicked Spoon" and you should be good. keeping in line with the whole "new" theme, it switches up the menu on the daily, which is good if you like to come to buffets every day or if you just like surprises.  \n\nits also an interesting "tapas-style" buffet, in that many of the dishes arent served in huge trays but smaller personalized dishes. all to create a high end atmosphere(and an equally high stack of plates for the poor waiters/waitresses), i guess \n\npersonal favs: lamb and pork meatballs, lamb gnocchi, mashed potatoes(aka pomme puree here lol but it actually tastes as good as they make it sound), crab claws, ceviche, pork belly, DESSERTS \n\nThe desserts are what makes this place almost worth the price of admission. chocolate strawberries were just ok for me but the gelato bar and bakery steal the show. i don\'t know what they put in their pecan and key lime pie but it made me come back for 5th and 6ths, respectively   \n\nit\'s now slightly overpriced at $35/pp when it used to be a steal at $29/per, but the quality is definitely there if that\'s what you\'re going for.  now, if there was only a way to put the wynn/bellagio\'s entrees and wicked spoon\'s desserts together for the ultimate vegas buffet experience lol'

Incredible delicious food and scrumptious yummy desserts, what else could you ask for?! \nWe went during breakfast and got there just in time because it filled up quick. We had a server who brought us water and left the bottle on the table, which was pretty cool. She also filled the coffee fast and cleared plates quickly so we could get more plates on the table. Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot! \nWe had eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, chicken & waffles, etc. The individual portions were awesome and the items that were are platters were always full. You never felt like you had to wait for anything. \nNow let me tell you about the desserts. Yes, desserts for breakfast. Cookies, pies, cakes, ice cream, gelato, fruit tarts, cheesecakes.. OMG!

We stuffed ourselves silly, had a mimosa that was included, had coffee/tea that was included all for $23.  There was no wait and it was a great deal.  So great that we went back for brunch on Sunday.

Three words to describe this buffet: modern, elegance, style. \n\nLoved the decor of this place. Almost felt underdressed although I was pretty dressed up that day. I was even excited with the complimentary bottle of water at every table. Convenient and thoughtful. \n\nI was excited to check out the food since I've heard so many good things about it. There were different types of food I haven't seen at other buffets and was delighted to see the mini takeout boxes filled with a variety of Asian food. \n\nTo be honest, the food was just okay for me. Nothing really wowed me, but fascinated me, such as the Watermelon Salad with marscapone cheese, Bone Marrow, and Kale Apple and Pear salad. \n\nThe service was superb, our waitress was friendly and helpful. I'm giving a star just for the service.\n\nI'm not sure if Wicked Spoon will be my next first choice of buffets, but I wouldn't mind coming back to give it another try."

S"C'mon on Toto, let's go home on that yellow brick road. Before checking out of Sin City, we headed to Wicked Spoon for Sunday brunch. Luckily we got there before the rush because the wait went from 30 minutes to about 1.5 hours in a flash. Party of 8, gratuity included so it came out to about $37/person.\n\nAs we got seated and I took my first lap around the bend, I thought to myself that I was at some fancy, newskool, contemporary buffet. I mean, you got fried chicken in metal frying baskets and food items served in bite sized pots which looked like they were purchased straight from Pottery Barn. Also being Asian, I'm not offended with the Chinese togo boxes filled with food.\n\nUnfortunately with all the glits and glamour, Wicked Spoon didn't quite take me home. There were a few items that needed work like their rubbery prime rib. That was a complete bust. But check out the corn, I think I pwned a few which led me to dominate the poor throne after.\n\nTo complete a buffet is to have the best desserts available. They're gelato selection was pretty up to par where as the pastries were overhyped like Serendipity's.\n\nI like the feel and the vibe to this place. Their chic furnishing and presentations makes you feel like you're in an unconventional gorge fest we like to call a buffet. Also, I appreciate the small portions they serve here because it gives you a chance to leave room for other items. Half your plate will be filled up with their fancy dinnerware. I would give it a second try but I'm not going to lie to you and say that Wicked Spoon is currently the strip's buffet champ."

But when they're serving bone marrow, a wide selection of charcutterie and cheeses, fried oysters, endless crab legs, meats galore, and an assortment of desserts that'll make you full just with a glance, you'll gladly shell out $50 to dine here. \n\nI have to add that even the guests at this buffet are the hottest in town! So you get a feast for the mouth AND the eyes! \n\nBest part about this place is the built-in portion control. I'm sure everyone has experienced the eating-overboard that occurs at buffets. At Wicked Spoon, they help you out by serving everything in their own containers and if you want more, just take another cup/bowl/serving."

S'It is just a below average buffet.  I have no idea why the rating is so high.  We did get there a little before 9 PM and they closes at 10 PM.  Thinking it will be ok because of many recommendations from others.  Man oh man are we in for a surprise.\n\nFirst, the seating speed is super slow.  We were there late and there are tons of uncleaned seats.  We were still in line for over 40 minutes.\n\nThen it comes the food.  Asian food, soy sauce + water with a little udon, miso soup with nothing else in it (usually I am expecting tofu or seaweed), tough hard to chew vegetable and beef, only bright side is the ribs.  Then the pizza and Italian food, why I need to pay $45 a person to eat those and spaghetti with meatballs? Standard roast beef and pork chop, you can get those at hometown buffet. Seafood, also standard crab leg, salmon pieces are ok.  No good salad bar, one star down.  No good fruits, one star down.\n\nDesert is ok, but the ice cream bar has a constant long line.\n\nOh, one more thing, when we got there, there is no sushi anymore.  I guess I can only snack on wasabi and those pink ginger slices.\n\nBefore 10 PM, they started closing already.  Nice for the worker, not so nice for the customer.\n\nOverall, I want to give them a  -7 if I can.\n\n-1 for seating speed\n-1 for Chinese food\n-1 for pizza hut type food\n-1 for no salad\n-1 for no fruits\n-1 for no sushi\n-1 for the price vs variety'

Everything comes in tiny individual size pots and portions, but the quality of the food selection is lacking. I was really disappointed in especially the Asian cuisine sections. The Chinese section tasted like something you get from a Chinese fast food place, nothing authentic at all. The Japanese section consisted of only three rolls: california roll, shrimp tempura roll, and something else. The roll even fell apart when i picked it up. \n\nThe only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section. \n\nThere's a HUGE dessert section and everything looks so beautiful and sweet. But after one bite of each item, it didn't make me want to finish the dessert. The only things I liked in the desserts were the chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate covered marshmallows, gelato, and tiramisu. \n\nI wouldn't come here again for $35."

I don't know if it's just me that notices this, but the butter has some kind of sweet flavor mixed in it, almost like honey or syrup.  I even went back and asked the chefs if they had some other kind of butter and they told me that all their butter is the same....\nI tried to ask what that sweet flavor is in the butter and I guess he didn't understand my question, cuz he just kept mumbling that their butter is the same and just shrugged his shoulders.  Meh...I guess lemons'll do then.

It's a perfect size, not too much and just enough to taste, which is what all buffet goers want, a taste of everything without being full from grabbing too much in the beginning.  This buffet is smart, they are saving tons of money from those that grab too much and end up wasting a plateful of food.\n\nCame here for lunch on a weekday, no line, $23.\n\nI will have to say that some of the Asian dishes were not that great.  This may be biased since I am Asian and know what it should taste like, but I think anyone would agree.  The hai gaw (dim sum shrimp dumpling) was dry and crumbly, like it was not steamed.  The chicken adobe was dry and not edible.  \n\nCouldn't try everything, but dishes that stood out were the curries, salads and desserts.  \n\nThere is a wonderful array of desserts displayed in all colors!  So pretty and tastes just as pretty as it looks!  The desserts saved me from those horrible tasting Asian dishes.\n\nService was good.

You go into 2 lines.  One was to pay and I thought that was it. No, you have to wait in the seated line which took us 5 mins to wait and get a seat...when there was no one there expect my party in line.   All that is fine.  The problem I had was our waitress. Older woman who was very sarcastic to us.  She asked what we like to drink and we all wanted water....she said "really, that\'s it?" and then several times when she picked up our dishes she said, " You guys are the best people I have waited on." Now we barely talked to her or said anything that would make her act like that. One girl in our party made it a mission to be super nice to everyone that served us! Which she did!

S'I have now been to Wicked Spoon twice, and my first time was wayyy better than my second time. I will say this, the place has a great set up, and everything looks great. The down side is that that\'s all that it is. The food looks great, but when you take that first bite the food is eh... I mean there are some great dishes in the buffet but overall, it was just ok. If you decide that you want to test the waters with the restaurant which I would suggest, only because you should try everything at least once. They have an "build your own omelet" station, their mac n\' cheese is really good, and selection of meats and cheeses are yummy too. One thing I notice a lot of people do when they go to the buffet is go for Chinese, Korean BBQ, sushi, and pho, DON\'T DO THAT! If you are from the San Gabriel Valley.. .go there!! not Wicked Spoon. Plus, the pho smells really good but tastes like water. Hope my review doesn\'t discourage you to try the food. ENJOY! :]'

Mainly because compared to most of the other Vegas Buffets, they do have a cool concept of serving most dishes tapas style,a large selection and you can't beat the price. $29.00 for dinner is a great deal!!!\nThings i liked: cute sweet potato fries basket: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=iPghhy9N4azg0lP_S5HrkA\nSalad (yes salad): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=hdhBFzkgK6B6235Cd9EpDA\nThat they have a mac and cheese bar: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=M2_4E_aQ9CKhPjH1w-2--Q\nand surprisingly the brussel sprouts were deelicious. \nLoved eating out of the little pans : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Ym-lY0eK698v546Q_AzDTg\nCrunchy tacos were good.\n\nSad they didn't have the raved about pork belly bun and XLB. They only had 3 types of sushi and they were all generic rolls. Crab legs were small crab claws. I had Bone Marrow for the first time- thumbs up. \nThe desserts looked beautiful and were plenty : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=xDoLAU2S10POWue58tlXBw\nand i grabbed a whole plateful :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=zxZDmDpWsDs2rcaWQa0ZEw\nBut the only thing i really liked was this lemony jelly dessert thing that was served inside of an eggshell topped with a baby macaron (mac was not great tho). Gelato was yum. Chocolate covered strawberries are always nice. \nI did enjoy the desserts here more than Wynn Buffet. But i remember liking the Bellagio desserts the best (but that was years ago)\n\nA little disappointing overall, but service was friendly (our waitress took the time to take pics for us and make conversation about our trip), everything was beautiful and how much fun was it to take some pics in the shoes and by the dog statues around the way.!"

S"Best buffet in Vegas!! We came around 6pm and there wasn't a line at all! There are so many options here - not like a lot of the other buffets in Vegas - and I've been to 5/6. Everything comes in small portioned plates/cups so it's also a great way to limit yourself so you can try a lot of different things.\n\nSome stand out options: um bone marrow!?!? whattt?? I've never seen a buffet offer bone marrow! It wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it, but I wasn't complaining. The shrimp and grits, mussels, bruschetta, roasted cauliflower and truffle potatoes were all very very delicious. I wasn't a fan of the gazpacho or risotto though. The gazpacho tasted a bit off and the risotto was a little hard.\n\nDesserts = the biggest chocolate covered strawberries you have ever seen! The presentation of the desserts are all very adorable! Probably the best buffet I've been to ever. Definitely make a trip to Wicked Spoon if you're in Vegas!!"

S'I\'m kind of torn between this buffet. We came in for lunch and the price included a free glass of champagne of Mimosa for a little less than the Wynn or Bellagio which was nice. The buffet itself wasn\'t overly packed and the ambiance was surprisingly very nice inside. Now onto the food..\n\nThe buffet was not really large or anything and it offered a good variety of asian inspired dishes, though unfortunately, I can\'t say any of them tasted right or were made right...\n\nThe Kalbi (Korean spare ribs) were just too tough to eat and way to chewy/thick, while the little Vietnamese sandwiches made in steamed buns with pork belly and pickled veggies seemed a bit bland and had more peppers in them than actual meat or veggies. The rest of the dishes looked good but were very dry for example, the fish entrees were rather bland and dry. They offered a soup station with Vietnamese vermicelli noodles but what was odd was that there were two pots of broth but it was only Miso and not "pho" broth which completely beat the purpose of having noodles there at all. \n\nWhat I must note about this place was that everything was already portioned for you into little cast iron skillets. The general taos chicken, fish, vegetables and mac & cheese for instance. \n\nNow, after having only "nibbled" on most of what was on my plate, I was excited about the dessert options as they still had a decent amount and most of it was very well made. Here were some of the stand outs in my opinion.\n\nGelato:\n\nThey even had the option of tiny cones and as with most gelato you just can\'t go wrong with this dessert. I especially loved the chocolate and pistachio flavors.\n\nMacaroons:\n\nOnly go for the mango macaroon which has a nice mango/passion fruit puree and fresh berries inside. This was the first to go and was very delicious. There\'s a raspberry one but seemed to have a funny after taste.\n\nChocolate covered strawberries:\n\nThese were by NO means those tiny ones but the large long stemmed variety that Godiva often charges up to $11 per berry for, while here you can have as many as you want included in the price. They had two kind, one with chocolate dipped orea and the other chocolate dipped with peanuts. I am not a fan of peanuts so I stuck with the oreo cookie dipped one.\n\nScones:\n\nThe lemon scone was perfectly soft, moist and delicious.\n\nMolten lava cake:\n\nThis was served in a mini cast iron pan and although it was not bad, it would have tasted better if it were warmer.\n\nAnd last but NOT least my FAVORITE dessert here:\n\nThe strawberry shortcake station. You basically get to build your own little shortcake with however many pieces of pound cake, whipped cream and fresh strawberries. As simple as this was, the cake was amazingly moist and the berries and whipped cream were very fresh.\n\nFor our one glass of alcohol, we both went with a Mimosa which wasn\'t bad, luckily it wasn\'t too strong since I don\'t care for alcohol that much.\n\nOverall, I liked the dessert options here better than the Wynne or Bellagio but the food selection kind of disappointed me in that anything Asian did not taste the way it was supposed to and this is coming from a girl raised on the stuff here in SF. However, if you just want to stick to a few of the better dishes, I would recommend filling up on salmon, any vegetable dish and the red velvet pancakes (if you come earlier during breakfast) which unfortunately, I missed but heard were all the rage,  the Mini steamed pork belly sandwiches and the on things like Mac & Cheese were not bad at all.\n\nJust be sure to save most of your appetite for the dessert selections, which even beat out the Wynn and Belaggio by far as they definitely were not cheap tasting by any means.\n\nI think I will have to come back for those red velvet pancakes next time!'

S'You know that annoyingly pretentious guy or girl who goes to Vegas and is all "I don\'t do buffets; that\'s for amateurs"?  He or she hasn\'t been to Wicked Spoon.  And don\'t tell him or her.  Let\'s try to keep this a secret for as long as possible ;)  \n\nHusband and I came here RIGHT when it opened for dinner on a Friday night and there was NO LINE.  We hear it gets pretty packed later on in the evening though so if you hate the waiting game, go early bird style like we did!  \n\nThe location was a little hard to find... it\'s on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, but we had to wander around the shopping area for a bit before we spotted a sign that pointed us in the right direction.  It\'s a bit of a schlep from the main shopping area through the hotel to the buffet (a warning to ladies heading out in those sky-high stilettos!).\n\nThe space itself is visually stunning and really does not look like the other buffets in LV.  Wicked Spoon has worked really really hard to distinguish itself from the other Vegas buffets and refers to itself as a "bustling culinary food hall."  \n\nHonestly, it can call itself whatever it wants.  It\'s awesome.  \n\nThe quality of the food was excellent and about 70% is offered in individual tapas-size portions, which helps if you\'re the kind of person who typically overdoes it with the heaping spoonfuls of food at buffets.  For the Vegas buffet lovers (i.e., for that person in your party who really had their heart set on going to a traditional buffet), there\'s still the standard Vegas all-you-can-eat staples like crab legs and prime rib at Wicked Spoon.  \n\nBone marrow?  At a buffet???  Yes, you read that right.  This is typically a $20-30 appetizer plate at some of the nicer restaurants I\'ve been to, so after having a few bones to myself I knew I\'d gotten my money\'s worth.  \n\nThe salad and cold items section had some of the freshest offerings I\'ve ever seen.  Octopus salad!  Shrimp ceviche!  Nom nom nom!\n\nService was excellent.  Our servers were very attentive, and they refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly.  \n\nThe dessert selection was impressive.  There were even some sugar-free options (that did NOT taste like your usual sugarless desserts!) and so many gelato flavors to choose from!  Too bad we were too full from sampling everything else at the buffet to really try much of the dessert.  \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone.  There\'s plenty of kid-friendly options to pick from too, so parents don\'t have to worry about it being too sophisticated for a young palate.  Can\'t wait to go back!'

S"We paid $44 per person for dinner.\n\nHonestly, I really dislike buffets. Nothing ever really wows me or makes me mouth water so for me to find even one food item that I actually like is surprising. At Wicked Spoon, I found three.\n\nMission Figs- Blue Cheese and Candied Bacon\nWild Boar Sloppy Joe\nDuck Ravioli\n\nI really don't like bacon and blue cheese but man, the figs? So impeccably sweet, tangy, and salty with a bite. Amazing- I could probably gorge myself on just this.\n\nWild Boar Sloppy Joe- it had an interesting flavor that I can't really describe, only it was pulled meat and oh-so-good.\n\nDuck Raviolo- again, really interesting flavor. I really liked it though. It was extremely creamy and flavorful.\n\nThese three items alone would make me come here again. Buffets never really make me happy or excited except- maybe this one. As long as they had these items forever."

There was (yes, I counted) 5 times I came back with food and the tables were not cleaned up. Not to mention trying to get someone's attention for plain water."

S"By far one of the best Buffet's in Vegas. Me and 15 or so of my friends, decided on this buffet for brunch on the day after Christmas.\n\nThe chefs create small portions of delicious dishes, eliminating a lot of waste that buffets create.There are fewer options than the regular casino buffet you'd be used to but it more than makes up for it in the high quality of food. Everything was delicious, I make it a point to try everything where I can say with confidence that it rivals Bellagio and Wynn's buffet.  \n\nIf it wasn't for a the fact that they were trying to pass off orange flavored water as orange juice, and the management befuddled and dumbfounded when I brought this to their attention, I would have given them much high marks. \n\nOverall, If you had to eat at one buffet in Vegas, I would go with the Wicked Spoon, the Bellagio or the Wynn buffet's."

S"wow. the coveted 5 star review. i dont give out these willy nilly....\n\nespecially for a buffet. i mean i think maybe outside of the M, the highest a vegas buffet would get from me was 4 stars... (and thats even after living in hednerson/green valley/silverado ranch/las vegas for 7 years before moving back to san diego)\n\nhere's why the wicked spoon stands out IMO - \n\nthe GRUB:\n- tapas style portions! genius concept IMO - because you wont have those peeps at the buffet shoveling mounds of shrimp cocktail and mac n cheese like its going out of style - the portions are reasonably prepared, presented and tastefully done in deliciously satisfying tapas dishes. if you want more, you would need to get up and get another serving.... imagine that, an all you can eat buffet without peeps thinking that they should get it all on just one run...\n- highlights: herb crusted tri tip, blackened cod fillets, korean bbq short ribs, angry mac n cheese, grilled corn cobettes, sushi, and shrimp cocktail shots\n- desserts were awesome - my faves: chocolate dipped strawberries, gelato from the case, and petite dessert cups\n- bottles spring water table side was a nice touch\n\nthe JOINT:\n- clean and very modern art decor\n- plenty of friendly staff to seat and serve you\n- open kitchens\n\nthe SQUEEZE:\n- $22 p/person on a saturday lunch. not bad at all! actually it pretty much is a steal for a vegas buffet of this caliber.\n- cash and card accepted\n- love its location at the cosmopolitan\n\nFINAL SAY:\nthe very low price, the flavorful food, and the tapas concept and presentation are all ingredients IMO for a stellar vegas buffet experience - 5 stars!"

S"Ever since I left Las Vegas, I cannot stop thinking about this buffet. I keep fantasizing about the unique dishes, flavors, and taste that I experienced here. If not for the food, come for the experience. My family have been hardcore buffet eaters and this gave us a different dining experience never to be forgotten. If you want something unconventional and tasty, this is place! \n\nThe salad and soup section was my favorite because they played with combinations of vegetables and fruits that I haven't seen or tasted before. Their watermelon salad is a must. I am also a big fan of the fig salad. The mushroom soup was mind-blowing. \n\nI've had better meats elsewhere although it was still very good. I've ate bone marrow before and this could've done with more flavors. The seafood and pasta sections aren't extensive but good. Their Asian flavors are not authentic but they do try with the presentation. \n\nBeing diabetic, I was pleased to see some sugar-free options at the dessert section. The must eat (and more of it if you can) was their sugar-free chocolate ice cream! Oh my god, it was the best chocolate ice cream I've ever eaten, sugar-free or not. Dark and rich...so amazing.

S"The trick to the Wicked Spoon is to come around 1 PM on weekend days. Yes, you will spend over an hour in the purchase line and the seating line, but when you sit down around 2, 2:15, the place begins to clear and there's not much jostling for that last slice of fancy meat or cornbread. \n\nAnd the other part? Around 2:45, they begin clearing the breakfast/lunch items and begin setting out dinner dishes. We began seeing people rush towards the food at that time, so we ventured up and each got a mountain of huge crab legs. They switched the omelette station with a gourmet mac n cheese station, and put up a fancy make-your-own-ramen station.\n\nThe desserts are all gorgeous, but we found that the best ones weren't the chocolate ones - they were the cream ones (panna cotta-like ones) or fruit ones. \n\nOur waitress was really nice. A friend ordered the unlimited bloody Mary and didn't like it, so she took it off the bill, no problem."

S"If I'd written this review soon after it opened, it would have had 5 stars. Unfortunately since then, it's raised the price and the selection has gone south a bit as well. Gone are the pre-peeled crab claws, and the macaroni and cheese bars hasn't been open on a few occasions I've been there as well. While the individual portions make for a more elegant display than at a traditional buffet, now the cute mini-pots are often left sitting on the the hot line and the quality has gone down a bit.\n\nThat being said, there are still many things I like about this buffet. It's a good place for large groups, and they make my favorite gelato in Vegas: Salty Peanut. The cheese selection is pretty good, and the pork rillettes is superb. I'm a fan of the bone marrow, and the Brussels sprouts too. Their shrimp cocktail is the best I've had at any buffet.\n\nService can also be slightly spotty if you're someone that needs a few refills over the course of the meal. They have an unlimited wine special for about $8 a glass, and the house wine is pretty good.\n\nHopefully they'll either raise their standards and selection back to the quality of  this buffet when it opened or at least lower their prices-- because I would love to be able to amend my review and give the Wicked Spoon the 5 stars I would have when it first opened!"

S"Pros: Amazing salmon! Most buffets overcook salmon meat so that its tougher than it should be, but Wicked Spoon manages to get it right every time. The fish is always moist and tender- just the way nice restaurants cook it. They also have extremely fresh smoked salmon which is just as good. \n\nLarge dessert selection. Our group was really happy with the dessert choices; they had chocolate dipped fruits, a bunch of cakes, macaroons, gelato, etc. I ended up getting the tiramisu and found it as a meal highlight.\n\nGreat service. Our server was really nice and attentive. He always checked on us too see how we were doing or if we needed drink refills.\n\nCons: Chinese food is salty and some of the italian small dishes were cold, which was disappointing cause that eliminated two major food stations for me. Also, the only cut for steak super rare, so I couldn't eat any since I prefer medium/medium rare. However, the boys in our group seemed to really enjoy it anyways (I guess meat is still meat. :P)\n\nNote: I'm writing this review for lunch.

S'I got my dad to take me here for my birthday one time (we love to stuff ourselves), and it was amazing.\nFirst off, get the membership card with Cosmo- it takes some percent off the bill, and adds to your points. \nWe came for lunch and it was a weekday, so there weren\'t many people, and we were seated very quickly. We got our drinks fast (they give you a water jug which is cool, since I hate waiting around for more water) and toddled off to the food.\nThey have a very basic selection of food- but better! Everything is portioned- there are no large ass spoons that everyone and their sticky handed kid touches! So they cut down on germs, and waste! If your eyes are too damn big for you, this is a perfect way to cut down on the food you throw away at these buffets. Everything coems on its own doll sized plate, or skillet, or pot, and the crab? Already sliced down the middle, so all you have to do is dig your fingers in it. \nThe best part, for me, since I am a fatty, is the dessert bar. Holy crab cakes, this place has the best desserts I\'ve seen at a buffet so far! Chocolate covered strawberries?! Chocolate covered strawberries dipped in pretty much anything from cookies to nuts!? YES!\nThe salad bar? Cool. The bread? They have fricken PRETZEL ROLLS! AHHH! \nI am not ashamed to amit I took some rolls with me...they were good. Don\'t judge.\nMy brother was overly impressed with these little chocolate pastries the shape of ice cream cones, with edible gold shavings on top.\n"I can eat gold!?"

Cosmopolitan has always done a good job with their execution on various venues, and they definitely hit a home run with this buffet.  What makes me such a Woohoo was that Wicked broke all boundaries of traditional Vegas Buffets.  I would like to be the first to categorize Wicked Spoon to be an "All You Can Eat Tapas" venue, to call it something else would be whorish!  Each item served on the buffet tables were prepared by portion on individual mini plates, pots or pans reminiscent of what you would expect at a tapas joint.  This very ninja-like method keeps you from getting plate-fulls of what you don\'t want, and allows you to get a taste of almost every delectable dish served without getting too full.  Wicked is a wonderland of tantelizing treats.. specially when they are serving freshly baked bignets with rasberry sauce.. IM ON IT!!'

S'Wicked Spoon is a ginormous Vegas buffet, but I think it has more interesting and high-quality food than many. Other reviewers have covered the basics, so I\'ll stick to the good stuff:\n\nThe fried chicken wings are awesome. They come two to a little wire basket and taste like they were ripped from the back of an angel instead of a chicken. Maybe an angelic chicken.\n\nThe Asian food in general is very good, with the exception of the fried rice (too dry). I think they also do a nice job thinking broadly about "Asian" food, including Korean and Vietnamese items alongside more common Chinese and Japanese dishes.\n\nThe gelato bar is a must. Every flavor is fantastic. Ask for a waffle bowl to hold your scoops.\n\nYou may want to wear elastic-waist pants.'

We were happy with our decision. Wicked Spoon does not have as many selections compared to other buffets and I felt that the quality of the food was mediocre. To list out some of their options: king crab legs, pizza variations, sushi, ethnic foods, dessert, etc., but none of the flavors stood out to me. We were fortunate enough to not have to deal with a line but we did notice during meal time that the line was horrendous. If you want to try this buffet, I'd say to go with the to-go box and take sample portions."

S'This buffet is awesome!! It ruined all other buffets for me forever.\n\nThe highlights were the huge pile of crab legs and the mashed potatoes were so awesome!!  The dessert selection was good, I expeced a little more( probably because of the pic on yelp) but it was still amazing ( the salted peanut  caramel gelato was the best)!! The Coffee was really good too..\n\nCons: \n-Service was lacking friendliness a bit but oh well, im still giving it 5 stars.\n-Pricey ( Luckily I had a coupon 2 for 1 price that I got on my united flight out).\n-They charge extra for espresso or a cappucino which I though was weird since its a buffet.\n\n I will definitly return on my next trip out!!!!!!!'

S'Sunday dinner review  from May 18, 2014\n.\n  Avoid this buffet if you want food that is quality without being distorted by added crap that masks that flavor.   I\'m a meat and potatoes lover, not a "foodie" so I found very little to eat here.  I took a slice of the "prime" rib which certainly was not prime grade meat.  I tried the wasabi mashed potatoes since my other potato choice was fingerling potatoes with duck fat.  I would have appreciated simple plain mashed potatoes no additions.  The wasabi was too spicy for me.\n  I thought I\'d have fried chicken since the beef roast was just ok,  only fried chicken was wings in a little wire basket, I only eat breast pieces, so that wasn\'t an option.\n\n Tried a roll, it was stale and dry, after 1 bite I was done.\n\n  As others have said there are no salad greens to make a simple salad with dressing.\n\n  Desserts nothing special I haven\'t seen at Mirage, Bellagio, Harrahs, buffets.  Their sorbet/gelato section does have a wider variety of choices than other buffets.\n\nSo here\'s what I was able to eat for $41\n1 slice of rib roast, 2 small scoops of raspberry sorbet.  Iced tea and water.\n\nMy server was good, kept the water and iced tea full and removed plates quickly.'

S'Dinner at Wicked Spoon for $35/pp. \n\nSo, I confirmed, dinner time does have BONE MARROW. There are stacks of bone marrow next to the meat stand. It looks like hunting gone wild. \n\nHere are some hits and misses:\n* Bone Marrow - great. Could be more roasted, but these bones have so much marrow. They are huge. \n* Prime Rib - ok. I strongly recommend, if you like medium rare, go ahead, ask them for a rare piece. They take requests. \n* Mussels made to Order - Red Sauce is better than Green Sauce.\n* Ceviche - a shot or two is great. It is fresh and very tasty. \n* Pig ears - I really liked the flavoring. Too bad it was so salty. I had to get a pack of white rice to finish eating it. But it was the good part of the pig ear and they sprinkled heavily some salt and pepper seasoning. \n* Shrimp tempura sushi - It was ok. The shrimp tempura was no longer crunchy. \n* Water melon tequila shots - So surprised to find this out in the open. What if kids pick it up. It is like a soju shot. Sweet from watermelon and a little bit of tequila trailing at the end. Most of the alcohol has sunk to the bottom, so you may chose to stir before drinking.\n* Cream of mushroom - You can pass. Not that great.\n* Shrimp n grits - Tasty, but dropped in scores after I tasted the American Fish dish.\n* Braised ribs - You can pass. It was a little tough.\n* Fish and Chips - Great presentation. But fish batter was a little thick.\n* Pappardelle - Looked dry, but surprisingly fresh pasta tasting. I would choose this over their spaghetti choice.\n\n* Pistachio gelato - Soooooooooooooo good. Soooooooooooo yummy. \n* Carmel Candy gelato - Also good.\n* Mango & Raspberry gelato - Good. But I personally like fruit gelato flavors.\n* Tiramisu cake - Adorable cups. Not much espresso flavor, but the cream part is so light and fluffy. It is very worthy of a lick.\n* Fresh brownie in caramel sauce - You can pass this one. Fresh baked and out of the oven is good, but by the time, you get to your table, it is probably already cold.\n* Fresh marshmellow - Soft and lightly sweet. One piece is enough for the palate.\n\nOh, this buffet is so fun. Especially, when most dishes are individually plated. It just looks so much more appetizing when things are not stacked in one tray.'

S"I'm not sure if we went on an off night but my boyfriend and I never really eat at buffets but I've heard a lot about this one and loved the idea of individual portions so we just had to try it. We did go on a Saturday night and got there are 6:45 pm, there were only 2 or 3 people ahead of us but it took 15 minutes to pay. We were told a 20 minute wait for seating, now I don't mind waiting an hour if you tell me an hour but don't tell me 20 minutes when it's going to be an hour. So that was the first negative.\n\nNow for the food...it was really bad, everything except the mac n cheese was cold, the  prime rib was lacking flavor, the chicken was dry, the sushi tasted funny, the risotto was pasty.\n\nI do have to say the mac n cheese was amazing and the shrimp cocktail was some of the best I've had but $35 for those two items was a little much.\n\nOne other negative is that we got up for dessert and they cleared our table. Not a huge deal, the waiter said, oh just sit here but then some other lady came up immediately asking for our receipt. We told her what happened but she looked at us skeptical and started asking some other girl when we had pointed out the waiter who told us to sit there. I guess they get a lot of people trying to sneak in for cold tasteless food."

Everything is good and everything's served in these cute little single serving dishes or mini pots!  Adorable!! Best of all, they always have chocolate covered strawberries and french macarons.  But the food itself is good.  Fresh made salads, sometimes even lobster bisque, and a vast variety of meats and other dishes. The wait hasn't been too long every time I've been to Wicked Spoon.  And the service has always been extremely good."

S'This place is just like the other buffets that you can get for $15 less up the street. There is nothing novel here aside from trying to be "hip". \n\nMy confession is i HATE buffets. I hate cold food, and i hate "fake" gourmet food. Check, Check, Check. \n\nThe waiter has to be asked twice for coffee.. all they do is bring drinks.. really.. we can\'t get juice and coffee down? And no offer to give us our mimosa or bloody mary which i didn\'t even know was included.\n\nThe waffle i had (pecan waffle) was GOOD but freezing cold. Not worth the 30 minutes walk from venetian.  (as i had a waffle, bacon, sausage, fruit and a spoonful of gelato.. that\'s all they give you, a spoonful)\n\nIn short, if you\'re going to eat at a crappy buffet, pick a place that\'s much cheaper, you\'re getting the same crappy food!'

S"Short Sum: May not be perfect but still great for an upscale all you can eat Vegas meal.\n\nPros: \n- Hits the mark for most of the foods and set up. Most of the foods have already been placed in small platters for you to grab. \n- Agree with one of the reviews below me. Very aesthetically pleasing food and interior. Definitely one of the better looking buffets in Vegas. \n- Dessert is amazing. There's a gelato bar and the servers are always nice. You can always get two or more at a time. \n- Our waiter was extremellyyyy nice. A star for him. \n\nCons: \n- Misses the mark on some foods. Kind of expected from the buffet. The fried rice was poorly made. Fried chicken wings were too salty. I asked for medium steak and I felt like mine was pretty damn rare still. \n- Buffet is pretty damn hard to find...or pretty hidden at least. \n\nGo Back? \n- I'll probably hold Wicked Spoon off next time I go to Vegas. Going to try other buffets and compare."

Wine on the table (and also displayed for you to choose from, taste, half glass, full glass, bottle).  Waiters that suggest their favorite dish.  Very modern and clean look to the decor.\n\nFood - includes crab (already cut in half so you can skip the hassle of cracking legs and getting all messy) platters of cheese. fresh fruit. salad bar. mac and cheese. shrimp and grits. many dishes coming in little skillets or platters for easy portion control. \n\nDessert - the biggest array of dessert I have ever seen at a buffet.  French macaroons. cheese cake. gelato for crying out loud! \n\nBy far, the best buffet I've ever had and well worth the cost."

The food is great and there are a lot of unique options.  A great place to try new things, because the portions are small and ready to grab.

S"Wow, we have a lot of fans for this buffet.  I'm giving them 4 for special selections that they serve here as compared to other buffets.  Not that much of a wider selection, but some different eats.  \n\nWe came here when they just opened up for the evening.  The wait wasn't that long, perhaps maybe about 30 minutes in that line.  PS get your players card and get $5 off your already expensive buffet.  \n\nI was a bit disappointed because I kept reading in the reviews to try the bone marrow.  haha, not a huge fan of that, but if its at a buffet and in these yelp reviews, I have to try it.  We got in right when they opened, but they were already out.  booooo.  \n\nSo different eats that was yum was the beef tongue shepard's pie, the mac and cheese station customized to your liking, deep fried oysters and calamari.  Had some what of an Asian twist for those that eat that.  What was neat is that most of those eats were already prepared in small dishes for you to just grab rather than scoop up traditionally in a buffet. \n\nOf course I finished up with snow crab legs, thankfully it doesn't get too messy because it is presliced so the meat is exposed. \n\nDesserts-best part of dessert was the ice cream to pair up with whatever pastry you wanted.  :)\n\nI'll come back if I'm being treated again haha"

S'Before I found out about Studio B buffet...I thought the Wicked Spoon was one of the best buffets offered in Vegas.  \n\nLocated in the modern chic Comso hotel/casino....the Wicked Spoon is a great buffet.  Its not awesome..but it is great.\nThe one thing that kind of sets this buffet apart from other buffets is that the serving style are mini plates just enough for one person.  This eliminated the urge to pile all the food on the plate (even though there are unlimited trips to the food stations) and also helped the waste of food.\nLike all buffets there is a huge selection of cuisines.\nWe were given 1 complimentary mimosa....but only 1.    More than one means you have to pay!  \nOverall it was a nice buffet.'

S"Very nice establishment and super convenient if you are staying at the Cosmo.  However, for the price ($44), you can get slightly better food at some of the other buffets.  I'm a big fan of cured meats and sushi but the sushi was definitely not the best and the cured meats consisted of two different types of salami.  Also, I've heard lots of good things about the dessert section and they do have a handful more flavors of gelato/ice cream than other buffets, but the dessert section as a whole is not any bigger than other Vegas buffets I've been to.  I might go back if I stay at the Cosmo again, but I think at this price there are other options to choose from.\n\nIf Chris Brown was in town, he would probably pass on this place."

S'Tried this buffet for dinner based on the wonderful reviews here on Yelp.  Wasn\'t impressed - long lines at the main course table, and by the time you picked up the little individual serving of vegetables and made it to the meat or chicken station everything on your plate was cold.\n\nThe variety and recipes as noted here are different and that\'s definitely in keeping with the Cosmo atmosphere - if you bring kids and they want pizza, chicken fingers and the like, you\'re out of luck here (and that\'s totally cool, just be aware).  Pizza is there, but it\'s white clam pizza, Mac & cheese is there but it\'s "angry" - with a spice kick.\n\nAll in all, the actual quality of the food was subpar, the offerings were lukewarm to cold, and the drink service was glacier slow and uppity - geez, it\'s a BUFFET, no need to be all snooty.\n\nGlad we tried it, but still prefer the Wynn, Bellagio and even Mandalay Bay.'

S"Compared to other Las Vegas buffets, Wicked Spoon is on the higher end of things - the seating area is more removed from the food lines and the decor is more upscale (beautiful blown-glass chandeliers!). The service was decent when we went, although Mirage's buffet service was better. The food selection here is smaller than other buffets, but that's not too big of a problem because those items are often better-made than other buffets. The omelet station is delicious and the wicked fried chicken and angry mac-and-cheese was worth trying - even at breakfast time. I wouldn't make a visit just for this restaurant, but if you're staying at Cosmopolitan, it's a decent breakfast stop in the building."

There is a dessert area, catering to your sweet tooth. \n\nIt is reportedly the best Buffett here in Vegas, and all you can drink can be added for total price of 51 dollars per person. See pics for food selection.  \n\nService was attentive and waiter brought us 4 rounds of drinks.  He did try to add extra on our drink but we said this is the wrong bill and he corrected it.

S'Overrated.  My wife and I love buffets and have been to most of the buffets in Vegas.   We both agreed this buffet was slightly disappointing.   Positives:  the decor was very nice and the wait staff was very friendly and timely, no line and was seated immediately(Thursday night), the shrimp ceviche, prime rib, baked salmon, and several of the pasta dishes were very good.   Negatives:  the snow crab legs were tiny, the "asian" bar was just pathetic, the 3 different sushi rolls were supermarket quality, the desert bar was disappointing, and just the overall offering was fairly weak.   The salad bar looked pretty good if you\'re into salads, but my wife and I don\'t pay $40+tax+tip to go to a buffet for salads.   This buffet should be about $27 instead of $40.  You can do much better for the money.'

S"Absolutely disappointing! Even without all the hype attached to this buffet, the food was downright bad and mediocre with only a few dishes I would go back for. If this wad a $20 buffet it would be fine, but I shelled out 35 for this and even found a bug in my food.  \n\nOkay lets get all the bad over with.\n\nAfter running all over to grab food for my first plate, I look down at it to see a funny looking caper in my fennel salad...that caper was actually a small green beetle. Extra protein I guess...but unwanted. I showed my server...and the manager comes to check. She thanks me for telling them and asks me if I feel okay. That's it. Hmmm I expected a bit more...especially from a place like this. It really didn't help my first impression. I stayed far away from salads the rest of the time.\n\nThe line was decently long even at 6. It was prolly because the first wave of diners just got seated. We ended up waiting over an hour.\n\nThe food...only a few dishes that I liked. Everything else is passable. Don't even bother with the asian food. The sushi was worse than what you get at a grocery store and was falling apart. The cha sui was simply pork slathered in sauce. The pad Thai and edamame looked pretty unappetizing. The chat sui buns looked okay, but that's not what I paid 35 to eat. There wasn't a lot of great interesting things to eat, typical stuff, but nothing  I was amazed by. The mac and cheese bar is a good idea, but comes out really watery. \n\nOkay so here's the good.\n\nThe decor is pretty nice inside. Definitely some nice touches in there. This was continued with the way they served the food. Portion sizes in small cute pots and pans and dishes. The dessert section was pretty good. Lots of interesting little scrumptous tarts and a great selection of gelato. Chocolate coffee tart, pecan pie tart, chocolate mousse with berries in a chocolate shell, beignets with jam, etc. Food I did like include lamb, risotto with short rib, gnocci with lamb, and mushroom polenta.\n\nOverpriced and overhyped.

Both days pretty similar. What I liked is I did not feel like I was in a cafeteria or old country bufffet. The decor was great and it was very contemporary, including the food. I liked how they had individual portions plated into little skillets or cast iron pots. The variety of beef short rib entrees was amazing considering that's one of my favorite dishes!

In many of the food options, servings were pre-portioned into little dishes and mini pans.  Being a female who once played house with play dishes, I loved this!  It left room for little mess, but balanced with several trips as these pans take up a lot of space! \n\nYou're probably waiting for me to get to the food specifics, but i just don't remember everything.  I do remember that there were about 3 variations of braised beef, the typical salad bar, and an amazing dessert section.  All of which I enjoyed.  \n\nAlso, I must say, that for someone trying to watch their figure, this buffet is pretty forgiving.  What I mean is, this is not the typical steak and potatoes kind of place.  I was able to eat 90% of my meal without heavy carbs like rice and potatoes. On that same note, I did notice that the dessert section had sugar free options available.  I would certainly recommend you try this place out for a new buffet experience."

Had alot of big ticket items such as chocolate dipped strawberries with either nuts, crushed oreo, and crushed toffee.  These are the stemmed strawberries which are much more expensive.  They also serve blueberries, blackberries, and rasberries which are much more expensive then cantalopes and honeydew.  Lots of different gelato flavors to choose from such as tiramisu, pistachio, lemon, mango, and peanut butter.  They even have bone marrow to smear on crostini.  Lots of small dishes, most very good.  lots of different fish dishes with salmon by far the best (very tender).  mac and cheese bar where you choose which cheese and ingredients like tomatoes, bacon, onions, peppers, and mushrooms and they make it for you is kinda rich (better off not getting it).  Very extensive dessert section with chocolate bark, fudge, choco dipped marshmellows just to name a few (no creme brulee though).\n\nonly gripe is that it's hard to bring lots of small pots and dishes back."

S"Seriously the best buffet out there. One thing that's really important to me is that everything is clean. The servers and chefs make sure everything is nice and tidy. The wait staff is great and are always checking in, making sure you have everything you need. \n\nThe food is FANTASTIC! The lamb, salmon, bone marrow, and desserts were phenomenal. Also, every salad I tried was great. Everything tasted extremely fresh and was prepared into little portions so you could try little bits of everything. The watermelon w/ siracha  sauce was a huge hit at our table. The gelato bar is great with some really unique flavors. There honestly wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like (and I tried A LOT of stuff)! \n\nIf you're going to the dinner buffet (the one we went to), I would highly recommend getting there right when it opens or sometime between 5-6, otherwise you might be waiting in a massive line, and we went on a weeknight. Again, really impressed with how clean it was and how swiftly everything moved, even when it got crowded. \n\nThe price was about $40 a person, but it was totally worth it. Will definitely come back for the brunch buffet!!"

S"I ate at the Wicked Spoon the day after eating at a buffet that cost about $25. As they say, you get what you pay for. I'd much rather pay $40 for the quality of food served at WS.\n\nI visited the Wicked Spoon on a Thursday about 5. It was perfect timing. My group beat the crowd by about 30-45 min. The set-up was clean. There were plenty of options- not as many options as a cheaper buffet- but quality over quantity.\n\nI like meat, so I was practically stuck at the meat station. Prime rib was decent, but the pork loin and top sirloin were great. The crab legs were on the thin side, but on the upside you can ask the server to steam them for you.\n\nI rarely eat dessert at buffets, but was attracted to the apple cobbler, served warm in an individual pan. I made my own a la mode with the ice cream.\n\nAgain, for the quality the price was reasonable. At this point in time, WS tops my list in the buffet department."

S"I will mourn the wicked.  Those of us who unashamedly eat more then we can carry.   Those of us who come into a buffet with a game plan and a pre-ordained eating schedule to maximize our stomach capacity.  And capacity is what you're gonna need for Wicked Spoon!\n\nFirst off, I really dig the Chibi-sized dishes at each of their stations.  It's hard to not put every piece of pot, tin, skillet, and basket on your table.\n\nWhere do i start?  How about the Special Order Mac and Cheese Bar!  You can stick with the 11 different ingredients in front the bar, but really, the entire buffet is your pantry. How about some prime rib in your mac?  Or maybe a little helping of crab legs. Or do what I did and throw some Truffled potatoes in there, and make your own Provencal Frankenstein Mac.  (btw:  I think the station is only open during dinner hours).\n\nSo, after about 30 minutes there, and another 15 or so to walk around and take pictures (I'm a Yelper, we take pictures of our food, and we don't apologize).  I moved onto the Enomatic machine where I spent another good 15 enthralled minutes.\n\nIf you've never used an enomatic machine before, basically you put your card in the slot, and choose between a half dozen wines.  You then stick your head underneath the appropriate spigot, and siphon away.  I'm told that they prefer you to use the wine glasses they provide however.  Hmmm.\n\nSo after what seemed like an hour of not really eating anything, here's what i settled down on that was most memorable to me:\n\n- Eggs Benedict in a Pot.\n- Red Velvet Pancakes (the search continues!)\n- Wicked Spoon's version of a Vietnamese Banh Mi (looked like a David Chang Creation).\n- Curried cod, and haddock on mini cast iron skillets.\n- Giant slab of cut bacon.\n- Prime Plus Rib!  (it was really good!) \n- Crab Legs (cold, but not frozen like other places).\n- Mini gelato cones\n- Mini lemon pudding cups with mini macarons in it.\n- Chocolate covered strawberries and marshmallows.\n\nI loved every wretched part about it!"

S"LOVE LOVE LOVE !! I cannot get over how much I enjoyed my dinner at the Wicked Spoon.\n\nThe individual servings is such a great idea. The portions are just right, and if I want to go back for seconds, or thirds, I can. I think it's a great way to make sure I do not get more than what I can eat because I hate wasting food. Plus the individual servings keep the buffet neat. The only con is that you are very limited to how much you can fit on my plate.\n\nA macaroni and cheese station !? What a great idea !! I can add whatever I want and it never seems to fail me.\n\nThe bone marrow is delicious. I cannot get over it. Seriously each time I went up for a serving, I always helped myself to some bone marrow. I would go there just for that.\n\nThe mushroom risotto is mouth watering, especially with the wine reduction sauce.\n\nThere's so much I want to comment about and just thinking about Wicked Spoon is making me hungry !!"

S"0 stars. \n\nOver this past holiday weekend we stopped by The Cosmopolitan to check it out before heading to The Buffet at The Bellagio. We found out there was a buffet at this casino/resort and decided to try it out. I don't understand why people are stating it's difficult to find, when it's really not if you can read the signs that lead you to the 2nd floor. \n\nAnyways, we arrive at the entrance to the buffet and there is a lady standing there stating they were not letting any more people in. WTH?! When does a buffet reject people entry???? I was willing to wait the 1-2 hrs to try their buffet, but didn't even have the chance to stand in line. The line wasn't even ridiculously long. They lost business that day not only from me, but from the other people who were willing to wait in their line to see what their buffet had to offer.\n\nI will be back in April and at that time I will hopefully be able to write a real review on their dishes. \n\nIf you're wondering where we ended up eating, it was back to The Buffet at The Bellagio... where we waited about an hr."

S"We ended up eating at Wicked Spoon because we thought it would be a nice experience with good variety of delicious and unique food. I was sorely disappointed.\n\nWe went over the memorial day weekend so it ended up costing a little over $40 plus tax per person. I wouldn't have minded the price, but the food was very sorely lacking.\n\nUltimately buffets are about the variety of the food and, in this case, the quality. \n\nThe good:\nBeautiful desserts, lovely presentation. gelato, fresh macaroons, cookies, marshmallows, cheese cake, etc. Modern decor, attentive wait staff. Good lemonade and orange juice. \n\nThe bad: \nValue/Uniqueness -Nothing out of the ordinary. Far too expensive for what you get. I would not pay more than $25 for this stuff--even for Vegas.We came for bruch and the selection was very sub par and unremarkable. Pancakes, fresh toast, omellete station, breads, 2-3 cheeses), cereal and fruit. Nothing worth $40. They didn't have a belgian waffle section, or  any out of the ordinary breakfast offering. Very sparse and a major disappointment...and I LOVE breakfast food. \n\nVariety - The lunch food selection is what really upset me. My fiance is big on meats and there were hardly any meats there (lamb, pork ribs, and tri tip), poor selection of salads, vegetable options, and general main dishes. I felt like I was eating a bunch of side dishes and fillers (i.e., mac n' cheese -not that great, risotto, pizza, spaghetti--seriously?), A big beef was that  their sushi  was no better than what you can get at the market--not fresh, dried out, flavorless. On top of that, the little Asian foods they had were also inedible. \n\nI really wanted to love Wicked Spoon. It had so much potential and had really great reviews. I am guessing most of these people were just there for the dessert, cause that's all I saw that was worth eating.  It just really let me down. I'm sorry, my fiance gave this place a shot for me cause he knows I like pretty food, but I really owe him a buffet at the Bellagio. Wicked Spoon, you really let me down. It's embarassing. We couldn't even enjoy our food. I even lost my appetite because the food was so bad. Considering it was Memorial Day weekend, I can't imagine what disappointing menu they normally would have for a cheaper price. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. If you don't mind shelling out 35-40 for cute little desserts then go ahead, but otherwise I'd skip this place and do the Bellagio buffet instead."

S'Decided to dine here on a Saturday night with 2 friends. 38$ including tax. A table for 3 consisted of a 15 minute wait, so i thought this better be worth it. \nThey serve everything in mini individual portions, trying to capture the \'gourmet\' feeling at a buffet. Some what successful in terms of presentation however i feel that by presenting their food in such a fashion, you receive less food than you would at a normal buffet. I attempted to try everything they had once but ended up only \'sampling\' about half of the selection.\n\nThe food tasted okay, had its pros and cons. It seems they tried to get creative with the food itself too which is noted, you\'ll see a lot of food you wont find in a normal buffet, I thought they we\'re really good with some of them but some were only okay, and some were downright disgusting.... They seem to be lacking in the dessert portion of the menu, only serving a limited selection of mini sized desserts. (TBH, they all remind me of Jello with additional gimmicky decorations to attract the "ooohs and ahhhs" (gold flakes, powdered sugar, berries were nice though). Their gelato bar was sufficient as for they had good flavors. Grapefruit was really underrated in my opinion (seemed to be the least scooped from their freezer) and was my favorite in that category. \n\nService was the normal "5 star fancy hotel" type stuff.. nothing too special.\n\nPros:\nPuree\'d Cauliflower - remind me of a mixture of mashed potatoes/soup.\nMac n Cheese bar - some guy makes your mac n cheese like he would an omlette. Nice selection of condiments (i went with cheddar and jack, sauteed mushrooms, baby asapargus, crumbled bacon, and chili flakes)\nRhubarb/berry cobbler - since it comes in individual portions, it seemed like a mini pie you would buy at the bakery, which made it very presentable unlike cobblers at other buffets where it looks like its been ravaged through stuff.. Tasted the granola in the topping which made me happy, the filling consisted of rhubarb and berries.\nShrimp and grits - tasty shrimps, but only two shrimps a pot.\nDIY strawberry shortcake section - Easy pass on the cake, Fresh strawberries with a nice dollop of freshly whipped? can\'t go wrong.\n\nCons: \nGeneral Tsao\'s Chicken - General Tsao would MURDER you if you served that to him.\nAsian food - step it up. feels like im paying $35 to eat panda express, highlights of asian food included "cha siu pork" and "kal bi ribs", Cha siu uses a different cut of pork then the one they chose, so it was dry.. kal bi was overly greasy, to a point it was soggy with grease. crisp it up better.. \nCrab legs - yeah, i understand that you\'re going for the mini-cutesy theme here.. but in reality ive had $10 dollar buffets that had bigger crab legs then this. Its okay to serve mini portion stuff but baby sized shellfish just means you\'re cheap.\nLimited selection of roasted meats - although i\'d like to say the roasted leg of lamb was delicious.\nMashed potatos - big fail, tasted like pasty butter. they add chunks of potatoes in it but your mash is trash.\nDIY strawberry shortcake section - DOES IT LOOK LIKE I WORK HERE?\n\nPresentation - 5\nAtmosphere - 5, cutesy portions attracts the \'facebook pic\' crowd\nFood - 4, (comparison to buffets) 2.5-3 if you compare it with restaurants\nPrice - 3, still felt a bit gimmicky.\nSolid 4.\nWould I come back? Yes.'

S"Overall:  This is by far the best buffet in Vegas.  I define best in terms of quality and value (NOT Price, but what you receive in terms of what you pay).  Lines are non-existant because this is still a diamond in the rough (and out of casino traffic's way).  Best quality buffet food - comparable to some low-end fine dining restaurants in Vegas i.e. Fleur de Lys @ Mandalay.  Price is still reasonable as it's cheaper than Wynn's and Bellagio's buffet price, but comparable or even better quality food.\n\nNOTE: As of 05/27/2011, they've raised their prices yet again to $35/person for dinner.  About a month ago when I went, it was $29/person for dinner.\n\nSetting: Dinner w/ friend and his wife on Friday, 05/27/2011\n\nMust EAT: Roasted Beet Salad, Bone Marrow (season w/ the Sea Salt, and don't forget the bread by the carving station to scoop it out), 5-Spice Ribs, Polenta and Mushrooms (forgot name of dish), Truffle Mac & Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries, Pecan Tart, Tiramisu\n\nThumbs Up: Coq Au Vin, Prime Rib (tastes different and much better than other buffets),  Cream of Squash Soup w/ Jalapeno, Cheese selection, Chorizo Pizza, Watermelon Gazpacho, Shrimp Cocktail, Pistachio Chocolate pudding, and Fruit Selection\n\nTip: They offer an all you can drink Merlot for $7, so take advantage if you like wine w/ your food."

S"The best buffet that I had during my recent trip to Las Vegas.  The other two buffets that I tried were More at Luxor and Buffet at the Aria.  Those both pare in comparison to this buffet.  While I had no line to wait in at more the buffet at Aria had a long line as did the Bellagio buffet when we arrived at a little before 4.  \n\nWhile there was a line it moved fairly quickly and we were seated within 30 minutes.  Once getting past the hostess and were showed to our seats it is a wonder to me why there is even a line.  More than half of the room we were sitting in was empty and it seemed there were more than enough servers and bussers to handle this size room.  \n\nWell getting past all of these things and getting to the food.  The choices seemed like they were endless.  The buffet line runs the backside of the wall and pretty much runs from one side of the dining room to the other.  \n\nThey had:\n\nKobe beef\nPrime rib\npork loin\nturkey\nking crab legs\nsnow crab legs\nsushi \npoke\nbreads\nsoups\nsalad bar\nand the list could go on and on. (And all of this for $26 a head.\n\nAlmost everything that I tried here was delicious except for the crab legs and the kobe beef.  It is a shame what they did to the kobe beef it wasn't tender or juicy but dry and bland.  The chef that cooked this meat should be fired as it is the worst peace of steak I have ever had.  It tasted so bad I wasn't even sure if it was Kobe beef or not.  Another shame is the crab legs, these things tasted like they had been soaked in salt water over night and were the saltiest crab legs I have ever tried.  \n\nGetting away from these two bad things the service was excellent and all of the other entrees that I have were just spectacular.  Won't be back to this buffet for a while as there are still many more in Las Vegas to try.  But one of the better buffets I had during my recent trip."

We decided to come here just before our drive home because we knew no one would be hungry after going here. (If you get here at about 3:45, you pay the lunch price but they put out the dinner at 4:00...yes!) All of the Italian food in the buffet is wonderful...the pizza is great.

We gave up on breakfast and tried the shrimp and crab legs just hoping to try to get something for our money. The shrimp were good but the crab legs were frozen. Needless to say we ate about 10 bucks worth of shrimp and left. I have to say I was very disappointed and left angry that I just paid a premium for really horrible food. I would never go back.

I only enjoyed the penne pasta with marinara...the most simple thing on there to eat, but that's all I liked.  Didn't try the prime rib but it was very rare so be forewarned if you don't like red meat.  Spicy tuna handroll was ok. Good selection of breads. Fruits weren't too sweet.  And the only part to every meal I look forward to was dessert...and that was a disappointment.  They didn't have creme brulee...just flan...but it tasted bitter. Bread pudding was ok...nothing spectacular.  My man was particularly impressed that they served fresh carrot juice.  Service I must say was excellent.  Oh...and one more thing... if you have a party of 8 or more, they automatically charged you an 18% gratuity.  That in itself blows.  Especially for a buffet.  Yeah yeah..it's Vegas... still.

Like the crab legs I was soooo looking forward to trying were COLD. So were the shrimp and the cod and salmon were flavorless. \n\nWhat was good though was the crawfish, tiramisu, and this smoked salmon tart looking thing with a fish egg to top.

Pastas seemed a bit warmed over, and the desserts were uniformly too sweet for my taste.\n\nStill, though, with at least a handful of standouts (smoked salmon!  shrimp cocktail!, surprisingly tasty pizza!)... you\'re likely to get your money\'s worth if you\'re at all hungry, especially if you\'re impressed by the insane variety of foods like I was.\n\nI actually went twice... once Thursday night at 9:30pm for a late dinner ($29.95), and then again Saturday at about 2:30pm for "brunch" ($23.95, if I remember correctly).\n\n\'twas no line at all on Thursday, and I feel that the food was of better quality than on Saturday for some reason.  On Saturday, I learned that pretty much all non-alcoholic drinks were included in the buffet price, including a fab fresh-squeezed and bottomless orange juice; not sure if that\'s true also for the dinners as well.\n\nAll in all, I\'d recommend at least one trip to this buffet to all Vegas-goers, though next time I think I\'ll stick to fixed-portion very-high-quality meals for the sanity of my waistline and energy levels (I felt kinda like a slug for the rest of the day after stuffing myself on Saturday!)'

Personally, I'd rather have a nice, good quality meal of a decent size, maybe even with leftovers.\nAs for vegetarian options? Forget it! The rice, risotto, & many of the other items you would expect to be safe have chicken stock in them. We went here thinking I could get vegetables & side dishes, but my options were very limited. The 2nd star is for the chef who showed me what I could eat, even though he wouldn't listen when I said seafood is not vegetarian.\nAfter this meal, we decided we will never go to a buffet again.

All that was offered additionally was turkey and ham roast carvery which we didn\'t even try as it looked rather dismal.  \n\nTwo stars given due to the increased price. \n \nIn summary:\nStay away from the Asian food and caviar bar\nSeafood selection is average at best\nPrime rib is nice\nDessert selection is nice\n\nDO NOT bother paying extra for the "holiday special".'

Gave it a go again on Sunday night for dinner and the line was much shorter, and the buffet is a little cheaper as well. \n\nExcellent selection of delicious foods. Crab legs, sushi, prime rib, pastas, salad...and don't even get me started with how much damage we did to the many desserts offered.  Our server always promptly bussed our table and even cheerfully gave us cold milk when we asked for it with our dessert bonanza! Worth it for sure."

I was not impressed since the food lacked flavor and the quality of food has gone down a bit. The prime rib, raviolis and sea bass were the only dishes that I thought was decent. Their so called Kobe beef was disgusting, no marbling whats so ever. its like they bought a select roast and cooked it medium rare. The Turkey was okay. The sushi no way avoid. The tuna poki was not good. The dessert section was OK better a bacchanal. I remember the old days this buffet was unbelievably good. When Steve Wynn owned the casino it was the place to eat. I will not be going back.'

You can seriously get anything you want at this buffet.  # 3 - Service.  Our waitress came by our table just about every 10 minutes to refill our mimosas, coffee, and water.  # 4 - Atmosphere.

S"I guess it was kinda our fault that we got there around 9:30 pm on a Friday night and they closed at 10:00pm (they take food back at 10:30) which meant that food was not going to be good and it wasn't. However, I did like their selection and the unique dishes that were offered. Prime ribs would have been great if it was fresh and hot.  Asian Food selection looked really smushy and gross. Italian section looked decent with their variety of pasta and pizza. Sushi was really really fresh which was very surprising! Don't judge me but the only thing I found exciting was the Shrimp Ceasar Salad and the selection of desserts. I'm pretty disappointed of myself that we came here late and spent $40 a person for cold food. Service was good. Our plates were gone by the time we came back. Maybe the next time will be better. So be warned, unless you're really really really hungry and there is no other choice but the buffet at Bellagio, don't waste your money coming after 9pm!"

S"The buffet experience is one of the reasons why you go to Vegas and Bellagio satisfies that craving... somewhat.  For meat eaters, your taste buds can dance as they have an array of meats, ranging from salmon to veal.  While their prime rib is not quite as good as Mandalay Bay's, their kobe beef is very delicious.  They also have beef wellington, which is rare.  Their specialty, I believe, is the dessert bar.  They have creme brulee, which is my favorite and they don't disappoint.  I couldn't help myself and had about 3 of those."

Bellagio's interior decor was far lacking as compared. It isn't as fancy, but rather comfortable. I think this was more family friendly, if that's a concern. Service was more attentive though.\n\nSelection doesn't include as wide of a variety as Wynn, but maybe that's because we encountered most of the American breakfast items like french toast, pancakes, eggs, etc. Again, food was simply average. My hangover did appreciate the congee =).  \n\nMy friend like this more than Wynn, I like Wynn more than Bellagio. But the Studio B Buffet inside the M (Hendersen) wins my heart."

The buffet is definitely the best way to get the most food for your money.\n\nI immediately followed my #1 buffet rule:  avoid the carbs, they are fill-you-up traps!  So I loaded up on sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and crab legs (both Alaskan King and Snow) mmmmm.  I also tried their baked wahoo and grilled salmon.  Great seafood selection.  yum yum yum.  They also have beef, chicken, and pork selections but I stuck with the seafood.  Unlike other buffets, I saw the sushi being made right then and there so you know it's good a fresh.\n\nEach meat has its own section, which makes it easier to find what you are looking forward.  For dessert, there was a fantastic selection of cheesecake, tarts, cookies, and cakes. There was also a decent selection of sugar-free desserts too for anyone who is diabetic.

We waited in line for close to an hour and we had arrived there around 1PM. \n\nIf you are going to do a buffet, this is clearly the one to do. \n\nHighlights: Pizza (pesto shrimp, BBQ chicken), Fruit (melons, pineapple), and Breakfast (french toast, pancakes, waffles). For all the raving I heard about the prime rib, I was let down a bit. I think it's more the idea that you can eat as much prime rib as you like that gets people excited. I actually found the hand carved leg of lamb to be superior. The pesto mashed potatoes were a crowd favorite. \n\nDisappointments: The desserts. Anytime you give me unlimited bread pudding (with toppings), I will be a fan, but I was unhappy with the overall selection of desserts. Needs to be more variety, not just rich cake-like treats that are heavily frosted. \n\nI enjoyed the experience enough to help myself to 8 plates of food in total, but there is a little more hype than warranted. It is likely the best buffet on the Strip and I easily consumed twice what I paid for, plus it's in the Bellagio, can't go wrong."

S'Thanks to my uncle who is a Vegas VIP of sorts, he treated us to dinner at the $50 holiday buffet. His status allowed us to bypass to the front of the line. Entering close to 10PM, we were told in line that dinner service would 10:20PM, however we word be able to stay until 11PM. The food was decent, much better then the Paris buffet that we tried in a past year. I enjoyed the wide variety of foods that they offered. The crab legs seemed popular but I chose not to try it. I did not care for their Kobe beef (most certainly false advertising) as it was tough and chewy. I would also pass on the ham which was dry and salty. However, the assortment of Asian inspired and Italian pasta dishes were savory, with the right amount of oily and creaminess respectively. I also enjoyed their peppermint cheesecake for dessert but was sad they already turned off their ice cream maker at that time. All in all, I was able to enjoy two of the three plates I had and that is enough to give this buffet a thumbs up.'

I was much more amused by the cougars further ahead of us talking about their football bets.\n\nOnce inside, you pay the 24 bucks for the brunch (28 if you want champagne, still a bargain).  The food is excellent, the options endless - it\'s what you should get at a Vegas buffet.  The only drawback to buffets is the gross people that often come to them - what is the fascination of sneezing behind me? H1N1, anybody, or am I just being paranoid? \n\nI will close with this great quote, stolen from another yelper: "treat everyone as if they have swine flu or syphilis."

S"re:  BreakFast buffet\n\nMy wife and I have made it a tradition over the past 7 years to eat at this Buffet each time we go to Vegas.  The name and decor is timeless in my opinion.  Even as old as the Bellagio is, this place is classic and has maintained an unbelievable level of upkeep.  We enjoy the robust selection of items available each time we go to this Buffet.  They really do a great job and we've NEVER EVER had problems.  This buffet is definitely one of the more expensive buffets on the strip and I believe it's still great value for what they provide.  \n\nUsually, we do not eat Breakfast Buffets as we are always sleeping in.  However, this time, we ate the Breakfast Buffet due to a long drive back home.  I can honestly say, this breakfast buffet truly exonerated what it means that Breakfast is the best meal of the day.  If you're up early enough for breakfast and want a buffet, the Bellagio is a must.\n\nMy one negative is that they only have one bathroom stall.  I had to wait over 10 minutes, because some jackazz was smoking in there.  I did not realize that until I went to use the bathroom, because otherwise I would have told someone.  They really only have the bathrooms there for convenience, because they want to control who leaves and exits the dining area.  They really need to install another stall or maybe a separate restroom."

S"BIG 4 BUFFETS ON THE STRIP\n\nI came here yesterday for dinner. This buffet is considered one of the Big 4 Buffets on the Strip: Bacchanal, Wynn, Wicked Spoon, and Bellagio. Including Bellagio I went to three of them. Last night was the first time I went to the buffet at Bellagio. I learned from my previous buffet there's a strategy when you eat at buffets. You need to approach them as if you're eating at a tapas eatery - get three items on a plate. I ended up having 8 plates. Instead of naming every item I ate I will mention the highlights. The chorizo sausage and pork and chicken sausage were tasty. The smoked salmon, ceviche, and calamari salad were fresh and clean. The prime rib was cooked rare to my liking. The baby back ribs had a sweet glaze taste. The chocolate and vanilla \xc3\xa9clairs were light and sweet. The rice pudding was also a nice filling for desert. There were three things I didn't like. Even though the pepperoni pizza came out of the oven the crust was chewy not crunchy. I found the snow crab legs to taste a little salty. I wish they served the bones of the prime rib. They're the tastiest part of the prime ribs. Overall The Buffet at Bellagio is a decent buffet. In terms of the Big 4 Buffets at the Strip (I haven't been to the Wynn yet) I would rank in order Bacchanal Buffet, Bellagio, and Wicked Spoon (at this buffet I went at the worst time on Saturday brunch and may go back at a better time)."

S"We went to The Buffet on a week night at 7PM.  At 8PM we were still waiting in line!  it took around an hour to get our seats.\n\nOnce in the dining area, it was a really chaotic sight.  People rushing all around like it was their last meal.  It didn't feel as welcoming as it could have been.  However, it did appear pretty clean, as far as the floor and dining booths, seats and tables.\n\nThe food itself was another story.  It really looked picked through.  I don't think the staff did enough turning over the dishes, so they look fresh and maintained.  Serving utensils were left in and on the food at some stations.  I just felt the cleanliness level was not what you would expect for the Bellagio.\n\nThe food was just OK.  I wanted to really enjoy this buffet because everyone raves about it.  But I was not impressed by the flavors, selection and taste.  Nothing stood out.  The kobe steak was tough and the prime rib was not flavorful.  Salads, soups, sides were typical.\n\nLIKES: mash potatoes were pretty good, desserts were nice and were the cleanest part of the buffet, mini mac and cheese was not bad\n\nDISLIKES: the long wait, the flavors and taste of the food, the price.\n\nUnless you are completely hungry and not to worried about cleanliness and taste, then this is ok.  Otherwise, try a good sit down restaurant and order the best prime rib or steak.  It will be better to have a waiter and staff as well.\n\nWe won't be returning."

At buffets I usually expect food to be mediocre to good. \n\nBut, like i said, their desserts are really, really good. We tried many different ones and none of them were overly sweet. It is my favorite buffet in terms of dessert.\n\nThey did have a few other good things too. Their thin crust pizzas, shrimp cocktail (already peeled!), pesto infused mashed potatoes (amazing idea), and mixed salads were all pretty good.\n\nIf you're really into sweets, I would recommend this place even if the rest of the buffet is not so good (yes the dessert is that good). If you want good non-sweet food though, I would go somewhere else."

Both the lunch and dinner buffet are very good.  Stick with what would be the higher priced meats and fish and you can't go wrong.  Just pace yourself.  The only downside, and this applies to most places in Vegas, is that the desserts are tasteless.  Hotels in Vegas use their magic to trick you into thinking their desserts are first class.  Don't be fooled.  In the end, who cares, eat their higher-end meat cuts and enjoy."

The Buffet at Wynn is pretty amazing too, and then my mind wanders off to chocolate covered strawberries and Bellagio Buffet takes the cake! \n\nThe prime rib is nice and juicy. The crab legs have a lot of meat in them. Good selection of pasta and pizzas too. Everything else was pretty good. And the desserts--the chocolate covered strawberrries FERSUREEEE!

S"My wife and I came here on a Wednesday evening at about 5:45pm and walked right in with no line.  The food station selections were a little better than most buffets that I have been to.\n\nThe flank steak and prime rib were delicious, as was the poke.  The rice on the nigiri sushi  could have been a little smaller, but that's OK.  The beef roast that they were trying to pass off as a Kobe beef roast was just regular roast beef.  If it were real Kobe beef, that meat would have been buttery tender with no effort in cutting or chewing.  The king crab legs were great, especially when heated!  I don't think anyone knew that they could have it heated, as I was the only one requesting this (or the other people just liked really cold crab).\n\nI went to look for a pair of chopsticks at the sushi bar and did not find any.  I asked the counter person and he directed me to another station, where again I didn't find any.  I asked our waiter for chopsticks and he promptly directed me to the sushi bar.  It was not busy at this time and he did not provide good customer service by saying that he will be right back with some chopsticks.  I did finally find chopsticks because previously, no one cared to fill the basket up.  For this incident with the waiter and other staff, I cannot give a 5-star rating.  I work at the Wynn where customer service is everything and that is why no 5th star.\n\nOther than that, the waiter was pretty good at keeping our beverages filled besides giving me regular iced tea on a refill rather than raspberry tea.  Will I be back?  Most definitely.  Some things can be overlooked.  I think I may have found my new favorite buffet!"

S"After hearing my hubby talk repeatedly about how much he enjoyed the Bellagio Buffet on a previous visit, I had high hopes for our experience.  I was honestly a bit disappointed!  We visited for a late lunch/early dinner on a Friday.\n\nThe service was fine, but not overly fantastic.  The dining room was nice, but lacked real atmosphere or character.\n\nGranted, I am allergic to seafood and therefore didn't enjoy the plentiful crab.  But, my husband and his family felt they had better crab legs at other buffets.  The Kobi Steak was a big disappointment as it was chewy and lacked flavor.  Overall, the food was ok, but there weren't any dishes to write home about.  I found other buffets for the price that I enjoyed a lot more!  One highlight was the banana and nutella stuffed french toast!  It was the perfect sweet entree and one I've since replicated at home because my husband and I loved it so much.\n\nA side note:  The best game plan to get the best food at the best prices is to go near the end of the lunch shift (which is usually between 3:00 & 4:00).  They don't clear out the restaurant between lunch and dinner shifts and the prices are usually significantly cheaper for lunch (like $12 less a person!)  For example, we went to the Bellagio at 3:30, paid the lunch price, but then they bring out the dinner entrees starting at 4:00.  We just ate an early dinner, but since it is buffet, you definitely don't get hungry later!"

Needless to say, we were so intrigued by the images on TV that we made a stop at The Buffet while we were in Vegas. First off, I'm not too big on buffets anymore because I don't have a huge appetite anymore and I get full easily (I'm a tiny person), so I was put off by the $40 price for dinner. What caught my eye from the Travel Channel's show was the seafood and sushi part of The Buffet. I LOVE SEAFOOD, so the first things I put on my plate were the smoked salmon sashimi, hamachi sushi, and ahi and salmon Hawaii-style poke. I wasn't impressed by any of the fish, especially the poke. It was WAY too spicy and didn't taste anything like the authentic Hawaiian poke I know. The rest of the food was just okay. I was really impressed by how the desserts looked, though I'm not too much of a sweet-tooth anymore. I probably won't be eating here again because I don't think it's worth the $40, but at least I can say that I've eaten here. I actually liked the seafood more at Makino at the outlets."

NONE of us found anything that we liked to eat and we left feeling unsatisfied and not even full! A lot of the food tasted over-salted but it was especially noticeable in the crab legs. It was nice that they were pre-cut, but was it really necessary to pour a whole shaker of salt on it?? \n\nOne of my friends unfortunately got food poisoning at the buffet, most likely from the sushi (the only thing he ate that we didn't) which spoiled our evening because he needed to be near a bathroom.\n\nI was VERY upset at their dessert selection. All of the cream/mousses tasted watered down, everything had the wrong texture or taste and there was only one decent dessert. It was this nutella in a cone with some orange on it. But it is pretty hard to go wrong when there's nutella. \n\nEven though the price was decent for a dinner buffet, with other buffet options available in vegas, Bellagio's dinner buffet is definitely not worth trying."

S"My first buffet in Vegas (but certainly not the last). \n\nAfter waiting in line for just short of an hour,  the meal began with us piling leg upon leg of king crab onto our plates and heading straight for the  steaming vat of melted butter. Next was the beef wellington followed by shrimp, and shepherd's pie. I'm the kind of guy that puts vegetables on the plate just for color and to fill in any nooks or crannies on the plate as a sort of damn to prevent foods from mixing together. There is nothing worse than having your ravioli sauce mixing with the chicken wings. With their oval leaves, lettuce works well as an organic capsule to hold certain dishes.\n\nAfter finishing dessert (the macaroons were nothing special) we were absolutely stuffed, making sure our meal was well worth the 90 dollar price tag. I would recommend this buffet if you have lots of room and want to enjoy nice legs (crab legs that is, you can get the other kind at a different place in Vegas)."

S"$25 for a weekend brunch and $5 extra for the unlimited champagne?  DO IT.\n\nWhen my party and I arrived at around 12:30 the line was intimidatingly long.  It was moving pretty fast though and before we knew it our group of 8 were seated with champagne and orange juice (we had to mix our own mimosa's).\n\nThe variety is huge and everything I tried was delicious.  We had two waitresses (yup, stayed long enough for a shift change) and both really took care of us, especially our second one.  They both kept our champagne glasses absolutely full and were always prompt with bringing more orange juice.  I don't know why the orange juice comes in such small carafes though -- it could have saved them a lot of work to just give us a big pitcher.  Our second waitress was especially lovely.  She even warned us that the mimosa's ended at 4pm and to remember to get our fill because we paid so much to get in.\n\nWe stayed here long enough to see some of the dinner items brought out. Salmon poke and tuna poke were enough of a temptation to get my disgustingly full butt off my chair to sample just a bit more.  So a tip for the weekend:  Do come at around 2 pm (to account for line wait), and eat slow enough so you can at least get to sample some of the dinner items (brought out at ~4pm).  Do this and you will absolutely get your money's worth.  But even without this, I was happy and full and buzzed and I can't wait until my next chance to eat here."

I think we probably could have found an off strip steakhouse and eaten better for less.  But hey, we\'re on vacation right?  I did manage to subsidize some of the meal by handing out some $10 dollar lap dances to some passing women (okay, and one guy, but he was dressed like a woman and I didn\'t know until I was halfway through the dance).  I don\'t want to talk about it anymore.  :-)  In a nutshell, it\'s good, lots of selection, but for the money if you\'re just wanting lunch and not to "gorge" yourself.

S"Second time I have been to the Bellagio Buffet for lunch. Line took 30-45 mins on Saturday at 1:30pm surprisingly. The food has gotten considerably better since the last time I went. The selection here is slightly more than what Aria offers. It can be a bit misleading because the buffet is slightly mirrored so that one half has repeated items as the other side. The price is more expensive than Aria Buffet as well ($35 vs $25) approximately.\n\nPros:\n- They have all you can eat shrimp cocktails. This is a good value for your money.\n- Wide variety of foods from sushi, pasta, asian cuisine, seafood, fruits, desserts, etc.\n- For ~$12 more, you can have all you can drink wines and certain mixed drinks like mimosas. \n\nCons:\n- Personally, I don't enjoy the old feel of the place. Our table was wobbly and the wallpaper was faded. Aria was much more modern but then again, Aria was built more recently.\n- I was really disappointed at the wonton soup. There was a separate dish of shumai next to it and the wontons were literally shumais in bland soup. Quite embarrassing really.\n- Dessert selection was okay.

S'I normally don\'t review buffets because they\'re so varied it\'s really hard to find something that just stands out.  I\'ve eaten at many Vegas buffets over the years and the only ones that have ever blown my mind is Aria Buffet, Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo, MGM Grand, and Luxor (the latter two particularly because of value for their brunch buffets).\n\nI originally planned to go to the Caesar\'s buffet (Bacchanal-something) but the line for that was at least 45 minutes or more.  I was really craving a buffet with some asian selections, which you\'ll typically find in the more pricier buffets.  Since Bellagio was close, I took a chance and made my way over there, where the wait was only about 20 minutes.  \n\nLike most night time buffets, there was piles of crab legs.  What I like at the pricier places is that they precut the legs so you don\'t have to spend half the night cracking open legs, pulling out the meat, and praying that you didn\'t screw up the pull to where half the meat gets stuck in the shell.\n\nThere\'s a salad bar, dessert bar, bread bar, soup bar, yadda yadda.  They also had a sushi bar and italian, american, spanish, and chinese choices.  Unfortunately, no shao mai or har gow but they had gai lan, chicken in black bean sauce with pea pods, char siu bao, fried rice, and something else I can\'t remember.  It was all delicious but little did I know that was the "worst" part of the meal.\n\nI had their pasta and O M G it was delicious!  Cheese tortellini in walnut pesto sauce, beef ravioli in cream sauce, and chicken and sundried tomato bowtie pasts....all of these were incredible!  \n\nThen it got even better when I went to the sushi bar because they had salmon poke and ahi poke.  For those of you that know me, I am a salmon fiend.  I LOVE SALMON.  Smoked, grilled, sushi grade raw, broiled, I\'ll eat it.  Even the crappy salmon they serve at cheaper buffets, I\'ll eat it.\n\nThat salmon poke was AMAZING.  They used quality sushi grade salmon to make it.  That salmon was so delicious, I feel like I definitely got my money\'s worth. \n\nThe desserts were delicious as well...I had their tiramisu and cheesecakes.  I was shocked to see ice cream machines instead of gelato stations like other contemporary buffets.  Negative points to that.\n\nAlso, this buffet wasn\'t very vegan friendly....unfortunately I can\'t take the Vegan GF here because all she could eat is the build your own salad, lentil soup, the chinese broccoli, and maybe some sushi rolls.  Wicked Spoon was far vegan friendlier.  However, the italian food and the salmon poke just made this place amazing for me.\n\nThe dinner buffet during the week is $35.   -1 star because even though the italian and seafood dishes are superb, the rest of the fare is hit or miss.'

S'We came here on a Friday night after Christmas.  The price was high but there was so much food I think it is worth it in Las Vegas.  I later read that this was rated either number 2 or 3 as the top buffet.  The top one, I believe charges over $30 more, so I think Bellagio was worth it being less.'

S"5 stars for holiday dinner selection and quality,  2 stars for dessert\n\nAll of the attention these days seems to be on the newer buffets at Caesars, Aria and the Cosmo.  After a disappointing experience at the Cosmo, I was left wanting for more and decided to try an old classic.\n\nThe holiday dinner buffet at the Bellagio was an exceptional display of Vegas extravagance.  While not much to look at in terms of decor, the endless meat/seafood selections made up for the poor ambiance.  King crab, caviar, shrimp, seabass, ahi poke, mussels, quality sushi, smoked salmon, lamb, brisket, ribs, beef wellington, prime rib, kobe beef roast, game hens, flank steak, short ribs.  The prime rib and the ribs fell flat, but the rest was very tasty - especially the lamb.  I love that they have all of the necessary condiments: mustard, mint jelly, au jus, horseradish, etc...\n\nI never eat pizza at a buffet - filler - but the pizza here is very good.  The truffle pizza and the beet/goat cheese were the best.  Some of the specialty salads here were good, but the other sides were just okay.  The big draws here are defiantly the carving stations and the seafood.\n\nWhere everything starts to fall apart, is with the dessert.  Ugh.  Really bad 90s era soft-serve and super sweet cakes/cookies.  I just can't give it the full five stars until they upgrade that section."

S'I checked out The Buffet at Bellagio on a Friday night. The group I was with were looking for the right combination of a good buffet and a reasonable price. The Buffet at Bellagio, based on a few online reviews I read, seemed to meet those requirements,\n\nThen I walked in.\n\nFirst of all, they charged me a $47 "holiday rate" because of Columbus Day weekend. Columbus Day is a horrible holiday for many historical reasons in my view, but that aside, I was there in a Friday. Columbus Day was on the following Monday. Why would they gouge customers for $47 three days before a random holiday? \n\nAnyway, that wasn\'t a good start to the experience. But I want to review this place irrespective of those shenanigans and provide an unbiased assessment.\n\nThe food was decent and diverse. They had a couple meat stations - one which was serving prime rib and corned beef, and another which was serving goat shanks and lamb chops. The corned beef was really flavorable as was the lamb shanks. Those who tried the other options had a similar assessment.\n\nThey had a few seafood stations, one which had shrimp cocktails, another with several different types of crab legs, and a sushi station. The crab legs were sliced in half vertically, making it easy to eat. The shrimp was okay. The sushi was underwhelming (especially the sashimi). \n\nThey had a pizza station which was pretty good. They had a few different kinds of thin-crust pizza, and I appreciated that.\n\nEverything else, for the most part, was pretty "meh" for a buffet - nothing better than you\'d have in your average buffet in other parts of the country. \n\nThe one thing I will offer specific praise for is the dessert section. They had several different options - cheesecakes, brownies, flan, cookies, creme brulee, ice cream, etc. After trying a bite of a few different options, I can say that they were all good except for the flan.\n\nUltimately, when factoring in even the regular, non-holiday rate, I\'d say that it isn\'t worth the price when there are several better dining options nearby. It\'s definitely not worth $47. Ridiculous.'

S'I\'m being generous by giving out three stars.\n\nEnvironment:\nThe buffet is located through the casino (of course) and right near the guest elevators. You have to wait in (a longggg) line and then they shuttle you off to a table. Like any other buffet, you sit down, order drinks, and move towards the plates. Yet, on this special day, as I sat down, I immediately felt sticky goo on my legs. Why would I feel this, you ask? Oh, only because there was SYRUP ALL OVER MY CHAIR! When I stood up, my dress was sticking to the chair and my legs were covered in goo. Disgusting. The waiter/bus boy simply handed me a wet towel (am I supposed to wipe down the chair myself?) and told me he would send over a manager. I peeled myself off the chair, of course the syrup all over my dress, and had to go back to my room and change. LUCKILY, I was staying at the Bellagio. What if I hadn\'t been staying there? Would I have to take a taxi with syrup all over me? After changing and coming back to the buffet, thirty minutes had already passed, and I had tickets to a show in less than an hour. Therefore, my $40 dinner was clearly not going to be worth it for me; who spends less than an hour at a buffet?? Did they refund me my dinner? No. They just offered to dry clean my dress.\n\nFood:\nThe food is OKAY. The prime rib was juicy and tender, but they were stingy with the end cuts, the horseradish was not very spicy, and their au jus was too salty. The turkey was dry and only good because of their cranberry sauce that I poured over the meat (their cranberry sauce is good but could use more cloves/orange peel). The pesto mashed potatoes were my favorite, but I realized I was just filling up on carbs and had to save room for bigger and better things. The crab legs had lemon already squeezed on them - don\'t they realize not everyone likes lemon on their crab? The crab did not taste that fresh to me...a bit too fishy and not like the sea. Perhaps the lemon was to hide the non-freshness...? I tried their pesto chicken pasta and it was WAY too salty! I couldn\'t have more than one bite. The sweet potato puree had too much orange juice/flavoring or whatever they add. The sushi was definitely NOT fresh and probably only deserves one or two stars (please compare to A\'Float Sushi). The salmon sushi was dry (how can raw fish be dry? how long was it sitting there?) and tasted like old sushi. Same goes for the albacore sushi. The only good thing from their raw fish/"Asian" section was the salmon poke not because the salmon quality was good (although it was better than the sushi\'s) but because the sauce was good. The dessert was the best part because they have a nice selection of sweet treats. The key lime was good, but the carrot cake was disappointing (too dry!).\n\nWhy three stars?\nOverall, the food at the Bellagio buffet is decent: the prime rib deserves five stars but their sushi only deserves one star. The service was crappy, but I feel like that is the overall experience at the Bellagio (the guest service wasn\'t that great at the Bellagio, but that\'s another review).'

S"***Dinner buffet review***\nReasonable price for nice variety including crabs and prime rib\n\nSo my husband and I are very much buffet fanatics when visiting Vegas.  We usually end up going to buffet at least once a day.  \n\nWe always loved Bellagio buffet and have been here several times.  It has a great mix of pretty much what you expect in a buffet.  Considering price, food choices (seafood included), ambiance, it is a solid 4 stars.\n\n* Food:  \n- Snow and King crabs = cut in half and COLD.  The best thing about the crabs here is that they have plenty of them out so you won't have to stand in line for so long.  (HINT:  Snow crabs are actually more tasty than the King crabs...I know, it's werid)\n\n- Prime Rib = very yummy, very fast line.\n\n* Price: $29.95/person (Thursday night)\n\n* Ambiance = typical casino buffet.  Very nice but not so nice that you feel awkward carrying a plate full of crab legs and melted butter.  \n\n* Service = Very attentive.  No need to ask for refills or taking away dirty dishes."

S"The lines for this place were prettty long when we arrived at around 6:35 on a Saturday night. We ended up being seated at around 7:45 or so. \n\nThe food's pretty good food for 35pp. For me, the highlights of the buffet  were the prime rib, the spicy raw salmon cubes (forgot the exact name!), and the desserts.  The quality of the prime rib was surprisingly good for a buffet, and with the horseradish+au jus, it was just heavenly. I also tried a couple of the other meats, like quail and ostrich and kobe beef... both of which I'm not a fan of. They were a bit too dry and bland. sadness. \n\nEven though I was stuffed to the max after eating a whole plate of raw fish and meat (no veggies at all !! I felt super great and healthy afterward.........), I made lots of room for dessert. My favorites are the square fruit tart (ate two of those), the chocolate brownie. And they have raspberry sorbet!!! The coffee tiramisu is not bad either, but I'm sure I would've enjoyed it a lot more if I weren't developing super food coma at the time.  We stuffed ourselves for 20 minutes straight! Bf even said 'No time to talk. eating.' so yeah, we were frantically eating for the short time we were there  (we had to catch at show at 9). We didn't feel too good afterward, but it was worth it. SO worth it."

S'Before you read on, the 5 STARS is because I\'m comparing it against ALL other buffets I have been to & especially the ones in Vegas.\n\nonto my BRIEF SUMMARY!\n- Buffets are usually about quantity not quality, but Bellagio gives you great quality food & a whole lot of it\n- Smaller than Rio but better quality\n- Great service\n- Wasted food goes to Pig Farm\n- Quality Deserts\n\nEvery time I go to Vegas, I\'ve officially been there 3 times in the last 6 months, I\'ve got to hit the Bellagio Buffet. Bottom line. Yes, you should go to Rio because it\'s the world\'s biggest buffet, but when you\'re done poo-ing your brains out, you\'ll want to spend an additional 5 bucks and go to Bellagio.\n\nVEGAS = LINES. So if you\'re gonna cry about waiting in line for the club or a really great restaurant, then don\'t go to Vegas. It\'s like going to an amusement park during some busy holiday weekend and crying about how you have to wait in line for a ride. It\'s RIDICULOUS. Suck it up and wait.. the longer you wait, the MORE food you\'ll probbaly eat. HAHA\n\nSo we waited like 10-15 minutes in line to eat dinner on Friday Night around 7 or 8pm. Normal wait time in Vegas without reservations can be at least an hour. it is a little bit pricey but again, it\'s worth it. Yeah it\'s 34.99 and basically you pay $40/a person.\n\nIn general the Bellagio is a NICE Casino and the buffet has nice decor. As soon as we sat down we were greeted and put our drink orders in. and then headed towards the buffet!\n\nIf you haven\'t been to the Bellagio Buffet yet, make sure you go around ONCE and look at everything they have to offer. The stuff on the right side isn\'t always the same as the stuff on the left side, so you wanna plan out what all you want to eat lol. The thing about Bellagio is that unless you\'re absolutely stuck on something in particular, you could probably eat a whole bunch of different meals in one setting haha.\n\nMy first stop is always the salad bar. They have freshly prepared salads to choose from and then they have the built-it-yourself. I love that their field greens are always fresh as well all of the other ingredients. They\'ve got plenty of salad dressings and toppings. \n\nOn to the stuff that everyone wants, but rarely matters to me. Seafood! There\'s so much food in general, that I basically ignore all the crab legs and other seafood. There is sushi available and it looks ok. I think I had it back in December and it wasn\'t anything to brag about. \n\nBellagio seems to specialize in giving you different "gourmet" type foods. I especially loved the Kobe Beef Top Sirloin, Beef Wellington, Roasted Turkey and the Ostrich. Although, I\'ve never ate Ostrich, I thought it was cool that they had it! They also had roasted Quail. Didn\'t try it but hey if you\'re adventurous, do you!\n\nBellagio also has all of the staple foods that regular buffets have. Super creamy and fluffy mashed potatoes (& a pesto version), fresh artisan bread, Asian cuisine, pastas, and carved meats.\n\nDeserts is where I think Bellagio sets itself from the Rio. Rio has a lot of selection, as does Bellagio. But Bellagio\'s cheesecake is legitimate. I think it\'s plain cheesecake with a fruit topping is equivalent to cheesecake factory. The cheesecake itself is very rich and smooth. And they have other deserts as well. I ate a few different things, but usually you\'re too full to even eat desert, depending on who you are.\n\nAll in all, Bellagio to me is the best buffet in Las Vegas. I prefer it over any other buffet that I\'ve been to and the service is great. They constantly filled up my drink, took away my dishes and offered advice on food. I\'m sure there\'s people that may disagree with me, but ehh they\'re not as cool as me! haha.\n\nGo to Bellagio and eat the buffet. Don\'t waste your money on a cheap buffet that\'s gonna keep you on the toilet. Get quality & quantity here!'

But you just dont feel like you're dining in a 5 star hotel. For lunch, it's $19.99/person, which is not bad at all. But kids pay full price... I was surprised they dont give discount for kids... at Wynn you get half off for kids under 12. \n\nAgain, the food is pretty good. Nothing too memorable, just your typical buffet in Vegas, probably better than most places, but I have to say Wynn's buffet is a lot better, even though you pay a bit more. The most impressive section of the entire buffet is their dessert section. The cheesecakes are superb!"

S'The Buffet at Bellagio has a nice selection of food. It won\'t wow you over and the atmosphere isn\'t exactly hip, but I enjoyed what I had and ended my meal with a dessert of carrot cake, bread pudding, ice cream, and bananas foster. I love dessert and took a full buffet plate so I could pile it high with sweetness. I love America!\n\nAside from the prime rib (it was good but small) they were serving up Kobe beef the night I went. I had never tried Kobe before and...and...maybe it said "Kobey beef" or "Coby beef" because it wasn\'t exactly the most tender beef I\'ve ever had. The prime rib was actually more tender. Oh well.'

The bf and I went at the wrong time (noon basically) and it was so packed.  We waited a good while but I tried to keep telling myself it's worth it and it was.  The champagne with the brunch was a little over 30 bucks each which wasn't so bad.  Champagne wasn't that great but it was bottomless.  I recommend asking for orange juice to make a mimosa out of your champagne otherwise it's not so great by itself.  On to the food...\n\nTHREE WORDS...honey baked bacon...when you go to vegas you don't go on a diet and well...this was total gluttony but pretty good.  Other magical items:\nPrime Rib--juicy and great with the creamy horseradish\nCreamy Polenta--I'm a sucker for polenta and this was very good...creamy cheesy goodness\nBlue Cheese Pasta--this is an amazing dish if you love cheese.  Rich and awesome\nBaked Halibut--amazingly tasted like butter. \n\nThere's so much more I tried but those were the winners for me.  I must admit there's better things for dinner here but brunch wasn't so bad.  I ate a full three plates of those goodies and didn't eat for the rest of the day.

The beef wellington was well done and had very little seasoning.  As far as the rack of lamb, there was only med well and well done to choose from.

S'I had been scouting out the yelp reviews of this buffet for a couple of months, waiting for the next time my friend came into town so we could try it.  We went on the weekend for dinner and payed $40each.\n\nI must say that it was a huge disappointment.  I used to be a fan of the Rio seafood buffet, but it has gone way down in quality over the years so I was really looking forward to getting some King Crab legs at the Bellagio, even though it is chilled and not steamed.  \n\nTo my dismay, the crab was not good.  Both the King & Snow crab had no flavor and some of it actually smelled like it was bad.  But I am not basing my review on the dismal crab.\n\nI had read many posts about how good the Kobe beef, and the Beef Wellington were, and numerous other items that were great, and they just weren\'t all that good.  \n\nThe "Kobe" beef tasted like dry roast beef.  The Beef Wellington was ok(never had it before), but it didn\'t knock my socks off.  The Lamb chops were a bit gamey, and I\'ve had lots of Lamb.  One of the best things I\'ve ever tasted was a  Lamb Chop on the Oregon Coast, and this wasnt\' even close.\n\nThe sushi smelled foul and I only could muster up the courage to try the tuna, which was about what I would expect at a low dollar buffet. \n\nThe only high point was the Prime Rib and the very large & tasty Peel & Eat shrimp.  The Prime Rib was very good & the au jus was also really good.  The Prime Rib isn\'t as good as Lowry\'s Prime Rib, but it is top notch for Buffet Prime Rib.  I\'ve had many disappointments with buffet Prime Rib, and the Bellagio isn\'t one of them.  \n\nThere were also a couple of vegitable dishes & other sides that were good, but for the price, I expected way more.  The buffet at Green Valley Ranch is a third of the cost, and the quality of the food is much better.  Not as much selection of high end stuff, but when the crab, Kobe Beef, & Sushi all suck really bad, the point becomes moot.\n\nI gave it two stars because between the peel & eat shrimp & the good Prime Rib, I think I got my $$ worth.'

For a family of four, even with the vouchers, it still cost us $70 + tip.  The prime rib was good and they did have a good variety of seafood but it was just OK.  The sushi definitely was just buffet quality, nothing special and very limited choice. We had one server for our whole section so it was slow to get our dishes bussed and our waters refilled.\n\n All in all it was just an OK dining experience, and we left feeling stuffed from overeating of course.

Was lucky to try both during my trip - reading previous reviews, looks like food selection varies slightly daily. My review is based on what I ate - there was alot that I did not try.\n\nPrice\n- Bellagio is cheaper ($30) vs Wynn ($35)\n\nInterior/Atmosphere\n- Liked Wynn better - garden decorations, more airy brighter & comfortable, less noisy. Bellagio layout seemed more packed & noisy.\n\nService\n- Wynn servers were faster & more attentive and efficient (refills, plate  removal, coffee). \n\nFood\n- Crab goes to Bellagio. Wynn only had split King Crab. Bellagio had King Crab & Snow crab. Both served the crab split & cold - straight from the box (Wynn server kept refilling the buffet straight from the box, they could have done this better). Flavor of both about the same, both very fresh tasting. Wynn provided drawn butter - Bellagio did not.\n\nShrimp was tie - great at both places.\n\n- Red Meat goes to Wynn. Wynn prime rib was seasoned better - Bellagio tasted like any other buffet. Both offered leg of lamb but was dry. Bellagio offered Kobe sirloin - not memorable. Wynn offered lamb t-bone & osso bucco, both dry.\n\n- Sushi goes to Bellagio. Wynn did not offer. Bellagio also offered Steak tartar - was not appealing or tasty.\n\n- Salad/Fruit/Cheese/Cold meats - tie. I did not eat any green salads or fruit. Salad layouts looked great - I'd rate them a tie. Wynn had cold meats - very nice. Cheese at Bellagio was very nice (esp for dessert).\n\nDesserts goes to Wynn. Preparation of the deserts was better & more variety - loved the mango lychee tapioca. Wynn had more variety & was nicely presented in individual plastic flutes. Coffee was hot at Bellagio, Wynn was warm.\n\nIn summary\n- Close Tie based on food alone. After trying both, I'm happy to report that both had very nice buffets & can highly recommend them both. If you are crunched for time & need to pick one, go for Wynn - based on atmosphere & service."

S"I didn't think this was even worth 30$. The Kobe beef was over cooked and it took a stiff steak knife to cut it. It tasted like the prime rib but too tough. If you do go get the crab legs, sausage was pretty good, shrimp cocktail and for dessert, coffee shooter, chocolate moose cups and mini key lime pies.\nIf you like lamb don't get their lamb ribs they are horrible.y over cooked. Not worth it in my opinion"

S"Loved this buffet.  As a fish-eating vegetarian (ok, pescatarian) all-you-can-eat buffets are rarely a good deal, but I definitely got my money's worth at this one.   \n\nThere were tons of interesting non-meat options; beyond an abundance of salads and pastas there were also less common-place grains, noodles, and well-prepared vegetables available.   Loved the unlimited sushi.   The desserts were plentiful and tasty.   \n\nI wish there hadn't been a 1 hour wait to get in (Monday night in March) but that was my only complaint."

S"Okay, this is my second time at the Buffet. The first time I was really impressed, the food was delicious and there was such a big variety. And the dessert buffet! The best. \nSo i decided to come back 3 weeks later with my family. It was a Wednesday night, there wasn't a big line and not top busy. \nThe food was again delicious, but the service was the worst. We were 3 adults and a kid and had ordered drinks for 3 adults, but it seemed like after 2 drinks it was a problem giving them to us. Our waitress seemed more and more angry and did not smile or talk back when we asked her to bring drinks. After 1.45 hours she said that we couldn't get more drinks and had to go. WHAT. Okay, on the receipt it says that they would like if people would stay no longer than 2 hours, but we just asked for a last drink. Well, she came back and said you can get a last one. And then in one of the drinks there were bugs in the ice cubes. BUGS. So gross. We talked to the manager and she apologized and we got the money back for 1 unlimited drinks (around $13). \n\nI am never coming back, good food, but that can never make up for the bad bad service, and BUGS in the ice cubes. EWW"

Both have your typical variety of food and desserts, but Wynn is a few ticks better than Bellagio for the reason that my experience felt better."

The price of what you pay also isn't terrible so it's good for what it gives you."

S"After reading the other reviews, I was prepared to love the Bellagio Buffet.  Having just left there though, I must admit I'm pretty disappointed. \n\nWe arrived at 2pm on a Thursday and the line reached the telephones outside the restaurant.  It moved pretty steadily though, and my party of 4 was seated in 40 minutes.  In general, the service was pretty sloppy.  There were times when up to 6 dirty plates were piled up on our table and aside from iced tea, which they filled pretty regularly, I had to flag someone down to get another drink.\n\nFrom the carving stations, I tried the flank steak, kobe, prime rib, chicken, and ribs.  The flank was marinated wonderfully and the ribs were awesome, but everything else was pretty meh, either over or undercooked.\n\nThe shrimp were plentiful and tasty, plus come pre-shelled.  The crab legs didn't come out until dinner and the line to get them was maybe 15 deep at first, but died down after about half an hour.  Tonight had both snow and king.  I didn't appreciate the fact that they're cut in half as much as I expected - you usually can't pull the meat out in one piece because there's a layer of cartilage in the middle.  Also, they didn't do a very good job defrosting them since most of my legs still had chunks of ice in them, but you can ask someone behind the counter to heat them up for you.\n\nThe lunch sushi options are pretty bare, but sashimi comes out at dinnertime.  Although I've seen ads of the buffet having dim sum, they only had BBQ pork buns.  I think there were four types of pasta and all but one was vegetarian.  The tortellini was really good.  I was also a fan of the pesto mashed potatoes.\n\nThe salad bar had a few premade salads, my favorite being the spinach and bacon one.  During lunch it had a bunch of deli meats and cheese, but they were taken away for dinner.  The mozzarella balls are a must-try!\n\nThe dessert station had about 30 options, all beautifully made and each approximately two-bite-size.  About 20 of them were little tarts or cakes, and then there was bread pudding, brownies, and cookies.  I saw three sugar-free options.  I probably shared about 10 desserts with my mom.  Everything was pretty good, but my favorites were the cheesecake, creme brulee, and key lime tart.  My sister was a huge fan of the fruit tarts and ate about six.\n\nAll in all, I felt like I got my $19.99 worth for lunch, but I don't know if it's worth the $29.99 for dinner.  However, given that it's generally ranked one of the top three buffets in Vegas, I feel like it's a bit overrated.  I had a much better experience at Le Village Buffet across the street at Paris Las Vegas when I came here a few years ago."

S'Date: November 20, 2009\nGood: Variety of all different types of food to try as well as the deserts.\nBad: $30 per person and food was average. \nSummary: If you want to try a wide range of dishes from different parts of the earth without going to many resurants this will work for you. If you want a specific type of dinner that is beyond average look somewhere else that specializes in it.'

S"Everything in the buffet at the Bellagio is tasty. The fried rice, noodles, stir-fry, the Mexican, the greasy breakfast, the desserts, the shrimp, the pizza, the lobster, the pastries, the salads (they have a wicked good seaweed salad), you name it. Service ain't bad, either.\n\nThe buffet is amazing, but not so amazing that you should wait in a long line to get in. If the line's moving and you want (lots of) good eats, it's probably worth the wait. Not really convincing, am I? Well, I'm holding back because this buffet sports a fantastic price: ~$40 for brunch/lunch! If you focus on eating seafood - selectively feasting upon lobster claws, shrimp cocktail, and fish - it's easy enough to stuff yourself silly with your money's worth."

S"We beat the holiday rush of prices paying $29.99 per person for dinner.  Surprisingly rated top 10 buffets in Las Vegas, it was nothing special.  Even the Wynn had ice sculptures and chocolatiers (from what I can remember).  The buffet was disappointing to say the least but a bit better than some other buffets that I've had.  \n\nFood: Why are the crab legs always cold?  Can't they serve them hot for once?  I don't like to eat any seafood cold.  The desserts were probably the best but like any other mass produced food, the best was the creme brulee and the strawberry tart with vanilla pudding on the bottom.  The sushi was mediocre being laid out and people taking mass quantity at one time.  This is a buffet, leave some for the people in line won't ya?  The meats were okay but with all the people hoarding the food, the presentation lacked its luster.\n\nService:  We were fortunate to get chosen from the line with the number of people in our party (so avoided a 2 hour wait so we heard).  We ended up sitting at the bar area and the staff was very pleasant and nice.  \n\nLayout: Like most buffets, they try to separate things however with the seafood and meats compacted in the same area, better to spread out the lines instead of cramming them through the sitting area.  I did not want to do any of those lines, so mostly salads, desserts, and italian for me.  There was not a lot of varied selection which I found surprising.  Even the rio carnival buffet had more I thought (haven't been there in years, so can't vouch now).\n\nI wouldn't go back...definitely going to try the M studio buffet the next time.  Although further south of the strip, worth to try something new for that price.  I hear it even includes champagne/wine as part of your meal purchase.  Can't beat that!"

S"The Bellagio breakfast was just ok.\n\nWe came for the cheapest of their buffets - weekday breakfast, more on the later side so we could cross-over in to lunch. I think I was just not in the right frame of mind, or the buffet was having an off day, but nothing really stood out or grabbed me, and I even began to question my buffet-loving self!\n\nThe best was their fresh french toast & pancakes. Absolutely amazing, warm and fluffy. Big vat of bread pudding? Always a huge plus. Two different kinds of breakfast potatos? All delicious. Tons of different breakfast pastries, from a myriad of muffins to (a very good) cinnamon bun and danishes? Check! Maybe I carbo-loaded too much? I did have lotsa beautiful fruits, though!\n\nBy the time lunch came around I was tuckered out and nothing really spoke to me. However I tried their fresh pizza & it was great! Desserts were super disappointing because none of them tasted fresh. Not even their cute little shapes could sway me, which was sad.\n\nThey had a lot of cold vegetarian options which was great, and some warm veggies but nothing too sensational. I didn't try what looked to be Pad Thai because it looked a little too forced to me..\n\nMaybe it was the ambiance - a little dumpy, and the layout was a bit chaotic. I promise I will try you again, Bellagio Buffet. Someday!"

S'Got into Vegas on a Sunday afternoon. After getting all checked in we decided to head on over here for their Sunday brunch. Pricing was good plus we got the unlimited mimosas. We arrived around 340 and there was no line. Brunch pricing runs until 4. At 4 the buffet switches to dinner and the crab legs come out. The food here was decent. Nothing spectacular. Their prime rib was good. The crab legs were ok. Nothing special there. Was too impatient to go and get them steamed somewhere else, although that would have made them better. The highlight of this brunch definitely would be the unlimited mimosas. It was a great way to start a mini vacation in Vegas. Plus they were not stingy on the champage to OJ ratio. Even though the brunch ends at 4, they will keep filling the glasses until 5!'

S"I told myself that on my next trip to Vegas, I was gonna try one of the nicer buffets on the Strip. My husband & I stayed at Paris, and it was a choice between Wicked Spoon and The Buffet. While I was intrigued by Wicked Spoon's mac and cheese bar, we went to the Bellagio.\n\nWe waited in line for about 45 minutes on a Monday night. It was worth the wait. The prime rib was awesome; the Kobe sirloin was even better. The cold shrimp was fresh, and the pasta had lots of flavor. Even the sea bass was good, and I never eat sea bass. I tried four of their desserts: my favorite was the tiramisu. The only thing I didn't like much was the shrimp in the paella, but that's a very minor quibble. \n\nOverall: great food, our server was really nice, even when she forgot my water, and it was definitely the best buffet we'd ever eaten at (at this point, anyway). It's definitely worth the splurge... although the Friday/Sat. prices seem a bit steep."

But, it is Vegas and the reviews were so good.  The husband really, really wanted to try a Vegas buffet, so I said OK as long as we went to one like Bellagio or Wynn. It really is just a buffet.  Yes, there are crab legs. And, my guess is that is where all of the money goes.  You will see people with giant crab leg piles walking past you. Everything was pretty mediocre. Mediocre sushi, mediocre prepared salads, beautiful desserts that taste mediocre. There is a lot of meat, but it is pretty mediocre and kind of lacking in flavor. The pretzel bread, olive bread, pesto mashed potatoes, sorbet, and mac n cheese were really good.  For me, the highlight of the meal."

S'Not worth the money or the wait in line. I went to the buffet for Brunch on a Saturday... The food was just "ok". It was edible, but nothing to go run home and tell your mother about it. The waffles were too hard and dry. The meats were extra fatty and very rare. The eggs were super runny. The breakfast sausage was good, but that\'s pretty hard to screw up. The pizza was ok too. The muscles were dry. The king crab legs were ok for buffet standards. The pork belly was juicy & delicious, They did not have too many options for desserts, just your standards, I tried almost one of everything but was only happy with the keylime tart. \n\nOverall I think the Belliago Buffet is more on the old school vegas vibe. With standard options. The newer hotel buffets on the strip (i.e. Cosmopolitan, Aira, etc) seems to give not only the standards but different variations of them as well as providing other unique options for the same price as this buffet.'

S"I had high expectations for Bellagio's buffet. We had stayed at the MGM 6 times previously. We decided to stay at the Belaggio  this time. EVERYTHING is better at the Bellagio.except the buffet....I am a foodie and went to the MGM buffet more than 10 times. It has TONS of choices and actually wasn't bad...I was expecting much better from Bellaggio based on reading reviews... SO disappointed. If you like fewer choices and shoe leather than this is your place. Otherwise, I swear, with the exception of the salads, the sweet potatoes and the marinated cucumbers at the sushi bar, EVERYTHING else got thrown out on my plate. I kept trying things since I figured SOMETHING must be good here.  Here is what I tried : chow mein. It was all right. Crab legs: Over cooked and way too salty and gristly. mashed potatoes: Not bad. Sweet potatoes : AWESOME. Sushi: Rice was horrible, shrimp tempura was OLD and way too salty. Char sui: BLAND , tasteless and I spit it out. Salads: Fresh and very good. Cous cous: too salty and blah. Shrimp cocktail: Hard to screw up defrosting shrimp so ,not bad. Roast: Overcooked and tasteless.cucumber salad at sushi bar: Tasty but OLD.Beef bourguignon: carrots undercooked, and HEAVY oregano taste. Yuck. Smoked trout: Good. Salmon: Absolutely tasteless.....! Manicotti: NO flavor... bland pasty with NO flavor in tomato sauce.... again I threw it all out. I tried teh butternut squash with cinnamon: It tasted like someone microwaved it and didn't even finish the job: TASTELESS and undercooked... anyway, on top of all of this, the smoke from the Casino,  gets sucked into the entire buffet area. I have asthma so this was awful. I asked the manager how it could smell like smoke. She explained the place acted like a vacuum. It pulled all the smoke into the buffet... OMG.. anyway, the line was also 30 minutes. We will NEVER go back. I asked for a refund from my hotel it was so bad. I have never done that before. My husband is sick and laying next to me  because of the food. guess it was good I barely ate. Plus it was more expensive than MGM. My advice: If you want a decent buffet, go to the MGM."

Not only were there many choices for me, the variety was well worth it. The layout of the buffet was nice and stations did not repeat themselves instead you have many more choices including the standards but the specialty was what made it perfect. \n\nThe restroom is inside the premises so you don't need to venture off like most places fighting your way through the crowds in the casino to try to rush back. The service was a little slower than I would have expected but the personalities were great and didn't frown on my 3 drink choices (couldn't make up my minds)."

S"The Bellagio buffet is probably one of the best, if not the best, buffet in Vegas. There is a reason why you will probably wait an hour for the Saturday brunch buffet. The buffet is massive and has offering such as lox, bagels, eggs, pasta, Chinese food, sushi, Vietnamese spring rolls, steamed shrimp, salads, and a good carving station. We also got the champagne Saturday brunch which also featured bottomless champagne for $30 ($25 for buffet only).\n\nThe lox were very fresh and not fishy. I wouldn't expect such high quality lox at a buffet, but it was a pleasant surprise. The Vietnamese springs rolls were also awesome. I tried the eggs benedict which were good, as well as items from the carving station. The only miss was probably the Chinese food. It was a worse than hole-in-the-wall Chinese, primarily because of the amount of oil present in each dish and the lack of quality sauces and preparation. Everything else was top notch though. \n\nThis buffet definitely trumps any others that I have been to, including the Paris buffet, which I also liked quite a bit."

Go at the cusp between meals (like 10ish between breakfast or 4ish between lunch and dinner) and you can sample more things. If you have the room. The food quality here is top notch. Several good sushi options, great pasta dishes like mushroom ravioli, kobe beef tenderloin, prime rib, squab, great gravies, and all kinds of other stuff. From the simple cheese and fruit to the well-crafted fancy desserts, this place does it right. This is a must visit when in Vegas.'

I felt like the Carnival Buffet was more of a cafeteria style type of place, versus the Bellagio. I had high expectations coming here, as my friend recommended me to this place just hours before the epic fail Rock and Roll Las Vegas Marathon and 1/2 marathon.\n\nI basically had my fill of protein worth of prime rib, which was pretty awesome. The dessert was tempting, so I had some cheese cake. The seafood fare was good, although it could have been a bit more improved.  Loved the ambiance of the fine dining aspect of it.

S'So... has the staff at Bellagio gotten lazy or something?  I\'ve heard so many great things about the buffet at Bellagio and how their "gourmet" selections offer the best value.  However that is not the case at all.  \n\nThis place is still popping, with my group having to wait 40 minutes around 2pm.  Once we got in, we were seated extremely close to other tables and it felt a little weird.  In fact, I think the layout of the place is weird.\n\nI was really excited to try the Kobe beef at the carving station but the piece I received was way too well done.  It felt like I was chewing leather and all the good things about Kobe beef was not there.  I decided to give it a 2nd chance and went back for another piece.  Slightly better but still, the meat had nothing going for it.  Wasn\'t seasoned well, and I think I can definitely make a better steak.  It just felt like they popped it on the grill and the oven and just forgot about it.\n\nAll the other foods are alright in comparison to some other buffets.  I do like how they crack the crab legs in half already for you so you don\'t have to do work.  Dessert station is the only thing worth mentioning since there is a good selection and that creme brulee is magical.  I probably ate around 4-5.\n\nThe buffet probably was good when it first.  The quality of this buffet has probably dropped and I think that\'s a problem that all hotels face eventually.  They have to find ways to reinvent themselves or just somehow maintain that standard that make them great the first go around.  Unfortunately, Bellagio definitely needs to do that or else nobody will shell out $30-40 again for the buffet.'

S'If I lived in Vegas, I would eat here for every meal and have a forklift carry me out every time. This is the most bang for buck buffet ever. It has amazing selection and the quality is up there. \n\nTar tars and smoked salmon to start. Half-split crab legs and unpeeled jumbo schrimp to, well, continue starting because I\'m eaiting for days. Skip all the pasta and bread, and get some Chilean Sea Bass, Prime Rib, Wellington. Repeat this a few times, then hit up dessert. There are so many different desserts that it can make a meal in itself if you just ate that. Some Creme Brule, Tarts, and Cakes and you\'ll be in heaven or you just feel bulemic as you search for the closest toilet.\n\nThis is by far the best 10,000 calorie meal your money can buy. Make sure you go between Mon-Thurs; you save like $8 for pratically the same food. If you feel guilty, just go clubbing that night and get hyphy/ dance it off/ "walk it out."'

S"Buffets are really hard to judge. One day, it could be great another day, it could just be okay or even bad and I really think it could be just the times you go. Ths is my first time eating at the Bellagio buffet and even though it cost more than other buffets I usually eat at, I give it five stars. \n\nTheir selections were great and have foods I haven't seen at other buffets or tasted such as a made to order creamy seafood sauce with veggies to your liking poured inside a puff pastry bowl (I don't remember the actual name but it starts with Vul). I usually go to the buffets for King crab legs, however, this time, the prime rib and the creamy seafood pastry entree are definitely the stars.\n\nTheir desserts are beautifully prepared and very tasty. By the time dessert comes, I always want to eat more but my belly told me stop.\n\nEverything I tried was just yummy and I am definitely coming back for more."

At 18 bucks a person, this was a steal and kept us full until dinner. (Oatmeal and coffee had cost 20 bucks at Starbucks the day before, to put things in perspective). Unlimited juice and coffee!

The best part was the shrimp/crab and cocktail sauce. Stick with that. The rest of the things were standard buffet fare. Defintely stay away from the 'pasta bar': where you can choose red or white sauce, pasta, and vegetables, and they heat it up for you. It's not good at all. \n\nBut really, just eat the crab/shimp and cocktail sauce."

S"Wow... so for the second night in Vegas for the first time in my life... we went to The Buffet at the Bellagio.  The line wasn't extremely long from the front, even on a Friday night.  We did get there pretty early around 6:30, which gave us enough time for our 10pm show.  Once we paid, we were promptly seated.  This place is huge.  We quickly went to get our first plates (yes, PLATES, plural) of food.  I went straight for some veggies, fish, slice of pizza, crab legs.  There are maybe about five to seven buffets... Sushi/Salads/Mediterranean; Meats (Turkey, Kobe Beef, Rack of Lamb, Prime Rib) which also has the asparagus, mushrooms, mash potatoes; Italian (pizzas, pesto pasta, ravioli, lasagna type thing); Asian (fried rice, fish...etc.); and a few other buffets that I didn't want to try.  The desserts are phenomenal!  The must-trys are the creme brulee and the sorbets (raspberry and peach).  They had a lot of unique pastries as well.  Overall, I'd definitely eat here again... but be willing to fork out close to $100 for two people."

Note to self, never expect too much or else you are in for a 3-star awakening. My dinner party was not too impressed either. One friend dusted off 4 plates full of snow-crab legs to get his money's worth while the other friend insisted that the pizza was extremely good. Okay, I get it! My recommendation sucked.

We have it all in local LA buffets (like Hokaido) for half price on daily basis (including seafood). At Paris you at least have the nice settings of sort of French village.

The cashiers are not friendly at All and act as if they can't understand or hear your half of the time. We were almost overcharged more than once, which was simply annoying.

At lunch 11 am there was  lots of fresh shrimp and the breakfast items ( eggs Benedict ) looked fresh and delicious . For the price , it was well worth it . But you have to go with a HUGE appitite !

Well at least about how much food they had there so of course I had to try it.\n\nWe spent the $35 for dinner, got there around your typical dinner time on a Saturday night.  The wait was pretty short, about 15-20 min.  \n\nWell my friends were right they had a TON of food.  And this was death to my stomach.  I kid you not, I sat here for over 2 hours eating and eating and eating.  Long after my bf stopped I was still going at it (hey I had to his $35 worth of food!)\n\nI really liked the spicy tuna hand rolls!!!  The kobe beef was okay, I like some of their other meats better.  The soups and pastas were good too.  What I liked the best were the desserts!!!!!!!!!  They had so many and they all looked so pretty!  I took a giant bite of at least 8 different ones.  The chocolate covered strawberries weren't as good as they looked.  I don't think the strawberries were that fresh...in fact some of them tasted like they were starting to go bad =(\n\nAlso the crab legs were so salty and kind of tasted like nothing.

S"Although pricey, I really enjoy the Bellagio buffet because their offerings are more creative, gourmet, and upscale than other buffets I've been to.  For example, they offered Kobe top sirloin when I was there, which was absolutely delicious.  They also had a station where they cooked-to-order a dish made of seafood, vegetables, and puff pastry with a cream sauce.  Other notable items were the pesto mashed potatoes and the lobster ravioli.  I also really like their pre-made salad station--I tried the one with mixed greens, pecans, cranberries, and a maple dressing, and it was so good that I would have been happy just eating that the whole time.  Their dessert selection is just out of this world, but unfortunately I was too full to try any!\n\nOne downside for me was the price, which ended up being $45 after tax and gratuity (automatic 18% gratuity added for parties of 8 or more).  The other downside, which some may disagree with, is how they split the crab legs for you.  I, personally, like having the experience of working through crab legs.  When all the work had been done for you, you focus more on the taste of the crab which I found too salty.  Regardless, I still see myself coming back next time I come to Vegas."

They offer fruit-juicy watermelon, delicious desserts, chinese food, breakfast (runny scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, pototates), ham was moist, turkey, sushi, shrimp, soups.  The food was plentiful.  I waited at 4pm to eat their dinner and it's better than the brunch.  The dinner offer ribs, beef wellington, wings, crab legs(lines were long at 4pm then the lines died down), shrimp, fruit, salad, etc.   The servers were great and refill our sodas very often.

S"So I don't know what happened but for the absolute longest I had strong opinions about not liking this buffet.  Maybe I came at the wrong time but I very vividly remember thinking the food was not all that and it was over hyped and not cracked up to how great everyone said it was.  I just remember all of the flavors being a little muted and bland and everything tasting blah and I swear I almost chipped my tooth on the toast.  So years  (or a decade, whatever) went by and I was urged to try it out once more.  Sure why not.  I was very surprised I feel like they must have revamped it.  The quality of the food was much better than I remembered. So anyway I wanted to give a shout out to one of the employees Silvia holding it down in the fruit and cheese department.  On  one of my trips I noticed they didn't gave granola.  I asked a few employees if they had it.  Almost all of them but one (Silvia) sort of shrugged it off saying it wasn't offered that day.  Silvia however, went in the back brought it out, and tracked me down in a sea of people to show me where she placed it! Who does that?!  Plus it was a pleasant surprise the food was definitely of a higher caliber than I previously remembered."

S"Sunday brunch buffet, after an absolutely atrocious visit to the Spice Market Buffet the prior night, which had us a little concerned that all the criticism of Vegas buffets was becoming warranted!  After a wait of around ten fifteen minutes we made it to the promised land!  Unlike Spice Market (once upon a time a Vegas fave of ours), just about all the food looked quite appealing!  How can eggs Benedict from a buffet be so darned good?!  I'm a massive fan of breakfast food, and nothing I had was disappointing.  Wife loves her fruit, and was especially pleased by the watermelon.  It was one of those experiences where you almost wish you were back in Roman orgy days (oops... wrong casino!) so you could go to the vomitorium and then come back for more delectibles!!!  I'm oh so close to giving the buffet 5 stars, but drop one as a result of mediocre coffee, the lack of personalized stations other than for omellettes, and too many limp and rubbery-looking pieces of bacon to wade through to find some crispier gems.  Thanks for restoring our faith in quality Vegas buffets, Bellagio!"

I believe they only serve it during dinner though, but it\'s worth the wait!  You know that saying, "It melts in your mouth like butter?"  "It" is their Sea Bass. \n\nThe offerings at the Bellagio Buffet have always been solid.

I went on a Saturday wherein they charge $36 for a gourmet dinner.  They have the usual... Salad, pasta, Chinese, Japanese, blah blah blah.  I tried a little bit of everything, they all taste good, but couldn't resist stopping by the meat section for another serving of the lamb everytime I passed by.

S'The Buffet at Bellagio is quite the attraction. And for good reason. It is one of the best in Vegas. I would not call it tops, but it is up there. As is the case for anything that is good, there was a long wait. But the lines move quickly and the turnover time seems to be reasonable.\n\nI tried out the breakfast buffet which is a good deal for $15.95. A lot to choose from here. This include your typical bakery favorites like muffins and croissants, alongside sweet dessert items, fruit, oatmeal and cereals for those with a lighter appetite. \n\nFor those of you with a bigger one, there is a lot to choose from here. They had your typical breakfast favorites like sausages (regular and chorizo), bacon, eggs, waffles and pancakes. But they do also have extra things like an omelet bar. They even had a Chinese selection for those preferring more ethnic cuisine. Also nice was the selection of breakfast pizzas offered. I thoroughly enjoyed each item I tried here.\n\nIf you are in no rush to get up, I would suggest hitting up this buffet a little later, say around 10 am. This way, you will be able to enjoy breakfast and also try some of the things on the lunch menu! \n\nI left completely full and satisfied, so much so that I skipped lunch altogether.

S'The Bellagio buffet does not live up to the hype. While the selection of the food is pretty good during dinner, the flavors of just about everything I tried was mediocre at best. Everything was either overcooked or oversalted, especially the crab legs, which tasted like it had been boiled in pure salt water after being split in half. The only savory food I enjoyed was the salmon and ahi poke and grilled asparagus. The dessert station here is pretty small and pathetic as well, especially compared to the buffets at the Wynn and Paris. At least the tiramisu and apple cobbler I tried were good, since many of the other desserts fell flat. \n\nThe only good thing about my experience here was that we paid lunch prices ($20) for dinner on a weekend, since the nice Asian hostess hurried our party of four in through the guarded entrance just 3 minutes before 4 pm. \n\nI guess one has to accept the fact that a buffet is still a buffet at the end of the day.'

Omelettes and crepes to order, pancakes, french toast, waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, chorizo with peppers, black beans, toast, roasted potatoes, pizza, fruit, granola, etc, etc.  Breakfast was all-around great.  Definitely worth $15.\n\nI stuck to my dinner plan and ate lotsa protein!  Kobe beef, venison, rack of lamb, prime rib, beef wellington, sea bass, sushi, crab, etc.   Probably worth $30 if you don't fill up on carbs.  I did try tiny bites of a couple of the pasta offerings and they were delicious but I wanted to get my money's worth so mainly had the meats.  Grilled asparagus was also very good.  \n\nThe reviews of things like sushi are all over the place so I decided to check it out.  It wasn't bad, actually.  The rice was a little mushy, but the fish was fresh so it was nice to sample a couple of pieces.  My fiance had dozens of crab legs, literally.  So, he was happy!\n\nAs for desserts, the creme brulee, the cappuccino mousse and the tiramisu were all very good.\n\nThere was so much that I really didn't have time (or stomach space) to try it all.  There's always next time."

S'Bellagio Buffet used to be the cream of the crop and I haven\'t eaten here in a number of years.  This past week, we went back and my perception of the buffet has been smashed. We went on a Tuesday for lunch and there was a pretty long wait which was a good sign.  We got to the front, paid the 22 dollars and got quickly seated.  Server promptly took our order and we were off to the races.\n\nThe carver stations had st. louis ribs and flank steak which were both pretty good.  And those were the only two redeeming dishes at the buffet.  We tried the spicy tuna handroll and it was packed with red pepper flakes which didn\'t go over so well.  The selection was really lacking (in comparison to the new buffets on the block like Wicked Spoon and Caesar\'s).  For sushi, there was only the tuna handrolls, a veggie roll and a california roll.  The asian food section had 1 shu mai, some rice porridge, fried rice and chinese veggies.  \n\nThe last time I was here, Bellagio was the best.  But that was in 2003 and I don\'t think they\'ve upped their game since then while other places have gotten bigger, better and cleaner.  Sad to say, I don\'t think I\'ll come back here.  As the great poet Ice Cube once said, "You used to be the Don Juan, but now your name is just Toine".'

There wasn't as much as variety as I was expecting. Though the hotel itself is wonderful, there are better places to eat. If you want a buffet worth the price try Planet Hollywood."

S"I waited about 1.5 hours on a Saturday evening and paid $40 (including tax). The food was definitely not worth the price or the wait. Given the Saturday dinner time and price, this was supposed to be Bellagio's top of the line buffet. There was a really big selection of food. However, the taste was truly subpar. Crab legs were really salty that evening. And actually, everything was incredibly salty. It was like Bellagio's approach was to oversalt everything and overpower all flavors. There was also some truly terrible Thai food that would not even be worthy of any regular restaurant, much less a world class buffet. If the buffet were $20, it might merit three starts, but for $40, it's really bad."

S"I gave it 5 stars because I've eaten at several buffets in Vegas and there's only one other that compares (Bachanal Buffet at Ceasar's Palace). I'm going to include this at the top of my review: IF THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF YOU...DO NOT WAIT IN LINE. Go to the front and ask to sit at the bar. The wait was over 45 minutes, but thanks to another reviewer, we read that smaller parties can sit at the bar and jump the line. Just ask the hostess to check for you. Our entire meal lasted almost 2 hours and we were the only two people sitting there so we got to know our bartender and had a great time. \n\nWe went here for dinner and even though it's over $40 per person for dinner, it's cheaper than two people eating at any of the high end restaurants in the Casino. Some of the pasta was a little over cooked, but the selection was great and the desserts were awesome. Mini creme brulee, eclairs, tiramisu, soft serve ice cream, Frangelico cups, macaroons, carrot cake, etc The dessert bar at Ceasar's is definitely larger, but the Bellagio's was still impressive and everything on it was great. For dinner, there were two types of fish, two types of crab legs, cocktail shrimp, several meat carving stations, mid grade sushi that I didn't try because I'm picky and there were things that looked better, salad, pizza, and pastas. The bread selection was good with several artisan breads and our service was great. I forget her name, but she was just the cutest southern lady and we had a great time talking with her while we ate."

The outdoor seating and indoor seating are both comfortable, though inside it is a little cramped. \n\nI love the white pizzas ( I can't remember the name, but it doesn't have traditional marinara-type sauce) and they have great salads, too.\n\nThey are pricey- if I remember about $16-20 per person, and I didn't get full.\n\nBUT it is a great experience and everyone should at least TRY it.

S"It took three tries to eat here. The first time we called (Sunday), it was closed. And according to their voicemail greeting, Pizzeria Bianco was booked for the next two months. The second time, we were told that there was a three hour wait, at which news we freaked out a little and ended up going to another restaurant. The third time, we showed up an hour before the restaurant opened so that we only had to wait TWO hours for a table. We were in Arizona, dammit, and by golly we were going to eat at this pizza place everyone kept recommending even if it killed us. \n\nLuckily, they strategically opened their bar next door at 4 p.m. so that we could drown our boredom in cider and Mexican Coke while we waited. Their hostesses were stunning and very sweet, and very skilled at keeping hungry people happy during a two-hour wait.\n\nWe ended up ordering the Margherita, Rosa, Biancoverde, and Wiseguy pizzas. The Margherita and especially the Biancoverde were quite good and light. The Rosa and Wiseguy were very salty and oily. I wouldn't order them again. Still, the meal felt satisfying. \n\nPizzeria Bianco reminds me very much of Basic in San Diego; both places have the floppy, slightly charred, thin-crust pizzas, the rugged brick walls, the wood burning oven. But Basic has no wait, better hours, a full bar, cheaper pizza pies, and more toppings to choose from.\n\nSo is Pizzeria Bianco worth the wait? Sure, but more so you can say you experienced a Phoenix institution than for the food. 3.5 stars."

S"First trip here in awhile.  A couple of things to update since my last visit.  For starters, they now have longer hours so you can take in this place for lunch, dinner, or a mid-afternoon meal.  We came here for lunch around Noon on a Saturday and didn't have to wait long for a spot inside.  Second, they now have dessert offerings.  Today I had their flourless chocolate cake and it was unquestionably the best flourless chocolate cake I've ever had.  Smooth, rich, velvety texture that is easily sharable.  The one thing that hasn't changed much are the pizzas.  The pizzas choices are limited, but good and are made in the same brick oven that has garnered worldwide acclaim for years.  Today my family and I split a margherita, a wise guy (a white pizza with sausage, mozzarella & onion), and a biancoverde (a white pizza with three different cheeses and arugula).  All had great clean texture and a crispy crust.\n\nBianco is a Phoenix institution and now has locations in central Phoenix and soon will be opening a location in Tucson.  With good reason.  It's good pizza.  But despite the hype and the accolades, I still can't declare this the best pizza I've had in AZ.  That title still belongs to Pomo just down the road in Downtown Phoenix.  In my own humble opinion, Cibo and Bianco are pretty evenly matched, but Pomo is just a step above.\n\nThat said, Bianco has a great product and (as long as you're okay waiting in line for awhile) is worth trying at least once.  From the ambience of its historic downtown location, to the friendly servers and pizzailolos, Bianco definitely offers a unique experience.  Some of you might even find you like Bianco more than the other local titans I mentioned.  Just be sure to pack your patience when you ask for a table."

S'The food at Pizzeria Bianco was okay, but I was actually thoroughly disappointed in my experience. It may have been that it had been built up for me for a long time, but the wait was long, the food wasn\'t the greatest, and the place itself was a bit cramped.\n\n1. Wait-time: Before I actually had my first dining experience there, I had tried 4 times previously to eat at Pizzeria Bianco. They don\'t take reservations, and the line is always out the door (or at least with 4-5 other groups ahead of you). On the day I actually had enough time to wait, I waited around 30 minutes to get seated, and another 10 or so for a waiter, and another 20 after that for the food to come out, for about an hour of total waiting time. \n**One good thing about the wait was that they had another building for you to sit and order appetizers/drinks if you wanted before you got seated.\n\n2. Food: I don\'t quite understand the hype of this pizza. The crust was burnt and the toppings were not the best either- I tried three types of pizza, sharing it with the friends I was with, but honestly, none of them struck me as absolutely amazing. \n\n3. Small room: I would estimate that there are about 8 tables at the place. Even after waiting for so long, we were stuck at the farthest corner of the restaurant by the restroom, and even that table was severely cramped. One of my friends was squished into the corner while another was awkwardly eating off of a side. \n\nI don\'t regret this experience at all- I have to say it was worth trying, just because it was rated the "Best Pizza in the US" by various celebrity/food critic sources. I just personally wouldn\'t claim it as the best pizza I\'ve ever had.'

S"Alright, let's move beyond the whole best-pizza-in-the-country conversational paradigm for just a ding-dang minute, folks.\n\nThis restaurant has created a wonderful way to enjoy your meal, something that is truly (and sadly) unique in Phoenix.  The long wait becomes an opportunity to relax - to slow down, and sip wine in a charming cottage, on a grass lawn, surrounded by historic brick houses, in the shadow of the modernist science center.\n\nThe wine and beer list is well-curated, the staff is attentive, and the carefree pace continues throughout the night.  Once seated, you are served in an environment that is casual but respectful.  Last time I went, the couple at the table next to us got their check 15 minutes after we sat down - and they were still there when we left.\n\nThe food isn't always impeccable - and where else is it, at $12-15 a person?  But the ingredients are always fresh, the dough is delicious even when soggy, and the atmosphere cannot be beat.\n\nHonestly, it's something people don't talk about enough.  This is a place that is heralded as (at least one of) the best pizza places in the country, and a schlub like me can afford to take my beautiful wife.  We can both enjoy a glass of wine, a night under the stars, and delicious pizza for under $50.\n\nWell done, Pizzeria Bianco.  Well done.\n\nIf you are coming here with your guard up, daring them to impress you, and aren't willing to slow down and embrace the whole experience, go to Cibo or Parlor or something.  That's not a knock on them, I'm just saying - if you can't take it down a notch, don't be a party pooper."

S'Blog for full review:\n\nHaving now sat for perhaps thirty minutes while pies entered and exited the oven being delivered to many around us the time would finally arrive to taste the oft raved pizza of team Bianco as all four of our selections arrived simultaneously covering the table and filling the air with the smells of smoke, yeast, pork, tomato, and basil.  With much sharing to be done and pictures taken the next twenty or so minutes would consist of much less talking and far more eating than the previous thirty and beginning first with my selection - well - let\'s just say it lived up to the hype as the ROSA with Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, and Arizona Pistachios may just be the best "specialty pizza" I\'ve ever tasted.  Beginning first with the crust - an expert balancing act between the thinness of a Neapolitan like Lucali and the chewy hole structure of that at Great Lake - it was nearly perfect as the slight char from the wood oven gave each pie a lovely crunch yet pliable interior that could support the ingredients without disturbing them.  Moving next to the toppings - no sauce here - just thinly sliced onions, intense salty cheese, crunchy smooth pistachios, and a touch of rosemary to pique everything else.  Marvelous.\n\nMoving next to another of Bianco\'s signatures, the WISEGUY with wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, and Fennel Sausage I was pleasantly surprised by the mildness of both the onions and the fennel, both present but not overwhelming, while the slight spice of the sausage floated above the pools of creamy cow\'s milk mozzarella.  Another well balanced pie, though I do feel it could have done with just a touch less olive oil...a small quibble, to be sure.\n\nFor the third choice, the BIANCOVERDE with Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, and Arugula would be the only pizza we modified from the menu description - in this case by adding a $3 supplement of Organic \'La Quercia\' Prosciutto Americano from Iowa that was every bit worth the cost.  Again featuring that same pliable smoky crust but this time topping it first with the trio of cheeses before adding the arugula and prosciutto after it exited the oven this "Salad Pizza" was a valuable addition to the lineup largely because of the quality of the ingredients and the balance achieved by using each lightly.  From the smooth mozzarella to the puddles of ricotta and tangy Parmigiano up through the slight bitters of the greens and the powerful saline notes of the pork everything simply clicked though for some the lack of spice was an issue - an issue easily amendable by the red pepper provided on request (try getting that at Una, Lucali, or Great Lake.)\n\nFor the final selection, that of the man who\'d experienced Chris\' work longer and more frequently than the rest of us combined, there was no way I was going to miss out on the MARGHERITA while I was here and thankfully he\'d ordered it (thus preventing me from ordering both it and the ROSA.)  With the stars of the show well known - simply the freshest Tomato Sauce with light hints of sweetness, oregano, and garlic plus Fresh Mozzarella, and Basil - this was a no nonsense sort of pie that hit on all cylinders; tangy, creamy, aromatic, smoky, and perfect.  While not the absolute greatest Margherita I\'ve ever had, a top 5 member for sure and when paired with the rest of the menu, the service, and the setting a pizza definitely worthy of the fame especially considering the fact that Bianco uses all local ingredients including tomatoes from California in the making of his sauce.\n\nEating, sharing, talking, and then eating some more while the service checked in occasionally to see if we needed anything else our time at Bianco felt much longer than it was and when it was all said and done only four slices remained - two of the WISEGUY and two the BIANCOVERDE - all wrapped up and going home with their respective owners while I took home with me the memories of some of the best pizza I\'ve ever experienced and (perhaps more importantly) the experience of meeting with some great people for outstanding pizza in a setting where people have a passion for what they are doing without all the pretense.  Yeah Chris didn\'t build the oven and furniture by hand like Lucali, and perhaps Pizzeria Bianco doesn\'t fly all their ingredients in from Italy like Una, and sure Chris\' health prevents him from being ever present at the oven like Dom at DiFara or Nick at Great Lake but in the end the results are the same...this is some really great pizza well worth going out of your way for.'

S'I will equate our dining experience at Pizzeria Bianco to that of the election of Obama.  All media hype and sensationalism perpetuated by tree-hugging democrats; frankly I would be shocked if my husband and I weren\'t the only two customers there high on pot.  The pizza is NOTHING to be impressed by as are the greasy goat cheese appetizers.  We waited two hours to eat "the best pizza in the US" and "Oprah\'s favorite pizza".  Please.  The ONLY thing that this place has going for it is its atmosphere and its wait staff.  We will not be going back and I shall forever feel sorry for the people who continue to waste their lives away by waiting 2 to 3 HOURS to eat salty pizza (which is too thin to support a teaspoon of sauce before it turns limp and soggy) and who profess its brilliance to everyone not \'fallen under its spell\'.'

S'On one of my many visits to see mi amore, he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!\n\nPS GET THERE EARLY!!'

I just don't come often.  I really do save this place for out of towners who have read that this is the best pizza in America.  (I have friends from Connecticut who argue with me on this one) but is Oprah ever wrong?  There is a bar next door where they get you good and shnockered before your meal.  The bread is delicious as are the salads, but who are you kidding?  You came for the pizza.  My favorite features arugula.  Everyone else seems to love the meat laden one.  But if you snag a table, be smart, order lots of pizza.  Everyone likes pizza even when it's cold the next day.  If you get a group of people together it's actually doable as they will take a reservation."

S'This place is just heavenly, it\'s a small restaurant with maybe 40 chairs inside and about 20 outside. With usually long long long lines to get a table. I\'ve waited 2 hours before for a seat at the bar, yes it is that good. On this occasion I must have hit a sweet spot, because at 7 PM on a Tuesday night the place was  1/2 full and the bar seating was empty. I waked in and was worried it was closed. Thankfully it was not, just a lull between the storms of guests I guess. By the time I left an hour later it was packed and people were waiting for a seat.\n\nIn any event I started out with an organic salad topped with blue cheese, bacon and house made croutons with a light vinaigrette. It was incredibly fresh, tasty and yummy and got my tummy yearning for my pizza. Sure I could have dined on pizza alone, but hey I need my greens and vegetables.\n\nSecondly I had the ever popular "wiseguy" pizza. All their pizza\'s come in one size and can easily be shared with your best buddy, if you like to share. Or like in my case take half home and eat it for breakfast in the morning. The "wiseguy" is a very simple yes incredibly delicious white pizza, with fennel sausage, caramelized onions and very thinly sliced fresh mozzarella. Because the crust is so thin it stays supper crisp and the ingredients get to shine. It\'s hard to describe why this pizza is so so good, but it just is. I think between getting a pizza with only three toppings on homemade fresh dough, made the way it is in New York has a lot to do with it. The cheese just adheres to the dough and creates this cheese skin that the other topping just stick to. Add that to the char that the wood fired oven creates on the dough, and you have pizza perfection. Plain and simple.'

My personal favorites are the bianco boy (I swear it used to be called that...but i think it is called the bianco verde now) and the classic margherita. All of them were delicious though, of course. \n\nWish I could go more often!"

S'Pizzeria Bianco is a great place to come for authentic, Italian pizza with some different, unique flavors. The seating inside is limited, so if you come during peak hours (i.e., Friday night), be prepared to wait! However, I came this last time for lunch with 2 other people on a Friday afternoon, and we were seated right away. Turnover and service is fast because the menu is pretty small. We split 2 pizzas between the 3 of us, which was more than enough. I highly recommend the biancoverde, which has arugula on it! So yum!'

S"HYPE, that is all I kept thinking about while I was there. I got there 40 minutes before they opened and still missed the first seating and then ended up waiting over 90 minutes after they opened which by what some people have written was a short wait. I'll agree that it's in a cool old building and the little house where the bar is next door is cute too but I can't justify the wait to the quality of the pizza being served. If there wasn't such a long wait I would have given them the 4th star but with that wait, I can't be a fan. There's not much of a selection in there pizzas but they do have a short list of other toppings you can get. I had a margherita and had them throw on some Sicilian Anchovies and sliced tomatoes. The anchovies were great but the tomatoes were sliced way too thick and they skimped on the Basil. I have a bit of experience working in a pizzeria and I know that you sometimes have to pop the bubbles, I guess they don't believe in popping the bubbles on their pizza because I had a big one and with a super hot oven it just burned an looked nasty. No, I won't go back but I don't live in Phoenix but I travel here often. Next time I will try a different pizza place where I don't blow an entire evening waiting."

S"Overrated.\n\nI moved to AZ about two years ago and the one place all of my new coworkers told me I absolutely had to try was Pizzeria Bianco. After reading about it's rich history and lines that make people wait upwards of 3 hours for, I thought there had to be something of this legend and gave it a shot. My fiancee seemed more excited than I was because (as she constantly claims) she is a pizza fanatic with marinara sauce pumping through her veins.\n\nWe made the journey out about half an hour before they opened to ensure we wouldn't have to wait the customary amount of time and wasn't surprised to see a line of about fifteen more arrive soon after. We were the first to order and chose the WiseGuy pizza (onions, mozzarella, and sausage).\n\nThe first thing I noticed that seemed a little off putting was that there didn't seem to be a chef handling the pizza but a couple of simple line cooks. I played it off thinking it didn't matter much because how hard is it really to make a a pizza? The ingredients and recipe were going to be the stars of the show.\n\nEven though we were the first to order we waited approximately thirty minutes before the pizza arrived. Again, I didn't think much of it at the time because in my mind, pizza of this legendary caliber was worth waiting for.\n\nOnce it finally arrived, we couldn't wait to dive in but I gave it a few moments to lessen the blow of any potential cheese burns seeing as it came fresh from the oven. My first bite was completely underwhelming. This pizza didn't have any flavor at all. The dough itself was very pleasing with a nice blend crispy and chewy textures but the cheese, onions, and sausage tasted of nothing. I never thought pizza could taste so bland. My fiancee shared the same sentiments. I thought she was joking at first and maybe I was being a little too critical but after one slice we stopped, paid our bill, and walked out of there.\n\nI've never seen a place hyped so much that went completely in the opposite direction. There are much better places in AZ to get a great slice of pizza but for my money, Pizzeria Bianco isn't worth the time or effort."

S'We\'ve been twice in the past month and think it\'s well worth the wait.  There\'s only one Chris Bianco and he can\'t make the pizza any faster without compromising quality - crusty complex dough and generous tasty toppings. \n\nWe\'ve worked out a system.  There\'s two of us and we try to go early in the week before 7pm.  We leave our name and get the usual "it\'ll be 1.5 to 2 hours but check back in 40min."  Make sure to call back exactly in 40min - we almost lost our place when we called back 10min late.  Plan something to do during your wait - bring reading, go shopping nearby, whatever.\n\nBoth times, we lucked out and got seated in less than one hour.  Make sure to get an extra pizza - tastes just as good the next day - 5 min in a 500 degree oven.'

S"Surprisingly I've been here three times and I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes. Not that I would mind waiting. The bar you can wait at next door is adorable! Perfect spot to grab a bottle or glass of wine before dinner. The restaurant itself is cozy, warm, and filled with delicious scents from the large oven. The margherita and the onion & pistachio pizzas are my favorites. The ingredients are fresh and delicious and the crust is perfection. The caprese salad is also great! I loved everything about my experience here.. Definitely plan to return again & again. Plan ahead and if possible go with a small party on a less crowded night during the week to avoid a reallyyy long wait."

S"http://stevelerer.com\n\nWhile waiting for my flight to leave Phoenix, I stopped in at Pizzeria Bianco with my friend Renee. This pizzeria is a transplant right out of Italy with it's own wood oven right in the dining room. I love seeing pizzerias set up like that, it is just a lot of fun to watch them cook your pizza only a few feet from your table. \n\nPrior to chowing down on pizza I had to order my first recommended dish, the Spiedini, Italian fontina cheese wrapped in prosciutto. The wrapped cheese was then skewered and cooked to be served nice and warm. Probably better than the pizza, this dish may be the best thing I've eaten in Phoenix. The cheese was warm and creamy and the deliciously salty flavor was layered along side the crispy and salty sweet prosciutto. Often salt on salt is too much but this combo just worked perfectly and kept me coming back for more. If I hadn't already ordered my pizza I might have just went with a few more orders of the cheese and called it a day. It really was that good.\n\nA few minutes after our appetizers, my pizza arrived. I broke my own rule and ordered a pizza without a red sauce because it was the other reccomended dish off my restaurant list. The Rosa pizza consisted of some of my favorite ingredients so I felt like it was ok to deviate from my norms. First it had a wonderful crust on which to build. Thin and crispy with a bubbly crust, but what would you expect from a super hot wood fire oven. The toppings started with cooked down red onions, and unlike Mr. Scott Conant, I love me some red onions. The bite of the onions was balanced out by the cheeses especially the fresh Parmesan. The last topping and by far the least likely on a pizza were the pistachio nuts. The great thing is that I love pistachios also! All of these ingredients mixed together on a pizza created a depth of flavor that made me happy to have taken the risk. I would definitely reccomend this pizza to people who want to stray from the norm but in the end the prosciutto wrapped fontina skewers significantly out shined the pizza.\n\nOverall our meal at Pizzeria Bianco was a memorable one.  Not much I could complain about. The service was good, the ambiance was like most pizzerias and the food was on point. I could eat that appetizer every day, too bad I don't live nearby. Next time you are in town and want some quality pizza on the western side of the country, check out Pizzeria Bianco.\n\nOverall Review: 7/10"

S"I agree 100% with some of the reviewers who address the long wait time and the issue about what constitutes as some of the world's best pizza.  Our group of six were well-informed about what to expect were therefore comfortably prepared for an absolutely great experience.  We were told that there would be a two hour wait, so we arrived at Pizzeria Bianco's at 5:00 p.m., put our name down, and happily passed the time away with champagne, great beer, and a nice cheese and salami plate at Bar Bianco's.  It gave us a chance to relax, catch up with one another, and develop a great buzz (and appetite!) before we were seated.  \n\nSure enough, we were seated on-time and there was great energy in the restaurant.  The decor was quaint, simple and not pretentious.  Despite the huge pizza oven that became an interesting focal point in the restaurant and could be seen from any point in the dining room, it was comfortably cool for its patrons in the Phoenix heat!  The place is a bit small and I wouldn't recommend going with more than 6 people.  For those who complain about this factor, I've learned through my travels that some of the coolest locations in the world like the Devil's Throat which accommodates only one spelunker at a time in its cave passages, or the little booth in the Parisian cafe that accommodates a maximum of four people at a time  - not every place can always accommodate you - sometimes YOU have to accommodate the place and sometimes you have to sacrifice a little for the experience.  (Alrighty, I guess that's enough ranting about the Ugly American from me!).  The place has a casual vibe and there were plenty of patrons in t-shirts and shorts, but I would feel like I were disrespectful of the whole experience if my husband hadn't worn at least a collared shirt with his shorts.  We all had shorts on, but were dressed nicer than if we were just going to the local taco stand.  \n\nWe ordered 5 out of the 6 pies on the menu and we also ordered two salads (plenty of food for all of us just as the waiter had advised).  The caprese salad (tomatoes and mozzarella) had some of the tastiest mozzarella I've ever had!  All of the pies were great and I would not be the least bit hesitant to order any of them again, but my personal favorites were the Margherita and the Sonny Boy.  Not surprisingly,  everyone at our table had a different favorite because they were all great.  Overall, not only was the thin crust a perfect combination of chewy and crispy, but it was also tasty - I could eat the crust without any toppings (one prerequisite for me in a great pizza - like fresh home made pasta that doesn't need anything but a little olive oil and sea salt).  Each pie was a work of art - just beautifully rustic and easily identifiable since the toppings were certainly not hiding under a ton of cheese - they were lying on top in all their naked glory.  So people want to know - how does it compare to authentic Italian Pizza or New York Pizza?  I don't know.  It's Pizzeria Bianco's pizza!  \n\nNow the all important final answer everyone wants to know - is Pizzeria Bianco's the best pizza in the world?  I can't say for sure - I haven't been to Italy or a bunch of other places in the world that has pizza, but with impeccably fresh ingredients, undoubtedly good food, a great atmosphere, and courteous service, it is up there with some of the greatest pizza and greatest and most memorable pizza experiences I've ever had.  That's good enough for me to give this place five stars."

S'I keep hearing about this place and finally on a Thursday afternoon, my coworkers and I made the trek downtown. We got there around 11:30 am so it only took us a wait time of 15 minutes to get a table (I heard the wait is usually hours). Anyways we ordered the "Sunny Boy" pizza and the White Pizza (forgot the name). The pizza was delicious, I\'ll admit that, but it was rather small for the price. Also, it seemed as if everyone got bread and oil and we had to ask our waiter for that instead of him bringing it to us. Also, they don\'t validate parking, they have a small lot where they have valet, but we ended up parking at a meter.'

S"We went here after years (literally) of hearing how amazing this pizza is and how highly rated it was on a national level. The place was so adorable and tucked away in the parking lot with cafe lights strung across the patio. Such a warm and welcoming restaurant. We walked in and were greeted by the friendly servers and chefs. The inside is tiny (10 tables or so) but we were seated right away. \n\nWe ordered a pizza and got half salami, half margherita. It took about 10-15 minutes but of course that's because it was being freshly baked in the giant wood-fired brick oven.  The pizza was really GOOD, it is exactly how I imagine it would be in Italy.  Super thin crust, slightly burned edges, sparse on the tomato sauce, and fresh ooey cheese and toppings. So yummy. Now I know this is a personal opinion, but there is another restaurant in the valley (it is a chain. i know....bad) that we both think is better. And cheaper. \n\nBut if you want authentic pizza and a romantic, cozy dining experience, I highly recommend trying Pizzeria Bianco!"

The starter plates weren't that great either as we waited another 45 minutes, after being seated at the bar, for our food to come out. Don't get me wrong, I knew there would be a wait as the restaurant is notorious for it. I just expected an amazing, out of this world pizza for that kind of time."

S'Good, but not "knock your socks off" pizza. Perhaps my expectations were too high, considering I have been wanting to come here for years. I tried the margarita, which is generally how I evaluate a pizza. Tomato sauce was tangy and delicious, fresh mozzarella was creamy and good as well. Crust had great consistency, char and structure, but lacked flavor. All in all, enjoyable experience, but I left feeling let down considering the hype.'

I started with a greens salad and the red wine vinegarette was refreshing but had a little kick, it was perfect. I can never make up my mind, so I was between the margherita and biancoverde pizzas and he suggested I get a half and half ... Great call because they were both fab!

S"If I could give you NO stars I would. I went there on a thursday night at 9:15pm.  The tables were full but there were 5 seats at the bar. The hostess (manager) told me that it would be a 15min wait for the bar, seriously? there are five seats open! She then said that she had people waiting for the bar. Well, there was no one waiting and no one in the house next door. The problem is that people think it is OK to wait 3 hours for OK pizza and be rushed to finish because the media praises this place.\nThere are many places in Phoenix that are better (Cibo) without the Hostess attitude. Your a pizza place not the French Laundry! And yes I have had the pizza, on 3 different occasions and it's not THAT good.  If you spent more time training your staff on customer service you might be able to open another location but my guess is that your afraid to."

S"The Pizzeria Bianco Date Night:\n\nIf you're gonna show up at Pizzeria Bianco and wait for hours upon hours anyway...might as well make a nice day out of it. Bring the following things:\n\n-Reusable cloth grocery bag\n-Large blanket/beach towels\n-Playing cards and/or board games\n-Disposable ice chest (if you don't want to buy beer/beverages from Bar Bianco)\n-Sunscreen\n-Frisbee (optional)\n\nThere are ample patches and hills of nice soft green grass in and around heritage square...absolutely perfect spots for a makeshift picnic. Pack everything in the cloth bag and show up to PB around 4:30 or so. You'll have to stand in line for a few minutes to put your name in...but once you do...it's Picnic time! \n\nFind a nice shaded grassy hill...there's a quite ideal one over towards the Science Center. Lay out your towels and make a fun evening of it. You can relax with some beverages while playing cards with your significant other and as a nice side effect the people watching can be pretty great while you do so. By doing this, you're really killing two birds with one stone...you're getting to have a nice picnic...and as a side effect...you're negating the whole negative aspect of going to Pizzeria Bianco...the wait. Once your name gets called you simply toss everything back in the bag, throw the disposable cooler out...and voila...you're ready to have some great pizza in a cozy rustic pizza joint after your picnic. \n\nI really don't see why you'd want to do anything else...it's making the best of a less than ideal situation. Each time I go there I see people lethargically pacing around with a beer, bored out of their gourd...I just don't get it...might as well try and have some fun. \n\nNow on to Pizzeria Bianco itself...I didn't feel the need to really add too much content about the place itself, because what's already been said by the 300+ reviews is more than sufficient. I will say this...the pizza is great, but it's not all that different than pizza you can get at Cibo for example, where the wait is almost non-existent. What Pizzeria Bianco is, however...is a dining experience every Phoenix foodie must check off their bucket list at least one time. \n\n4/5."

S'The two young lovers, sat breathless in his vehicle.\n He: tall- long of leg, sinewy and dissehveled would steal glances at her in his silent and profound admiration. She: Voluptuous, and indomitable, viewed the world, and all things in it, with awe and a unnerving love, that could move the mountains to tear, and silence the nightengale\'s song. She\'d suggested the venue, and he\'d all too willingly agreed- his easily won tryst belied a desire long dormant to share this experience with her- and she\'d seen it a mile away.\nHis meek jalopy pulled into Heritage Square\'s modest parking lot, and as if on cue a sleek mint conditioned sports car whizzed into the only vacant spot the eager young valet had reserved for this bourgeois prospected tipper, who\'d no doubt been able to tip the valet better than He. The valet then guided Him to the parking structure located deeper inside the labrynthine Heritage Square, a parking lot assumably more suited to the likes of his mode of transport. \nShe left him, and with a promise of reserving their table they parted. A brief flash of reserve entered his mind, yet was quickly pushed out, as he navigated his way to the poorly described location of the parking garage.\nHis beat up 96\' Hyundai Accent he ironically dubbed the "egg" creaked and struggled out of the street and into a space. As he stepped out of the vehicle the crisp air of the night flooded his senses, the blooming trees of heritage square, and the dead leaves on the dirty ground accosted him with reminiscences of a home town, and land now long gone- momentary nostalgia. His brisk pace quickened and he was soon reunited with Her. She informed him of the wait, a potential two hours-This He\'d been fully prepared for, and He grinned knowing that he was right ,and her assumption of speedily gaining a table due to the rains of the evening, dead wrong. They spent their wait together on the porch of a charming English ale house across the square, sipping stouts and India pale ales and discussing ontology, deconstructivism, and the merits of post modernist literature. When they\'d realized it was their time to check in, they\'d overstayed their wait by 15 minutes or so, and were informed by the stylish young hostess that they\'d need to wait a bit longer. No matter. They chatted with the barmaid, and made a fast and easy aquaintance. \nThe night then found them seated at their own table, in a sultry dimly lit corner, on a humble wooden table seemingly hewn out of a wizened tree whose soul aim in its years of existence had been to comfort and house the glorious repasts ordered by the thousands of patrons who\'d shared in the hospitality of this former tree. The kindly and attentive servers, had amicably and expertly suggested various dishes and spirits to accompany them. He discussed the menu with Her, their eyes dancing in the bossa nova the candle light effused, they held hands \'neath the table and felt encompassed in the joy of being near one another. A Bianco Verde & Rosa. The simple and unpretentious pies made their senses dance, re wrote in their young minds the possibilities of cuisine,  and filled them with wonder and grattitude, in no way were they begrudged by the wait- rather it had given them time to acclimate, and enjoy their leisurely evening of epicurean delights. He realized, that as he stared into the depths of that evergreen pizza, and breathed deep of the aromas of the brick oven, swooned over the extravagant flavours- that nothing in this world save love, could craft something so perfect. In that moment, without words- they two realized that it was love that had brought them together, and so would they remember Bianco, for it was love that brought them there.'

S"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place, yet!\n\nWent here awhile back on a hot and very humid August evening with a group of ten.  We had reservations for 8p- we arrived at 7p (as was requested by the venue), and tried to keep cool at the very crowded and NON-air conditioned Bar Bianco next door- very quaint, but the overhead fans and open windows were laughable- funny that no one was laughing.\n\nYes, we arrived at 7p and were seated at 8:15 and glasses of water were quickly given.  Orders for salads and pizzas were taken fifteen minutes later.  Salads were on the table by 8:45p and pizzas around 9p.  (Hey, I was ready to eat at 7p, so yeah, I was watching the clock!)\n\nI ordered the Farmer's market salad and the Rosa pizza (with parmigiano-reggiano, rosemary, red onion, and AZ pistachios).  Fantastic salad- tasted very fresh with a lovely vinaigrette- the shaved parmigiano-reggiano on top was the icing on the cake!  I'm a thin-crust lover and was impressed with the pizza crust here.  Loved the scent and flavor of rosemary, and the toasted pistachios really brought the flavors of the other ingredients together and made them pop!  \n\nThe server we had was courteous and aimed to please, which was nice to see.  Chris Bianco looked quite busy, and yet was all smiles, tending to the oven- another cool thing to spy."

S"All things considered, Bianco gets 2 stars.  Only pizza/food considered, I'd probably give it a 3.5 or 4 stars.  However, half of dinning is the experience.  And when it comes to Bianco, the experience is terrible.  Basically if you don't like to wait longer than 1-2 hrs for a table, you should go somewhere else.  The owner purposely keeps the place small so the wait time is always over 1 hour.  They only take reservations for 6 or more people (assuming availability).  They own the house next door and have converted it to a bar/waiting area.  Actually even the waiting area requires you to wait in order to score a seat inside.  Otherwise you are doomed to wait in the 100+ degree heat on the porch.  \n\nHaving eaten at Bianco, I am really perplexed by why there is always such a wait.  I mean the pizza is pretty decent but bang for buck it's really not that much better than the Phoenix chain NYPD (NY Pizza Dept).  The only assumption I can make is that Phoenix area lacks well-reviewed restaurants so people always flock to Bianco because it has been pretty well-publicized.  \n\nAs for the food, Bianco has pretty good pizza.  After all the chef did grow up in Brooklyn.  The pizza is thin crusted, good amount of cheese and sauce and they are wood-oven cooked.  The menu has a choice of 7 or 8 pizzas, a few appetizers and a few deserts.\n\nIf you want good pizza without a wait, go somewhere else.  If you want to wait for 2 hours, eat good pizza and be able to say you ate at the pretentious Bianco's then go try it.\n\nADDED: Finally, I think part of the reason why I think it is over-hyped is because it is pizza.  In my opinion, something like Bianco's pizza has minimal ingredients and uncomplicated tricks of the trade.  Of course there is probably a lot of skill that goes into making the dough exactly the right way and I can respect that.  He does a good job at that.  The sauce probably has some ingredients and seasonings that add to the quality.  But at the end of the day, it is pizza...and American pizza at that.  He makes all the pizzas himself because he wants to, not because he has to.  If he wanted to, I can't imagine it would be terribly difficult to hire assistants to help him put the sauce, toppings and cheese on.  =)"

S'My man and I wanted to try this place and decided it was the perfect spot for a small celebration. We arrived on a Monday evening at right about 6pm and there was a 30 minute wait  for a table or the bar was completely open besides two other people sitting there. We were hungry so we took the bar! \n\nThe seats were comfortable and we never felt like we were in the way of other customers or staff like you do at almost any other restaurant where you take a bar seat. Plus, I was sitting up high enough at the end of the bar to see into the wood burning stove where the pizzas cook. Rad. \n\nOur service was killer. Super polite, friendly, yet real. What my man likes to call "service with a smile." It was that! They would refill our wine or beer for us and supply more napkins. Because we are messy you see. The bread and olive oil they bring out to you as a starter is so delicious. I need to find out what type of olive oil that is! We then ordered the mozzarella, tomato, basil, and olive oil salad and the Margarita pizza and added mushrooms. The mushrooms added so much flavor to an already delicious pizza.\n\nI\'m excited to try this place again! From what I hear, wait times can be brutal so it looks like we lucked out.'

S'Went here recently on a trip to Phoenix and it is as good as ever.  I have been here 20+ times when I lived in Phoenix and I never had a bad experience.  \n\nThe pizza is amazing.  I always go with the wiseguy (sausage made locally from Schreiners) and has never disappointed.  The appetizers at the wine bar next door are fantastic.\n\nExpect a long wait...who cares, grab a bottle of vino and enjoy the atmosphere next door.\n\nFYI - get a babysitter, not a great place for children.'

S"Get here early & grab a beer or glass of wine then u wait :)\n\nShowing up early is key for this famous and popular pizzeria.  Our neighbors in CA recommended Pizzeria Bianco and we had to try it.  They open at 5pm so show up around 4pm and get in line.  While you wait (here's the genius idea on their part) you can grab a drink at their bar, which is just next door.  \n\nI love the crust.  It's chewy and has a great bite.  The menu is small but satifying.  The flavors are clean and fresh.  Just good old traditional Italian pizza.  I had the Biancoverde with proscuitto.  It's divine!  My husband had the Wiseguy - it seems to be a favorite among the guys.  \n\nThe pizza is cooked in a traditional wood fire oven.  The ingredients are simple but the execution is wonderful.  It's all about clean fresh quality ingredients."

Pizza is not very large, so if you are looking the thick dough and greasy pizza for 1 dollar, forget it. \n\nA one time event, as I don't think I would wait again so much for this pizza...after all, good things are best kept in your mind :)"

S"Undoubtedly the best pizza outside of Italy. Arizona is honored to host such a superb artisan as the master chef who owns and operates this place. If you come to Phoenix, this is the one place that truly matters to go to.\nThe wait is ridiculous, and for any other restaurant save a hand-full (such as Ruth's Chris for instance), the wait would be intolerable. For this pizza, however, the wait makes perfect sense. I literally spent over 3 hours out of my 18th birthday waiting in line for this place (I had already been here many times before), and I honestly don't think I would've rather done anything else with that time.\nThe pizza here has been voted the best pizza in the world by the Travel Channel, by Bon Appetit Magazine, and by (the most meaningful in my book, since it's a slap in the face to every cocky New Yorker) the New York Times. With worldwide recognition and universal praise by critics, this is a landmark in Arizona. I love this pizza, and this restaurant, every time I go there without fail.\nFor me, the Wise-Guy pizza is the best thing in the world. They start with the best brick fired crust you can find here, in New York, or even in Italy. Then they go for some salty house smoked mozzarella (it's one of their sauce-less pizzas), add some wood roasted petals of onion, then top it off with some homemade, hand-spiced fennel sausage. Oh yeah... the pizza is that good. But, that's just my personal favorite, they have 6 pizzas to choose from with 6 extra toppings you can put on. Doesn't sound like a lot? Well.. this isn't Cici's. This is art, PB doesn't need a menu full of novelty pizzas to make it. They have a short list of perfect Italian Pies that need nothing, and leave you wanting nothing. By offering little, they offer specialized, immaculate pizza to their patient clientele. \nThis place is a singularity in the way-overdone pizza business. The chef and his brother have a garden where they personally grow all the herbs, spices, and some of the toppings for their pizza. This place is one of the few places on the West coast to have an old-school wood fire brick oven (they are in Heritage Square in Phoenix and are in a historic building, so it was grandfathered in). Another quirk is that every morning they make 500 balls of dough to be made into exactly 500 pizzas that night. And when they make all 500 pizzas, they close shop and go home. They even slightly change their dough recipe for humidity and by season to help insure the perfect product, every time you go there. It's all of these small little touches that make this particular pizza joint stand out from all the rest.\nThere are so many things to say about this place. I love everything, from the very best french bread I've ever had that they serve with olive oil and vinegar, to their minimalist, ultra-classic spin on a salad, even to the great bar next door for the adults in your group while you wait. This restaurant truly is the pride of the Valley of the Sun. If you come to visit, you didn't really see Phoenix if you didn't go to Pizzeria Bianco. Period."

S"The hype was worth it. I've been coming to Phoenix for 10 years and always wanted to go but didn't want to have to wait. Finally my family decided to take the plunge and it was worth it. My biggest fear was that the pizza was hyped because most people traditionally do not have pizza cooked in a wood burning oven.  After waiting for an hour and half I was beginning to think that the hype was bigger than the restaurant itself. Wow, was I wrong. I had the Sonny Boy pizza with fresh cured salami and olives. The flavor was incredible. Mix it with the flavor of the crust and it was like a party in my mouth. My family had the margherita pizza and the sauce was simply spectacular. Best sauce ever!  Alton Brown once said that great pizza comes from the crust and Chris Bianco's recipe proves it. The flavor of the burning oak is easily imparted to it. Even though Chris is no longer handling day to day cooking chores I'm glad to see that his recipes are still being cooked the way he expects them to."

S"I moved to Phx about 6 months and since the beginning I have been hearing about Pizzeria Bianco. I also heard how freakin long you need to wait to get in. I tried it once at night and after an hour and 15 minutes I gave up. I couldn't help but wonder\n\n1. why don't they serve food outside?\n2. why don't they make the restaurant bigger?\n3. does the owner want to keep it small despite the negative experience for MANY people who have to wait for forever or just don't go because they don't want the hassle?\n\nWell, they they started serving lunch. Usually it's too far for me to run to during the work week but I happened to have a random day off and luckily I put this on my list.\n\nI was so happy to show up and see plenty of seats for me to choose from at the bar. Hallelujah, let's see what the fuss is all about. I had a tasty coke from a bottle (I'm rarely a caffeine drinker) and ordered the Margherita after debating whether to go red or white. 5 minutes after I ordered the friendly waitress told another customer at the bar that you could split the pizza and do half and half for yourself. Wish I woulda known!\n\nIt took awhile to get my pizza but it was damn tasty. Maybe a 20-30 min wait tasty, but not a 4 hour wait tasty. Still good, still glad I went, still want to go again, definitely not at night, but lunch is my saving grace."

Half wiseguy and half margarita with mushrooms. Both were very good even though I preferred the margarita pizza. Just not a fan of the whole onions and what not. Everything just felt really fresh. I really liked their black tea as well even without sugar it tasted just fine.\n\nWe're planning another trip to Biancos soon, but this time we might take a couple of friends to enjoy it with us."

S'Their reviews are extremely over rated.  I am from Chicago, so I was excited to visit the famous Pizzeria Bianco. So, 4 friends went for dinner. I heard the wait was long, but seriously 3 hours, NO WAY!. So, we had a couple of bottles of expensive wine, just hanging out in the wine bar area.  After 2 hours we starting after questions about the wait?? Let me mention that even the bartenders were confused on our extremely long wait at this point.  After having visiting the hostess stand a few times, at 3 hours I went to ask, "Whats up", all because we had notice people who arrived after us being seated, Not good right!  Actually one of the groups that came in after my group was a gentlemen from my work, so when they got seated immediately I ask WHY? I was told that was a personal friend of Chris Bianco\'s.  Well, it was also a co-worker of mine.  An any account, to seat them (personal friends or not) before my group, who now having been waiting for 3 hours is NOT right, NOT a good business practice.  As I proceeded to inform the hostess of my concerns, Chris Bianco himself came out to inform me that it is his restaurant and he can seat who ever he wants, whenever he wants, and I might mention his voice was inappropriately loud and rude.  Well, being in the hospitality industry for 25 years, I could not help but to express my dissatisfaction, as you might image.  As my group decided to leave, Chris Bianco and 3 of his male employees followed us out of the restaurant, yelling and screaming at us, with foul language.  I was SHOCKED! In my life I have never had such a HORRIBLE experience!  We did not pay for the wine, and I might add that the bar tenders never presented us with a bill, probably because they knew better.  2 of the 4 adults in my part work in the Hotel/Resort industry, over 35 years combined.  Working for super brands in the industry.  We encounter individuals from all social, economical, and political background.  We are often ask for recommendations, on occasions people will ask about Pizzeria Bianco, I ALWAYS TELL MY STORY, I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, NEVER!  Karma Chris, Karma.'

S'To start, I\'d like to point out that Pizzeria Bianco did not make the claim of having the best pizza in the country (to my knowledge); it was made by others.   Regardless, I thought it was a bold statement.  I mean, who could possibly say that about pizza?  Pizza is so subjective (i.e. deep dish, thin crust, grilled, electric oven, brick oven, etc.), and you can\'t possibly satisfy everyone with one type of pizza.\n\nWell, curiosity still managed to get the best of me, so I convinced two of my friends to drive 5 1/2 hours with me to Phoenix to find out for myself.  (As an FYI, we did go to a few other restaurants on that day-long trip.  Just wanted to make that clear so you don\'t think I was entirely crazy for driving that far to check out just one joint.)\n\nWe got to PB around 6pm and I gave the hostess my name.  \n\n"It\'ll be a 3 1/2 hour wait," she casually informed me.  \n\nShe smiled, but she didn\'t blink.  She didn\'t give off even the slightest impression that she felt bad that we\'d have to wait so long for pizza (in 110+ degree Arizona heat, mind you).  It\'s nothing short of crazy that we are living in an era where pizza-in-under-thirty-minutes has been replaced by pizza-in-three-hours.  I guess if I had to think of anything positive about waiting that long is that you can go next door to their bar, go across the way to The Rose and Crown and shoot pool or just befriend others who are just as crazy as you are for waiting that long for pizza.\n\nHaving said all that, here is my review:\n\nThe ambience is really nice.  It\'s dimly-lit to create a romantic environment for couples, or just a peaceful dining experience if you\'re with friends.\n\nThe country bread, as simple as it looks, is really good, especially when you dip it in the olive oil (add salt and pepper).\n\nFinally, the pizzas were... AMAZING.  We had built up our expectations so much that by the time we got the order, we were positive we would be disappointed.  But with the first bite, we knew our trip was not made in vain.  It was completely worth it.  And that\'s saying a lot since I\'m a die-hard deep dish guy.  To say these were thin would be an understatement; sometimes you could see through the pizza because it was so thin.\n  \nSonny Boy - The amount of tomato sauce and the fresh ingredients went perfectly together.  Though I\'m not a fan of salami, the pieces on this pizza created a party in my mouth.  So rich.  So good.\n\nWise Guy - No tomato sauce on this (note that half of the pizzas on the menu do not have tomato sauce), but the onions, mozzarella and sausage were amazing as well, just bursting with flavor.  Yes, bursting.  \n \nSo... was it worth the drive?  To be honest, I think even if it didn\'t meet the hype, the experience would have been worthwhile.  I mean, come on, you only live once.  Why not do a few out-of-the-ordinary things occasionally?  Fortunately for us, Bianco\'s was outstanding and definitely worth driving out for.  \n\nMr. Bianco, you get 5 stars from me because your pizzas are my favorite in the country.'

S"I had no idea they were open for lunch! Perfect since the boy and I were down town during lunch the other day. \n\nWe stopped in around 2:30 inthe afternoon. No Wait! I couldn't even believe it. I hadn't eaten there since I was a little girl, but it was just as good as I remember.\n\nWe got a couple beers and split the Margarita Pizza. It was sooo yummy! Perfectly crispy on the edges and lots of flavor. The service was a tini bit slow, but no big deal, we loved it. \n\nIf you want great pizza and dont want to wait the normal 3 hours during dinner, you should hit up Pizzaria Bianco while the sun is still up, less wait time if at all. \n\nEnjoy!!"

S'This place was recommended to me more than pretty much anything else on a trip I made out to Phoenix.  Additionally, I was told that along with their supposedly legendary pizza, were the legendary wait times.  With that in consideration, I strategically planned my visit to be on an in-between time on a Saturday afternoon well after lunch, but fairly before dinner time.\n\nBeing downtown, if there\'s any free parking, I didn\'t find it, and I parked in a pay garage easily within walking distance.  Pizzeria Bianco would validate my ticket, and in the end, I still paid just a dollar to park for this place.  Regardless, it\'s located in one of the nicer parts of Downtown Phoenix near all the sports complexes, and not within any eyesight of any of the slummy looking areas.\n\nRegardless of my odd time I chose to show up, there was still a wait, but it wasn\'t to the extent of three hours as some other users may attest to.  30-40 minutes wasn\'t bad, mostly because of neighboring Bar Bianco we were suggested to wait at, which was definitely worth a trip in its own right, due to the smoking hot woman working the bar, the Four Peaks beers on tap, and the comfort of a relaxing outdoor country-style patio where I could people watch and enjoy some suds on a not-hot November afternoon.\n\nWhen I got seated, the interior is very sparse, but an intimate, cozy feeling, and not at all pretentious as a place that might have three hour waits might make a customer feel.  The centerpiece of the establishment is the giant stone oven where pizza is wood baked freshly to order.\n\nI ended up ordering a Wiseguy, but my friend ordered a Rosa.  Trying both pizzas, I\'d have to say I preferred the Rosa, but my Wiseguy wasn\'t bad at all.  If you\'re thinking of commercialized New York style pizzas with tangy sauces and the entire produce section on it, you probably won\'t like Pizzeria Bianco.  Their\'s is definitely more along the lines of artisan, Italiano style, where everything is fresh, tastes fresh, and is absolutely delicious.  The centers are soft and chewy, but the crusts don\'t make you feel like you\'re eating wood, either.  $16.00 for my Wiseguy doesn\'t in the least bit feel steep at all, considering it\'s far less than what I\'d pay for a satisfying steak dinner or something else considered "fine dining."\n\nUltimately, it was worth the wait.  Classy downtown location, cheap validated parking, great bar with its own great attributes to wait at next door, fantastic bang for buck, and wonderful pizza.  As easy of a five-star rating as I\'d give.'

S'Okay so this is a good pizza but not the best. I love the ambiance of this place brings, reminding me of a typical portland OR eatery. Love the friendly customer service we got and the beer served on draft was good (sunbru). The pizza itself is a wood fire burned style reminiscent of Italian pizza. The brucheta was good and the ingredients seems of good choice. One pizza can be eaten by a hungry brat and even a normal sized girl. Best way to eat is order different pizzas ( sonny boy is my fav) and drink beer or wine with friends and comrades.'

I still am amazed that there are ANY bad reviews about this place. The complaints are really obscure and hard to figure out. Ignore them. Here's the deal. If you go at night you are gonna wait a long time. This pizza doesn't have magic fairy dust on it so it won't change your life, its just really good. Go at lunch if you don't want to wait. There is a high demand for this place and therefore it takes a lot of effort to keep the hoards organized and happy so forgive the staff if they are a little direct after answering the same question that they have been asked for the hundredth time that night.

Next day we went for lunch instead. $16 for a medium thin crust pizza is not quite worth it: not enough cheese, just a few slices of sausage. Salad is even worse. A few leafy lettuce with 6 olives. Cost: $6. I can buy a bag of same lettuce from 99 Cent store and can divide into 10 plates! Tables and chairs are old, made of wood only. They are not comfortable. The place is small.

S"While being drunk and in a hurry limit my ability to rank this against NY's finest, i can confidently say that Pizzeria Bianco rivals any pizza I've ever had.  And no offense to the Italian population of Phoenix but this blows my mind more than how Luis Gonzalez's piss-ass bloop hit won the 2001 Diamondbacks-Yankees World Series.\n\nThey offer 6 different pizzas on the menu - three of which don't have any tomato sauce.  I ordered the Margherita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil).  Here's the verdict...\n\nCheese - The fresh mozzarella was FANTASTIC.  Sharpest mozzarella I've ever had on a pizza.  I'm assuming it's bufala (buffalo) mozzarella but can't say for sure.  You get one blob of cheese per slice and, while I would've gladly taken more, this was best for the overall balance of the slice.\n\nCrust - Fantastic as well.  It hit all three C's - crispy, chewy, and charry (made up word but should be self-explanatory).  I'd have sworn it came from a coal oven (consdiered the best b/c it gets super hot - in NY, they aren't legal but there's a grandfather clause for some of the older places).\n\nSauce - Good but clearly plays a backseat to the cheese and crust.  Kinda like Spinderella to Salt & Pepa or talent to Hall & Oates.\n\nI also tried one of my friends' Wiseguy (House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage, Wood Roasted Onion).  I didn't like it as much - missed having tomato sauce - but liked the smoky mozzarella and really liked the sausage.\n\nThe restaurant is clean, quaint, and pleasant.  Despite it taking 3 hours (!) to get a table, it really wasn't much of an ordeal as there were places nearby to get drinks and the hostess was very helpful (e.g., providing an estimate time when we'd sit, telling us when to check back in).  And sometimes you can't rush it when someone's putting that much TLC into their pizza.... \n\nHighly recommended to anyone visiting Phoenix (with some time on their hands) or to anyone who lives in the area."

We enjoyed it for about 30 minutes before we were called to be seated. They seated us at the end of the bar, which was fine. Whatever got us in fastest.\n\nWe had the Sonny pizza, and it was delicious. The crust was just right. It stood up when you picked up a slice (I HATE flimsy pizza). It was still soft on the inside with a touch of char from the oven. The toppings and sauce were delicious. The only thing that we thought could have been improved was the mozzarella. It was very mild tasting with a slight taste of scrambled eggs. Service was good.\n\nAll in all, it was a satisfying meal and I would recommend it.'

Once again, the food was a solid good food so there is no issue there.  My only issue is the claim that it is the "best" - that I don\'t get. OK OK if I have to be super picky, I can also add that the cheese was on the stingy side = large patches of exposed tomato sauce were evident throughout the pie.\n\nand the parking, hmm the parking - sucks.

S"I have never given a pizza place five stars.  My lovely bride met up with Tim and Sarah and their two teenagers at Pizza Bianco on a Thursday night.  A table for six required a 45-minute wait in Bar Bianco.  It was well worth it.  Given there were six of us, we ordered five pies:  Margherita, Rosa, Sonny Boy, Biancoverde, and Wise Guy.  Okay, I hate to admit it, but they were the best pizzas we've ever had, bar none.  I recommend the Rosa and my wife likes the Wise Guy.  This place is stellar."

S"I've wanted to try this place to see what all the hype was about. \nI was nervous that there would be a huge wait but we got in a table for 2 within 15 mins! \nWe ordered the margarita pizza and the wise guy. Both were great pizzas. The wise guy had some of the best sausage I've ever eaten on a pizza. \nThe main downfall if this place are the prices. As good as these pizzas were, the price was not worth it. We spent almost $50 on 2 pizzas, and a couple of sodas. \nWould I come back? Not unless I was in the area. \nI was glad I could mark this off my bucket list of restaurants to try through."

S'When you reach the passover from double, to triple digit reviews, you want the century marker to be something notable and worthy.  Where else could commemorate a 100th review than Pizzeria Bianco?\n\nThe secret to Bianco is really quite simple:  Have kickass friends.  \n\nWhat I mean is, have friends who will call you mid-evening, and bless you with the great news that they have enrolled in Bianco prison, and would you kindly meet them for dinner in a few hours after the NCAA basketball games have finished and maybe after a little self-primping in front of the bedroom mirror?\n\nWhy, yes!\n\nSo, addressing the exhaustively discussed subject of wait time, having done both the hard-time and the soft-wait outside of Bianco, I have to say, "just get over it".  Is anything worth waiting two, three, four hours for?  Yes.\n\nUT national championship football tickets.\nA reunion Smiths show at the Hammersmith Apollo. \nA plane ride to Seattle.\n\nAnd Bianco Pizza.\n\nWhat I\'m trying to illustrate is, you are there for the experience.  The wait, the wine, the conversation, rinse, repeat.\n\nEventually, you will get into the gorgeous early-century brick general-store-esque building and feel like you\'ve accomplished something.  Don\'t be a bitch about it.  This is the highest quality slice you will likely ever have, and though some will argue the necessity for the buildup, you will never have the same dining experience anywhere else.  Moreover, any place equally hyped and ballyhoo\'d, will leave your wallet hundreds of dollars lighter.  Bianco does not.\n\nSo, when the waiter came, and my gf and I finished off our delightful $9 Sangiovese (from Arizona, nonetheless -- hint: this is a RAAAAARE varietal for our state), we observed that they had Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale (from Sedona).  An absolutely PERFECT brown ale, far FAR better than Newcastle or anything Four Peaks could brew up (the secret is in the superior Sedona water).  My gf got that one, and of course out-selected me.  Instead, I had the Mirror Pond Ale from Bend, Oregon .. a superior brew that represents the promised land of micro-brew very appropriately.  Both were highly complimentary beers for our impending pizza dinner.\n\nFor our pizza selection, we chose the Rosa (the must-try for Bianco n00bs) and the margherita with prosciutto added on top.  The Rosa, as usual was outstanding, but the margherita/prosciutto was absolutely fucking phenomenal.  I couldn\'t get over how delicious this creation was and as a self-aggrandizing foodie, it was truly the best pizza I\'ve ever had the pleasure of knowing.  Please do yourself a favor, loyal reader, and give consideration to this option upon next visit.\n\nOverall, I could not dream of giving Bianco anything less than a solid 5 star rating.  Look, I gag and eye-roll about overhyped goods like any other would.  A band?  If they\'ve been out longer than 5 minutes, released anything longer than an EP, or have had a showcase at SXSW, hell, they\'re way to overexposed for my taste.  A football team?  I hate USC for no reason.  And so on.\n\nBianco doesn\'t deserve similar criticism.  Go for the oddity and hype, but stay because you have the sense to appreciate a remarkable overall experience.'

S"I'm in Phoenix and staying with a friend for a conference (TPE/NASPA). Never having been to Phoenix before I asked my friend for a few suggestions around the convention center area to have lunch/dinners with old friends and colleagues. He suggested this place and informed me it is ranked #1 in the nation. Being an aspiring foodie and someone who is very judgmental of pizza, these are big shoes to fill. Myself and a good friend went on a Friday around 12:15, I was a little nervous about getting in and out in the needed time, knowing that it was a small place and could have hours of wait time for dinner. Not a problem. We were seated immediately and there were tables to spare. We both ordered coke lights (apparently the Italian version of diet coke) and they came in the adorable classic glass bottles and were very tasty. We asked our server if we could only order one pizza which one he would suggest. He told us the Biancoverde with added prosciutto was the one to get, so we went for it. NO REGRETS. This pizza was tasty. Thin crust and oh so flavorful, the ricotta and cheese were amazing, and the prosciutto was yummy, not overly salty like some can be. It can seem a little pricey, our one pizza was $24 but it fed both of us comfortably. I definitely recommend and passed along the info to a couple friends at the conference as well. I may even end up venturing back before my time comes to an end in Phoenix...only time will tell..."

S"It was okay. Definitely overrated. However, I think half of the magic is the wait time. If you wait for anything for over 2hrs, you are starving by then, and it tastes incredible no matter what it is! Honestly though, the pistachio pizza is so unique, and equally delicious. And once inside, the chef/owner (?) made a stop over, was very professional and appreciative of our business, and it shows in the rest of the staff. It's not quite Italy, but then again, what is? Given the choice though, I would go to Federal Pizza over this one. More selections, better crust."

People waiting in line were all super nice.\n\nWe started with antipasta for my daughter who has to eat gluten free.  It was very good different than usual with roasted pepers, squash, etc.  She also tired the tomatoes with mozzarella which she liked.\n\nWe tried the Margherita which we loved.

S"Everything about Pizzeria Bianco is exaggerated: both the wait time and the quality. We went in with high expectations, having heard all about a New York Times article saying that Pizzeria Bianco has the best pizza in the country. We left quite a bit less than amazed. \n\nThe wine bar where we passed our time before being seated was charming, with a rustic theme suffusing the area. The wine selection was limited however, favoring reds over whites. I liked that their beer selection included a number of local breweries, but their selection was limited in that as well. For non-alcoholic selection they had Mexican Coke and Coke Light (Diet Coke) . Avoid the Coke LIght unless you like to be overwhelmed with Aspartame.\n\nWe eventually made our way to the main dining area, which strangely enough is smaller than the wine bar. We were helped quickly - you certainly cannot fault the service here, which was prompt and friendly. Then our pizza arrived.\n\nI don't know what the opposite of synergy is, but the pizzas we ordered had it. They were less than the sum of their parts. We ordered the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy. The Wiseguy is a white pizza (no tomato sauce) with smoked mozzarella, sausage, and smoked onion. The Sonny Boy is a standard pizza with salami, olives, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. \n\nThe Sonny Boy's ingredients were lost in the melange of the pizza as a whole. There was no clarity of taste from the salami. It was more a texture than a taste, and the texture was leathery. The salami reminded me of prosciutto rather than salami: very thin and salty. But with the mozzarella and tomato sauce, the salty taste disappeared into a void. The salami also looked a tad raw, salmon pink in areas rather than red. \n\nThe pizza was also somewhat small. I felt like I paid sixteen dollars for a ten dollar pizza. I could not help but wonder whether the writer of the famous New York Times article had ever eaten pizza before.  \n\nThe Wiseguy was not much better. Given that there were so many smoked ingredients on the pizza, the pizza did not taste smoky at all. It was an okay pizza. Certainly not bad, but also very certainly not the best in the country; not by a long shot. It is not the best pizza in Phoenix, or even the best pizza in the neighborhood. So far, that goes to Cibo. \n\nIt is not a bad place at all. The crust is crispy as one would expect from a wood-fired oven, although I question the wisdom of placing said oven in the restaurant. Phoenix is hot enough without placing a colossal heat source a few feet away from the seating area. \n\nI think that having so many rave reviews actually enhanced our disappointment with the restaurant. We went in expecting to be blown away and left with some sort of existential malaise. \n\nI can recommend Pizzeria Bianco, but only with reservations. The pizza is  above average, but Phoenix abounds with mediocre restaurants so the bar is not very high. There are better Pizzerias in Phoenix; Cibo and Le Grande Orange come to mind immediately. LGO even uses many of the same ingredients as Pizzeria Bianco, but with far better effect. \n\nIn essence:  don't believe the hype. Eat here if you want good pizza. Don't eat here if you want amazing, best in the country pizza."

S"On a whim I ended up here on a Saturday night. The lady and I were enjoying the zombie walk when we all of a sudden decided to top off the already romantic evening with a date at Bianco's. Believe it or not, we waited less than an hour for a table. That being said, I wasn't wasted when I finally got to my pizza and I wasn't a pissed off/hungry food nazi waiting to hate every bite. I was completely neutral going in.\n\nWe ordered some bread and olives to start, and they were both tasty! I would have preferred some kalamatas but the olives we received were good enough. The bread was great, and with a little bit of olive oil and salt, it was even better. As for pizzas, we ordered a Sonny Boy and a half Wiseguy, half Rosa. The Rosa was good. The rosemary and pistachios really went well with each other. The Wiseguy (the pizza that I thought would be my favorite) was just okay. The sausage had fennel in each chew, and the onions were a nice touch, but there wasn't that pop of flavor like I got from each bite of the Rosa. It's important for fancy pizza in my opinion. And, last but not least, there was the Sonny Boy. This pizza was definitely my favorite of the three. The salami, the cheeses and the olives went perfectly with one another! Those first few chews were the highlight of my visit to the pizzeria. I would order that pizza again in a heartbeat.\n\nMy bottom line...? It's good. Period. I'm not sure that I'd want to wait for 3+ hours to eat there (that's silly considering all the other great pizza places not too far from there), but if the same kind of situation that I had my first visit came about, I could see myself returning to Pizzeria Bianco."

Thankfully we  didn't have to wait very long (plus!) and the food came out pretty quickly (double plus).  I ordered a mixed local greens salad (literally just mixed greens and vinaigrette) and my friends ordered something similar to mine, but it had skewered salami/cheese on top.  All three of us were happy with our starter, and then came the pizzas.\n\nI ordered The Marinara (marinara and garlic no cheese) and added organic roasted mushrooms for three bucks.  It was quite tasty and I ended up eating the ENTIRE pizza.  Don't judge me, I was hungry.  My one friend ordered the pizza with pistachios and onion and I can't remember what friend number two ordered (oops), but they were both pleased as punch with their pies.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice dining experience.  The food was good, but I don't think I would wait multiple hours to enjoy a slice.  However, if the wait isn't crazy, I'll hit this cozy little spot up again, for sure!"

I went during lunch when there was no wait and I'm not sure if the pizza would be worth a one hour wait. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is definitely pretty good but I was expecting much better from a place rated among the top pizza joints in the US. One of the pizzas had a slightly burnt crust and the other wasn't crispy enough. The pizzas we tried were Rosa and the wiseguy and both had pretty good flavor."

S"The best pizza of my life! My friend and I went a road trip to Phoenix from LA and Pizzeria Bianco was one of the things on our to do list. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint.\n\nThe wait was long, but I think that made the experience all that much better. We ordered four of the six pizzas on their menu:\n\nMARGHERITA (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil): Amazing. The freshness of the tomato sauce was out of this world as well as the succulent olive oil in each bite.\n\nWISEGUY (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage): The homemade sausage was brilliant. Also, the onions were caramelized to perfection.\n\nBIANCOVERDE (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula): One of the more unique pizzas that I've had as it is topped with fresh arugula after it comes out of the oven. Although it was very good, this was my least favorite out of the four pizzas we ordered (this was my friends favorite though).\n\nMARINARA (Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic [No Cheese]): Again, the tomato sauce at this place is so delicate. Words cannot describe how good it is. Also, the fresh oregano in every bite was terrific.\n\nOn top of the great food, it was really cool to watch Chris Bianco (the chef) cooking as the kitchen is on the floor. The service and the decor of the restaurant was very good too.\n\nI plan on making a road trip to Phoenix again for some of this great pizza."

S"Well we finally got in. About seven attempts and five years later we finally ate at Pizzeria Bianco. I think the only reason we got in is because they are now open for lunch. We were attending a matinee at the symphony and arrived 1.5 hours before and went to the restaurant, there was already a 45 minute wait. We put our names in and didn't get called before we had to leave to see the performance. We got out of the performance at 3:45 and decided to hustle back to Bianco and see if we could possibly get in before the dinner rush. We spoke to the hostess and she fit us in! Yay! \n\nThe menu is minimal about five different pizzas, appetizers and salads. As we looked at the menu we decided to order everything we were curious about as we didn't know when we would ever make it back. So we ordered the Antipasto - wood fired veggies with big blocks of cheese, bright green olives and sopressata, served with bread and the most flavorful olive oil. The perfectly roasted veggies included sweet onion, red peppers and sweet potatoes it was wonderful! We also ordered three pizzas (for two adults and two kids - oh my) the margherita, wise guy and sonny boy. The pizzas were good. We enjoyed the pizzas with Peroni which is a perfect pairing. My favorite was the wise guy. Wood roasted onions and fennel sausage - just incredible. Everything was cooked perfectly. Our tab for three pizzas, antipasto, beers, and sodas came to $92. Pricey lunch but we ordered too much.\n \nI think I felt slightly stressed during the meal as the service was speedy and I felt a bit rushed. Maybe it was my Catholic guilt rising up feeling like we bumped someone else from getting in earlier. It was a lovely meal, lovely building, but it was not relaxing. \n\nWe took home an entire pie - a mixture of the three. Stuck it in the fridge and can you believe it actually tasted better the next day?? We warmed it in the oven and it was so delicious! \n\nI'm so happy we finally ate there - cross that one off my list. I don't feel compelled to drive all the way into Phoenix and wait in line for hours any time soon but I would do it again. Probably when I have guests from out of town and someone else is driving so I can enjoy lots of red wine while I wait.\n\nI'm torn between 4-5 stars but I'm feeling generous."

S"I have had Pizzeria Bianco on my 'Must Go List' ever since the day I first heard of it. My only obstacle? I live in upstate NY. So recently I threw logic to the wind and drove the 2500 miles for pizza.\n\nFor those thinking now that I must be a raving lunatic there were some underlining reasons. I suffer from a debilitating disease and decided to take my children on a cross country adventure while I still can. Also them experiencing first hand a individual who is passionate about his work can only be a inspiring and positive thing in their young years. Or at least I hope so.\n\nI guess I could go on and state how unique and great the pizza was. Or how the salads were made with the best ingredients available.\nOr how even the potato salad in the antipasto may be the best darn potato salad I ever tasted. I pretty much tried everything on the menu except one salad and found everything outstanding.\n\nBut I would prefer to address those who find it absurd to wait so long for pizza. I understand the puzzlement yet I believe they may tend to generalize it as just pizza. Which is not the case.\nWhere in this country can you find people waiting outside for two hours in the blazing heat seem so happy? Strangers laughing and talking with each other, telling stories of past meals at Biancos to first timers. The joyous atmosphere was one of the first things I noticed and it was contagious. Once in the dining room nothing changed, people taking a step back, slowing down and enjoying great food and company. That in my view is what great food is all about.\n\nProducing this type of magical atmosphere in a restaurant is extremely rare and can't be a easy task. But somehow Chris Bianco has and this may be the very reason why people are willing to wait. The truth is. It's more then just pizza.\n\nEdited to add. Those who claim it is just pizza. As a chef I can tell you the test of true talent comes from taking a minimal amount of ingredients and making them shine.And without pristine ingredients it is nearly impossible to make something great if one is taking the minimalist approach. Chris Bianco's pizza's are every bit as good as Thomas Keller's Oysters and Pearls. And are harder to produce."

S'I\'ve been a handful of times now.  All I\'ve had is the pizza, but I\'ve had most of the menu (not difficult with only 6 choices).  The last time I went my friends added additional items which didn\'t improve their pizzas.\n\nThe positives -- good crust and fresh organic ingredients\n\nThe negatives -- poor pizza design, poor execution, long lines\n\nOne bit of good news is that Pizzeria Bianco is now open for lunch.  The last two times I\'ve eaten here there was no line; both were afternoon meals.  The lines are still long in the evenings.\n\nI like the crust, as overly thin and slightly burnt as it might be.  And I appreciate the organic ingredients.  But they just don\'t taste very good.  The Margherita and Biancoverde, two pizza styles I normally love, are just kind of boring.  Supplemental ingredients (expensive to add and the restaurant actually adds too much of them to your pizza) don\'t help.  The Sonny Boy has sort of a sharp olivey flavor which isn\'t desirable, and the Wiseguy pizza is less than the sum of its parts.\n\nBut in addition to the flawed pizza design, I\'ve experienced inconsistency in the pizzas I\'ve had.  The same pizza can taste substantially different on different visits.  Some might argue something about each pizza being unique because they are made by hand, but my experience is that it is simply poor execution.\n\nOne last item.  This didn\'t contribute to the review, but is worth noting.  This has to be the worst pizza I\'ve ever had "the next day".  Whether eaten cold or reheated (something I do with a lot of pizza), it is borderline inedible.  Not a requirement for a good pizza place, bur don\'t over-order because your take home portions will just go into the trash.'

S'We came out for Spring Training and decided to see what all the fuss was about. The pizza is very good. Not even close to worth the wait. It just isn\'t. If you\'re from LA, just wait to get back home and go to Mozza. If you\'re from Chicago, just wait to get back home and go Great Lake or Crust.  If you\'re from New York, just go to DiFara. You\'ll be getting a better pizza at any of those places AND you won\'t have to wait for 3-4 hrs. Sometimes in situations like these I think that folks walk away saying "That was totally worth the wait!" so they don\'t feel like idiots for waiting that long for pizza that is good, but not THAT good. \n\nWe got the Wiseguy, Margherita, Rosa, and Sonny Boy. The fennel sausage on the wiseguy was pretty weak and the pizza overall was under salted. Too much smoked mozz just made the crust soggy. The sonny boy was better but a little boring. The Margherita was great (but once again, you can get better elsewhere.), and the Rosa was awesome. If you like Parmigiano Reggiano, you will love the Rosa. I have to wonder why they even bothered with the pistachios as you can\'t really taste them through the strong flavored cheese, but still wonderful. \n\nWhat I\'ll remember most is all of us walking away and asking ourselves "What the hell just happened?!". Again, I\'m not saying the pizza is bad. It\'s pretty good. Just not even close to worth the ridiculous wait. Never again.'

S"In Short: Awesome Pizza, long wait but worth it.  Take a book or five, while you wait.\n\nThere's nothing much I can say that haven't been said before, but I'll say it again anyway.  I loved this place, the decor was fake italian, perfect for a pizza place.  Kitchen is nice and visible, food is simple and non pretentious.  Waiters are very helpful but the hostesses are bitchy, just like NY!!!  I must confess though that I didn't have to wait more than 15 mins for a table, because I'm cool like that ;) I wish, but in reality I had reservations, and it comes free with searing looks from the rest of the folks thats been waiting in line for 3-5 hours.\n\nI really didn't bother with the menu we just asked our water to bring us his favorite combination of 8 pizzas and then enjoyed couple of bottles of wine and some antipasto (the roasted vegetable platter), which was sooooo good.  Pizza was amazing, and didn't disappoint one bit.  Ingredients were fresh, honest, and each component held it's own.  the crust was crispy and delicious, sauce was simple and non-overpowering, and the cheese was minimal, just like any good pizza joint should be.  \n\nfor a place this exclusive, the price was pretty down to earth, there wasn't an item on the menu more than 17$, can't beat that.  I can see why people would give this place 1 star, because it's a pain in the ass to wait so long for just pizza, and I could see people giving it 3-4 stars just because the experience as a whole, was disappointing.  In reality this is a 5 star pizza place, with 4 star service, and 1 star for the wait, but you should at least try it out once."

S"I'll be honest, I'm not quite sure this place is all it's hyped up to be. I mean, it's definitely fresh and good but I'm glad I didn't have to wait too long to get in. I have had better pizza before. for sure.\n\nWe were quoted a 45 minute to hour wait. No problem, we chilled at the bar next door and played a make shift game of chess. Just as I was about to stomp my brother's king we were called in. It hadn't even been ten minutes. What luck!\n\nThe place was swamped and the staff was clearly working very hard. For that reason we lost a little bit of the personal touch. I hate when I ask for something and it feels like I'm a burden. Still, they were very efficient. \n\nWe shared a small salad and the margherita pizza. I very much wish we had had one of the more unique options but Davis doesn't like white pizza. Ahwell. The food came out in a reasonable time and we dug in. It was not a cheap pizza. It was about sixteen dollars for one a little bigger than a plate. But it was clearly very fresh ingredients. And very thin but good crust. The salad was uninspired. It was only lettuce and a few olives tossed in dressing. \n\nYes, the pizza is good but I really wouldn't wait very long for it. And I don't have a problem waiting for food at all! This one just wasn't very fulfilling."

Also, guy who parked my car moved it as it was in a different place than where he first put it. Of the 100-200 pizza places i have gone to in my life, this one would be top 10 worst.'

S"Brought the kids here for lunch during a Science center day. Managed to sneak in before the lunch rush and got a table for 6. Woohoo. We ordered the regular cheese pizza for the kids, and my other nanny friend and I had this other pizza with sausage, onions and smoked cheese. I'd have to say I liked the kids pizza better than the adult pizza. The adult pizza was just too smokey tasting for my preference. My favorite part about Pizzeria Bianco- the cats wandering around outside the place. :) My overall opinion, doesn't live up to the hype. Good pizza, don't get me wrong, but I am glad I didn't wait hours for it."

S"Best wood fired pizza around and reasonably priced. True Italian style pizza by a chef who's done his research in the old country. Locally grown ingredients that are hand selected. Used to be that Chris Bianco made every pizza by hand and the restaurant was only open evenings, but now he has turned it over to his apprentices and opens for lunch as well. This has reduced wait times and the quality is still there. They've also opened a new location making it more accessible. I go every time I visit Phoenix.\n\nThis is not a place to go if you are hungry and in a hurry to eat. If you've got some time and enjoy a dining experience with friends, then put your name in and go next door to Bar Bianco, enjoy some drinks, appetizers, and conversation, and before you know it you'll be eating great pizza straight from the oven."

S'Dear Mr. Bianco, \nI am writing this to bring your attention to the rudeness of your hostess that was working 2/19/11. If you have more than 1 hostess let me narrow it down for you, short dark hair and glasses. I myself am a business owner and no matter how great your product is, amazing customer service is also an integral part of the the overall experience. I have dined at your establishment twice and both time the food was delicious even if the wait was long. \nBack to the night at hand. My boyfriend and I stopped by after dining elsewhere in hopes of grabbing a pie to enjoy the next day. We were holding the door open for those that were exiting, those that were being ushered in to their seats and those that were putting their name on the waiting list. When there was a lull said hostess says "Yes?" Not, "How may I help you?" or "Hi" or anything that could be construed as gracious, friendly, hostessish. My boyfriend states that we were looking to get a pizza to go. Miss Crab-Apple, my new moniker for her, states, no haughtily sniffs, "We don\'t DO orders to go when there are people waiting." Then she turns and walks away. She doesn\'t even ask us if we want to put our names down for a table. \nMr. Bianco we didn\'t know what your kitchen\'s policy is for takeout, maybe you should have a sign that is in huge letters right on the door: NO TAKEOUT WHILE OTHERS WAIT! I am sure that would clear it up for those of us that simply wanted to spend our money on your food, just not eat it there. \n\nThank you for your time, \nD\'Lisa Shayn'

S"I think I love pizza more than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles -- Cowabunga!  Is it worth the wait is what everyone will ask?  Well let's just say it makes it more worthwhile.  YUM -- Indeed!  First off, if you don't know, I'm what scientists call a carnivore -- Meat!  However, to my surprise my favorite slice of heaven was topped with Arugula & Ricotta cheese - Biancoverde is a must -- oh yeah! (think I'm having a pizzagasim here!)  The bitterness of the Arugula along with the sweetness of the Ricotta was amazing.  Like dude...it was awesome.  Our service was kind, fast, and speedy.  Ambience was cute, quaint, and homey....with a rustic feel.  I wish it snowed in PHX it would've added that extra flair of love and tenderness :) - Enjoy!"

S"Good pizza in Arizona??! Whaaaat?!!\n\nYes, that's the story to this place. Man grows up in Brooklyn, falls in love with Arizona, moves himself to said Arizona, opens a pizza place and BOOM! You have Pizzeria Bianco.\n\nSo being from NY, and after hearing much hype about this place and how, according to one NY Times critic, it could be even BETTER than NY pizza, I HAD TO HAD TO try this place.\n\nFirst off, let me start by saying that for an out-of-towner, this place was quite hard to find! It was facing the street but within a closed restaurant square just outside of Arizona U. Considering that we were driving and didn't know the area, we drove around and around the area a few times before we decided to just park the car and take it by foot. After parking the car and putting approx 8 quarters in a meter that robbed us of 20 minutes (max 2 hrs but we were prepping for the long wait that is also associated with this place), we walked only to find a parking lot right next to the restaurant. Grrrrr.... Lucky for us, we went on an off hour and had no trouble getting a seat.\n\nNext up, upon walking in we noticed that the place was teeny! No wonder they have such a long wait!!! I know that they're pizza was modeled after old recipes, but did they're structure have to model the old tiny places that the old NY pizza joints are also known for? I'd say no... So anyway, we sit, get a menu and are a bit thrown off by the prices considering the sizes of the pies in front of other patrons. $18 for a personal sized pie with only sausage on top??! Whatever... By this time we were a bit perturbed but fully committed. We paid our meter, lost the money, were seated, hungry and extremely curious about what all the hype was about. So bam... $18 gone for a little pie w/ fresh sausage on top. I swear this better be good!!\n\nAbout 10 minutes after ordering we received our pizza, fresh from the brick-burning oven with cheese melting and sausage steaming. Looked good; smelled good... damn better taste good too! We stared at the pizza for a while as we tried to soak in the size vs price and come to terms with the absurdity of it, took our slice and took a bite...\n\nThe suspense as we chewed, absorbed and swallowed. Was it even better than NYC pizza? Was it deserving of all the hype from Oprah and Diane Sawyer? Did it deserve to have up to 3 hour waits? Answer: No. As a New Yorker who has tried many of the old greats (Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, John's, Joe's, etc.), and even some of the newer ones (Pulino's), the answer was a definite No. And my goodness man who wrote the review in the New York Times, were you really being honest or did you just have a connection? That said, for Arizona, it was definitely fantastic. In fact, for the nation, it definitely falls into my top 10 pizza places within the U.S. Will I be back? Most likely not. I have my fill of NY pizza when I'm actually in NY, and I can't seem to swallow paying $18 for a pie that I could honestly finish myself on a good day. Will you regret it if you visit Pizzeria Bianco? I'd say almost definitely not."

Some times I'm actually sad that there is no wait because I do want to go over to Bar Bianco and hang out for a bit before going to dinner!  :-)"

S'I went there a few months ago on a Saturday with 2 friends.  I arrived at 3:30pm to wait for the 5pm opening.  There were already several tables of people ahead of me.  My friends arrived later and were kind enough to run and get me a glass of wine.  5pm came and excitement buzzed in the air!  Would we make the first cut?  I couldn\'t see why not, but just then several large parties arrived and went in first...due to the reservations allowed for 6+ rule.  The line started moving and sure enough, the cut-off was right in front of me.  We\'d have to wait.   My friends were irritated, even though I\'d done the longest wait, but I dug in my heels and said "I\'m staying, you guys can go elsewhere if you like".  They stuck with me and we went to the other building for an hour or so.  We had a cheese plate and more wine in the meantime.  Our number was up and we were stuffed into the last table at the back of the room.  We ordered 2 pizzas to share.  They were good but being so thin, not very filling and the dessert selection of tira misu wasn\'t very exciting.  We got the impression they didn\'t care much if we were satisfied, just wanted to keep the line outside moving, so I left still a little hungry.    Added annoyance was I forgot to have my parking stub stamped and had to pay the entire fee when I left.  So not a great experience I\'d say.   It would be really nice to go there and walk in like a normal guest, not in a herd, and enjoy my first glass of wine WITH my pizza.   Maybe it\'s better now that it\'s open during the day?'

(have fun with that!) We got there for a late diner at 8:30pm.\n\nWe had their tomato, basil and homemade mozzarella salad for starters.  It was awesome!

My girlfriend and avid yelper tells me though that i'm not supposed to post 5 stars unless its consistently the BEST i've ever had, so I'll abstain and go for a solid 4. \n\nI usually go for a basic red sauce pie with cheese and prosciutto. I'm not big for the white sauce. Their bread is great and they always have a nice, albeit small selection of beers. They've also opened up a location in Town and Country off of Camelback and 18th st, which makes it much more accessible to those unwilling to travel downtown and face potentially monstrous wait times for their dinner."

S'Visited Pizzeria Bianco last night, had to wait ~2hrs to get a table.  But sitting at Bar Bianco next door was just fine for me.  A few drinks and some great appetizers with good conversation was a great way to pass the time. \n\nGot the Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese, the farmers market salad - Honeydew Melon with a thin slice of prosciutto on top.  Pizza - ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios.  Everything was great!  Rosa had a lot of Red Onion though, probably would have been better with a large group to share instead of the only pizza for 2 people.\n\n Baseball Fans - check in before you go to the game and then come back after the game for a late dinner!'

S'Would you believe my family and I spent $15 on a cab ride just to eat a $7 sammie? We decided we had to hit Burgr also just to make the trip "worth" it, but I can tell you, the All American itself accomplished that. \n\nThe eating environment leaves something to be desired, but the execution of the American was perfect: a nice blend of savory turkey, melted cheese, fresh lettuce and tomatoes, with an added dimension of sweetness, thanks to the cranberries. The ingredients are neatly arranged without the bread getting soggy or the flavors ever getting lost. How do they do it? \n\nI don\'t think the concept of a hot sandwich is that novel (I literally never eat cold sandwiches, but that could be because I\'m Asian?), and so the 5-star rating I\'m giving surprises even myself. But then I remembered, this place is open 24/7. And it\'s cheap. And it\'s in Vegas. Even if you factor in cab fare, the Earl earns every star.'

I\'ve honestly never encountered that bad of an attitude from a stranger before, so I asked out loud, "what the hell?" and he CAME BACK OUT and exclaimed, "WHAT?!" like he was seriously about to fight me. \n\nI\'m 5\'2".

I don't think you can go wrong with any of their sandwiches. \n\nWe shared:\nThe Full Montagu - roast beef, turkey, two cheeses (aged swiss and sharp cheddar), lettuce, tomato, and house mustard\nThe Italian - salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, and zesty italian dressing\nMediterranean Chicken Salad - super fresh, and the chicken was really tender!  \n\nI can't even tell you which sandwich I liked better because they were both good in their own right.  \n\nThey're open 24 hours so eat here for dinner, go gamble, then come back and eat some more.

The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!\n\nJerk Chicken Sandwich\nFilled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!\n\nDessert\nBrownie Cream Sandwich\nImagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!\n\nService was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!\n\nWith that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!\n\nHappy Eats!"

Granted that it\'s only a sandwich shop, the food is served fresh, warm, and tastes pretty damn good!\n\nEarl of Sandwich is located in Planet Hollywood and normally there\'s a line but it goes pretty fast. Line = good sign for a restaurant. You order first and then pay at the end of the line (then they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready). There\'s limited seating space so you\'ll have to have a few of your friends lurk around and snatch a seat. But the best thing about Earl of Sandwich is that it\'s open 24 hrs 7 days!!!\n\nSo far I\'ve had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken - Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce (there\'s a slight kick to it, but nothing no one can handle...and the roasted red/banana peppers gives the sandwich a nice smokey flavor)\n\nand\n\nThe Earl\'s Club - Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce (I gobbled everything up...can\'t go wrong with bacon...IT\'S BACON!)\n\nI believe all the signature sandwiches are priced at $6.99...and that\'s an automatic win in Vegas (especially if you lost at the casino tables). You can add soups, chips, drinks, dessert, etc to your order as well but the sandwich is pretty filling - at about 6".'

I don't know how they make it, but it's sooooo good! I absolutely love carbs so the bread stood out to me the most - warm, light and flaky but chewy, all at the same time. The sandwich was pretty big - I only finished half of it and took the other half to-go. And for $7, it's reasonably priced. \n\nThe seating area wasn't too packed when I was there, but I can see how it would get crazy packed if there's a long line. It's self-seating so if it gets too packed, you can always have a friend save a table while you order! \n\nI finished the other half of my sandwich a few hours later. It was cold so it wasn't as good as it was fresh, but it was STILL amazing! I'm so glad they opened up another location in Anaheim. I'll probably be going there more often!"

It's open 24/7 for all you lovely belligerent and drunk, 5 inch heels in hand meaning blackened Hobbit feet, crusted yack on chin folks. The Earl just might be your savior.\n\nFor a measly $5-6, you can get a nice, freshly made and toasted sandwich. There are many options to choose from such as the classic club to the Hawaiian bbq. Of course there are other items on the menu like their rich tomato soup (I recommend the croutons on the side), salads, wraps, and so forth. \n\nThe word about the Earl of Sandwich is out so don't go bezerk if you see a pessimistic long line. Their efficient staff will keep the lines steadily moving and it shouldn't take too long for the orders to be called. The only downfall is possibly the seating for it may fill up quickly.\n\nOn our most recent trip to Sin City, we stopped by Earl's twice due to the fact that we stayed at PH and so it was always a short walk away. On a random note, I would like to state that for some odd reason I enjoyed the sandwiches from Earl the next morning after it was left out over night more than straight out of the oven. Perhaps it was the hangover munchies?\n\nGive the Earl a hollar if you're ever in the (702) area code."

Besides Earl of Sandwich that is.\n\nLove their sandwiches here; they're hot, flavorful, and satisfying, whether it be lunch time or fourth meal. Caribbean jerk chicken sandwich is where it's at, but every other sandwich I've sampled (yes, I take bites of my friends' food, who doesn't?) was delish. Went a taxi ride out of my way to eat here and it was worth it...maybe because I didn't pay for the taxi :)"

Try the Earl's Club, bacon plus turkey and that mystery sauce equals heaven in your mouth..... or if you want a spicy kick to it get the Caribbean Jerk. \n\nPerfect for broke college students, and it is a total bargain on the strip!\nFor 6 dollars and fifty cents why go to Burger King or McDonalds and get a soggy burger with a fries and a drink, when you can go to Earl's of Sandwich and get a bite of heaven . \n\nAnd to top it all off they are open 24/7, I'd come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. \n\nThis place is MUST, when it comes to places to try in Vegas!"

A highlight?  What the??\n\nI'm sure all of the other sandwiches here are bomb, but as others here have mentioned.. the tuna melt is seriously off the freaking chain and was the best tuna melt I've had thus far.  It's made with fresh Albacore tuna salad & melted aged swiss cheese.. all in a delicious ciabatta type bread.  Oh so good.\n\nThe broccoli cheddar soup here was so so.. a little too thin for me, but screw it.  The sandwich gets an A+.\n\nThe line can get long, but no worries because it moves quickly.  This is definitely the spot to hit up when drunk after a club.  I'm definitely coming back next time."

S'As I am writing this, "Earl of Sandwich" has 1186 reviews and 4.5 stars for a rating. The short of it is the rating is TOTALLY deserved. It is not 5 star in my eyes because there are no pastrami, corned beef or Rubin offerings (a fact that the order taker knew all too well) and so I can\'t in all good conscious give it that  1/2 star. But boy howdy, they know how to make a sandwich.\n\nI had the "Full Montague" and my wife the "Club Sandwich". Both were done just right with tasty sauces on bread that could stand up to the true test of a sandwich, which is, can you eat it holding it in one hand with poker cards in the other hand? This means the sandwich is stacked right, pressed correctly, not too moist to soggy out the bun, does not dribble parts of it down your shirt and most importantly not fall apart. If it meets those criteria AND tastes fantastic you got yourself a winning sandwich. And at "Earl of Sandwich" you got yourself a winning sandwich.\n\nI am not going to go into more details; the other 1186 reviews will state more than I can ever write. But I will say this: I am a Vegas Local which means I normally do not head into the casino for a sandwich, it is just too much of a hassle, but that may change now that I have tasted the goodness of "Earl of Sandwich", and I don\'t know of any better recommendation.\n\n"Earl of Sandwich" people, if you are reading this, open up one of these in North Las Vegas. I will drive to it; I will eat there... OFTEN. Please please please open one nearby. Amen!'

For $5.99 you get endless flavor stuffed into a lightly buttery portion of bread. It's breathtaking. Seriously.\n\nJust make sure you don't get lost and walk outside of the casino trying to find this place. It's to the left of the big globe! =)\n\nBy the way--It's open 24 hours! Lushes REJOICE!"

S'This place is the definition of clutch. Delicious food, fast service, and super affordable prices. A real lifesaver in Vegas.\n\nI swear that I eat here at least 2-3 times on every Vegas trip. Why? Maybe I don\'t have the appetite for a buffet. Maybe I don\'t want to pay $30 for an average restaurant meal. Maybe I\'m running short on time due to other "priorities". Where can I get great food without emptying my wallet or waiting endlessly? You guessed it.\n\nIt\'s remarkable how fast the service here is. Whenever I see the long line, I always think that it\'s going to take forever. Silly me, I should know better after all of my visits. This place uses an assembly line system to crank out sandwiches in record time. If only more places were like this. But what about the taste? No compromise here. The sandwiches are fresh, toasty, and hearty. I would highly recommend the Full Montagu, Earl\'s Club, and Caribbean Jerk Chicken. The prices are amazing compared to most food items in Vegas. Most sandwiches are under $7! For that price, you might as well get a few and stock up for later.\n\nAnd while I\'m not sure if it\'s open 24/7, I\'ve never seen this place closed. Let\'s just say I\'ve been here at some pretty odd hours too. Can\'t wait to come back!'

They're reasonably priced, some may even say cheap (at least I think so).  When you compare the quality & price of this to a chain, then yeah, this is cheap!  \n\nPlus, their service is pretty fast.  Although I didn't like the whole ordering your drink at the second cashier thing.  My only other complaint?  They messed up my drink order.  They gave me an ice tea instead of a lemonade, but ah well, it wasn't a big deal.\n\nDefinitely worth going to for a quick bite.

S'ok. im going to try to be fair to the earl. after all, it\'s not his fault that my feet hurt in my heels - which apparently got no traction on the highly-polished miracle mile (where this place is located) floors. it\'s not his fault that i ate shit -HARD- on the concrete floor, landing all knees and wrists and while walking with my boss no less. i concede that. \nit\'s not earl\'s fault that the miracle miles has the worst layout of all time, and an even worse "you are here" map, which led to even more risk of slipping and falling again as we wandered forever trying to find that wing it was stashed in.\nwe finally found it and for being a sandwich place i was kind of disappointed. there were maybe 8 options (versus a dilly\'s which is similar in price and order and pick up at counter style). really, all i wanted was a french dip (or meat on a bun with meat juice, as i affectionately refer to it and order when i am starving). but i settled on a tturkey, tomato and brie and their "signature famous" lemonade. the food took kind of while to finally be ready, and by then i was bruised, starving, pouting that they didn\'t have a simple sandwich staple and pissed that i finally had to *buy* a $16 pair of flip flops because i really feared i would fall again trying to find the damn place.\nanyway, it was just ok, and about halfway through the most ear-piercing, loudest fucking siren went off right above our heads. the emergency lights started flashing and the sirens broke - briefly - for a robot voice to inform the stunned and deafened consumers that an alarm had been activated and the reason was being investigated. then back to the sirens! really? it was so loud i couldn\'t concentrate, let alone eat. we tossed the rest and got the eff out of there.\nall the disaster aside, the food wasn\'t good, the lemonade was terrible, and the options were pretty bland -slapping brie on every other sandwich doesn\'t really make it unique or skyrocket your eatery out of subway level, people.'

S"On my last trip to Vegas, one afternoon I woke up to discover that three different groups of people I went there to meet had independently decided to go to Earl of Sandwich.  Although I had never heard of this place before, it was clear that I had to try it, and I am definitely glad that I did.\n\nThe first thing that stands out about Earl of Sandwich is the price.  When you are used to paying $8-10 for a sandwich in DC, $6 for a sandwich is fantastic.  And when that $6 sandwich tastes better than any that you're used to, it's mind-blowing to say the least.\n\nI tried The Original 1762, a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  I also had a taste of The Full Montagu, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard.  First off, the bread is outstanding.  It's toasted and has a great crunch to it, without being overly thick.  The meats are also great and the sandwiches have a good amount on them.  Although the sandwiches are a bit on the small side, they are ok for a smaller meal, especially when paired with chips or soup (which I did not personally try, but have heard good things about).\n\nOverall it's a great place to go and I highly recommend it.  That sandwich was one of the best I've ever had and I wish I had had time to try more of their menu.  Whether it's a late night snack or lunch, Earl of Sandwich is definitely worth checking out."

One size sandwich\nStopped here twice for back-to-back meals.\n\n1) Earl's Club: Meh. Filled with bacon, turkey, lettuce & tomato and sauce. I rarely find myself having to add seasoning/sauce to my food. However this was one of the times I had to add dijon mustard just to take away the somewhat blandness of the product. It pains me to say this but even a sandwich from Subway was better than this one.\n\n2) Hawaiian BBQ: Better than the Earls Club, IMO. Between the melted cheese, meat, pineapple & BBQ sauce, this one's a winner. Would definitely order this one again.\n\nThis place is great to try at least once based on all the talk. Sandwich is the perfect size when you have chips, salad, etc. I've had better sandwiches elsewhere but it was convenient due to staying @ PH.\n\nMain gripe: Keep a full stock of them big ass choc chip cookies.

S"This is actually a tricky place to review. On the one hand the All American is hands down my favorite sandwich in town (even better than the Bobbie at Capriotti's IMO), but the other sandwiches at Earls are really lacking. So basically for the All American alone I'd give Earl 5 stars, but since that's really the only sandwich my bf and I have liked here, I'd have to drop it a 4.\n\nThe All American is the perfect mix of tangy, savory and sweet and the bread is always perfectly toasted. I'm getting so hungry just writing this review!\n\nDo be prepared for a loooong wait if you go during peak or near peak times. Also if you're local, the drive, park and long walk to get to Earl is a chore and has kept us from going more often.\n\nI was really happy to find out that there is another location at the Palms (easier to get to), but I was thoroughly disappointed when we went. The ingredients were not as fresh and service was non-existent. It was like going to a completely different restaurant.and we wouldn't go back again."

S'Best Tuna Melt ever! Anywhere, hands down!\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, There are few things in life that are worth driving hundreds of miles for, amongst them is Earls. \nFor those of us who are not 21, there are very few activities we can enjoy in Vegas. Fortunately Earls is friendly to patrons of all ages. (although you have to hurry if you enter through the Planet Hollywood entrance; try and use the Miracle mile shop entrance to avoid being harassed by pit bosses and the like.) \nI have tried their house sandwich and roast beef, both of them taste alright. But the Tuna Melt is absolutely perfect, I really mean perfect. You can make no amount of spices or make any other adjustment to that sandwich which will make it taste any better! \n\nPros: \n*Best tuna melt in the US. Maybe the world.\n*Price (~$6)\n\nCons: \n*Long lines.'

Tastes like Hawaiian pizza with a BBQ kick!\n-Italian: mama mia! Delizioso!

Yep.'

Once again, I had to order the tuna melt. I love getting the sandwich and it's so hot it burns your fingers. I know it's definitely fresh. I take a bite; the cheese is so smooth, the bread is soft, and the tuna is delicious. Man! I loved the sandwich so much! I was so sad when it was gone.

S'tasty and reasonably priced sandwiches. definitely worth a visit.\n\nThe Earl Club:\n - a basic yet filling turkey bacon sub\n - nothing out of the ordinary \nThe Full Montagu: ***personal fav***\n - roast beef and turkey is a great combo\n - earl mustard makes sandwich even better\nItalian:\n - an awesome hearty sandwich\n - very bold and savory pizza-like taste\n\nAll of the sandwiches come on their special artisan baked loaf which reminded me of a lighter more luscious ciabatta. the desserts were extremely tempting but i was too excited to try the variety of sandwiches we ordered.\n\nits hard to find a cheap yet delicious establishment along the strip so when we came across this place we were pleasantly surprised. the storefront and staff were well kept making it more inviting to sample their delicious sandwiches. not only was the storefront and staff presentable but the wrapping of the sandwich was like no other. the light gold foil coated the sandwich perfectly. \n\nvisuals + taste + price = awesome * 10'

They are all pretty good but the Full Montagu is definitely the best.

My favorite I have to say was the Earl's Club. I totally want to try the other sandwiches when I come back, or better yet please make up in the bay area!!! I'd seriously come here everyday to eat. lol The wait was not that bad, and the workers there are extremely  friendly, even though i was probably drunk and obnoxious lol Sorry!

S'Went with the Original and the Caribbean jerk.  Listen to the Yelpers on this one.  Go with the Original and you should not be disappointed.  This place is great for two reasons.  It is open 24 hours a day, and it is super affordable.  $6 a sandwich is amazing for vegas.  The original is a roast beef sandwich, which had a hint of cracked pepper.  It was bomber.  the horseradish sauce was very pleasant as well.  The Jerk was not that great, good, but not great.  Go with the Original and you should be a happy camper.'

Some small complaints would be that the bread is equivalent to the bread served at Subway - they just toast the outside a little bit. Yet again, minor complaints. Also, the salad is not as fresh as possible, and some of the lettuce had brown spots. \nI highly recommend the Tuna Melt, the Club, and the Cannonball. Also, the tomato soup as a side is delectable. \nIf you are looking for a delicious sandwich during your time in Vegas, this is the place to go. It is also open 24 hours, so it would be the perfect late night snack!'

For my three day stay in Vegas, I've eaten here three times (all these times, sober). I tried the club sandwich, the carribean jerk, and the tomato soup. I can't deny bacon in anything, so the club sandwich was definitely a win. The carribean jerk sandwich had an amazing spread to it, packed a powerful kick with some tender loving. I've named the carribean jerk sandwich my favorite of all time. The tomato soup is topped with freshly baked croutons and is the right amount of creamy. I'd say the soup itself is filling for a light lunch. \n\nCheap, fresh, delicious."

I always thought it looked good and wanted to try it. So when you're broke from too much gambling and don't have the money to eat at the buffets, Earl's is my suggestion for you! Kind of expensive for a sandwich, but also pretty filling and might I add, delicious! I had the full montague and the italian and I like both. I even saved half for a little midnight snack and even after a couple of hours it was still SO GOOD.

S'Another 5 star review for this sandwich spot?! I guess so.\n\nWhen we got to Earl of Sandwich, the worst possible thing that could have happened, did. Their system was down for 45 mins - 1 hour. Which means no sandwiches for 45 mins - 1 hour. We kinda just stood around Earl\'s hoping a miracle would happen & their system would magically start working again. Wrong. Even Planet Hollywood workers stood in line behind us thinking everything was fine until we said "Their system is down for 45 mins - 1 hour. Do you know of any other good food places we could eat at?" Their response. "No way! Earl\'s is the only place we come for food." We didn\'t eat the whole day because we wanted to try the sandwiches, so we were pretty much starving. We couldn\'t wait, so we just ate at another local food spot for a quick fix.\n\nThe next day, we were able to finally try Earl\'s. The line was huge. I mean, for a sandwich? Is this line really necessary? YES. I can\'t really describe the feeling of this sandwich as it hit my taste buds. It was like a party in my mouth. I must say, the anticipation for this sandwich made it that much better. Something about the bread completes this sandwich. I got the All American, & also tried the Caribbean Jerk, Tuna Melt, & Original. They were all very delicious. For all you vegetarians out there, you NEED to try the Tuna Melt. Also, their prices can\'t be beat! $5.99 for any hot sandwich.\n\nI was in Vegas for 4 days, so trying out all the local top notch food spots was a must. Since 4 days is not that long, you wouldn\'t think of going to the same food spot twice during your stay right? Uhm, sure.. Okay. ;)'

The hot sandwiches were amazing, we ordered their club sandwich and original, with macaroni salad. After driving around looking for decent food that wasn't overpriced, we were really happy. We ate for under $20. I wish that we had heard of this place sooner instead of waste money on overpriced food that left us still hungry! We will definitely be returning!"

We ended up making it our nightly routine for the weekend - go out to the club, drink our faces off, go back to the hotel, GET A SANDWICH! Made my night every night. Over the course of the weekend we also had the soup, brownies, and chicken caesar salad. Everything was hot, fresh, and made quickly. It was super busy every time we went (including the first night at 4:30AM), but our food came out pretty quickly and we never left hungry.

By pairing it with an Earl of Sandwich sammich, of course!\n\nI was reserving my 200th review for a place that I considered near and dear to my heart, and Earl of Sandwich is just that!  I have been here countless times. I'm sure I have also been here without any recollection of eating here .. or of the night :)\n\nAlthough I try to order something different every time, I always find myself devouring the Full Montagu. What can I say? It just tastes right with my hurricane + octane + 3 extra shots Everclear / 151 FT concoction! Or maybe it is just that being inebriated dulls my decision-making ability. I also tried the bf's Caribbean Jerk on my last visit... not something I would have ordered myself, but surprisingly really awesome!\n\nI usually eat here during normal eating hours (mid-afternoon, dinner), so the wait is not bad, even though there will always be a line. It would be cool to check out this place post-clubbing hours, but there are so many graveyard steak & egg deals around the Strip that I have not made this place an option yet.\n\nLike the opinion of fellow Yelp! friend Michelle F., a Vegas trip without a visit to Earl of Sandwich just feels incomplete and disappointing. But now that Earl of Sandwich will be extending its franchise this summer to Downtown Disney Anaheim (most likely with shorter opening hours), I will get a chance to try every sandwich on the menu after all!"

I just remember the sandwiches are good.\n \nService: I was surprise to find a long line at 3 in the morning for sandwiches. It reminds me of fast food where you order and pick up. The staff is quick and fast.\n\nFood: I love their sandwiches but the portions are small to me. They even have Mac & cheese, salads, pastries, and soup.\n\nRecommendations: Best damn tuna melt ever.

Luckily for me, I stayed in the Westgate Towers at Planet Hollywood so we were only a stone's throw away from Earl's. Among my group of friends, I bet we hit this place up at least 5 times a day. My favorite is the club sandwich. The bread, ingredients, and special sandwich sauce they put in all meld together perfectly.

Can't wait to be back for some drunchies in two weeks! :D\n\nHoliday Turkey is their special thanksgiving time one and it was so good. I thought cranberry and stuffing in a sandwich would be weird. FALSE! it is delicious. It is literally a thanksgiving meal in sandwich form. Stuffing, gravy, turkey and cranberry sauce. GENIUS.\n\nThe chipotle chicken is a little spicy with avocado and bacon pieces I think. (I don't know I was eating it in the dark tbh LOL ) but it was good. probably my least favorite one, but all my friends say its their favorite.\n\nFull montagu. its the creamy sandwich that you've been looking for.

The combination of everything,,,,bread, chicken, pineapple, sauce,,,,,is just perfect! I gotta say it's a really good sandwich. Too bad it is located  in the sin city,,,,if not, I'm sure I will visit it more often. But still, it's a good choice if u need to grab a quick meal in Vegas."

S'The only sandwich I tried was their Tuna Melt but it here but it had to be the best Tuna Melt I\'ve ever had...so good in fact, that I had to go back again for another one!  The bread was perfectly toasted so that it was crunchy but still also soft on the inside, it had a generous amount of Tuna with just the right amount of cheese so that it\'s not overly greasy.  My other girlfriends ordered some of the other sandwiches like The Earl and Cannonball and they raved that those were just as yummy too.\n\nOne sandwich is pretty filling by itself but if you have room I\'d also recommend their potato soup.  It\'s tasty and hearty and doesn\'t taste processed or canned like some soups I\'ve tried at other sandwich places.\n\nTo top it off, their service is really quick too.  On our first visit, we called ahead to order 10 sandwiches and had only a short wait before our order was ready for us to pick up.  Even during the "after club" hours, we probably waited less than a minute before our order was ready.'

S"There is a reason why the line curving around Earl's which extends to the long pathway of PH's miracle mile exists everyday. Because the sandwiches are that. good.\n\nEarl's has never disappointed me - other than the brutally long wait that occurs at literally the most random times of day. I think I've waited less at noon than around 3-4pm. But duh, it's vegas, and when in vegas, bedtime doesn't happen til 6am so of course, lunch will take place later. So I suggest go as early as physically possible. \n\nThe full montagu and caprese sandwiches are my favorites, but literally everything on the menu is delicious.\n\nConsidering the lengthy line, service here is quick. I mean, lightning fast. After you order, the wait is no longer than 7 minutes (oddly specific of me, but I'm serious) to get your food. Making the long wait that much more worth it."

I did wish the sandwich was bigger, but after sitting and letting it digest, I found that I was fine.

Some people like drunchies to be unplanned, but my trip to Earl of Sandwich was definitely planned days before. The line was relatively long, probably took over 20 minutes from standing in line to sitting down and devouring my sandwich but the wait was so worth it!\n\nI got three different sandwiches: the chipotle chicken avocado, the tuna melt and the hawaiian bbq! YES - a small girl like me had to have three, but of course I didn't eat them all in one sitting. Honestly, if my boyfriend didn't stop me, I would have gotten a dozen of these sandwiches to-go. They were simply too good and I can't even tell you which one is my favorite because all three were amazing!!! \n\nThere are plenty of seating but as you can imagine, the lines are long and there are always a lot of people so seating may be hard to find. I didn't have trouble finding a seat for two, but that was at 3pm, which is more of a lunner hour instead of normal eating hours. \n\nTRUST ME. GO HERE.

S'After a long drive to Vegas, I was extremely hungry and in the mood to get something fast that I could eat in my hotel room. Bring in Earl of Sandwich.\n\nI must have gotten there at a good time, as there were only a few people ahead of me in line. I got my sandwich very quickly and headed back to the hotel room.\n\nI ordered the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich. A bit pricey considering the size of the sandwich itself. If you\'re a big eater, one sandwich definitely will NOT fill you up! The taste of the sandwich was pretty good, but it reminded me of a Quizno\'s sandwich. I think it was the ham (thin sliced) and the sauce, which tasted EXACTLY like the sauce you find at Quizno\'s. That\'s definitely not a bad thing, but I wouldn\'t call it the "World\'s Best Hot Sandwich."\n\nWould I come here again? Probably, if I\'m looking for a small, quick food option.'

I took out the Bacon and Tomatoes since I'm not a huge fan, but everything else was AMAZING.  The bread was ridiculously delicious - it had a gorgeous crust.

I went through the reviews and heard so much about the famous Montague so had to try it. It was tasty and overall good, however I expected it to have more of a wow factor. Not quite.. Wanted to try another one just to really have a 5 Star experience, but was too full. As for the service it was super fast and friendly, and organized.

Like most places, the advertisements show a plump and vibrant sandwich but what you get is a squashed lump in between two slices of bread. For $7 it wasn't bad, but it looked like it shrank quite a bit when they toasted it.\n\nI was a little confused at first because you tell the first employee what you want and then you take the receipt to the other employee down the line and they actually ring it up."

S"People have often asked me about late night eats in the City of Sin and usually the first place that comes to mind is Earl of Sandwich. The good ol Earl might just be the best thing that has ever happened to Planet Hollywood and for 24 hours a day, seven days a week it feeds many appetites for non-Strip prices.\n\nFor those not in the know, Earl of Sandwich is a chain. Not a Nevada only chain like some others were lead to believe, but a national one. It doesn't carry the name of a Quizno's or Subway's, only its way better and until LV gets an place that is local and convenient, it seems the rest will be flocking here and adding to the already silly lines that occur randomly throughout the week.\n\nMy sandwich of choice is the Full Montagu, a beautiful concoction of turkey, roast beef, lettuce, cheddar and swiss cheeses, tomatoes, and Earl's mustard. It's a classic choice, perhaps their most popular one, and it is delicious any time - whether its hungry and sober or hungover and blacked out. A fun combination is the Turkey Holiday (aka the Thanksgiving dinner), which features turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy. There are a multitude of sandwiches that fit every palate, every craving, and thankfully are between $5-8 each. This is considered a great deal on the Strip.\n\nIf you can stomach the lines and the sometimes impatient service, Earl of Sandwich is a rite of passage for many late night hungry folks on the strip. This is a way better alternative than shooting for the standard casino diner / cafe and worth the few bucks for a shot at sandwich glory."

S"This place has many, many good Yelp reviews, so I bookmarked it a while back.  Finally, we drove to the strip and gave it a try.  It is inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino (Las Vegas Boulevard & Harmon).  The Earl is near the Southern most entrance facing the Las Vegas Strip, right next to the Sugar Factory and the sports book.  The line was really long when we arrived and the seating appeared to be full.  I hate standing in line, but that is a good sign that they are doing something right.  Surprisingly, the line moved quickly.  The Earl is known for their hot sandwiches, we ordered two:  The Original 1762 is one of their signature hot sandwiches with roast beef, sharp cheddar, and creamy horseradish sauce on an artisan baked loaf.  I enjoyed the horseradish mayo.  The French Dip is only being served for a limited time.  It has roasted beef , sauteed red onions, on an artisan baked loaf and comes with Au Jus on the side.  I think they should have given a little more Au Jus.  We added a bowl of creamy tomato soup served with burnt croutons.  Cups of ice water are free.  Their bread is pretty good, but they are a bit stingy with the meat.  They slice the sandwich in half and the meat is clumped in the center giving the appearance that it has lots of meat.  Feels a little like false advertising.  The whole bill came in around $18.  By the time we got our food there was plenty of seating.  Apparently people move through pretty quickly.  The Earl is basically fast food like Quiznos or Panera Bread.  This place has a ton of reviews because it is one of the few places on the strip for tourists to get descent food at a low price.  I would eat there again if in the area, but it is not worth the hassle of the strip just for a sandwich.  Hey locals, there are far better options off the strip.  Looking for a good sandwich in a fast food type environment?  Try Jason's Deli."

S"BEST. SANDWICHES. EVER.\n\nI LOVE sandwiches in general, but so many places just drop the ball--too oily, too little ingredients, etc.\n\nI had the Earl Club here, and it was fantastic. Perfect proportions of turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. So tasty, and it was the PERFECT amount for me. They are healthier than a LOT of other sandwich places I have been to. My parents got the veggie sandwich, since they aren't too into meat. At most restaurants, a veggie sandwich means....lots of lettuce and not much else! This veggie sandwich was TASTY, healthy, and full of a variety of grilled veggies and melted cheese.\n\nI give this place 5 stars easily! I wish they would open up a store in the Bay Area though!!"

Feel free to come here anytime you like the sandwiches are fresh at all times.  \n\nWe ordered the Original, Full Montague, Hawaiian BBQ, and the Earl's club. I got to try a bit of all of those sandwiches except for the Earl's.  \nTaste is good but if I had to choose I would pick the Hawaiian BBQ. Chicken, ham, cheese, pineapple and bbq sauce goes really well together.  \n\nThe price for the sandwich is fairly priced but it's not that big of a sandwich.  Probably the size of a 6 inch sub.  They don't put a lot of meat inside as well.  It's more bread than meat for sure.  Some bites had nothing but bread.  \n\nDefinitely a good spot to hit up after the clubs though, using the bread to soak up all the alcohol and hopefully you won't puke it all out after."

Waited only a couple minutes to get to the cashier. Once we placed our order, we found a table and waited 5 minutes for our food. \n\nWe ordered the chicken chipotle avocado sandwich, the pastrami Reuben and tortilla soup. Both sandwiches were delicious! The sauce in the chicken chipotle sandwich was so tasty. It had a slight sweetness to it. And the pastrami in the Reuben was very fresh. Usually, you'll get a rubbery texture from pastrami at places like subway or togos but the pastrami here was much like Ike's (if you've ever had it). It was easy to bite through. And the tortilla soup was sooo tasty. So many flavors going on in there! And the tortilla chips on too add a nice crunch to the soup.

S'Earl of Sandwich is a touristy place with average tasting sandwiches. I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich without the bacon. The sandwich was poorly made and all of the ingredients in it were sub par. Romaine lettuce wilted and the cheddar cheese tasted like plastic. Bread was fine but the grill or panini maker they make it on needs to be cleaned more thoroughly because it had that dirty type of grill taste. Not impressed and this is why I rarely eat in casinos.'

I actually split it with my boyfriend and he enjoyed it too. I like the "crunch" factor of the bread and the saucy mayo, hot chicken, and nice schmear of avocado BUT they are kind of on the smaller size of sandwiches for $6-$7.

Located right in the middle of the Miracle Mile shops, this speedy sandwich shop is the cheapest and yummiest meal you will find on the strip.  \n\nThere are a ton of different sandwiches, salads, soups, and wraps that could fill anyone.  The Full Montague is always a hit with the roast beef and turkey all in one sammie.  I think I have tried over half of the sandwiches on the menu and I haven't been unhappy with any of them.  On a recent visit this past weekend I tried their Holiday Turkey sandwich.  It was delicious.  It had turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and gravy!  It was like Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  So SCRUMMY... I think what makes these sandwiches so good is the toasted bread.  The bread is super good.  Fluffy and crispy at the same time.\n\nI have had multiple friends eat this about 4 times in one weekend.  No joke.  At $6.48 ($5.99 plus tax) per sandwich, this place is a great deal.  Your belly and wallets will be satisfied.  You can go and waste the rest of your money on roulette."

The sandwiches were fresh, flavorful, and fun to eat! I was perfectly stuffed after one but some friends bought another and shared. I love how the bread is crisped and the meat inside tastes really good. My only critique would be that they all start tasting the same after awhile, unless there's horseradish in there, haha."

We were all quite hungry and this place is open 24 hours.  Sweet!  The line was a little long, but they're pretty quick with giving out the sandwiches.\n\nI really enjoyed the one I ordered.  The cranberries and the turkey basically melt in your mouth on The American Sandwich.  I usually don't like hot sandwiches, but this one definitely changed my perspective.  I forgot how good melted cheese can taste on a sandwich.\n\nI'd come back here again and again if I could.  Next time I'm in the city of sin, i'm going to indulge on a heavenly sandwich."

In case you've never been here before, you can just follow the long line of people- you order your soup, sandwiches, salads, or wraps at the first register and pick up extra goodies like cookies and pasta salad on the walk to the second register where you pay for everything.  You'll receive pager which will beep when your food's ready.  It can be hard to nab a table here during meal times but it's worth it.\n\nI got a chicken salad here since I'm trying to get ready for swim season and it's just not the same as the sandwich.  The chicken is that refrigerated/packaged chicken strips which are kind of spongy and bland.  On the brighter side, the dressing was great and the other toppings like kalamata olives and roasted red peppers were great.  The bf was smart and got the full montegue.  We also ordered the original to go.  Any sandwich here is a must.  Don't try to get something healthier like my salad cuz it just isn't worth it.\n\nand for all you lucky LA people... we will be getting one at Downtown Disney soon!!!"

S'In a town where a "cheap dinner" costs upwards of $20 per person, it was great to find a spot with great food and great prices! I went here with my husband and parents while walking the strip. We got the club, montague, and jerk chicken and we shared all three. The club and montague were filled with meat and cheese and veggies, but the jerk chicken was a little on the skimpy side. I was a little disappointed in the size of the chicken sandwich... after one bite I found that what it lacked in size it more than made up for in flavor!! And the banana pallets were such a great addition. Personally. A sandwich is only as food as it\'s bread and this place had amazing bread! It can be difficult to find a table, there were 5 of us circling like vultures! Oh... And it\'s open 24 hours!! What\'s not to love?? Two thumbs way up!!'

S"I was in Vegas last week and HAD to see what all the hype was about. A friend of mines went there a few weeks back and every meal he had was at Earl of Sandwich. Come on, how can that be? Had to find out. It's located inside of Planet Hollywood so it is not that easy to get to. There is almost ALWAYS a line from what I hear, especially around 2am-4am after the clubs. The place is clean, well lit and there are about 10-12 different sandwiches. Our group tried the Montagu and Italian sandwiches along with the soup. They also offer different salads and desserts. Everything they had displayed looked wonderful. The prep time for the sandwiches was short and everything came out piping hot. The anticipation was killing me. With my first bite, I was deeply in love. I had to sit back in my chair and contain myself. I really needed to take my time with this sandwich! The Italian was so tasty and delicious. The sandwich is soft, not soggy... with italian dressing. I normally cannot finish a full sandwich but I sure finished this one! The Montagu was great as well but the winner is the Italian!!! I also tried the Chicken soup which was good, the Cheese soup not so great. I am in love. Too bad long distance relationships don't work because I live like 4 hours away.

And considering the prices of most food in Vegas, this is the best way to get a good meal for 2 for under $20.\n\nThis joint is always busy, but the assembly line moves reasonably fast and worth the wait! \n\nIf you've never had an Earl of Sandwich EVER.... you've been missing out! My boyfriend had never tried it before, and even he agrees it's the best sandwich he's ever tasted. Now if only this existed in Canada... I would be a regular, and extremely obese.\n\nMy absolute favourite: Full Montagu - everything good jam packed into a sandwich. All the sandwiches are just as good though, including The Original 1762 and The Earl's Club. Like that there's also a variety of options for salads and snacks, though it's the sandwich that sets it apart."

S"When I heard about Earl's, I kept picturing a nice gourmet sit-down restaurant that lavishly only sold handsome sandwiches.  Little did I know that it was just another Subway style sandwich place--with darker interior and more sit-down areas.  Don't get me wrong though their sandwiches were super well made, actually no they were super well done with the warming up process.  I really want to try the sandwich non-warmed up to see if there is a difference with the taste and texture.  \n\nI ordered The Earl and the Hawaii BBQ Chicken which I both highly recommend.  Other people went more extravagant with their choices, such as the Full Montagu but I personally wanted to see if their basic sandwiches were even stellar.  \n\nThe location of Earl of Sandwich is incredibly convenient and I couldn't have asked for a better location.  Smack middle-ish on the Strip and very near the entrance of Planet Hollywood. The fact that it's opened 24 hours a day makes this place even more golden."

Well even if that is the case, my belly was very content and I'm sure the bread really helped soak up all the alcohol. In actuality, the bread seemed to be the star of the sandwich, not so much the filler inside. \n\nIn any case, I could only eat half that night and the rest ended up in my hotel fridge for morning after breakfast. It tasted delicious even then so I can only wonder how it tasted sans alcohol fresh out of the oven.\n\nI am a big fan, and for only 6 bucks for a HUGE sandwich, anyone would be crazy not to check this place out at least once!

S"I love the flavors of this place and the location. Good sandwiches and the Pleasure Pit--can I ask for more? Quick tips first though!\n\n1. There is a parking structure that enters into the rear of the Miracle Mile Shops.\n\n2. Earl of Sandwich is located near the entrance of the casino via Las Vegas Blvd.\n\n3. If you're taking the walkway, the shop is on the first floor. There is no direct elevator down to the first floor from the second floor shops! Use the escalator. Walk past, til you see Pinks and go into the doors of Planet Hollywood.\n\nEarl of Sandwich is one of our favorite stops in Vegas. The food is really great, the service is pretty fast, and the prices are really good--at least for Vegas. My favorite sandwich here is the Hawaiian Chicken. MAN the sauce is amazing on it and the pineapple slice along with the melted cheese is almost heavenly. Whenever my girlfriend and I come, we always order at least one Hawaiian Chicken sandwich.\n\nWe've also had the Earl Club, the Chipotle Chicken, and the Full Montagu. The first two sandwiches are good, though the Earl Club is a little too over the top with the sandwich sauce that they provide. It can get a little too messy and salty or it can be awesome and just right. The Chipotle Chicken is great too with a lovely chipotle sauce as well as avocados and bacon. The only thing we would not really recommend is the Full Montagu, just not as flavorful for us. The great thing about Earl of Sandwich is that their breads are toasted and rolled out of the machine on the spot. In fact you can watch them make your sandwich and roll it out on the grilling rack.\n\nOne of the things that I like is that even when the line is long, I can expect to wait maybe 10 minutes or so before ordering. The food is quick to come out as well. The only thing I would possibly say is an issue is that the service people may appear to be a little bit snippy when you're ordering a sandwich. This can be forgiven since I know that they deal with some fairly obnoxious guests that can be a little too drunk.\n\nAnyways, the prices are what makes this place really special. Realistically, $6.49 (Hot) or $5.99 (cold) sandwiches would be nothing to go on about in LA or in any other city for that matter, especially when you consider that the size of the sandwiches are not gargantuan and may be even on the small side. However, being that it is 1. in Vegas and 2. in a casino, the prices that they set are pretty budget. I love this place just for the fact that my girlfriend and I can get full off of $20.\n\nI just want to point out though that besides the sandwiches, we have also tried some desserts that they offer. My girlfriend swears by the chocolate brownie. I'm not a brownie person myself, but I can agree that it is rich and definitely chocolatey. Hope you guys can try it out for yourself!"

Don't get me wrong -- the bread was good... though it would've been nice to have more variety.  But then it's not really my way.  The sandwiches are pretty much done as an assembly line so there's not customization.\n\nBetter than subway?  Sure.  Worth the money?  Yeah.  Worth the hype?  No.  Would I come back?  Eh... don't think so."

S"Earl of Sandwich is located in the Planet Hollywood hotel. All the sandwiches are $5.99 (which is a steal in vegas). Think Quizno's but 100 times better in flavor and in quality. \n\nEarl of Sandwich offers several specialty sandwiches, all toasted on their famous artisan bread. When I first approached Earl of Sandwich, the line was wrapped around the corner, and I cringed, thinking I would have to wait an eternity before I could get my hands on one of their tasty sandwiches. \n\nTo my surprise, the line went by quite quickly, and we got our food order within 10 minutes. Not too shabby, especially with the mob that was surrounding the place.  \n\nHighlights:\n\nClub: Turkey, bacon, lettuce tomato, sandwich sauce. subbed out sauce for their house mustard which is a mix of dijon and honey mustard. The sandwich was just plain good. The bacon was not too fatty and it added the perfect smokiness to the turkey. The crunch of the bread mixed with the meat and veggies was a pure delight! This was my favorite sandwich of the day. \n\nMontagu: Turkey, Roast beef, lettuce, tomato, house mustard. I liked this sandwich too. There wasn't an overwhelming amount of meat, and again it all kind of worked together. \n\nItalian: This was also very good. Typically, italian sandwiches (i.e. grinders) are way too salty for me because of all the different types of meat (which all tend to be on the salty side) To my surprise, the warm sandwich really hit the spot for me without making me run for a glass of water to wash down all the sodium. \n\nHam Egg and Cheddar breakfast sandwich- I thought this breakfast sandwich was just ok. I definitely think that the other specialty sandwiches are better deal in price and in flavor. It was kinda bland, and I needed my special hot sauce to give it a zing. ($3.99)\n\nEarl of Sandwich was so good, that I went there TWICE in one visit (especially with all the good places vegas has to offer). It's definitely a good alternative if you're trying to stay on budget, without sacrificing flavor. \n\nHighly recommended!"

They actually have great breakfast sandwiches too for about $3 or $4.\n\nMy favorites are the Full Montague and the Chipotle Chicken with Avocado. With any sandwich, the bread is super important and it seems that Earl's does that just right.\n\nI come here almost every night of going out in Vegas, and I never get tired of it."

S"Anyone who gives this place more than three stars without being drunk needs to have their head examined. I appreciate that there's an affordable option on the Strip, but most casinos have a food court or casual eatery on site somewhere, so price really isn't enough to nudge this into the extra-stars category.\nThis is basically a slightly-nicer Quizno's.\n\nEarl of Sandwich is a chain that offers (what else?) sandwiches: warm or cold, with side options like chips and cookies, and the occasional soup or salad. While some rave about their bread, I guess I've gone on the wrong days because it didn't blow my mind.\n\nThe original is tasty, though I prefer a very light touch with my horseradish. It's refreshing to see a caprese on a fast-food menu, but the bread texture/density doesn't complement the delicate components of this particular sandwich.\n\nBut the fact that this place is rated one of the top five places to dine in Vegas based on star score and number of reviews is downright insulting to the hundreds of phenomenal restaurants we have, even including ones that are not celebrity-chef-owned or expensive."

The bread is really good when they toast the bread but after about an hour, if you don't eat the sandwich, it's not that good anymore.  Their salads are okay so should have got their wraps instead.\n\nOne morning I ordered the egg & cheese breakfast sandwich...definitely better than mcdonalds.

The line was long when we got here mid-afternoon, but it was moving at a decent pace.  THIS PLACE IS OPEN 24 hours, which is pretty awesome.  The service was awesome and the staff answers any of your questions in a friendly manner.  \n\nThe sandwiches are cut in half already, so it's perfect for sharing two different types like I did with one of my friends.

You won't be overly stuffed with the portion, but I was content.\n\nCHIPOTLE CHICKEN AVOCADO: This sandwich came with grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce, and this bomb chipotle sauce! I loved it and would totally order this again!!\n\nHAWAIIAN BBQ: This sandwich comes with grilled chicken, ham, swiss, pineapple, and bbq sauce.  I'm not usually a fan of hawaiian pizza or sandwiches, but this was awesome!!\n\nI loved both the sandwiches and their flavorful tastes.  Definitely stop by if you can! (:"

From the outside it may not look appealing but you definitely cannot judge a book by its cover when I comes go this sandwich. For $6.49 (regular) this can definitely fulfill any holiday meal craving you may have not matter time of year (Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing or filling for us east coasters, and gravy).

Bread is toasted and crispy but is very thin and has NO flavor whatsoever. Caesar salad was DRENCHED in dressing and the plastic container was over half full with those nasty soggy squishy chicken pieces. Yeah you're paying ~$6 per sandwich, but I don't consider that a great deal for such a small, mediocre sandwich. SO NOT WORTH waiting in that long line. People who like Earl's - you are trippin."

They do toasted sandwiches but Quizno's would be the mere fly on the stick compared to Earls. I had the Full Montagu sandwich and it was just off the chain!

I got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado with a Broccoli & Cheddar soup. The chicken was grilled to perfection with a perfect balance of chipotle sauce topped with fresh avocados. For those of you that are a big fan of avocados, the Earl Club is something to rave about. It's a classic sub with turkey and your sandwich essentials (tomatoes, lettuce, Swiss).

S'Every other time before this current trip to Vegas I would have given Earl\'s 5 stars. Let me explain...I am a regular here in Vegas coming about almost every 2-3 months. Earls is my go to place every single time. One being they are right within the hotel I stay at (Planet Hollywood/Elara), two being they are 24 hours, and number reason being they are the best sandwiches on earth! the tuna melt and Hawaiian BBQ are my top choices while I do very much enjoy all the other kinds! Trust me I want to give this place five stars but here is what got me to give only 4. This current trip that I\'m on I haven\'t had the best experience...apparently since they are open 24 hours they need to "refresh" their system (registers and what not) which is totally understandable. BUT they pick the worse time to do that...12 am, the time that most are heading to earls! And it causes this 10-15 minute wait which feels like forever when you\'re hungry!!!!!!!!!!! Another reason for me is that even during regular hours of the day the service seems to be so much slower. I find myself constantly having to repeat my Order cause it seems like they don\'t pay attention the first 3 times and they just seem out of it...then down the line the sandwiches are prepared much slower than usual and I notice this is because the employees spend too much time laughing and joking around causing (from my experience) a bunch of errors in orders and it takes so long for it to be ready! And it can get very frustrating! Despite the delay sandwiches seems to have gotten smaller as far as the filling it\'s much more less than it use to be. Over all yes I will continue to be a regular here and always be. I love love love love earls here at the Planet Hollywood but there can definitely be improvements!!!!'

Then again anything beyond 5 items to a drunk is to be considered an extensive list. And unfortunately it doesn't help if they are unable to make the single tuna melt that I had ordered. Not wanting to wait any longer I ordered the first sandwich on the list.... which I have no recollection of what it is called. I can't tell you whether it was good.

Sounds like an odd combination, but it definitely works. Bf ordered the full montagu, and said that it was good too. Can't wait to go back to vegas to try their other sandwiches."

S"The perfect and most convenient place to eat a delicious sandwich whenever you are on the strip and close to Planet Hollywood. Their Earl's Club is my all-time favorite. I first had this sandwich in 2011 and I keep ordering it every chance I get because it is one of those things that you start to crave!!!\n\nThe restaurant is small, clean, and the staff is very friendly. I have seen a few people being mean to the staff (as I stood in line) but they were very courteous in return and never retaliated!"

S"Looking for a quick cheap bite of food right on the strip? Well look no further than the Earl of Sandwich at PH - it is worthy of the title Earl of Sandwich for a reason. \n\nThe location is in the rear of PH near the mall area and generally has a steady line throughout most of the lunch and evening dinner rush. \n\nMy first visit I had the BLT and was pleasantly surprised by flavors of just those basic fresh ingredients. The bacon was generously diced up and tied together on their signature bun so well we came back the next day. I then tried there Holliday sandwich at the recommendation of my friends, though it is not the same as Capriotti's I was slightly nervous ordering it here. IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING. The simple flavors of thinly cut turkey, cranberry, and stuffing come together so well on this sandwich I  wish there were more locations throughout the U.S. The house brand chips pair very well with any sandwich you order - my personal favorite was the sea salt and vinegar.\n\nThere is a selection of teas, soda's, and beer offered at this location with prices on par with other locations in the area.\n\n5 stars - you have to check this out, it's worth your time."

S"Tis true.  Hail to Earl of Sandwich.  This mighty establishment has made a fine addition to our meals at all hours around the clock.  From the late night munchies of a Montague to the early morning hangovers of a Tuna Melt dipped in Brocolli Cheddar soup. \n\nAnd when there is no piling wait out to the slot machines...you'd be a damn fool for not taking advantage of that opportunity.  \n\nBest part: It's less than $10 for your soup and sandwich!  Try getting that kind of treatment anywhere else on the strip.  It's a rarity"

Earl of Sandwich has a large selection of hot sandwiches at very reasonable prices compared to other places on the strip. Most of the entrees are $7, and you can get out with a fountain drink and chips for about $10 total. \n\nI ordered the Caprese sandwich and I would definitely recommend it for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. The fresh mozzarella was delicious and creamy, the bread was nicely toasted, and even the balsamic was good. The tomatoes were a little flavorless, but this isn't the season for fresh tomatoes anyway.\n\nI'll definitely try to make a second trip out here before I leave to try another one of their sandwiches.

Lo and behold, Earl of Sandwich came up and with so many reviews and a good overall rating, we decided to check it out.\n\nWe (my girlfriend and I), split the Caprese salad and settled on the club and the Italian for hot sandwiches.  The salad wasn't bad, the cheese was fresh and it had a good taste overall, but compared to the ones we make at home it wasn't bad.  The club was great, it had a smoky taste to it that I really liked.  My girlfriend had the Italian which was amazing.  Great blend of flavors and it was exactly what she was looking for.  \n\nWe were hoping to make it back again over the weekend to try some more of the menu items but were unable to do so.

That gives you a fresh baked sandwich and nice melty cheese.\n\nIt's still 6 bucks for a sandwich that's not real big, but at least it's good.  We tried three different ones, and they were all good.

Luckily for Earl of Sandwich, the bread has a light crisp on the outside with a moist, soft, and chewy texture on the inside... no cutting the roof of your mouth here... thank you sandwich gods!\n\nAs a first timer this weekend, I decided to try the original sandwich..the meat to bread ratio was decent and the horseradish sauce was not too over powering in flavor; great compliment for the thinly sliced and tender roast beef and cheese...  I was able to taste my friend's club sandwich which was equally as heavenly as mine. For the price, portion, and quality, this sandwich has amazing value...half of one sandwich and some chips made me full but the fatty inside me could not put it down... i had to finish it while it was still warm LOL\n\nDefinitely gonna be back to try more on their menu on my next visit to Sin City."

I figured the bread might get soggy because of the sauce, but it wasn't at all!  The bread was tasty too, and very light.  I became quite the fan and made frequent visits here on my trip.\n\nI tried the Caprese sandwich which is basically slices of mozzarella cheese and tomatoes.  This by far was my absolute favorite sandwich there.  The vinagerette was perfect with the melted cheese and the tomatoes were just perfect!  \n\nPrice was decent too, if you're on a budget for food in Vegas, I'd definitely suggest Earl's, there are plenty of choices to choose from, and you'll want to try just about everything on the menu!"

It was AMAZING.  So good and everyone in my group of 7 said it was one of the best sandwiches they've ever had in their life.

Unless you go at a real-late hour, though, be prepared for an understandable wait, and even if you do go real late there's a risk. Full Montague, every day, all day."

S"It's the most boring sandwich I've ever had. I guess if you think Subway's and Quizno's is good, then this might be on par with them, but this place isn't even in the same league as the like of Specialties Cafe & Bakery. I had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich today. If you were to have 100 Jamaicans taste this sandwich and ask them what flavor it is, I'm sure 99 out of 100 times, the answer wouldn't be Jerk Chicken. The sandwich had some run of the mill pre-packed, pre-cooked, sandwich-chain chicken breast with runny mayo sauce that can be quickly squirted from a squeeze bottle. It probably has a tiny bit of Tabasco in it to wake it up. Bread was nothing special. Don't believe the hype."

(Could use more meat though.) \nMy girlfriend got the Earls Club and she thought the sandwich was flavorful but was lacking in the onions and pickles department. This is why she would rather give this a 3 star. \n\nOne of the cons would be the location itself. It is not actually located IN the Miracle Miles shops....its more like somewhere near the front of the casino so if you park inside their ONE AND ONLY parking structure, be prepared to walk for a bit."

The lines moved rather quickly: 1.you order and a receipt is handed to you 2.move along the line, pay at the next register with anything you picked up along the way and you also order your cup for the fountain drinks at this register. They hand you another receipt and a buzzer.\n3. When your buzzer buzzes pick up your sandwich next to the paid register.\nThe only thing I wanted more of was the meat! There was hardly any meat in The Full Montagu. It's not something I would go back for or crave for but  is something light and close by that I can grab when at Planet Hollywood. It's good enough to fill me for an hour or two. Something to try but not a must."

Usually it's wrapped around the corner.\n\nMy hubby had the Jerk Chicken and I had the Earl Club. I didn't ask him too many questions because I was too busy stuffin' my face. \n\nThe bread they used was amazing. From the looks of it I thought it would be harder but it wasn't.

Decent sandwiches, kinda small for the price they charge you.  The Italian came with a variety of meats like salami, ham and mortadella. It was topped with tomatoes and a vinaigrette type dressing. The Full Montague had roast beef, turkey, cheese, tomatoes. The bread was really good, they were hot sammys, so it came toasted. The sammys weren't bad, they just weren't anything special.

S"Summary: Pretty solid sandwiches for a pretty good price.  Great bread.  Quality ingredients.  Fast assembly.  An excellent choice for a good meal for just one $.\n\nI had just arrived in town with a friend for 2013 CES and we wanted to grab some late dinner on a Wednesday.  We made reservations for Mesa Grill the next night, so to balance that out we wanted to eat on the cheap.  We Yelped and came across The Earl of Sandwich and made our way down the strip.\n\nIf you come into Planet Hollywood from the strip, you basically have to walk straight back a ways and keep to your left.  It is part of the food court.\n\nIf there is a line, it moves pretty quickly because they just take your order, you choose your drinks, and then you pay and take a number.  When your food is ready, you go and pick it up to the right of the cash register, and there is plenty of dining space for everybody.\n\nOn this visit I got the Jerk Chicken sandwich while my buddy got a Chipotle Avocado Chicken sandwich, and then we split a Spicy Italian.  Each of us enjoyed the quality of the ingredients and the way they all worked together between two perfect pieces of bread.  All sandwiches were very flavorful, nice and toasty, and pretty economically priced at around $6 each.  Is it the same price to quantity ratio as Subway? No. But it is a better quality experience for just a little more.  I'd defintiely recommend a visit to the Earl."

It goes fairly quick though and the staff are fairly efficient.  Sometimes there is even someone walking through the line who will hand you a menu so you can decide before you make it up to the counter.  Also, they give you a buzzer to notify you once your order is ready.  They have typical beverages including sodas, juices and even gatorade.  They also sell beer by the bottle.  Additionally, they have about 3-4 soups available per day.  Salads too.  Plenty of seating as people are pretty much in and out."

Instead, I ordered a Chinese Chicken salad, my sister's bf ordered a Tuna Salad, and my bf ordered a sandwich (I think turkey with cranberries?). The salads were only decent... something spectacular. The sandwich was good, the cranberries were a nice touch, but it wasn't the greatest sandwich ever. \n\nI want to say this place is over-rated, but I have to try a sandwich to make that claim. Their frozen lemonade was good.... typical. Service was rushed and when our to-go bag handle broke, the servers behind the counter were in such a rush to get everyone's order in that he didn't bother to replace the bag. Oh well.\n\nMight try it again, esp since they are coming to Downtown Disney in Anaheim."

S'I was really craving a "nice" dinner somewhere and my new Vegas friend and I decided to try out the buffet here since we heard good things from other people about it. Also I had gotten kicked out of the Wynn earlier in the day and it really made me want to walk around inside in a spiteful and evermorecurious manner. \n\nDownsides:\n-It will cost you upwards of $40 bucks for dinner.\n-Lots of nuts in food, but they have labels for food allergies! \n-After partaking of the lunch buffet at Paris, I felt the selections here weren\'t that different. \n-Only power outlet that I could find was in the bathroom. (You don\'t want to know. Or do you?)\n-King crab legs were still frozen :(\n-Sushi sucks, no sashimi at all unless you count the smoked salmon sitting on a tray in a different section.\n-Prime rib was better than the buffet at Paris and it was tender and more edible, but lacked flavor. Maybe I\'m meat spoiled. \n\nUpsides:\n-Beautiful beautiful decor!\n-I got to try rabbit, which I can\'t remember if I\'ve had before but I would like to say that I have. So let\'s say I got to resample rabbit. \n-Lots of choices.\n-Beautiful dessert selection.\n-We got to traumatize an older couple sitting next to us. Muhahaha.\n-Silverware and table settings are still in new condition. It sucks to eat somewhere that has ratty utensils. Just saying.\n-Our server was great with her timing. She would come by to clear plates and refill drinks without being gone too long, or checking up too frequently. \n\nOverall, it was great. I wish I could have eaten more and that I got to experience it without having buffet for lunch so I could have appreciated the food more instead of comparing.'

The service was good, quick refills, friendly, and fast with cleaning used plates off the table. \n\nHere are the problems with the Wynn buffet:\n\nAtmosphere - upscale mall food court\nQuality of food - I did not at all feel that the quality of the food met the $39 price tag. Everything was bland and under seasoned. The salad was good. The pasta bar (chef makes in front of you) was seriously lacking in quality - white pasta shells, a few button mushrooms, and canned Alfredo sauce. \n\nThe crab legs were a big hit with the crowd, long lines.\n\nWe picked here and there. I wanted to try a lot of different foods. Unfortunately, all entrees fell short of me wanting to eat more than a few bites.\n\nThe desserts: WOW! Really delicious, huge selection, crepes made in front of you, a dozen varieties of cupcakes, pies, a variety of gelato, cheese cake, all in bite size pieces. My favorite: the molten brownie. Least favorite (of the ones I tried): key lime pie. All in individual serving sizes.\n\nMoral of the story? Wonderful, tasty, tempting desserts, and mediocre food.

S"Friday morning of our Vegas trip.  It was 11:15.  We figured by the time we get to the front of the line, it'll be lunch time.  The line slowly moved, but we eventually got to the front of the line.  Lunch was $24.95.  Or something like that.\n\nThe central dining area is brightly lit by a huge skylight and the faux fantasy forest provided a stepping stone for the imagination.\n\nTypical buffet set up with various stations offering a variety of dishes and cuisines.  The prime rib was good, as was their fried rice, leg of lamb, the gyozas were decent.  The had other items such as pizzas and pastas, sushi, other Asian dishes, a salad bar, and a few other things.\n\nI would have to say the star was the dessert station.  They had at least 12 different desserts, all in small, 2-3 bite servings but they all looked so delicious I wish I could've had them all!  Oh, they also had gelato, with as many toppings and syrups as you want.  I didn't get any gelato but I had a bite of my friend's coffee gelato and it was REALLY strong.  The only thing that irked was one of the ladies didn't know who the executive pastry chef of the hotel was when I asked her.  I later had to google it, finding out that is it none other than the awesome Frederic Robert.\n\nOur server could've been a lot better.  She wasn't around much and we constantly had to flag her down for refills on our beverages.  One of the busboys was doing a better job than she was.\n\nI would definitely have to say this compares to the Bellagio Buffet (review to come)"

Since our trip was pretty last minute, we really only had half a day to spend in Vegas, but we still made time for one buffet so we chose to eat at the Wynn for lunch. While standing in line I told my dad i heard really good things about the buffet so he started to wonder how much it was going to be per person. My cheap dad thought it was only gonna be 18 bucks for lunch! ha ha \nBut I knew better, so after i told him my guess, he said "LETS GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!" of course we convinced him to stay! \nAnd boy was he glad he did! \nThe Wynn buffet has such a huge selection of food. They had sea food, sushi, Asian food with a congee station, omelets made especially for you, pasta\'s, soul food, different kids of cheeses, bagels, breads, BBQ hen, prime rib, waffles, pancakes, parfaits, soups/salads/fruits, Mexican food, Italian food...u name it, they had it! \nOh and did i forget to mention their dessert?? They had a ton of different things there, felt like a kid in a candy store! the dessert selection alone is worth the $30+ bucks /per person. \nOh...I do have to say one thing though, pass on the candied apple, it \'s really just for looks, the candy coating is a pretty red color but tastes disgusting! It\'s impossible to eat too, i almost hurt myself trying to get a bite of that apple! \nOther than that, everything was amazing, even their unsweetened ice tea was the best i\'ve ever had!!

S'Every time I go to Vegas, someone always suggests "This hotel has the best buffet!!!" and every time I end up being disappointed. However, I wouldn\'t say I was totally disappointed but I wasn\'t amazed either. The food wasn\'t really different than any other buffet except the food looked more expensive...if that makes sense. I think maybe because it was the brunch but who knows. The wait wasn\'t very long and we went exactly at noon. \n\nEveryone in the party loved the congee and it was just ok for me. I thought the "bacon" (not the regular bacon but the bacon carved next to the prime rib) was really tasty but very fatty. But who doesn\'t like bacon...amirite?!!?!'

S"Glad we started our 4-day stay in Vegas with this buffet. Quality selections, clean environment, and FRESH seafood.  We went to the studio B buffet at the M resort as well as Le Village buffet in Paris. Both of their seafood selections are nowhere close to what this place offers. We spent two hours trying out most of the food and they certainly did not disappoint. Even though this place is a little bit pricey compared to other places, it's well worth the money."

S"Ok so the Wynn hotel is pretty nice.  It caters to high rollers and the super wealthy.  I mean how many other hotels on the strip have a Rolex branded store that actually caries every known model of Rolex including special editions?  The answer is none.  This is 1 of 4 Rolex stores in the world as of 2008 and first one in the USA.  At the same hotel is a Ferrari / Mazerrati dealersihp.  Ok so there's also a high end shipping center but really, I think the Rolex/Ferarri combo says it all.\n\nOk so wouldn't you expect a hotel at this caliber to have an exceptional buffet?  Yeah I did as well.  However, I was grossly dissappointed.  I'm not easily pursuaded and I really have very little prejudices.  I really try to give each location I review a fare shake and be as objective as possible.  The food was flavorless and the selection was 1/3 what it should have been.  The food really was flavorless.  It was pretty bad.  The best parts? (Soup...the best dish in the whole place was the Curry sweet potato soup).  The other really delicious food item was a dessert.  The coffee ice cream was up there among some of the finest.\n\nOn a very serious note, the Wynn buffet really isn't even worth half of what they charge and I'm only raiting it against other buffets so you know that the standard that I'm using is apples to apples.  Go to Bellagio if you want to see how a buffet should be done in Vegas."

S'I loved the decor of the entrance and already set me in a good mood to start my meal off with my parents for lunch. It kinda looks like something out of Alice In Wonderland with its stacked plant fruit/veggie arrangement going in. \n\nI didn\'t have anything terrible. Some things were okay but there were many standouts that let me leave happy. There were wonderful fish dishes that were pretty tasty, good charcuterie selection, yummy little salad, great roast beef and lamb at the carving table. Decent tuna hand rolls. Carmel mousse cups were creamy yet light enough to not be overwhelmed. Gelatos had a good selection and very good! \n\nI always am willing to pay more for quality, and this was good enough to warrant the price in quality and ambiance. Sure I can get a fantastic one entree meal somewhere for the price, but sometimes I just want to try everything like a little fatty girl. Yeah, I can sit here and get my money\'s worth! \n\nComing back for dinner or sunday brunch. So far the lunch was impressive. Definitely a favorite when it comes to buffets and I\'m not a "buffet person". I go, but I don\'t do it often. This I would gladly come to a bit more often.'

S"Went during the Christmas Holiday to New Year's time period so Sunday Brunch was about $40 a person. Was it worth it? No. Maybe because I'm not a breakfast food person and most of the food were breakfast items. The line went pretty quickly. We were in line, paid, and seated within an hour.\n\nThey had a bagel station, shrimp cocktail, sushi area, Asian inspired food, create your own omelette station, carving station, create your own eggs benedict station, Mexican inspired food, breakfast pizzas/pastas, cheese/breads, oatmeal, and salads.\n\nI got to try their smoked salmon which was nothing special. Prime rib was pretty salty, but they cooked it medium so not as pink as I would have liked. Plenty of shrimp cocktails, but how could you mess that up? Eggs benedict was a fail. You have a choice of lobster, original, and other choices, but they ran didn't have lobster or canadian bacon so you only had the choice of pork loin. Why ask me what I want if that's all you have! I ate a bite and threw it away. They had a congee (Asian porridge) station as well which I thought was pretty cool, but it wasn't hot at all, it was like room temperature...\n\nAs for the desserts, I was expecting something spectacular! However, I was pretty disappointed. They have 2 sides of desserts and they were all basically repeats. They have a small selection of cakes, ice cream, and other stuff. The only thing that stuck out to be was the passionfruit tapioca, but I just scrapped off the passionfruit and ate that.\n\nService:\nOur server was friendly to everyone else, but us. Took awhile to take the dishes away. Took awhile to refill our glasses and wouldn't even bother if we didn't ask. Most likely won't be dining at this buffet again...Come closer to dinner time. That's when they brought out the snow crab legs, oysters, and lamb chops!"

S"What a disappointment!  Although it was rated as one of the best buffets in Vegas, it turned out to be worse worse than average.  Note: we went here for lunch, not for dinner.  Maybe they serve better food after 4pm?\n\nWhy such scathing review?  Let's see:\n\nThey promised sushi and ceviche.  From sushi, there were only salmon and cucumber rolls--with 5 times more rice than salmon.  I disassembled the rolls, extracted the small piece salmon inside, and realised that it tasted like it was cured to allow it to last longer.  Only one of the ceviches actually had seafood (the other was mushroom seviche).  I tried the scallops that I was able to fish out--they tasted like pure vinegar.\n\nPretty much all the fish they had was overcooked: baked salmon, fried tilapia; smoked salmon tasted icky.  Only the sea bass was worth coming back for.  There was also a delicious polish sausage.  Anything else?  Not really: rubbery meat; average salads; cold saut\xc3\xa9ed bok choy (it's only good while it's still hot).  The only redeeming factor of this buffet was the strawberry cheesecake, that was absolutely amazing.  I think I had 4 shotglasses.  (They serve dessert in shotglasses.)\n\nSo I was full, but I wasn't satisfied by the experience."

S"Typically, I don't have a pleasant dining experience whenever I visit buffets.  Aside from not being able to eat my money's worth, I generally don't deem buffet food as superb and fresh.  \n\nThe buffet at the Wynn, on the other hand, was rather enjoyable.  Yes, just as other reviewers have confessed, I stuffed myself perhaps a bit too much, slipping into a food coma or post-meal narcolepsy.  Despite such crime against the pancreas/liver (with a minimum of 1000 calories in fat and carbs), I must say the food was delicious.  The prime rib and the king crab legs were my favorite. The dessert bar was a sweet tooth's absolute heaven (or haven).  Their creme brulee was by far my favorite, and I believe I went through 4 of them just to crack the top and eat the crispy, caramelized sugar.  \n\nAfter about 2 hours, it was time to call it off, and we sluggishly waddled our way out.  Next time, a prophylactic cocktail of a PPI, a statin (and maybe even a fibrate), and insulin would be a wise choice."

S'So much hype! We were promised that this was going to be an amazing experience and it really wasn\'t.  Maybe my taste buds and stomach were not ready for the explosion of food since I had gone to another buffet earlier in the day.\n\nThe "highlight" of this buffet is the crab legs.  I ate them only because I figured that it was the only way I could get my money\'s worth. But the crab legs were cold, salty and not even that good.  Plus, you have to wait in a long line just to get to it; it\'s not worth it.\n\nThe prime rib was actually pretty good. I did like it.  I also liked the gelato selection at the dessert area.\n\nSpeaking of desserts, they were probably better than the entrees.  The hot brownie was also delicious! The creme brulee was below-par.  While the top was fine, the custard underneath tasted very odd.  I\'ve had a lot of creme brulees in my life and this one didn\'t make the top 20.\n\nI\'m glad I gave it a try but one time is enough.'

S'My first impression upon walking into this buffet was, "gez, they need a remodel". I think the seating area in general looked a bit outdated compared to the other glamorous buffets around the strip. \n\nAt first glance, the food looked good! However, i wasn\'t too impressed when I started eating. I was not wowed as I would be when i tried other buffets like at the Cosmo, or even Paris. I would think that Wynn would try to compete with the bigger Casinos when it came to food, but apparently they might be competing with the likes of World Buffet. \n\nTheir dessert section was kind of embarrassing. I think hometown buffet has a bigger selection than these guys. They had the usual ice cream, cakes, and they had an eye appetizing Candy Apple. I was actually really excited to try the candy apple since it looked like it was the best thing that was being displayed on their dessert selection. I was curious as to why i didn\'t see one person reach for it, but I soon realised why. It was only made to be an eye pleaser... The candy shell was hard as a ROCK. It\'s impossible to bite through it, you literally have to take a knife, place the apple on the table, and smack it. And even then, the hard shell barely cracked. I can\'t believe that they put rock candy on their apple, it was completely inedible. For 3 minutes, i tried cracking the shell with my knife to get to the apple, but I failed. The only thing that I had from that dessert was the rock candy, which wasn\'t even that good. \n\nOverall, not impressed with this $40 buffet. I\'d rather go to circus circus and spend 20$ on their comparable buffet and spend the remainder of my money on alcohol.'

S"All the food rates no less than 4 star restaurant food. The desserts are good. You get what you pay for. I'm not sure what drives me not to give it 5 stars, something like they have preservative in their soy sauce package and other gut feelings. It might have 4.3 or 4.4 stars though.\n\nWe had the christmas dinner. I don't think there was difference in food, it just cost more.\nI think, we had a little trouble finding the place for parking. Better figure out where it is to make things smoother. Dinner starts early (3?) and costs more. We decided to go earlier to avoid waiting too long.\nHow can you go to Las Vegas and not eat at a reasonably nice buffet? :)"

S"I have to say that the Wynn buffet did impress me.  The different assortment of higher quality food (for a buffet) was excellent.  However, I was conflicted with giving it 3 stars because of the service.  It took a long time for my girlfriend and I to get a glass of water.  Then afterwards, they forgot about our refills even though we repeatedly asked.  Busy or not, this shouldn't be tolerated.  Also there was a gnat in my girlfriend's food.  This could have been from the floral arrangements located around the buffet.  They did give us a free glass of champagne for that, however, the service was still abysmal.  \n\nIf you can put the service aside though, the food was great, the desserts were average with ice creams, cakes, and other goodies you would find at a buffet.  If you want to try items such as lamb, rabbit pasta, and other entrees you wouldn't usually find at other buffets, then try this out."

I really liked the Tandoori fish and I usually do not like Tandoori too much. \n\nThere are ample crab legs and as much prime rib as you could hope for. They also have sushi (skipped it as it looked pretty standard), hummus, babaganoush, a variety of salads for the vegetarians, pasta, soups, and amazing dessert. I liked the creme brulee and the lychee pudding the best. \n\nI wish they had sashimi - that would have been excellent. \n\nOverall, I think the $37 price was well worth it. The variety and quality can't be beat (although I love the Bellagio buffet too). \n\nGet there early as I hear the line can get pretty long - 2 hours +. Luckily, we were there on a Tuesday night around 6 and only had a 10 minute wait."

S"Still one of my favorite buffets in Vegas. As with any buffet, there are things that you can skip, and things that they are simply awesome. In terms of food, these guys at the Wynn know how to cook their prime rib, shrimp cocktail, chinese dishes, and all the bacon-based breakfast dishes. I would say the best part about Wynn is still their dessert selection, ranging from home made ice cream, warm bread pudding, different kinds of cakes, brownies, cream puffs, among others...You can spend the $35 and just have dessert and get your money's worth. The ambiance is great! Super clean, bright environment, and usually it doesn't get too hectic. Definitely try this place if you've never been!\n\nSome things to watch for is that If you're there for brunch, don't do any of their egg dishes - usually either too runny or the egg benedict's wayy over cooked. The french toast is pretty bad as well. I'm not a big fan of their Italian section too...way too much pasta and not enough of the main ingredients..."

My husband is giving me that look like "you better be ready to make them feel our presence here!" Luckily, we skipped dinner the night before and were STARVING.  So we sit down and order our drinks and head to the buffet. I don\'t know what I was expecting, but this was my 1st Vegas buffet and WOWZAAAA! Sushi, shrimp, dim sum, rice, eggs, sausage, bacon, bagels, pastries, desserts, ice cream bar, pizza bar, omelet station, seafood station, salad bar, fruit bar, Mexican food....I mean Jesus H Christ! It was INSANE! I started with breakfast food and mimosas, but by round 3 I was drinking wine and eating sushi. I think we both went back about 5 times, and I had about 6-7 drinks. Needless to say we left feeling stuffed, ashamed, and I was drunk. We took a long nap afterwards! Only regret is leaving a 20% tip up front instead of leaving cash on the table where we know the server would get it! Can\'t wait to return!'

Sigh\n\nI understand if we had shown up as the doors were about to close and the prime rib wasn't available, but cmon this is a pricey, supposedly upscale buffet where running scarce on prime rib should be a foreseen issue. \n\nThe rest of their food was ok at best, with none really catching my eye or compelling me to come back for seconds.\n\nI will say that the best part of the buffet was their dessert section.

It's like waiting in line at disneyland, the lines wove around and around. \n\nThe buffet is about 30 dollars but they have champagne brunch for 36 dollars as well. The champagne is good, they use Freixenet Champagne, which I like, and they also bring you orange juice for mimosas if you ask. The champagne is unlimited and we drank to our hearts content. \n\nThe food is gourmet from Asian sushi and soups to Italian rissoto and pastas. The thing I found most interesting is that all the food is gourmet, but they had congee with pork sung!! That is the ultimate Vietnamese porridge and we ate that because it was so cheap!! I had to try a bowl and it was delicious. \n\nI had mostly breakfast food, but I also meandered to the Italian section to try the lamb rissoto and it is the best risotto i have ever had. I think I had 3 bowls of it. \n\nThere is a whole dessert room that had different flavors of ice cream, eclairs, cupcakes, doughnuts, and cookies. You can get on a sugar high just being in this room. \n\nEven the coffee to sober up was good.

S'Rumor has it that the Wynn buffet is the finest buffet in Vegas.\n\nRumor is right.\n\nI have to make a disclaimer first, though: I\'m not a buffet fan.  In my experience, buffet food is bland, stale, and mass-produced.  Plus, I can\'t force-feed myself enough stuff to justify the cost.  \n\nThat said... In terms of quality and atmosphere, the Wynn buffet blows all other buffets out of the water.  No other buffet comes close.\n\nWe decided to give the Wynn buffet a try on a Monday morning.  I was surprised that there was already a line, but it moved quickly.  After paying the cashier, we were ushered through the bright and cheerful entryway to our seats.  Water and OJ appeared in front of us in no time.  \n\nThen we wandered over to scope out the savory food...\n\nLet\'s just say that the selection is... obscene.  Don\'t bother trying everything here; it\'s impossible unless you have a black hole in your stomach or something.  Be strategic with what you want to taste.  My memory is too hazy to provide an unabridged list of the deliciousness available at the Wynn buffet, so I\'ll begin by recalling a few highlights from the savory options:\n\n** Pastas (delicious bowties with pesto, rigatoni, etc.)\n** Fried chicken (crispy outside, juicy inside -- superb!)\n** Mashed potatoes (creamy!)\n** Gazpacho (fresh and tangy!)\n** Bagels and lox with cream cheese and LOTS of fresh onions (my weakness)\n** Vaguely Chinese-inspired stir-fries (flavorful and not greasy)\n** Omelets made to order (yum!)\n** Beet & orange salad (love!)\n** Split pea risotto (amazing texture)\n** Carnitas bowls (nicely done!)\n\n... and my mind is blanking on the rest of the delicious savory goodies.  \n\nThere were some lowlights sprinkled in, though:\n\n** Pizza (rubbery, grease-soaked, and inedible)\n** Sushi (slimy rice-balls that are better suited for throwing at people you dislike)\n** Prime rib (overcooked into oblivion)\n\nOf course, the shining star of the Wynn buffet is the dessert room.  The sweet options here are mind-bogglingly diverse and 100% delicious:\n\n** Gelato bar\n** Marshmallow "lollipops" dipped in chocolate\n** Keylime cheesecake\n** Cr\xc3\xa8me br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e\n** Chocolate chunk brownies\n** Strawberry tarts\n** Candy apples\n** Mini red velvet cupcakes\n** Cookies galore\n\nI lost count of how many plates of food I went through.  :-/  In my defense, I only took a bite or two (or twenty) from each one.  :-)   The Wynn buffet is the (main) reason I had to hit the gym reeeeeeeeally bad when I returned home.\n\nViva Las Vegas... and Viva Wynn buffet!'

S"We got off the plane and dropped our bags off at the hotel and the first thing we did was hit up the Wynn Buffet.  We hate buffets but love the Wynn.  So many great choices with out all of the hillbillies touching everything.  I was only able to fill up 2.5 plates of food but that is still alot for me.  \n\nHighlights were....spicy tuna handrolls, carribean ceviche, bbq pork sliders, and of course all of the desserts.\n\nWe went for lunch and it seemed cheaper then the last time we were in Vegas.  Price may seem high to some but the quality of food is way better then anything you'll find at any of the competing buffets."

S'I\'m Torn on this one.  3.75 Stars OK?\n\nI\'ve been here...3 times now?  I think its finally adequate to give them a review. \nThey were probably "THE" buffet back in 2009 or 2010.  Since, then I believe they\'ve regressed a bit.  There\'s like a million reviews on here so I\'ll just compare this and bacchanal, cause someone\'s going to find this useful!\n\nround 1 : Carvery \nBacchanal: Terrific Leg of Lamb.  OK sausage.  OK Ham.  Tasty (a bit salty) briskey.  Salty pork rib (No BBQ sause) .Missing Prime Rib?\nWynn: Best beef rib.  Juicy prime rib (I waited for a good piece), didn\'t touch anything else.\nwinner: wynn\n\nround 2: seafood\nBacchanal: Amazing selection.  Fresher oysters.  Creative mini dishes.  Spectacular soups.  good support of sauces\nWynn:  lacking in options.  Very good cold king crab legs.  small oysters.  \nwinner: bacchanal\n\nround 3: sushi (i know its seafood...)\nbacchanal: why bother?  5 different rolls and sushi combo?\nwynn:  not much better, but they did have a very delicious seaweed salad.\nwinner: wynn\n\nround 4: World assortment (so i clumped it up..)\nbacchanal: pho/udon station, cheese and ham station.  Italian station that served steamed crab (bonus point for seafood).  Wagyu beef sliders ( overrated..).  Good looking chinese food station.  Nice assortment of fruits and salad. \nwynn: nice dim sum platter, specialized salad dishes, a lot of italian inspired foods, points for ramen station. \nwinner: bacchanal.\n\nround 5: dessert\nBacchanal: gelato, cookies, creme brule, crepe, cakes, creme buffs, candied snacks\nwynn: same\nwinner: tie.  This should have been the wynn\'s but I think they pulled back some items that used to be there... disappointing.\n\nAh crap, I thought I got a winner out of this.  It\'s 2-2-1.  Well, if i had to spend my next $50 bucks on something... I\'ll say bacchanal...just because The WYNN told someone in my party over the phone that Dinner was a cheaper price then what we actually paid for.  That totally did not go well over with us.  ARE YOU LISTENING WYNN?!'

S"This buffet is an experience!  To get the most bang for your buck....catch champagne brunch right before it ends, then head right on over to the crab legs at approximately  3:30pm.  They serve them cold, which surprised me, but they are already cracked in half and ready to eat.  If you like dessert, they have an entire dessert room.   Very good service, can't tell you how many times she filled up my mimosa, and even one to go."

S"We went to Wynn Buffet for Christmas because we knew that, as vegetarians, we'd have way more options here than anywhere else.\nThe wait was LONG, clocking in at about 3 hours.  It went by fairly fast, and waitresses brought water bottles around for everyone.  One thing I wish someone would have remedied was the screaming kid who wouldn't stop crying for the ENTIRE hour wait in the inside line.  Cramped quarters, low ceiling, shrieking child.  Not necessary, one of the parents should have taken him out of there (and one of Wynn's staff should have told them so).  \nOnce we were seated, we asked our waitress if she could point out for us which dishes were vegan.  To our surprise and delight, she went and got a chef to personally take us to every single station and show us which options were vegan.  He was so friendly and went into detail about several dishes.  My favorite part was how the crowds parted ways for us.  It was definitely star treatment.  :-)\nThe food was absolutely incredible.  The highlight for me was the pasta bar, where you can pick your ingredients and sauce.  The alfredo (vegan!!) was ridiculously rich and perfect.  I'd live on that stuff. \nThere were so many veggie dishes that I filled up way before getting to try them all.\nDEFINITELY worth the price.\nMy only complaint is that they could always use more vegan desserts!  I think there were only 2 options when we went."

S"I was SUPER excited to eat here... but left unimpressed. Sad face. I must say, the Bellagio buffet is hands down the best buffet in Vegas. Sorry Wynn buffet!\n\nHUGE selection of items. Salads, cheeses with crackers, pastas, fish, ribs, turkey, chicken, prime rib, mashed potatoes, crab legs (NOT KING CRAB), sushi, desserts, etc... the layout is VERY nice and the restaurant is VERY clean. Our server was super busy and wasn't as on it as I would have liked... but eh, what can you do? \n\nI normally try a tiny bit of the things that look pleasing to me and then go back for what I really liked. I ended up liking the mango salsa mahi mahi (VERY tender mahi mahi), the mashed potatoes (yummy buttery goodness), and the prime rib (prime rib is prime rib). Nothing exciting. I tried almost EVERY dessert. Literally. Hell I'm paying $44 for dinner, I should be able to! I liked ONE. Yes. ONE. And it was OKAY. I can't even remember what it was. \n\nSorry Wynn buffet... I won't be back... I'll be chillin at the Bellagio buffet!!!"

S'After every trip to vegas, i tell myself "no more buffet!" But i still haven\'t learned.  The selection here wasn\'t as good as i remember. I wouldn\'t pay how ever much it was for the just okay food.  I only went because i had a free voucher on my red card from playing the slots.  My friends and i came for lunch on a monday so there was no wait.  We paid the lunch price and because it was already 3:00pm, it rolled over to dinner service. (not so secret buffet trick that i\'m sure many have used).  My friends like to sit for hours and try everything.  My favorite part is always dessert. I love the tiny little cakes and trying a scoop of every gelato flavor.  I probably wouldn\'t come back unless i won another free buffet or my friends were very insistent.  I only do buffets under certain circumstances. Otherwise, the food in general in most buffets aren\'t worth the price. NO MORE BUFFETS!  I\'m getting old and my stomach is getting weak.'

I didn't get the high class quality I had at the Bellagio or Cosmopolitan buffet. \n\nThey had crab legs, only cold ones, in a messy pile. I've had warm steamed ones at  much lower level buffet restaurants. Sushi seemed to have been refrigerated for a while. I didn't like the taste of coffee for some reasons, but I guess I'm just too picky.\n\nTables were crammed in. I felt like I was sitting at a food court, sort of. \n\nOverall foods taste all good, but I give this buffet the same grade as Mirage's Cravings, which is much cheaper."

S"SO DELICIOUS.  Pro tip: lunch ends at 3pm, dinner starts at 3:30pm.  Dinner is about $15 more expensive than lunch.  Go 20 minutes before lunch ends, pay lunch price, eat all the delicious lunch food slowly, take walks, enjoy, save some stomach space.  Then check out what they break out for dinner!\n\nFavorites:\n1. pea truffle oil risotto - creamy & delicious & truffly.\n2. creme brulee - this was a dinner dessert.  VERY rich, but small portions so not overwhelming.\n3. cold seafood: squid ceviche, cocktail shrimp, smoked salmon, creamed herring\n4. pastas both in seafood & italian sections\n5. slices of flank steak - not dry, quite flavorful, cooked medium rare.\n\nThe less goods:\n- big chunks of fish in general I thought were kinda dry and not terribly flavorful\n- cup of thai beef salad was weird and definitely not thai and just vinegary & weird.\n- Indian food at dinner: not as flavorful as Indian food in an indian restaurant\n\nService was great - very friendly and attentive.  Over all, a huge selection of food with a lot of light options, so that you can try a lot of awesome food that you wouldn't normally get to eat without feeling disgustingly full.  Major thumbs up!"

S"I came here for dinner right before a show at the Wynn Theater. And I must say what a buffet experience it was. When one thinks of a buffet, this is not the generic one that comes to mind. If anything, this place is far from that. \n\nThe decor is very aesthetically pleasing. Being located in a classy hotel like the Wynn one can only expect this. The bathrooms are very clean and easily placed near the eating area for one's convenience. The hostesses were very friendly as well, seating us close to the food. WIN!! :)\n\nThe food is what people come here for. They have a wide selection of choices, one will surely find something to satisfy their stomachs content. What I found most enjoyable was the beef brisket, ham, maple syrup battered fried chicken, seafood, and even Chinese DimSum like Shu Mai which I was very surprised to see. The Shu Mai here was excellent, in many ways better than NYC Chinatown Dim Sum! \n\nI had a pineapple juice which was tasty, as far as drinks go, they will bring you anything ranging from coffee, tea, juices, sodas, water, etc. \n\nThe price per person was $40 for dinner, plus tip you're looking at a flat 50 which is very reasonable being a buffet with quality food and great service. The waiters keep clearing your finished plates off so by the time you're back its grub time. \n\nFor those who loves to gorge on endless amounts of delicious food with a great selection, this is Buffet Heaven. This is an ideal place to grab dinner right before a show in Vegas."

Despite the horrendously long line for dinner, the buffet was great! Definitely caught me off guard, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI\'d recommend that you walk around the whole buffet, get a good idea of where things are- then start off where they have all the goodies! For me, those were the crab legs! I wish I wouln\'t have stuffed myself with pasta prior to the crabby goodness!'

S"to me, a buffet is a buffet is a buffet. don't get me wrong, I like being a fatass and eating everything in sight, but at some point the food costs start to run a bit high and then quality takes a dip. However, that has not really happened here! ha!\nAs I discussed in my other review for the Wynn overall, my experience is one of extreme privilege, as my friend received a GREAT deal for free over here. This also means we got to cut to the front of the line, and the buffet was comped. It looked expensive for everyone else though, haha.\n\nThe food itself was pretty solid, nothing truly spectacular but everything was solid quality. King crab legs (pre-cracked), shrimp cocktail, sushi, lox, har gow, potsticker, indian food, prime rib, leg of lamb, veal ossobucco, pasta, pizza, charcuterie, soup, salad- a little of all of the preceding list passed through the gaping maw of my mouth. As for the desserts, there were a fuckton that I don't even remember all of them. I know there was a crepe station."

S'When you think of Vegas buffets you usually think of bad food, bad service and cheap prices. None of these things come into play at the buffet at the Wynn.  The interior of the buffet is beautiful. There are tons of plants and flowers all over the place. The line to pay and be seated is usually long. I was surprised the first time I ate here when I found out that it is around sixty dollars a person for dinner. I thought to myself this food better be fresh and not cafeteria style like most Vegas buffets. \n\nOnce seated our server came up and asked us what we wanted to drink. Since they charge so much to eat here I figured they would have a huge selection of drinks. When I asked what they had to drink the man smiled and named all types of drinks. Everything from soda, to all types of juices to regular or chocolate milk and so on. After we ordered our drinks I decided to go take a look at the food selection. When I got into the food area I was pleasantly surprised. They had the biggest selection of food I have ever seen at a buffet. I ended up trying everything. It took me four full plates to accomplish this. Everything was absolutely amazing. The crab legs where the freshest I have ever seen or tasted. The pasta bar had many types of sauces and pastas to choose from. All the different meats (prime rib, sirloin, etc) where all cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. Then after all those plates I decided to hit up the dessert section. I swear to you when I walked into that room I felt I had died and gone to heaven. They have so many items to choose from. Again I tried everything. I had homemade donuts, creme brulee, a big and moist cupcake, and more but the best things were the crepes that they make fresh right in front of you. \n\nOur server was perfect. Even though he was in charge of a very large area he managed to never let our drinks get half full. \n\nI have been to many buffets in Vegas but none come close to the buffet at the Wynn. Five stars all the way.'

I would give most buffets 1 or 2 stars, whereas this one gets 3.\nThere was a vast selection of different cuisines, so the chances of finding something you like are pretty high. But there was nothing that really knocked my socks off. Guess I was just expecting more from this place.\nThe prime rib was inedible (for my liking) because it was practically raw...I think I saw it move.\nThe crab legs were served really cold & were too salty. I prefer crab to either be warm or at room temperature.\nSo, the two things that I looked forward to the most were a disappointment. \nI must say though, the desserts were very impressive! \nThe lardass in me would go back just to load up on the desserts. \nEverything else was edible & no one left hungry that night.\nOn the way out of the buffet, we ran into Vince Neil from Motley Crue.

S'4.5 stars for an awesome lunch and dinner.  \n\nTips and tricks from a bunch of scheming money-saving Asians:\n\n$35 for weekend brunch (I think for dinner, it\'s another $5, and if you want the Champagne brunch, it\'s about $40).\n\nTip #1:  TIMING and PRICING\nTo get the full spectrum of food awesomeness, the WHOLE enchilada (mmm, i do want enchilada right now...), order the brunch around 2:30pm - 3:00pm.  Why?  Well, dinner starts at 3:30pm, so if you get there at around 2:30pm, you\'ll probably wait in line for about 15 minutes, pay the cheaper rate for brunch, and then get seated and ready to hit the buffet line and access all the brunch items by 3:00pm.  You can eat two or three plates of brunch items for about 30 minutes.  Then, right around 3:30pm, they change up the buffet lines and bring out all the new dinner items.   And, BAM, that\'s where you come in, ready to hit up the dinner buffet.  And you can get it all while it\'s fresh and hot too.  Two meals for the price of one; a ton of variety for $35.  Makes sense?  YES, I think so too!\n\nTip #2: CONSUMPTION STRATEGY\nThis is a generic eating tip. Go SLOWLY.  You\'ll be able to consume more and digest better.  I alternate between heavy and light plates, and the Buffet at Wynn certainly has its share of light and heavy items.  They\'ve got everything!  For example, I started out my first plate with a giant omelet, and some other carnivorous items.  My second plate, I opted for some vegetables, fruit, yogurt.  Third plate I returned to a combination of light and heavy, with some seafood pot pie, balanced out by a light salad and some more veggies.  That way, you can pack in more, and enjoy it along the way.  It\'s all about eating respectable amounts, but still getting a taste of EVERYTHING. \n\nTip #3: THE FOODS\nNow, we\'ll get to the actual foods that you should devour.  The seafood pot pie was HEAVENLY.  It was so full of flavor and the puff pastry parts were light, crispy, airy.  A must-eat.  Well, unless you\'re vegetarian, in which case this buffet might be a waste of your time and money.  The duck salad was amazing too.  Tender slices of duck packed some mean flavor into the light spring greens mix.  A good cleansing meal in between heavy rounds.  The desserts are all pretty good, and I especially liked this thin chocolate cake/wafer item and another cube strawberry layer cake with some kind of cream/custard in the middle.  A warning on deceptive foods that aren\'t actually so good: the omelet is tempting but just average, it will fill you up because it\'s really large, so be careful.  Also, you might be tempted to get the mini Kobe slider because, after all, it\'s KOBE.  Well, it\'s also not very good, the bread is hard, and the meat is dry.  Don\'t be deceived.  Save room in your stomach for the better things.\n\nThere is a smorgasbord of great foods here, and it\'s probably one of the better buffets in Vegas.  I was very impressed by the variety, which has something to satisfy everyone.  Hunks of carved meat, extensive seafood and sushi, many different kinds of salads, cheese and cold cuts, fruits, huge variety of desserts, hot entrees ranging from Italian to Asian, and everything else you\'d expect at a Vegas buffet, and probably more that you wouldn\'t even think of.\n\nHalf a star off because the service wasn\'t so great, nobody filled my cup of water/juice the entire couple hours I was there.  \n\nBut hey, it\'s a buffet, so it\'s about the food, not the service.  And the food is AWESOME.  \n\nTake my advice; follow the strategy; leave happy, satisfied, and most importantly COMFORTABLE.  And I say "most importantly" because the worst feeling is coming out of a buffet feeling like a whale.  I went outta there feeling very satisfied and happy that I ate a large yet respectable, classy amount.\n\nMission accomplished!'

S'My husband and I were staying at the Wynn over Thanksgiving, and attempted to go to the Wynn buffet after we checked in around 5:30. We waited in line for 2 hours, and by the time we got to the end of the 2 hour line, we were offered VIP tickets to wait 25 more minutes for around $10-$15 more per person (on top of the hefty $46/person meal we were already paying) or to wait in line for another 2 hours. By this time it was already 7:30 and we were starving. We decided to head up to our room and try the Wynn buffet for brunch the next morning. Glad we did that. We walked right in at about 10:30 a.m., no waiting in line, and paid the still large price for brunch. The selection was great; I still got my traditional thanksgiving fixings I had missed out from the night before, and had some breakfast food and then everything from italian to asian. Have to say the Caesar salad was a bit too fishy tasting for me, so that was a disappointment. The desserts were the highlight for me, as they were so delectable looking. I got a candy apple just because it looked to appealing, even though I really despise apples. I give just three stars because of the price and the waiting in line for two hours for nothing the night before, and having a somewhat disappointing thanksgiving.'

Even THAT was delicious!\n \nI will have to say, however, that their prime rib was delectable!  Roasted to perfection, the right amount of salt and spices (I think it was also brined).  Tender and juicy and seemed to melt in your mouth.  I can't say enough about it.\n\nWell worth the $$ at a Vegas buffet.  \n\nBest advice is to go earlier than you plan because it could have a line."

All for just $20 a person!  We had a small breakfast the day before at the cafe in the Wynn which cost $20 total - it's almost more worth it to just do the buffet and pay an extra $20!"

Crab legs and shrimp were great.  Had some sea bass that was totally over cooked and dry, there was no fresh fruit, only turkey and roast beef available.  Never been to a buffet without prime rib.

S"hands down - BEST buffet in Vegas! :)\n\nThe selection and quality of food really surpasses the other mediocre buffets. The selection is so vast that you can't taste everything there - so choose wisely! The best thing is that you can sample all types of foods from just ONE buffet. I tried so many things that I've been meaning to try from one trip to Wynn! Kobe beef sliders, cerviches, indian curry, smoked trout, korean kimchi, mexican salsa/guac, sushi, greek salads, brie, salami, pancakes, french toast, etc etc.. and thier dessert selection was immense!\n\nThe service is superb. You ask for hot tea, and you get a whole array of tea bags and honey to choose form. Order a coffee, you get a whole pot to yourself. You can have salads tossed for you and ice-cream dishes made for you on demand. \n\nGo for lunch! Prices are decent~ 24 with tax.. and the food you get is very similar to dinner (may be w/o crab legs)"

S'Had dinner here on a Monday night.  It was a half hour wait at 8PM.  Dinner costs $35/person.\n\nAs buffets go, The Buffet at the Wynn is top notch.  The only other buffet that compares is the Bellagio.  I haven\'t been to Studio B at the M Resort but from what I\'ve read 1)  They don\'t offer King Crab Legs (only snow crab)  and 2)  Their seafood buffet is only for the weekends where as the Wynn\'s high class offerings are DAILY.\n\nI started with a plateful of King Crab Legs which are already split in half for you and some P&D shrimp cocktail.  The crab legs were tasty and not salty at all as some have complained.  They have a bunch of different salad offerings plated in individual shot glasses.  I tried the Thai Beef Salad which was excellent.  They have a limited sushi selection which I did not try mainly because I wasn\'t in the mood for sushi.  Their prime rib was delicious and cooked to perfection.  I asked for and received a perfect medium rare slice.  They can cut a slice from any doneness that you prefer.  The Sea Bass was delicious as was the Risotto.  Truthfully almost all the offerings were delicious and there was so many different options that I forgot what I had.  What I do remember is Osso Bucco, Jerk Chicken, Mahi Mahi, Snapper, etc.  They also have a pasta station with made to order pastas, plenty of different pizza offerings, and a varied selection of Ceviches.\n\nThey also had a decent offering of desserts.  Fresh made crepes were available as well ice cream (not self serve soft serve, they actually scoop it for you)  The only problem was I was stuffed by the time it came to dessert and was only able to try a few of their options.  Offerings included Tiramasu, Creme Brulee, fruit tart cups, etc.\n\nOverall it was well worth the price tag.  You can find buffets with more items on their menu at a lower price but only at the Wynn or Bellagio will you find such high end items done right.  You can\'t compare.  As they say, "You get what you pay for!"'

S"This buffet is definitely good but it's not amazing. Maybe I had high expectations since the hotel itself is pretty fabulous. Maybe it was the hype.  Maybe it's because I hear that other buffets are even better. Maybe it's the pricing (but I think it's pretty much the same anywhere)\n\nBut saying all that, this buffet is still pretty good. They have a huge selection of all different types of food which is great. Their dessert section is my favorite, especially the creme brulee, I ate 10 plates (excessive, yes)\n\nI do like the decoration and the fact that most of the tables are spread out from each other. Don't you hate it when you're seated so close to the other table, you're practically on their laps? I do. So I like that this buffet is definitely roomy"

The wait wasn\'t so bad either, we had 10 in our group and got seated within 20 minutes.\n\nWhat I love about my group, we stayed for 3 hours. It wasn\'t because we wanted food all 3 hours, we all lost money. Only way to keep us away from the tables and ATM, was to stuff our face with food.\n\nThe environment, the color and tables were nice. I felt very comfortable .

We waited about an hour which is insane for me considering I didn't want to go to a buffet. Once you are inside the array of food options can be really overwhelming. They do an excellent job controlling the flow of traffic into the buffet which means that there is never a line for the station you want to go to next. \n\nThe food is of excellent quality by any standard, but insanely fresh and delicious considering it's a buffet. You can find food from every cuisine you can think of. I was especially impressed by the dessert selection. The creme brulee was incredible and definitely the perfect way to end the meal. \n\nThe service here, like everywhere else inside the Wynn, is incredible.

Other than slow, they looked miserable - I almost felt bad for them.\n\nFood - When walking into a buffet there should be So many items that stick out that Im overwhelmed and can't decide. This was not the case - I actually had a hard time deciding this time because nothing was appealing.  - the only thing that I was slightly excited about was the fried chicken - which btw was also disappointing. It was greasy and flavorless. The lamb was another item that was bad - it was extremely overcooked - dry and jerkylike. I even had a hard time trying to cut it into pieces. I should not be struggling this much. Crablegs were sad - hardly any meat and icy cold. Desserts - not good. The crepes were so sad. The blueberry parfait had the worst texture.

S'As far as buffets go, the food is quite good. But I don\'t think I\'ll do buffets any more. The wait was ridiculous, almost three hours. I was planning to go for brunch, but it became dinner. About $110 for 2, then add the drinks ($16 per person for beer, wine, champagne, bloody mary), the total is almost $150 (and after tipping the waiter, clearly more than that).\nAs I said, food was decent, but if you go for a "real" restaurant, it will be better.\nThe drinks were disaster: the "champagne" was some sweet sparkling wine, but drinkable; the red wine was "capstone cabernet" which you could drink with food, but don\'t smell it (I couldn\'t finish the glass); the bloody mary was most peppery I\'ve ever had, I had two sips of it (of a 16 oz glass).\nThe desserts were good.'

I wasn't too eager on spending $30 for lunch when I can only shove 2 platefuls of food, but my friend was dying to go here. \n\nWe got there 30 minutes before lunch service, so we ended up paying for the cheaper breakfast fare enjoying both their breakfast and lunch. \n\nSome of the dishes were not palatable and I had to spit it out. I had a cornucopia of everything that looked great; skipping the breads and salad.....I had to make room somehow..... \n\nThe pizza, eggs benedict, enchilada, and spicy tuna roll were pretty good. The cheese blintz and biscuits & gravy were some of the distasteful items I couldn't swallow. \n\nDesserts!!!! There were a vast variety of mini desserts. I really only enjoyed the ice cream the pecan pie. Everything else was mediocre. \n\nThe standards at this buffet is the same as the Bellagio. It would've been nice to try the dinner buffet because of their seafood selections. Unfortunately, buffets are a waste of money for me, so I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to try. \n\nThe decor is beautiful!

I got short ribs and they were really dry...couldn't even cut it with a knife! \nThe best part was probably the dessert, which they're pretty well known for.

S"This review is for the lunchtime buffet.\n\nThe family recently took a trip to Vegas because we were craving good food.  The difficulty was in finding child friendly places, as we have a 1 year old cranky brat of a child.  We figured we'd go to the Wynn buffet for lunch, since buffets are notoriously child friendly.  \n\nFor a Tuesday, the line was longish (we waited for 30 minutes holding the baby the whole time (Wynn doesn't allow strollers to discourage kids, I suppose), and the food wasn't so great.  They didn't have any prime rib or crab legs, and only a little bit of fish.  We got the feeling that they used leftover meat from the buffet last night to create their lunch dishes.  For instance, they had turkey and prime rib sandwiches, as well as spicy tuna hand rolls.  The dessert wasn't so great, either.  There was no creme brulee, for instance.\n\nFor 20 bucks a person, I guess it wasn't bad, but considering the dinner buffet is generally pretty good, I'd expect a LOT more out of the lunch buffet.  Bleh.  I would definitely NOT go back to the lunch buffet, and, based on this recent experience, would maybe think twice about visiting the dinner buffet again."

S"Like Arnold W., I too had high expectations for this place - so many people claim that it is THE BEST buffet in Vegas - that's quite high praise considering I've had amazing experiences at the Mandalay Bay and the Bellagio Buffets.  \n\nSaturday brunch is a wallet-breaking $40, yikes!  And this doesn't even include crab legs.  Sure the food was fresh... lots of shrimp cocktail and prime rib to go around.  The other expensive item that might get you to hit that $40 mark is the kobe beef sliders, but too bad they were dry and virtually tasteless.  \n\nThe dessert station was small, with maybe about 12-15 different mini dessert options.  From what I remember, Bellagio KILLED in the dessert category!  Mandalay Bay's Bayside Buffet even had a larger selection.\n\nI will pass on The Wynn Buffet on ALL counts.  Big disappointment, at least for lunch - maybe the crab legs at dinner make this place more worth it."

S'Steve Wynn set out to have the best buffett in Vegas, and he does. The Wynn buffet definitely takes the cake. The quality of their ingredients and preparation is a step above the rest, and it\'s apparent in everything from the thin-crust brick-oven pizza to the huge, meaty crab legs to the New Zealand rack of lamb. I also appreciated the little "exotic" touches, such as the Asian noodle soup bar, fresh longans (not canned!) and Asian pears in their pear salad. \n\nMinus one star for that crazy long line, though...we waited for 1.5 hrs, and believe it or not, many people waited longer. Someone in line behind us even fainted and one kid got a nosebleed. Damn, people! With the Wynn buffet being a quintessential Vegas attraction in and of itself, Steve Wynn should consider implementing a FastPass type of system!'

S"I had such high expectations for this place. I was greatly disappointed!! I came here for the Saturday brunch. It was $40. I know you'll never eat your money's worth, but the buffet wasn't worth $40!! Also keep in mind, I'm not big on dessert. (So the girls say) Wynn Buffet has the better desserts (compared to Bellagio [I have yet to try Bellagio]). Anyways, the best thing they had was probably the shrimp, they were legit in size and freshness. I also enjoyed the variety they had, the congee brought back a sense of home comfort. The prime rib was cooked perfectly, however I'm not a big fan of prime rib. I'd rather have a steak. The kobe sliders, ummm, not sure exactly if they were really kobe beef, but it was rather dry. All of this definitely wasn't worth $40!!! Maybe I'll come back one day for dinner. I'm not really big on crab legs either, yeah, I'm pretty much a hater!!! =(\n\nSadly, I realized I no longer find joy in buffets! =/"

S'Maybe I was expecting a lot more but this place is overpriced and the food is just blah.\nThe price was 40-48 something.\nFirst off, i was disappointed at the dessert quality. The selection was good but the taste is more suitable for people who like diet dessert or something. I guess it\'s healthy for you but i\'d rather exercise than eating sugar-free, light cream type of dessert. I like my crepe with "heavy" whipped cream but the chef couldn\'t deliver that. Since i ordered extra whipped cream, i had to eat extra "light" whipped cream. How sad. Same with their creme brulee and other mousse cake. I just don\'t think food that are not supposed to be healthy should taste healthy...like...ok the point is unhealthy food is unhealthy food and it should not "pretended" to be healthy. So it was a big disappointment for me cuz i love dessert and cream stuff.It\'s the first thing i eat when i go to a buffet and first impression is important (hence the two stars).\nOnto the real food, i like the lamb and the prime rib was good. Not bad but not memorable. A lot of people line up for the king crab legs cuz it was probably the only thing that was worth eating there. They were nice enough to cut open the crab leg to expose the meat so you don\'t have to do much work to eat it. \nThe sushi bar only have 3 type of sushi: California, shrimp, and some plain roll. They have smoked salmon which was good and some white anchovies that is good also but that was it. \nThere are more dishes like the normal dish you can find at a Chinese and Indian fast food chains. Variety of cheese, some other stuff that i tried and didn\'t like.\nSo i won\'t be returning unless they cook their dessert with better ingredients like real whipped cream and butter. It\'s sin city and i would like to indulge my gluttony sometimes.'

S"When you head to Las Vegas, one thing you hope to enjoy are their legendary buffets. We decided to try the Buffet at the Wynn since it received such high reviews. \n\nThe line getting to the buffet was pretty long - almost like a ride in Disneyland. I thought that if the line was this long, the food must be good. And it was - sort of. The decor was typical high-end Vegas. It was classy but of course over the top glam. We sat in one of the more private rooms for large parties, so we were shielded from the noise of the main dining area and the buffet lines. The service was good and they are quick to replace your plates. \n\nAs for the food. It is divided into several categories: Asian, Italian, American, Seafood, etc. Each one had their highs and their lows. To me, the best was the Italian and Seafood section. Although the pizza was not the best, the gnocchi was amazing! I had to go back at least twice. The seafood was delicious, though limited to salmon, red snapper, and mahi mahi. The Asian section is mainly dominated by sushi and a small selection of dim sum. The American section is more of breakfast food, ribs, turkey, roast beef, etc. The desserts were plentiful and hard to choose from.\n\nIt was a good experience, but I was a bit disappointed. Maybe I expect a lot of buffets that cost $25 a person plus anything located in the Wynn. The wait was about 20 minutes, so I was pretty hungry. Good advice: pace yourself, don't fill up your plates immediately, and don't be afraid to try different things (but revisit your favorites)."

We waited for an hour even though we got there at 11am. \n\nAnyways, as for the food, it was disappointing. The only highlights were the baked fish-salmon, sea bass, etc., the fruit salad, the pasta, the pumpkin pie, and the ice cream. The sushi was horrible so were the other Asian style items like potstickers, etc. The salad bar had strange choices, there was not even a respectable Caesar salad or a garden salad to be found. The American and Italian food was average, I mean, how hard is it to make pasta?\n\nThe dessert bar looked delicious, but looks are deceiving. The mint chocolate cake tasted like toothpaste. The lemon bars or anything that had a lemon flavor had a egg taste to it. The chocolate cupcakes were super chocolate-y to the point it was like eating fudge. The cheesecake was bland. The spiced muffin was hard as a rock and it didn't have any flavor.

The buffet looked great and overall is a good deal for $24. \n\n*MAJOR TIP: Lunch ends at 3:30 but they start the dinner at 3:30.\n                        You can pay for lunch and sample some of the dinner \n                        as well.\n*TIP:               More seafood was available at dinner time but at the                  same time more vegetarian stuff was available at dinner too.\n\n* TIP: No alcohol provided for free. Only soft drinks but for additional $7 you can get unlimited bloody mary and champegenge and wine. I wish I had done that.\n\nFor vegetarians like me the Wynn buffet is A.Ok. Even if the quantity was less I wish the quality would have made up for it but not really. I would try another buffet next time and not go back here. But, the desserts were good and a great selection was available. There are A LOT of meat done in different ways for all you carnivores and the decor was done very well.'

S'Way over-rated! I paid $40 expecting the best buffet ever due to all these rave reviews from Yelp, however, once I was able to look at what they were serving, I was in disbelief! It was as common as the other buffets in Vegas. Nothing spectacular nor is there anything the stood out or super tasty.  I was done after a plate. It was just OK but way too expensive for what they were serving. Wicked Spoon is the best and Bellagio comes in second.'

S"High class buffet in Vegas. You should dress accordingly (Gentlemen: no sleeveless, Ladies: opaque coverups). It's worthwhile and #2 on the top 5 buffets in Vegas (from what I read)! Not the typical buffets you eat anywhere and probably the only buffet I like to eat at. \n\nThere are a few things that are delicious and not so delicious, the dessert bar never fails me! Few notable items to eat at this buffet are the Alaskan crab legs (when it's available), Prime Rib, Venison, and Red Snapper w/ Sweet Chile Cream Sauce. The sushis are okay but you should avoid them because you can eat better sushi elsewhere (Like at Makino). Most of the desserts are delicious! I mostly enjoy eating the vanilla bean gelato, chocolate/peanut butter rectangle, and chocolate chip cookies. Mmm there's always room for dessert!\n\nOn the downside, it's quite a pricey place to eat at ($45 per person), the line could be long (about 20-45 minute wait, VIP line takes you straight to a table for $20 extra or something from what I remember), and the people don't refill your drinks very often. \n\nIf you really want to have a good time at this buffet, take every item from the dessert bar and just try them all out (take a bite out of each)! If you don't like some of the dessert they offer, o well! Just get more of the desserts you like. #TreatYoSelf! You're paying $45 to get in so enjoy! :)"

S"I learned 2 things from the last time I came here.  \nLesson #1: Don't come here if you're starving.  Come here if you're hungry.  I ate to the point where I started to feel really sick.\nLesson #2: No buffets within 3-4 hours of drinking/clubbing.  No one wants to feel like a whale in their skimpy Vegas outfit.\n\nAs for the buffet, the food was ok.  It was a solid buffet, but only a few things stood out to me (even when I was starving!)  They have your usual fish, meats, and seafood but I actually really enjoyed the simple things like the baby back ribs and the broccoli cheese soup.  The sushi was bleh, no thanks.  I loved the herb salmon and the desserts!  The coffee ice cream was one of the best I've ever tried.  Here's an idea.  Grab 2 cookies and make an ice cream sandwich with the ice cream, sooooo good!\n\nSo like I said, solid buffet, nothing too outstanding but nothing horribly gross."

Not only is it beautiful to look at , I am always a sucker for great decor, the food , layout and service complimented the whole deal. \nOur meal included Great Prime Rib,  A larger pastry assortment with well thought out treats, such as small espresso cups of Pot au Chocolate, my fav,  Bread pudding, profiteroles , cakes, puddings and  pretty candied apples.  The areas of the buffet had well seasoned fishes, shrimp cocktail , fruit that was fresh and ripe, lots of sides that looked good but I wanted meat, sweets and such.\nThe waiter was spot on , constantly clearing , refilling  and courteous. \nI was amazed that the line looked huge going in but wasn't very long of a wait. \nI highly recommend The Buffet at Wynn."

S'To cap off two weeks of visiting friends and family, we did breakfast with business colleagues staying at Wynn who were told the Wynn breakfast buffet is amazing.  We have to agree -- excellent. I restrained myself since I had a lunch scheduled for a few hours later. Had an egg white omelet that was fabulous as well as some grilled pineapple and some berries plus a few candied pecans   My husband enjoyed the smoked fish (lox/trout/herring) and sausage, including apple chicken sausage. He had vanilla bean ice cream with toasted coconut for dessert. Huge variety for about $20/person during the week. I also noticed delicious items like crab frittata and salmon eggs benny.'

S'I have to give an average review of this place because overall this buffet is not a good experience.\n\nThe main drawback of this buffet is definitely the wait on the weekends.  I went here last Sunday for lunch with my girlfriend and we waited for probably 1.5 hours.  Another demoralizing thing about the wait is that the Wynn tries to get you to pay an extra $12 more for the "VIP" line to skip the regular line.  While I understand the need to generate extra revenue, this has the effect of demoralizing the customers in the normal line.  I won\'t come back just because of this.  I hope whatever finance or operations guy they have there has done the calculations on excel to justify this attempt at padding their revenues. \n\nThe second big drawback of this buffet is the price.  Sunday lunch was over $30 which is way too expensive for the variety of food they had that day.  While I still think the food is high quality, they didn\'t have enough expensive items to justify that type of pricing.\n\nOverall, the price and the long wait deter me from wanting to eat here again.  This is one of those places that if you are in Vegas for the first time, you might want to try it.  Other than that, don\'t waste your time or money.'

S"*This is on my MUST-TRY list for Vegas*\n\nHands down the best buffet I've ever had in Vegas.\n\nIf you like king crab legs, then you're definitely in the right place.  I think they're the only buffet in Vegas (correct me if I'm wrong) that does not salt their crab legs.  Most places salt them to preserve them, which tells me that The Buffet's seafood is relatively fresh.  It's always really sweet and juicy.. yum! \n\nI'm sure they have whatever you like, and it's always cooked to perfection.  My personal favorites?  Crab legs.. duh..and the braised veal :)  YUMMY!!\n\nAnother thing I look forward to when I come to The Buffet..... DESSERTS!!!!  CREME BRULEEEEEEEEEE!  The tiramisu is also amazing.. and they have gelato too!  There's always a huge assortment.. it's always so hard to choose without feeling extremely guilty.\n\nA couple of downers:\n-On special holiday weekends, they totally jack up the prices.  The prices vary from day to day, but expect to pay around $30-40.    \n-There's almost always a line... and it's a long line too :(\n\nBut, the pros overshadow the cons.. so I still love it!\n\nTip: Get inside by 2:30 or 3pm.  You're paying for brunch/lunch, but just sit around for a bit until 3:30pm and you get dinner too!   \n\nHappy eating!"

S"I normally don't go to buffets because if it's a comparison of quality vs. quantity, quality always wins.  HOWever, The Buffet at the Wynn has probably become my favorite buffet ever (unfortunately...or not...I've only been to a very few buffets in Las Vegas and I hear most of them are pretty good).  All the food you can eat and it's all soooo good.\n\nI recommend going during lunch time because it will be less crowded and costs much less than dinner.  If you can go on less busy days of the week (such as most weekdays), it might cost a little less.\n\nWe went in for lunch on a Saturday around 1pm and had no problem getting in.  The line took about 5 minutes and we had prime seating next to the main walkway on the balcony area. I couldn't believe how long the buffet strip went...and by the time I found the end, I discovered there was a whole different area for desserts.  They had fruits, salads, soups, meats/cheese, fancy breakfast items, Creole, Asian, Seafood, Sushi, Ribs, Crepes, Omelets, and a bit more that I can't even remember because there was so much food.  All of it was delicious.\n\nA friend also got bottomless Bloody Mary's for $7.50 (using well vodka of course).  I highly recommend this place to everyone who goes to Las Vegas.  I'll be back for sure."

S"AH-MAY-ZING!!!!!\n\nThe buffet at the Wynn is such a treasure that I am so glad my friends took me here for our dinner last night in Vegas.  It is what everyone has been saying about this place... absolutely delicious!\n\nFor dinner on a weekday it was $38, no alcohol included.  The management at the Wynn was very sweet and was willing to accommodate us.  They helped us grab two tables, which while were apart due to it being a busy evening, was nice of them to give us that option (otherwise we would have waited longer for a larger table).  We had a couple of friends who had had a little too much to drink, but our servers were so kind in letting them lie down for a bit and asked us if they needed anything to comfort them.\n\nNow, of course when you're reviewing a buffet, it's all about the food, and the Wynn certainly delivered!!  This has got to be on my list of the top 3 buffets I've experienced in my life, and here are some hi-lights:\n\n1. Prime Rib - EXCELLENT.  JUICY and savory!!  Cut was excellent as well.  I went back for seconds, and I'm the type of guy that likes my meat medium-rare.  For my second cut, the meat was so red... yet it was NOT bleeding... was EPIC.  It is hard to cook it that well and have it lean towards rare, but not bleed.  Man... PROPS!\n\n2. Alaskan King Crab Legs - FIVE PLATES OF THESE ALONE!  I could not believe how delicious they were.  There was so much meat, easy to crack open... I was in awe over this.\n\n3. Chinese/Japanese food - There is few sashimi options, but enough Chinese and Japanese entrees to keep you satisfied.  I loved the sushi rolls and the friendly Cantonese speaking Chinese workers.\n\n4. Desserts - gelato was my best friend of the night.  Delicious desserts that really sealed the deal.\n\nThe Wynn Buffet was an amazing experience, and I am hella excited to try it again... maybe with champagne this time. ;)"

Plus the areas was decorated very nicely so it wasn't a bore to look at. \n\nThe food here is basically a high quality version of other vegas buffets. The food was good. Service was good. I came during brunch, so they had a lot of breakfast food. The salad bar was big, lots of varieties. Dessert was great. They had my favorite dessert cake (tres leches) in shot glass size cup, which i liked because that prevented me from getting too much. \n\nOverall, this place was great.

The pot sticker is just frozen food that you can get in walmart. They don't have much seafood, only shrimp, crab leg and oyster(and the oyster was not really fresh), and the dessert was just ok for me, the cramel pudding was not cooked well, too mushy and they don't have much flavor for ice cream. Other food like steak and lamb was good, but overall it's just lack of choices and the food is just not very satisfying! Most importantly we waited in line for 3 hours, it's just not worth it. I've been to Le Village buffet in Paris Hotel and it's much better they have basically the same food and less time to wait, besides it's cheaper."

S"Everything's bigger in Vegas. But not necessarily better. \n\nWhile I loved the quantity of selection (redundant?) at the Wynn buffet (5 kinds of ceviche? Hell, yeah!) the quality was another thing. \n\nAforementioned ceviche was great flavor-wise but did not have much actual seafood (I know, I know, they have to have filler but only getting two tiny pieces of tuna in 2 scoops of ceviche is just not right). The salmon and sea bass were quite dry and that strange artichoke dish was just bizarre. All of the pasta dishes were bland.\n\nThe good: chicken noodle soup made with real chicken stock, tender sliced beef with to-die for jus, amazing mashed potatoes (maybe I'm just easily impressed by butter), green beans, guacamole and the white chocolate crunchy cake. We got one of every dessert and that was by far the best. Runner up would be the orange tapioca. Sad, sad selection of puny slices of only 3 kinds of fruit, though. \n\nIf you want to give the buffet a try (and you do because everyone says you should), I'd definitely advise going for lunch. Comparable experience to dinner but less pricey so you don't feel completely ripped off."

Sure it cost us around $36 bucks for dinner but hey, I figured why not see what a $36 buffet taste like.  It i wasn't satisfied, I can say at least I had a 36$ buffet.\n\nWhat an assortment of food!!! Too bad i'm not a big foodie and coming here definitely opened my eyes on all kinds of different foods.  I'm pretty embarassed I didn't know/or hear of any of these different dishes.  They had crab legs, prime rib and all kinds of other good stuff.  You can definitely tell the difference between this type of buffet and other buffets i've had in Vegas (Boardwalk... YAYYYY!!).  You can taste the freshness versus the other guys.\n\nDesserts were ok but I guess being stuffed always sours me on getting desert.  I had a pretty solid sugar cookie and some fruit but avoided the ice cream that my friend was raving about. Oh well.\n\nOverall, a pretty damn good buffet if you enjoy food.

S'Only after getting a "friend invite" from a fellow yelper, and then checking out his take on the Wynn Hotel Buffet, did I remember that I did that buffet just a few weeks back. I had one of our customer service reps come from PA to help me do a show at the convention center. Our Wednesday night dinner needed to be logistically simple. I didn\'t want to have to do reservations and then wait an inordinant amount of time to be seated. We took one of our clients with us, and we three "did the Wynn buffet!"\n\nIn short, the layout is similar to the Hilton Hotel buffet, and frankly, I remember the Hilton spread to have been more enjoyable. I was, sadly, underwhelmed. This is not a "kick-ass" great buffet, as some of us remember from the late 60\'s and early to mid 70\'s; Caesar\'s Palace Showroom Buffet, or even the pretty decent Golden Nugget Buffet that Steve Wynn revived when he made his mark in Vegas...before he started with his strip properties. Those days, and those buffets, in my opinion, are long gone.\n\nFor me, the better food in Vegas is no longer at a buffet, but at some of the hotel restaurants, and certainly some off-strip restaurants. I\'d rather revisit Vic and Anthony\'s at the Golden Nugget, pay my "half a hundred", and get a great steak, than serve myself with OK, but certainly not great buffet meats and carbs. Best thing at the buffet? The desserts. \n\nI\'m always reassured when I see other yelper\'s reviews agree with mine. In this case, it\'s not because I\'m insecure about my judgement, and need reinforcements........ it\'s because I want to make sure I just didn\'t hit them on a bad night.'

S"We tried this buffet because 1. we were staying at the Encore, and 2. we heard it was the best for vegan and gluten free options, and were so impressed that we actually ate here twice, once for breakfast (which crossed into lunch just as we were finishing) and once for dinner.\n\nFor breakfast, I was very impressed with the omelette station, the variety of smoked fish, and the great selection of fresh and dried fruits, yogurts and granola. My omelette was packed full of my requested toppings and perfectly cooked - and I was unsure how high my expectations should be given the line of people the cook had waiting for him. Even for vegans and celiacs, there were tons of options - ie., I'm not even mentioning the large portions of the buffet that I didn't touch, for example sausages, pancakes, waffles, bacon, toast, cereal, etc. \n\nThere were also Mexican and Chinese food options available for breakfast; I tried the corn frittata and the hot bean mixture from the former and the pineapple fried rice from the latter, all of which were very tasty.\n\nFor dinner, there is an even larger selection of cuisine types available. My personal favourite was the antipasto station with an awesome array of meats, cheeses, olives, dried fruits and nuts, and spreads such as hummus, baba ghanouj, and olive and artichoke tapanades. I also absolutely loved the sweet pea risotto (and I don't usually like peas!) and the Thai basil rice noodle stir fry. Not to mention the hot and cold seafood options - I only tried the smoked salmon and a small bite of a couple of the hot fish dishes because I was enjoying everything else so much, but the crab legs looked impressive.  Again, there is a ton that I am not even mentioning, for example the sushi, the pasta bar and pizza in the Italian section, the Chinese section, and the American section with fresh carved turkey and roast beef for the meat and potatoes crowd. Point being, once again, options galore. \n\nAlthough a celiac and not a big dessert person, I would be remiss to mention the buffet without raving about the dessert station. Even though I couldn't eat them, you couldn't help but be charmed and impressed by the little cups full of cute little dessert creations, as well as the cupcakes and other assorted goodies. As for what I could have, the gelato station made me feel like a kid ordering an old fashioned ice cream sundae, and there were a few other excellent gluten free options, including but not limited to fresh fruit.\n\nThe atmosphere was lovely, the seating space was very large so we didn't have to wait too long, and the service was great, especially for a buffet. Yes, it is on the pricey side, but absolutely worth it for the variety and quality of the food. Also, my absolute favourite part? For dinner, for an extra $10, you can get all-you-can-drink mimosas, champagne and Bloody Marys. Every time we went to grab some more food, the drink that we ordered was waiting for us when we got back to our table. Perfect!"

S"This buffet ranks as one of the best in Las Vegas, although it is a bit pricey (be prepared to pay $40 per person for dinner).  The variety of food items is incredible and ranks as one of the best buffets I've eaten at (the buffet at this one hotel in Taiwan is tough to top).  They have Italian, Thai, American, Chinese, Indian, seafood, salads, soups.  Their dessert selections are pretty impressive too.  Most of the items there could be served as an entree item at an above average restaurant.  \n\nI've been to The Wynn Buffett twice and each time, I've enjoyed it.  Hands down better than the buffet at The Bellagio (food is a bit cold, restaurant feels a bit dirty and cold)."

S"Best Buffet in Vegas, bar none!  Over the years, I've tried 'em all, from the Rio (meh) to the MGM (ok) to the Bellagio (pricey but lots of seafood items).  I've also tried the Mirage's buffet (delicious, a close runner up) and the buffet at Paris (very good, but food preparation could be better).  But the buffet at the Wynn sets the standard.  \n\nFirst, it's a bit pricey (I paid $42 for dinner on Saturday).  Lunch on weekdays is around $24, more like it.  The buffet is enormous.  Probably something like the size of a football field.  There are so many different types of food, you really don't know where to start.  Oh, and the food has been well prepared, but trained chefs who know how to create delicious meals.  I think the desserts are on par with some of the finest restaurants in town.  Truly, I think this buffet is about the best value in town, and everyone in your party will leave with a smile on their face and a very full belly!  Something for everyone to eat here, even for the finikiest of eaters!"

S"We're coming off of an Encore stay that included three buffets (two dinner, one breakfast), so while you'd think I have a lot to say, it all boils down to two words: CRAB LEGS. Those heavenly, succulent, pre-split bundles of goodness. \n\nI would eat them in a house.\nI will eat them with a mouse.\nI will eat them here and there.\nI will eat them ANYWHERE.\n\nWithout them... hm. The tuna poke was not bad, the fried turkey was delicious, and otherwise a lot of inconsistent dishes, some better one day, others the other day. The veggies were all way too oily (the chili lime corn was good), and the kimchi was sad but a necessary complement to the crab. \n\nDesserts were excellent, though again, the warm brownie was insane one night, hard the next. My breakfast review hasn't changed from below. \n\nI've read many divergent reviews about the quality and availability of crab legs at other buffets, so let me say for the Wynn, at least, there was plenty to go around, they were great, and I can't imagine paying $40 for this buffet without the tender flesh of my little crustacean friends."

S'The Wynn buffet is my favorite buffet in Vegas (I\'ve also been to the Monte Carlos, Bellagio, Aria, and Venetian).  They have a really great selection of food and the quality is much better than the other buffets.  Most of the other buffets have "buffet" quality food made for mass production, whereas I think the food at the Wynn is good enough to be served as individual entrees.  \n\nMost buffets in Vegas also feel overcrowded and the interior of the restaurant isn\'t very nice, but the Wynn buffet is really pretty inside.\n\nThe prices are a little higher than most but definitely worth the money.  I usually go for brunch and I would recommend going on the earlier side to get the breakfast price which is cheaper than the lunch price.  Otherwise I would go on the later side for lunch because they only bring out the crab legs at 3pm.  Sadly I was there from 1-3pm, too late for breakfast prices but too full to eat the crab when it finally came out.\n\nFood highlights:\nPrime Rib\nJumbo Shrimp\nDesserts\nCrab Legs'

I think I would have been ok paying for it too. It's beautiful inside, absolutely gorgeous. Depending on where you're seated it can be quite a walk to the food but I guess it's good, you gotta burn off some calories and make room for more of the tasty dishes. The chicken that was prepared in a pancake/syrup type batter, OMG!! The pesto pasta with fresh pinenuts was also amazing, so much to chose from. The desserts were plenty and set up nicely, nothing in the dessert area really knocked my socks off but I was super full by that point. I was definitely return."

S'I\'m really not a buffet person, but I always try to hit up at least one while I\'m in Vegas. Tradition, I guess. \n\nSo, this one was on my list. When we signed up for the Red (Players) card, we were told that we only needed 55 points to earn a free buffet! Alright! Sooooo, $100 dollars later (each!) we had earned our "free" buffet. \n\nSince we don\'t eat until later anyway, and it was a Wednesday, the line wasn\'t really long. Our server was absolutely incredible. Our drinks were always filled and our used plates were constantly pre-bussed. Yay for good service!\n\nOn to the food! \n\nI thought the salad station was okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Honestly, I prefer the Cravings Buffet\'s salad station at the Mirage where they custom mix your salad into this gorgeous chopped salad. \n\nAnyway, I thought that they had a lot of high-end food. If I eat at a buffet, I stay away from a lot of the filler foods (bread, pasta, pizza) so that I have room for the real food (prime rib, crab legs, shrimp, etc). Let me tell you, if you only get one thing, the king crab legs are SO worth the buffet price. They are even split for you! I just wish that they were hot. The prime rib was good, not great. My bf said that all of the fish he got was cold. I do wish that I had saved room for some of their chicken panang! \n\nThe dessert station was incredible and large. The crepe and waffle stations were a nice touch, as was the selection of gelato. Creme brulee was meh.'

Now don't get me wrong as far as buffets go this is/was better than most buffets I've been to, but for 40 bucks a pop, I've had better. the seafood wasn't as fresh as i thought it would be and I was excited about the ceviche until I tasted its bland almost inedible grossness.

S"Saw a lot of good reviews for this place so since we were there we decided to make it a must to try out.  The line was very deceiving, they will have you line up outside the buffet and once you make it inside there's another long wrap around line just like the amusement parks.  The wait wasn't too bad when we arrived around 10 in the morning.  We made it in within 15~20 minutes I believe. They have an alcohol package for an additional 15$ and you can choose whatever drink from their menu you want with as many refills as you please.  Very decorative inside with a very flowery garden theme.  The food choice was amazing!  Let alone was there a lot to choose from but the quality of the food was superb as well.  The most random thing we noticed about the buffet was that it served congee which was very rare.  We enjoyed their congee along with their selection of ice creams.  I wish I could've ate more but I felt I got my moneys worth, a quick tip about the dessert section.  Stay away from the baked goods since they've been sitting out for a while.  I got a muffin and stabbing it with a fork did not pierce it, it actually cracked like a cracker.  Overall have a good eating if you're able to make it to this buffet!"

S'"Classy" and "buffet" usually don\'t go together, but the Wynn nails it: their buffet is the best dinner buffet on the Strip I\'ve had thus far. It ought to be, for the price ($40).\n\nStations represent different "ethnic" foods, your typical Indian, typical Chinese, some Thai. The salad bar was fresh and inventive. The lamb was amazingly moist, the highlight of the meat offerings. The charcuterie was an unexpected treat, little pickles and all, and the dessert area impressed me, even without a sweet tooth. Of course, king crab legs never disappoint.\n\nFriends and I decided to celebrate a birthday here, so after we let our server know, we were provided a dessert assortment, complete with candle, while waiters sang "Happy Birthday". Thoughtful!\n\nThe buffet has a ton of seating, and you don\'t feel like you\'re on a farm thanks to strategically-placed partitions which provide a sense of privacy. The ambiance is money - one should expect nothing less from the Wynn.'

S'Clean, and not extremely crowded.\n\nI\'ve been to various buffets in Vegas, but what struck me the most about the Buffet at the Wynn was the fact that it was clean and neat. Then again, it was a Thursday night.\n\nI was there during the Wynn\'s 5th anniversary, and so with 55 points on your Red card, you could get a free meal at the buffet. Sign me up! After some heavy playing on the slots, I got my 55 points and my "free" buffet.\n\nIt was my first time at the Wynn, so I spent some time wandering and looking at all the choices while everybody else made a beeline to the stations that they liked the most.  There is a seafood station on one side, with cocktail shrimp and crab legs. Most people were loading up on them. The seafood was good, and the cocktail sauce was a lot spicier than I\'m used to. It definitely had a kick to it.  As you walk along the rest of the buffet, they had some international food stations, featuring Chinese (with lo mein, and dumplings), Indian (curry, lamb, etc), Italian (pasta station, osso bucco), the requisite carving station, and then some hot seafood items (various fish in different sauces). The other end of the buffet had a charcuterie, salad bar, and soup.  Towards the center of the buffet area was the dessert station, which was probably my favorite due to the all the pretty desserts in the little plastic containers, and the crepe and waffle station.\n\nOverall, I thought the food was better than I had expected. Because it was a buffet, I didn\'t expect the food to be amazing (even though it was the Wynn), so I was definitely surprised by the fresh quality of the food. Nothing really tasted as if it had been sitting out under the heating lamps for hours on end. I was disappointed by the sushi selection, however, and consisted of two different rolls.  Overall, the food selection wasn\'t as varied as what you would find at some of the other buffets.  However, I think that\'s a good thing because one problem I have with buffets is that I always feel like I didn\'t get to try everything I wanted because there was just too much to choose from (I\'m quite indecisive at times). Therefore, having a varied, but slightly more limited selection, allowed me to enjoy my meal fully without wondering if I "missed something at that really far away station I couldn\'t get to".  I also liked the crepe station because it\'s made right in front of you. However, when they make the (customized) crepe for you, they add a lot of filling to the crepe, so it loses its crispy texture.  Still good, however, but slightly overwhelming in size.  \n\nThe service here is superb as well.  Our server quickly removed our empty plates and dishes, and refilled our beverages promptly.  The atmosphere is nice as well; it wasn\'t really loud or noisy so we were able to enjoy our meal, as well as have a good conversation while we were enjoying our after-dinner coffee as well.  \n\nThis is now one of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas, and can\'t wait to return. While I will, because I ended up getting another free buffet meal courtesy of my Red Card.'

S'PLAY THE WEDDING BELLS BECAUSE I MAY JUST BE MARRIED TO THIS PLACE!  The Wynn hotel is already an amazing place, and they knocked my socks off with the ambiance and quality of food.\n\nJust to let everyone know, my family and I ended up paying around $50 /person only because it was a "special holiday price" -- it certainly can put a dent in your wallet, but that made all of us really want to make our money\'s worth.  \n\nThe size of the buffet is huge as it spans the entire restaurant.  It\'s so organized too as they break up the different sections from American, Salads, Asian, Cold food , seafood, desserts, etc.  You will certainly find something for you and new here.  There are just too many options for me to list my fav items here, so i guess I\'ll have to make you go there!!\n\nAnother thing that sealed the deal was the dessert section.  Anyone that knows me, knows that desserts/pastries are my weak point.  They had crepes and gelato too!  Yes, crepes and gelato!!!!  I was already so full from the main buffet that I knew I had to save room for dessert!  Quick tip: Take your time when you eat.  Feel free to walk around and just digest before going for your next round.\n\ni\'m glad to say the Wynn Hotel Buffet has certainly retained me as a future customer.  My only criticism the $50 price tag.'

S'I really like this buffet and went there during breakfast/lunch, so we ended up paying the breakfast prices for lunch.  Anyways they had a huge selection for food I thought.  The breakfast food was okay. They have an omelette station, but took forever though a huge line like 30 minutes to get it, but they have only one chef, but that chef does four omelettes at a time.   It was okay though I think I am spoiled by the omelettes at where I stay at.  \n\nOkay hmm what i else, I was a little disapointed by lunch.  My prime rib and meat were dry.  I give it three stars on that.  Hmm I like the salad selection as well.  Hmm they did have some bbq which was okay and some interesting thai soup which was spicy and decent.\n\nso why the four stars, the desserts made up in everything. I definitely pigged out on that one.  I like the caramel, cream puffs, ice cream and yum yum yum yum that is all I got to say. I like the mint cakes as well.'

If you are hungry expect to wait for your food.\nThe ambiance (tables and chairs) is more Soup Plantation then first class Vegas hotel. The food was abundant but mediocre. If you think you are going to eat all the great sushi you want for a flat fee forget it. There were only a few rolls  (no fish) and they were of supermarket quality. Bottom line: If you just want a trough to endlessly feed from then it's okay. If you prefer good food and a pleasant dining experience the city has so many other better choices for a better value."

The prime rib was actually pretty good minus the crazy amount of salt on the sides, the green beans were pretty good but I just kept going back to the crab legs. Had to get my moneys worth from that thing. The seabass was pretty good and I forgot the other fish, but that was pretty good too. \nGrab some ice cream on the way out, some deserts were just bad, some were pretty decent.\nI didn't get to try everything because a lot of it didn't look appealing, but overall it was pretty decent, although the service seemed slow with the drinks, why these buffets don't just add a fountain drink machine is weird."

We went on a Tuesday night, after a long day of hiking at Zion National Park, so we were starving. To be honest, I didn't feel like the buffet was that big. I went back 2 times for a heaping of crab legs & shrimp cocktail, which are the only foods I really enjoyed there. They have some dim sum like dumplings and such at the Chinese food station, which was awful. Most of their cooked fishes were overcooked and not impressive. Their cheese ravioli in their pasta section was good, as was their miso soup.\n\nThey have a huge dessert section, but to be honest, none of the desserts really impressed me. One of my dining companions loved their coffee ice cream, as he is a big fan of coffee and it tastes very very strongly of coffee.\n\nI would not go to their dinner buffet again. Also, it is very pricy, comes to about $37 with tax per person. A friend of mine said their breakfast buffet was great though, and only $25, so would be willing to try that sometime."

S'While the hotel and the main atrium of this buffet are gorgeous, the larger seating areas to either side are nothing special.  So be sure to request the atrium. The collonade of plants and veggies are stunning.  \n\nThe food is also very very good.  Not the best brunch buffet I\'ve ever had but very good.  One of the pricier buffets on the Strip but that was expected from the Wynn.\n\nWhat loses a star is the bad service.  Now when we were first seated in the main restaurant, right off the hallway, I knew enough to say "no , this will not do".  We had waited in line for 45 minutes and I wasn\'t going to sit in a standard hotel restaurant while pple walked down the hallway staring at me.  Our waitress promptly moved us to the atrium area to a lovely four top.  She was then publicly scolded by the looming restaurant manager for taking our drink order.  We tried giving her a tip but she was obviously frantic at that point and handed it to the other waiter.  Ridiculous.  She was the best server we had.\n\nWhat I soon realized, the main problem with this place is is that they simply did not have enough pple clearing tables.  While the line snaked around in the waiting area, abandoned tables sat with dishes piled high up to ten minutes after the diners had left.  I couldn\'t believe how poorly managed that aspect of this restaurant was.\n\nNow if you can over look all that, the food is really quite good.  And it has a large selection.

S'Ew ew ew. This buffet was WAY over priced! I feel bad for making my boyfriend take me here and spending all that money because I didn\'t end up enjoying it. $40 dollars per person for dinner yet the food was mediocre? I remember going to the Bellagio buffet a couple of years ago and it was way better and cheaper, $28 per person only on a weekday.\n\nAlthough the selection was not bad, every dish I\'ve tried (and I tried a little bit of almost everything) was either undercooked, overcooked, or bland. I was looking forward to the Chillean sea bass but the quality of the fish was clearly no good. The fish tasted EXTRA fishy, kind of dried out rubbery at places, and it had the texture of cheap tilapia. It was definitely not the melt-in your mouth texture I was hoping for like so many other reviewers have mentioned. I love sushi but I did not even bother with the sushi rolls because it looked dinky and "poked" at. I remember the sushi at the Bellagio was actually pretty good.  Whenever I visit any buffet, I have to stuff my face with crab just to make my meal worth it. The crab legs at the Wynn were disappointing, too. There was a long line to get them so I thought they would be awesome but to my dismay, they were cold and sitting on a bed of ice! I quickly found out that you can go to the grille section and get them warmed but come on, cold crab legs and the only option is to warm them on the grill? At the Bellagio, they do the same, cold crab legs split in half, but least you can ask the chef to heat it up with some butter sauce.\n\nThe rest of the foods were not memorable at all. The dessert section had a huge selection including gelato and a crepe station but nothing tasted out of the ordinary. They were mostly pastries and petite cakes that looked amazing but when I tried them, they tasted like pure fondant! Who the heck wants to eat desserts that taste like pure confectioner\'s sugar? There was no fluffy pastry/cake texture and even the chocolate desserts did not taste very chocolatey.  I\'ve had better more creative gelatos and the crepe station was not a hoot either. The toppings were mostly frozen and preserved fruits and there was no utella. How do you have crepes without nutella??\n\nOverall the ingredients put into the food seem fancy smancy (exotic herbs, spices, and what not) and they have fancy smancy names, but the quality, presentation, and  culinary skill was just not there. What a disappointment. I will be going back to the Bellagio next year.'

Both hotels are near the top of the Vegas hotel and food experience, they're near comparable in terms of pricing, and they both bear the heavy hand of Wynn himself. \n\nI'll come right out and say it: I think the Wynn's buffet is just a bit better than the Bellagio's. Don't kick yourself if you go to one over the other though -- the difference is noticeable, but not vast, and both of them offer a fun and tasty experience. Overall, I found the Wynn had higher quality food -- fresher, slightly better prepared, and even winning a bit on presentation. The Bellagio did have a wider variety of food, but at times it felt a little mass produced, and some things weren't just served the way they should be (shrimp cocktail a bit too cold, eggs a bit too tepid, that kind of thing). Other things were exactly similar -- they both served the same Freixenet champagne, they both featured gloriously patches of natural light interspersed with more conventional booths and tables, and they both seemed to have comparable attention to service. \n\nHere's what I liked about the Wynn:\n\n* The desserts [which were clearly superior to the Bellagio's] were awesome. Superb ice cream, yummy apple pie bits, tasty cookies, and wild candied apples -- this is to say nothing of the buttery croissants near the dessert. :)\n\n* The drinks -- the same all you can drink champagne on Sunday mornings that you can get at most places, and then 'bottomless' version of the same for a modest fee in the evenings [$7 for all-you-can-drink Kettel One Bloody Mary's here). Service on these was great -- I never found myself wanting for alcohol. :)\n\n* The bacon was just the right amount of crispy. It's a hard thing to cook bacon for a mass of people without making the bacon either too soggy or too burnt, but they nailed it.\n\n* Solid breakfast: Good french toast, good eggs benedict, tasty waffles. They just got it all right, and generally you miss on at least one dish at breakfast.\n\n* THE KING CRAB. I saved the best for last. Because, honestly, Jesus Christ, the crab was the best crab I'd ever put in my mouth at a buffet. Pre-cracked (brilliant), served with surely-bad-for-you-but-oh-so-good butter, and I went through three plates of it at dinner. \n\nOk, now I've poured out my heart about the crab, here's what I didn't like about the buffet:\n\n* The Line\n\nI know that when you give Americans (or people visiting in America and wanting to cosplay our life of reckless excess) an all-you-can-eat pass, they show up in droves. But I have to think, in my heart of hearts, that you can do better than making me stand in line for 45 minutes on a Sunday night to get in to eat. It's also galling to me when I'm staying in the prole-ish rooms at the Wynn that I get to see the beautiful people from the tower suites waltzing ahead of me over in the VIP line.  Crab envy gave me class envy.\n\n* The crab only comes out at 3:30 pm. \n\nThe crab would make a perfect breakfast or lunch food, but it's only brought out for dinner.  There are all sorts of plans where you buy lunch at 3:15, then wait for the crab to show up, but honestly I would rather be able to pay a little extra in the morning to get access to that sweet, sweet crab.\n\n* A little over the top in the exotic department.\n\nEven in the dessert section, which I regarded as stand-out, this showed up. While the stuff there was amazing, I ended up missing some of the more basic desserts that I come to expect -- cheesecake, chocolate, German chocolate, coconut cake, or even some eclairs (which my gf couldn't find).\n\n*\n\nI would happily go again -- and if they fixed any one of my complaints, I'd give it 5 stars in a heartbeat."

The food was ok but nothing to rant nor rave about. In fact I remained at the salad bar the entire meal after trying a little from each section. However there is a silver lining: I fell in love with their bottomless mimosas option! Who wouldn't love $15 bottomless mimosas on a random tuesday wednesday??\n\nOther than that, I wouldn't return here over going to the Bellagio buffet or Bacchanal, sorry!"

S"After reading all the glowing reviews that said the Wynn has the best brunch in Vegas, we stopped in this past Sunday around noon.  The place was packed and the line to get in was long.  I took this all as a good sign.  However, when we saw the food, which was displayed beautifully, I was underwhelmed by the selection.  There were no crab legs, no lobster tails.  Really, the only seafood was shrimp cocktail--which was nothing special--and baked salmon (the citrus beurre blanc was nice) and red snapper.  I expected a lot more in the way of seafood options and was disappointed--especially since I don't eat red meat.  Pics I've seen online all showed the Wynn brunch with giant crab legs and lobster, but there was definitely none to be had on 1/27/13 when I was there.  The dessert options were also underwhelming.  The cream puffs were splendid, but the raspberry cheesecake shooters tasted like Jello no-bake and all the chocolate cakes were sugar-free.  Very disappointing.  So, five stars for presentation and service, but three stars for the food."

Fruit and yogurt area nice if you are into that. So much good food and then tere is another area for dessert. Too full to even try.  Some of the items were small like bagels but for good reason too many other things to try!  You could graze here and not eat another meal that day. Everything high quality"

They're delicious and you can probably get your money's worth right there.  They have different sections representing different lands.  My favorite combination was pizza and hummus.

We went on Monday night and there was no line at all! :) I have to say that after eating here, there is absolutely no doubt that wynn's buffet is better than the Bellagio's! The food quality is much better, there is way more variety, and everything is so much cleaner, healthier, and nicer. Their dessert selection is phenomenol. My favorites: the mussels, shrimp, t-bone lamb, and the crepes that are made right when you order them! For $35 (plus tax), this is a fantastic deal.

The dessert room was so cute with all the little goodies they had in there...mini candy apples, marshmallow pops, mini cupcakes etc. \n\nYes at about $35 a person it is a little pricey but  we definitely thought it was worth the price tag. Service was excellent as well. Even though they were busy plates were cleared promptly and drinks were filled. \n\nI will most definitely be back!"

The buffet is the same, the decor is beautiful, and makes you feel like you are in an palace with a beautiful garden. I remember having a lot of crab legs! yes unlimited. there was sushi too. Dessert selection was good. Make your own awesome pasta station. \nMinus one star for making me and my friends get separate tables because we didn't want to pay the ridiculous gratuity increase. whatever. I came here for the lunch I think it was about 30 - 40. yes. i know. Up to your pocket . \nWear something loose because you will be eating to get your money's worth. They had prime rib here too. yes. a good selections of salads too. Fruit, etc. all that good buffet stuff. the waiters were pretty good at taking your plates and stuff from your table too."

S"I've been to The Buffet a few times several years ago and remembered it being a pretty awesome place to eat, especially for breakfast or brunch. Endless mimosas for $15? Yes please. As a result, I wind up pretty tipsy before noon. \n\nWe showed up Monday morning at 8 am for breakfast. There was a pretty extensive line even though it had just opened but this was mainly due to the time it took for the servers to take payment and escort each group in. We weren't waiting long before we were brought to our seats.\n\nI passed on the endless mimosas this time around since I'd actually had a bit of a delicate morning (boooo) but I made up for it with amazing food. There's standard breakfast fare, including freshly made omelets and pancakes, fresh fruit, cereal, and a bunch of other things I can barely remember. Then there's a whole other level of food: pizza, Asian, Mexican, a fresh slab of meat. I can't even remember what else was there. Then there's desserts: an ice cream bar, assorted bars and cake slices, cookies. \n\nI ate so much, but fortunately didn't make myself sick (unlike the last buffet I attended!)  Servers were quick to clear off our dirty dishes, although on one clearing they swiped the silverware. \n\nSince you pay before you get in, once you're done with your food, you can just up and leave. It's actually a pretty sweet arrangement. \n\nI've never regretted going to The Buffet for breakfast/brunch. It's decently priced, lots of options, and super easy to get to if you're staying at the Wynn (it's right off the casino). Get there early though, i does fill up pretty quick!"

S"Congeeeeee!\n\nOkay, so that's my favorite part. Comfort food - there is no rhyme or reason.\n\nThe first time we came here about 5 months ago, we stayed at Vdara and decided to earn our meal by making the walk to the Wynn. It was FAR. But it had rained the night before and the weather was cool so the walk was pleasant. By the time we got to the buffet, I was so hungry, I would've eaten a shoe. Mission accomplished!\n\nWent again this past weekend but this time, we monorailed it (yeah, I just verbed it... or gerunded it) to Harrah's and walked the rest of the way. Still far! Stupid Wynn. \n\nThere's a good selection of food from roasts, ribs, american, Mediterranean, sushi, ceviche, salads, soups, desserts, etc. \nIf you come here looking for some standout item - there really isn't one. But I appreciated the consistency for ALL of the items.\n\nAnd in terms of weekend brunch prices, right on par for what you get. Bottomless champagne for an additional $7? Aint nothing wrong with that."

S"The pinnacle of Vegas buffets.  \n\nThey offer all sorts of cuisines here at the Wynn and every single one is done surprisingly well.  Great meat selection at the carving station, and the seafood selection is ample as well.  Crab legs cut in half, piles of cocktail shrimp ready for the taking, and even a nice sushi selection on the side, with hand rolls being my favorite although you gotta get it when it just comes out or else the seaweed will get soggy and that's no fun.\n\nA good deal of grilled items, which to me shows that they are actually spending to effort to make their items, rather than taking the easy road and frying everything.  BBQ sliders, hen, grilled pork chops, and roasted fish are just a few the good ones.  As for the carving station, definitely go for the bacon if they have it.  It is just a beautiful piece of meat done right.\n\nIf you go there for brunch, there's an omelette station and once dinner service starts at 3:30pm, it turns into a made-to-order Italian pasta station.  I love the pasta there, especially when you can have it made with the ingredients you like and the sauces to go with it.  Nothing better than to sit here for 3+ hours and eat different meals all in one sitting :P \n\nAs for the dessert selection, it beats all others as well.  Just the ice cream is a good enough reason.  Their coffee ice cream is bitter like real coffee and they offer good toppings for your ice cream.  Pile them almonds!  You can even order crepes which is just fun cause you can choose different toppings to overdose on sugar.  My favorite dessert though is the creme brulee just cause I'm a sucker for them hahah.\n\nThis buffet seriously stands alone at the top by itself.  I absolutely love coming here.  The quality is there and I really think everything is just done with much more effort.  At $30-40 it is a bit pricey and the wait can be long but hey, it's worth it."

S"The Wynn Buffet is arguably one of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas. From the gourmet fare to the delicious desserts, this buffet is nothing short of spectacular. The food at this buffet almost resembles eating fine dining quality food in an all you can eat format. There are also some very unique dishes that you just won't find at any other Las Vegas buffet, such as octopus salad.  The buffet features quite a bit of live action stations such as a great pasta station that allows you to make your own past. I highly recommend doing this because it won't disappoint. There is also a large selection of gourmet cheese, fresh fruit, unique pastas, and some melt in your mouth cheeses.  Plus if you add in the always fresh crab legs and shrimp cocktail, you got yourself a great all around buffet.  So overall, if you're looking for delicious gourmet meals, high quality meals, and spot-on desserts, all in a very bright and upscale setting, the Wynn Buffet is your buffet of choice."

S"**Go to The Bellagio instead. Don't waste your money here!**\nSo let me start off by saying that I rarely take the time to write reviews. But I read the reviews of others quite often and that is what led me to this buffet at the Wynn. \n\nI have to say that this place was THE BOMB when I came here 1 year ago. I couldn't wait to go back for the dessert crepe station, king crab legs and creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e. \n\nI'm sorry and sad to report that none of these things were at the breakfast buffet. No crab legs.  Not even snow crab. No creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e. No crepe station. Really???? \nEverything we ate was just ok. Some of it was totally disgusting! The prime rib was so good 1 year ago that it has stood out in my mind ever since. But, today it was just like the prime rib you can get anywhere else. Average. \nAnd they bumped up the brunch price to $38 just for Mother's Day. This price DID NOT include champagne. Wasn't that nice of them?  I will NEVER eat at this buffet again. I will go to the Bellagio next time or Studio B. I'm sorry but $40 for breakfast better include some crab legs, creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e and champagne. Soooooo disappointed.

S'I haven\'t tried the buffet at Bellagio, but will next time since there are so many comparisons made.  For now, I am still daydreaming about the Wynn buffet.\n\nDinner starts at 3:30 pm and is $35.  There\'s always a line, so when my companions were running late for our 4 pm dinner date, I got in line.  I made it to the cashier in about 20 minutes, but they won\'t seat you without your full party so I waited off to the side.  The cool thing though is that the rest of your party can then go through the "express" lane to catch up with you!  So lucky them (for letting me do all the waiting) and lucky me (for not having to wait even longer to get my grub on)!\n\nThis buffet was AMAZING.  Could you get better food elsewhere?  Yes.  But the point is that for buffet fare, the food here exceeds.\n\nWe dined for a couple of hours and there was still so much more I didn\'t get to try.  I made a beeline for the prime rib (great) and then stood in line for the shrimp cocktail and crab legs (yummers).  These are the cornerstones of buffet dining so lay off those fillers (you know who you are mashed potato guy)!  I also sampled some bites from my friend\'s plate.  The herb crusted salmon with dashi mushroom in a carrot miso broth was fantastic, as was the sea bass with cabbage, bacon and fingerling potatoes in a red wine sauce.  It\'s surprising when fish is good at a buffet where the food is bound to sit under heat lamps or on heated trays.  Also good was the grilled asparagus.\n\nThe dessert area made me wish I had a tapeworm.  So many choices (including a waffle and crepe station!) and such beautiful presentation.  I went with chocolate and vanilla ice cream (excellent) and an Oreo mousse cake (sadly it sounds better than it tastes).\n\nThe sushi section (I skipped it) looks weak with only three offerings, but otherwise most buffet sections looked impressive like the salad juice glasses, the five kinds of ceviche and the charcuterie (I didn\'t like the prosciutto though) and cheese (love the gouda)!\n\nCan\'t wait to go back!!!'

So there we went.\nThe wait was pretty long, but in the end it was pretty worth it. The selection looks like a lot, but don't be fooled. Each section is spread out and the serving dishes are spread out quite far as well. The main attractions I thought were the crab legs, seafood soup section, tossed caesar salad section and the meat section. For $40 on a Saturday night, it's pretty decent. Skip the sushi section unless you are from an area that doesn't have decent sushi (must be sad). \nThey have good service here and the dishes and food are replaced all night long. If I wasn't in such a rush to go party I'd probably have tried more. As for all buffets, don't expect too much, but this one is worth the entry fee."

However, it doesn't get 5 stars like I would happily rate Wicked Spoon inside the Cosmo.\n\nThe wait:\n- around 40ish minutes at any given time throughout the dinner period\n- i went on a monday night around 9pm and it was definitely busy\n- it was around 40 min wait for a party of 2\n\nThe service:\n- my server was fairly...indifferent\n- he wasn't cheery, nor a downer...he just kind of did what he was supposed to do, minus he didn't offer to refill our drinks. so we had to ask and only got refilled once\n- they weren't the quickest to clean up our plates, even though the boyfie and i politely always stack our plates so they're easy to grab\n\nThe food:\n- granted...I wasn't sober at the time of my visit, but it wasn't anything that deserves at 5\n- yes, they do have king crab legs (and though I'm not a big seafooder) I do see the value of this commodity; however, the line to get some is long and they're not the fastest at refilling the loot\n- if you really want to get some good stuff, to the left of the king crab legs they have smoked salmon sashimi. dasswassup\n-  the prime rib is standard, but not mouth watering or melt in you mouth status, also considering it was near closing...it didn't look fresh\n- the rest is faiiiirly standard for a vegas buffet (ok desserts, really dry sushi, decent but not spectacular pasta)\n\nI've tried a handful of Vegas buffets (Wicked Spoon, Bellagio, Cravings, Rio), and while I can check this off the list, I probably won't go back."

S'The Buffet at Wynn lags far behind it\'s peers (my own points of comparison being the Bellagio, Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar\'s Palace, and even Aria) in both variety of selection and quality of food.  \n\nFor Sunday brunch ($34.58), the Fried Brown Rice with Edamame, Steamed Pork Buns, and Maple Bacon at the carving station were highlights.  I even appreciated the Mini-Waffles that had smaller-sized grooves that give a much better texture than the more usual quarter-Belgian waffle (such as the one at Bacchanal).  A major disappointment was the lack of any version of Eggs Benedict, somewhat surprising as breakfast the next day at Terrace Point Cafe featured a trio of of Eggs Benedict variations.  The puff pastry in the Bacon and Sweet Pea Tart lacks any fluffiness, and while Waffle Batter Fried Chicken sounds like an incredible idea, it does not translate into any particularly distinctive taste.  A regular piece of fried chicken would have been much better.  The Bakery/Dessert area--almost easy to miss even though it\'s at the center of the buffet--had a halfway decent oversized Croissant (the same that is served at Terrace Point and the Encore Lobby lounge for breakfast).\n\nDinner seemed to be even more limited in terms of available choices.  The distinctive  characteristic of the Wynn buffet is the increased use of food stations (i.e., where somebody prepares and/or serves you food).  I liked the Roast Duck Bun station, but not the Gelato Ice Cream Sandwich Station (where the cookies were much too hard and the gelato much too soft to really maintain any semblance of sandwich form).  I did appreciate the carving station, where I asked for a thick cut of prime rib and was surprisingly rewarded with a 1.25" cut of meat.\n\nOverall, The Buffet at Wynn is not an overly terrible place to eat.  You\'ll still get a lot of food and relatively acceptable service from the waitstaff.  Also, the line at The Buffet seemed a lot more reasonable than I\'ve experienced at the other casino resorts.  But having dined at some of those other buffets, The Buffet at Wynn is a classic Yelp 2-star "Meh.  I\'ve experienced better."'

The line was ridiculously long, so paid the extra money for the VIP access.\n\nOur waitress was nice, but took forever to get us drinks. Maybe it would be a good idea to also have juice machines in the buffet so that people can self-serve themselves since the place is understaffed.\n\nThe selection was larger (esp the desserts!) than other buffets I've been to. The quality ranged from utter crap (sushi) to good (desserts). The prime rib, fish, omelets, etc were about average. The price is a bit higher than other hotel buffets in the area, but the overall quality is a bit better, so I guess that's understandable. However, I wouldn't go again. And no way I would wait in line for the quality. \n\nSurprisingly, on my way out, noticed that even the VIP line had gotten long. Not sure what all the hype is about???"

S'Very good buffet on the strip.  The price was reasonable for a Friday night seafood buffet.  Not the most selections compared to others, but the quality is there.  All the seafood items tasted fresh.  Standout dishes include the crab legs, raw oysters, ahi poke, street tacos, peking duck on a bun, ramen noodles with a very good broth and the desserts.  The service was excellent as can be expected from a Wynn resort.'

S"Yum! I've tried many of the buffets on the Strip over the years and this was definitely one of my favorites! The price for dinner is decent (for Vegas), and they have a wide selection of food. The crabs legs and shrimp were delicious, very sweet and succulent. I also really like the antipasto bar and the fresh scooped gelato was really tasty! One of the major misses for me was the sushi, however. It was just not good, small, hard and yucky. Other than that, everything was delicious and we had many plates full of food! I would recommend this buffet for those who want to chow down before they hit the slots."

S"I consider this the best buffet in terms of quality. Everything is fresh and every item tastes good. They are not as ambitious as Bellagio, so don't expect as much variety or as many of the fancier dishes. The king crab legs here are the best I've had at a buffet. Desserts are also amazing. I don't know if it just isn't as popular or if they have a lot of seating, but the line, even when really long, seems to move faster than at other places. Service has been somewhat bad on each visit though. The first time we came around closing so I overlooked it, but I've had mediocre service the past few trips as well."

The king crab legs that everyone kept lining up for were cold and tasteless, the prime rib that night was just... meat, and the desserts were pretty generic. The only dish I really enjoyed was the veal scallopini. \n\nMaybe I've been spoiled by all the Yelp adventuring I've done this past year, where I go to restaurants that specialize in specific cuisines/dishes. But for such an expensive restaurant (of such high repute), I expected better.\n\nNext time, I'm trying the Bellagio."

My friend had to go to the gift shop and buy a $25 non-refundable tshirt just to eat here for $25 during lunch on a Friday. \n\nNot only that, but they make you wait until your whole party is there before they seat you. The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits. The selection of food was not the best. There definitely was NOT any crab legs, and in fact, the seafood section only consisted of basic maki rolls that were rolled poorly and certainly NO shrimp, crab, or any other related "seafood." So disappointing. The only good thing that was offered was the skirt steak at the carving section. The Chinese section was just sad, I didn\'t even bother to try any of the food from that section just by looking at the food offered, it did not look appealing at all. \n\n+1 star for the skirt steak\n+1 star for having sorbet\n\nI wouldn\'t recommend this buffet, nor would I come back.'

S'Very, very good quality.  The chefs here definitely believe in quality over quantity, and I cannot argue with them over their choice.  \n\nThe one reason I can\'t give them 5 stars is because they lack the variety that other buffets have.  They have more variety now than the first time I went (around 3 years ago), but I can see some people wanting more.  For example, they had 2 types of salad the day I went: caesar, and smoked salmon.  They had a few other dressings (bleu cheese, italian, and something else), and both salads were great, but sometimes you want to build your own salad with all sorts of additions that the Wynn lacked.\n\nThe few soups that were served were very interesting (I think one was a pumpkin soup), but I didn\'t see anyone get them!  I think they were a little too "different," and they should stick to normal.  A few years ago they had this amazing cream of asparagus soup, I was sad they didn\'t have that this time.\n\nPrime rib was amazing, spicy tuna hand roll was very, very good, and the cheese ravioli was the best pasta even though it was the simplest.  I can\'t remember much more, but those were the standouts.  I was really disappointed in their mashed potatoes and other sides/veggies... strange thing to say, but I expect better, especially after Bellagio\'s pesto mashed potatoes!\n\nNow, the dessert is what SHOULD get the Wynn 5 stars!  Homemade ice cream and sorbet that truly rivals Haagen Daaz, Dreyers, and any other famous ice cream maker.  Amazing bread pudding, creme brulee, cookies, madeleines, etc.  I definitely enjoyed my dessert more than the dinner, and I\'m not usually a big dessert person.'

Went to the $35 brunch a few years ago, decor of eating area was quite plain to say the least, compared to some of the other buffets around Vegas (ie: Paris, Rio).\n\nWhen i first walked in, the first item i saw was...Asian CONGEE?? What the heck?!!! In asian countries like China, Congee is seen as cheap street food. Here its actually one of the featured stations. Totally lame...\n\nAll the other brunch items were nothing out of the ordinary that you could not find at a cheaper buffet.\n\nNot worth the money. If there is one buffet in Vegas that really kicks butt, it's the Rio World seafood buffet. Money well spent there and good food!"

However since each dish is so complex with foodie ingredients-many dishes normally available within my dietary restrictions were not.  Bacon or proscuitto would appear in random tartlettes or side dishes.  Basically? I felt like I spent a LOT of money to come to a buffet that did not have very many accessible dishes for vegetarians or semi-vegetarians.\n\nMy carnivore cohorts seemed pleased enough-but we all wish that we had just gone back to the Rio\'s buffet, which we all felt had a more robust assortment of dishes to select from.\n\nBottom line-this place is a okay, but after all the hype and expense it is not going to make it to our regular rotation of Vegas buffets.'

The best part was that there were no lines for food once you got sat.  They have a VIP package for a couple of bucks more which means no line to get in that includes a glass of Bubbly and 10 percent off your next visit (pays for itself) .  Not sure why anyone would wait three hours?\n\nAlso, Brenda the General Manager came to our table to see how everything was a nice touch.  \n\nHave been to many buffets in the city and this is the very best.

We sat in the more garden-like dining area where we were surrounded by planters full of beautiful plants so it made it feel as if we were dining in a cafe rather than a stuffy restaurant.  And the food is just to die for that you forget that it's massed produced buffet food.  Even though we were there for lunchtime it was far superior to the Bellagio buffet dinner.  Some of the highlights included the bowl of ramen noodles and the hand scooped ice cream for dessert."

I think it's safe to say you won't have to wait long if you get there before 10 am.\n\nWe loved the decor of the Wynn buffet (as well as the hotel).  The dining areas were broken down into smaller areas.  The tables were comfortably spaced.  It was very quiet.\n\nOur server was very attentive and checked back with us at least 5-6 times.\n\nThe food presentation was beautiful.  My husband and I sampled many different breakfast items.  Everything was delicious.  I especially enjoyed the fresh vanilla pineapple with toasted coconut.  When I saw case after case of breakfast bakery items, I thought I had died and gone to heaven!  We've been to many buffets in Vegas.  In my opinion, the Wynn is tied with the Wicked Spoon for top spot.  For $20, you will get a fabulous gourmet breakfast buffet in upscale surroundings.\n\nConclusion:  I highly recommend the Wynn breakfast buffet!"

S"Came here for the breakfast buffet and since it's still the holidays, we ended up with the holiday brunch buffet. It was $35.95 and for that price, we were able to get the best of both worlds: breakfast and lunch. Oh wait, and a third world: DESSERTS. \n\nBreakfast: skip the eggs benedict, hit up the omelet station and the pork sausages. YUM.\n\nLunch: wasn't the biggest fan of any of their fish entrees or their sushi, the pastas were all right, ALL the potatoes (mashed, sweet potato + marshmallows, and roasted) were amazeballs, the prime rib and the bacon were very flavorful and didn't even need any extra sauces \n\nDessert: die for the rocky road, pecan pie, and the key lime pie mousse, cheesecake was allright, bread pudding was not too shabsters, and I wasn't the biggest fan of the ice cream (but maybe you'll have better luck)... there's also a ton of pastries that I skipped out on but you'll find anything from croissants to danishes. \n\nWe got here around 9:30 am so we didn't really have a wait but about an hour after we got there, there was a huge line. I'd definitely keep that in mind when planning out your time.\n\nI'm not sure if you can expect the same (or a similar) spread during their regular breakfast buffets but based on my experience, I think the lunch may be more worth your money. I think I'll definitely be back -- but maybe for lunch or dinner the next time around!"

I was pretty upset about how gross their oysters looked. They were so NOT fresh; they were BROWN. The selection was meh, the food was meh, the desserts were also meh. Everything about this buffet screams mediocre. \n\nIt's funny because as we were waiting in line to get in, we had several people telling us not to eat here.

S"It must be hard to be so dearly loved, because you can NEVER live up to the hype. Sorry, Wynn Buffet--you disappointed me. It could be because it was the third Big Vegas meal I had in three days. Here are the highlights: \n1) Desserts are definitely the strong suit at the Wynn. If that's your bag, save room. Better yet, start in the dessert room and work your way out. \n2) Prime rib, I'll admit, was huge and good. However, the old server guy who carved it didn't like that I took the au jus from the fuller well in front of me, and chastised me for it. What's up with that?\n3) The husband loved the sea bass and the tandoori salmon (shoulder shrug).\n\nNow the lowlights:\n1)What happened to having sushi or sashimi at Vegas buffets? Neither Mandalay nor Wynn had more than a single platter of mushy-riced/ soft-seaweed product. Bleh. \n2) People who load up on those crab legs must not know what crab legs should taste like: like CRAB not like eating SALT.\n\nI think if you want the Fancy Reputation, you're going to have to kick it up a few degrees past the Mandalay buffet, which I got 2-for-1 because we stayed there. Okay, done. No, wait, one more. PS, all those big floral / fruit arrangements: all fake. Confirmed by the hostess."

S'From everything I had heard about the Wynn Buffet I expected to walk into an airplane hangar with aisle upon aisle of every food I could possibly imagine.  Turns out my interpretation of buffet heaven is slightly too fantastical and instead I ended up having a moment to myself wondering where they were hiding the rest of the food.  I still wonder if maybe I wasn\'t missing something, some corridor that I did not explore, because I hardly considered myself overwhelmed by the options.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  Maybe people shouldn\'t throw around adjectives like "huge" and "crazy big" since this girl will spin it into a food utopia.  Whichever the case, I do not want to belittle the selection too much because there is a lot to choose from.  There just weren\'t any food mountains.  And I found that disappointing.\n\nThat being said, the buffet has good variety for both carnivores and vegetarians, even a vegan option or two, and everything is yummy to really yummy.  The waitstaff attentively removes plates and refills drinks so you can focus solely on gorging yourself instead of flagging someone down for more water or booze.  And as with any good buffet you\'ll find yourself taking labored breaths and clutching your stomach by the end of it all, bemoaning your decision to eat that much food in the first place but still slowly and painfully spooning bread pudding into your waiting mouth.\n\nBut would I do it again?  Probably not.  I\'d rather spend that $50 on a finer dining experience.  Or pay $35 for that all day buffet deal that lets you eat at 5 different buffets on the strip.  Taken together 5 buffets might actually come close to an airplane hangar full of food.  And then I could live the fantasy.'

S'The best buffet in vegas!!!!\n\nDuring our trip, we decided to try out the buffets in LV which according to my friends, "a must try". So we went to wynn in the first day, and it certainly did not disappoint us. \n\nThe wait time for the buffet is not that horrible. We went right at the dinner time, and it took less than 25 minute for us to get the seat. Perhaps it is because it\'s somewhat pricey compared to other LV buffet. ($89+10tip). \n\n\nThe atmosphere is wonderful over here. Seems like a lot of people are around you, but trust me, you do get full attention of the waiters. They are quick and helpful.\n\nSelection is amazing, however, it does not have sashimi which is a little sad for me because I am  a huge sashimi lover. The spicy tuna is good though. It gives you the kick that you want, and you can taste the freshness of the tuna. They even have a specialty section that has some fancy cured meat, but it just doesn\'t appeal to me. \n\nThe prime rib is a must try here. Juicy and succulent. The quality is far above Ballagio\'s. Also, the creme brulee is a surprisingly tasty. It\'s so good that I had 3 of them. \n\nIn the end, we left happily and extremely satisfied.

S"Quick rundown: Fantastic atmosphere, very fast service (on a Sunday night), only drawback was the food.\n\nMy friend and I arrive at around 7pm to a decent sized line with about a 30 minute wait. Something tells me had we shown up 30 minutes to an hour earlier we could've walked in no problem because within 10 minutes the line had grown significantly behind us.\n\nPrice was about $80 for the two of us, including free (non-alcoholic) drink refills and coffee. The waiters were very attentive about it, usually making it over just after I emptied my glass.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it's absolutely gorgeous. When you first walk in, the place is literally decked out in flowers, with a very springtime feel. Many restaurants I go to tend to keep the lights dim, but it was very well lit here, making the colors of the flowers stand out even more. Don't worry about being dressy. However a sign stated that all shirts had to have sleeves (for men at least).\n\nAs for the workers, some were more outgoing than others, but for the most part I was greeted by anyone who I walked past. The guys serving food (especially dessert) were all friendly and chatty, even offering suggestions.\n\nNow for the food: It wasn't all that bad, but considering I hinge my buffet experience on the food, I was pretty disappointed. There were a couple of standouts, mostly in the seafood section. Crab legs (WERE ALREADY OPENED AND PERFECTLY CUT), clams were delicious, and sushi was fantastic but very small selection. The BBQ ribs were so tender that they literally melted in my mouth, so amazing, only wish there was more sauce on them. The veal was to die for! If you eat nothing else there, have the veal. \n\nThe rest of selection however didn't thrill me. There was hummus but the pita bread was (ehh). There were small Asian & Mexican sections (egg roll, tamales [kinda dry in my opinion], burritos, etc). There was also a very tender, yet poorly seasoned beef brisket. Really, you NEED to have a sauce with it. Moving down there was decent meatloaf, disappointing lasagna as well as some other Italian food, pastas, etc. Nothing or that stood out. Finally there were oysters (ok) and some really dry salmon (such a disappointment). Besides that, there was tons of bread but most of it seemed as if it had been out all day, and then a huge selection of cold cuts if you wanted to make a sandwich and tons of toppings, which brings me to my next point:\n\nWHERE WAS THE CHEESE? I don't know if it's just me, but I like to have something cheesy every once in a while. Especially if I go to the buffet, but there was a distinct lack of cheese in everything there, even the Italian food. I was really, really turned off by this.\n\nAs for the desserts, there were tons of choices served tapas style. Small portions of cakes, etc. so that you could try out a lot of different flavors. Unfortunately, most of them weren't all that good. The cakes were dry and lacked sweetness. Even the rice krispies were hardened as if they'd been left to sit for hours. The things you definitely want to try in the dessert section are the sorbet, which was scrumptious, and the warm brownie with almonds. Throw some ice cream on top and the mixture of warm brownie and cold ice cream just makes my heart smile.\n\nVery interesting note: They had these fruit cups with alcohol in them. Pretty awesome. One of them was watermelon with tequila in it. The other was pineapples with malibu rum and coconut shavings. I hate coconut, but I loved this.\n\nWhat's crazy is that it sounds like I ate a lot. I'm 5'10 165lbs, so I'm not a big person. My friend is about my size, just a bit taller. We actually finished trying just about everything and still had quite a bit of room left. I polished off a few more of those crab legs because I was still in amazement i could just pick large chunks of meat out with a fork. He tackled some more sorbet and we called it a night. We left there fairly satisfied with our fullness, but partially disappointed at the meal.\n\nTipped the waiters pretty handsomely though because they were awesome the whole night."

My standouts were the great hand scooped ice cream options, pork and shrimp dumpling station and the pizza with a cooked egg on it.

S'Typically, I\'m not a fan of buffets, but I would have to say this is the best buffet I have ever been to. At first, I thought the name was rather contentious, but this is definitely "The Buffet" of all buffets. If I had to do just one buffet while in Vegas, this would be the one.\n\nThe first thing I noticed while stepping onto the line was the smell. The aroma of food was fantastic and awakening to my senses. I made sure I came here on an empty stomach with a mean appetite, and it was well worth it. \n\nThe Buffet has an extravagant selection of food to choose from, and everything is presented very well. The selections are quite creative as well in contrast to most standard run-of-the-mill buffets. \n\nThe decor is bright and colorful in a cute, very floral sort of way. The service is very good as well, from the empty plates being pre-bused and frequent drink refills. I came here for dinner on a weekday, and although the price may seem a little steep at first glance, it is quite competitively priced for all that you get as well as the dining experience.'

S'was here over the weekend for dinner.  have not had a buffet in vegas for many years but finally gave in and tried the Wynn.  $45 including tax and tip for dinner in vegas is a fair deal.  prime rib was very tender and my favorite dish.  had a few lamb lollipops also which was cooked perfectly but the seasoning on it was not my favorite for lamb.  it left an orange oily film on my plate.  the asian food selection was pretty good also but the sushi selection was lacking.  only a few roll selections and no sashimi.  for $45, i expected some faw fish.  the crab legs were not king crab.  it was tasty but skinny long legs were not as meaty as i like.  i like the big chunks u get from king crab.  there was a large selection of dessert but not outstanding.  i tried 5 different things and the best was a basic gelato.  very refreshing for an end to the meal.  the Buffet at Wynn is worth a try but it was not good enuf for a return visit.'

The cost was $56.95, for that price i would recommend going to the SW and pay a little more, but it would be worth it!!!!  King crab legs were not even worth the wait.  Screaming kids all around us.  We asked to be moved to another table and waitress told us we would need to wait another 15 minutes, after 1/2 hour wait.  Food was typical buffetfood, nothing special.  Extremely disappointed.

It never ends. You can eat forever. It's like a big fat magic trick that every Vegas-goer can participate in.\n\nI don't even remember the main courses offered (things like pasta and sushi), but I certainly remember dessert. There are pastries reminiscent of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, scoops of ice cream, and lots of tiny tarts and cakes to choose from.\n\nOr don't choose. Just try everything because you can.

S"This is a a fantastic restaurant. Disregard any reviews that try to rate Lotus of Siam based on the lunch buffet. And some of the more common Thai dishes, like pud Thai, are no better here than at your neighborhood Thai restaurant back home.\nLotus of Siam offers an exceptional variety of food. Beef jerky is always a winner for me as an appetizer. I also like the spicy crispy rice and the bacon-wrapped shrimp that are deep fried. (See my photos).\nTom ka gai is a chicken coconut soup they do so well. The way I get it normally in restaurants is that they cook the mushrooms in the soup. At Lotus of Siam they add fresh mushrooms right before they serve it. THat's a different way to do it and I like it. Also, if you look at my picture, you'll see a nice dose of chili sauce floating on top of the soup. Be forewarned about eating that straight. Make sure you mix up your soup before you eat it.\nThe duck dishes are usually pretty good at Lotus of Siam as well. \nIf you're not sure what you want, you can trust your server to order for you. Just tell them what you don't like and they can pick dishes for you.\nThe wine selection is fantastic and the prices are more than reasonable."

I had the yellow chicken curry with a spicy request rating of 8 and boy did it kick my ass!  This is really the first thai curry I've tried that I can say is truly spicy.

S'I give this place 3.5 stars. This place is way off the strip and you would probably want a car to get there. Taxi would be expensive I bet. We came here for lunch and arrived around noon and there was a line out the door. Some of the people were there for the lunch buffet and after looking at it, I didnt want to waste a meal on cheap fried stuff. The place is pretty big and we were seated with the sit down side and noticed that more people do that than buffet. Overall, the food is pretty authentic but too bad we werent able to explore more of the authentic dishes.\n\nGarlic prawns- These bad boys are quite expensive at $22 but they are fried and yummy. I couldnt help but eat the fried shell as well. They werent spicy and did have some flavor to it but I did have a tummy ache after all the fried stuff. I say if you are a fan of seafood, then go ahead and give it a try. Since I am not an avid fan of it, I could have easily passed on it and tried an entree but my yelper self had to try.\n\nNam Kao Tod- This is an appetizer that Yelp told me to get. I would not reorder this. It is fried crispy rice pieces that have a sour lemon taste to it. I do not particularly like the flavor and it is not something I would ever crave. I would pass.\n\nTofu pad see ew- Average and nothing special about it. I liked the veggies in it though.\n\nMango sticky rice+ coconut ice cream- These are sold separately but they put them on the same plate. This dish is always awesome and it tastes like the others I have tried. The sticky rice isnt that sweet which is nice because you have the mangoes and ice cream with it.\n\nOverall, it is a good Thai place in Vegas and I guess it is similar to Krung Thai in San Jose. Nothing crazy status but a good change than the regular buffet.'

I finally got up and took a glass from a water station and helped myself.  The buffer while ok was not monitored and refilled timely.  I made two separate trip 15 min apart for the green chicken curry. Neither time was it refilled. Just a few sad pieces of zucchini floating in sauce.  The same applied to the tempera.  Staff did not acknowledge me or two other tables.  When I went to pay I told the cashier and she said with no concern we are busy.  I said hire more help. You can afford it.

I\'m blown away by the level of execution and consistency of their dishes." (http://www.lamag.com/features-hidden/2013/05/16/vegas-chefs-choice) \n\nReally now mister fancy chef dude? With all of the top notch Thai places in LA that is a rather bold statement and I decided I must witness such cuisine myself. \n\nMy wife and I are in Vegas and we decide to make the trek from the strip to this place that is located in an oddball shopping center. We saw the place and were skeptical... we walked in and our nostrils were immediately welcomed by delicious Thai aromas. Skepticism melted away as we walked past the bunch of people waiting around for a table. We put our name down and the wait was long - I wish we had made a reservation. That right there folks is the only gripe I have.\n\nWhen the hostess took us to our table she warned us that since they are busy the wait for our food might be lengthy. At that point we had already invested too much time to turn back and after looking at all of the yelp reviews we were ready to try this stuff, so that warning did not detour us. We were then greeted by a friendly waiter and he took our drink and food orders efficiently. The hostess\' warning turned out to be unnecessary as our food came out in a very reasonable amount of time. \n\nOkay, enough semantics. The FOOD. Oh, the glorious food. The drunken noodles with soft-shell crab were stunning. I took the first bite and I felt my eyes pop out of my head. The flavors were so amazing! Then the panang curry with crispy duck was unbelievable. I\'ve had "crispy duck" before and never, never in my life has it been as delightfully crispy as it is here. Perfection!  \n\nMy wife and I dine at some pretty spectacular places when we are in Vegas and we have talked about this meal more than any other. I will certainly be returning to this place each and every time I go to Vegas. So, yes. Mister fancy chef dude\'s bold statement is absolutely valid. Yes, I too am blown away by their amazing Thai food!'

The other half is sealed up with drywall, leaving very limited seating and long lines. \n\nAt lunch #1: we ordered off the menu.  \n\nDRUNKEN NOODLES with PRAWNS:  The prawns were fanastically fried, with the shells semi attached, which are like the best shrimp crackers ever.  They were so addictively well fried and well seasoned.  The noodles, however, were sooo meager in portion that it almost makes me angry.  I'd actually consider bartering with the chef.  I'll give her back a few prawns just for a few more noodles.  The dish is littered with fried, seasoned garlicy basil leaves.  Nothing is mixed though so it's a bit of a mystery how to eat this. \n\nPAD THAI:  Tiny little noodles and it makes your neighborhood Thai place embarrassed to use ketchup! \n\nNAM KAO TOD: Crispy rice with sour sausage seasoned with ginger, lime.  OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.  The flavors were so intense and funky.  With a bite of raw cabbage and cucumbers in between each bite of rice, this was my favorite dish of the day. \n\nLUNCH #2:  Lunch buffet.  Vegetarian pad thai, some kind of curry (e.g. red, yellow), vegetable tempura, some kind of soup (e.g. egg drop, hot and sour), fresh fruit, fried rice, white steamed rice, various stir fries, orange chicken.  Only order this if you're wanting huge portions of pad thai.  I did like the banana rolls for dessert.  Banana wrapped in egg roll wrappers along with some shredded coconut and deep fried.  \n\nMmm, next time I'll skip the buffet and order more adventurously off the menu."

The key to the menu here is prolificity, with close to 150 items capped off by a series of Chef\'s dishes and curries all of them fresh and interesting.  For me it was the Roast Duck Red Curry with pineapple and a dash of coconut milk, preceded by an amazing salad of crispy Soft shelled crab tossed with shaved cabbage, lime, peanuts and fresh chili (10/10).  But wait, there\'s more!  Wine list is crazy extensive for an ethnic joint.  Great German riesling selection, to be expected, but a surprising amount of Burgundy plus a ton of other old and new world juice.

Queue the dirty look from the girlfriend.\nI was somewhat relieved once inside LOS, although wasn't sure what to expect given that there wasn't anything too special about what was inside.\nAnyway, all that really matters is that the food is amazing.  I eat a lot of Thai food and generally find it hard for a restaurant to do it really poorly or really well, and LOS managed to impress me.  Her specialty is Northern Thai dishes, so be sure to try something you may not be accustomed to if you're used to Bangkok Thai food, like I am.

But that might not really be saying much as the rest of the places have been in Arizona. But there is no place in AZ that serve Isaan food and mm mm mmmm I have missed me some Isaan food. Seeing as how both of us have not had Isaan food since we were last in Thailand, we decided to splurge a little and ended up with a $90 bill between the two of us. I\'m going to just reiterate that every single dish we ordered was the best that we\'ve had in the states.\n\nWe started out with some Moo Dad Deaw (Issan Style Pork Jerky) This was one of my favorite dishes in Thailand and I was just beyond ecstatic when I finally found in a restaurant here. Som Tum (papaya salad) with some sticky rice to dip it in was next. It was funny to us when the waitress came by and was like "Oh you eat just like Thai style!" Tip. Try it. Soaking up the Som Tum juice with the sticky rice is oh so delicious. Again I find it hard to find a place that serves a good Som Tum AND have the sticky rice available so I was extremely excited. We also ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup to start out with too and it absolutely hit the spot. \n\nThen we finally reached our main courses. We decided on getting the Khao Soi and the Northern Larb. These are both Isaan (Northern region) style food that we have found impossible to find in Arizona. I\'m not going to lie, the larb absolutely kicked my ass. But it usually does everywhere I have it. The dish was amazing yet I have forgotten how hot Isaan spicy really is. The Khao Soi is a noodle curry dish that is absolutely divine. I don\'t think that you really find this combination too much so I was glad to finally have it again.\n\nI can\'t wait to come back already to get some of the other dishes that I have been searching to no avail for. People might go to Vegas for gambling but I am coming back for the Thai food. It might not save me any money but it will absolutely be worth it.\n\nThe only weird part of the experience might have been the fact that there was a empty table next to us the entire time. The place was hopping, the waiting parties at the bar were getting to be ridiculous, yet there was a table for four right next to us that was left empty. Now we had a couple theories for this. A. It might have been because we smelled. Everybody was in their Night out getups and here we were in shorts and a tshirt covered with a couple layers of dirt. I wouldn\'t be surprised if there was a certain odor permeating around us. B. We had spicy food. This entails me sweating like a pig. A + B probably meant nobody wanted to be within a 10 ft radius of me. I will try to clean up for next time...'

S'I was delirious from no sleep, no rest, work calling endlessly, tendonitis flaring up in my ankle and a wedgie from my thong.  Stupid underwear....why is my boss calling me again?  What time is our flight?  Fuck these shoes are cutting into my skin!!!!  I should have talked to that hot guy at the pool....too bad I looked like the Pillsbury Dough Boy.\n\nAfter four days in Vegas I was plumb tired and exhausted from laughing and drinking and walking endlessly through the desert of Sin.  I was swimming in my disillusioned mind of crazy thoughts.  You know the feeling right?  The one where you are so loopy with exhaustion that you have no other emotions but "wha????".  You answer every question with that blank stupid grin of numbness.  \n\nThen we came to Lotus.  The food was great and replenishing.  It was fresh and flavorful and it gave me the mental pick me up I needed to gamble once again the same $20 dollars I\'ve been losing and winning at the penny slots all weekend.'

S'I have heard from so many places about how this is supposed to be the best thai food this side of (insert thai city here), but my friends and i left very disappointed.  We shared the satay which were good.  The pad thai was really disappointing.  My bf and i also had the thai fried rice and the yellow curry.  Neither was anything to write home about.  This was hardly the best thai food i have ever had.  Honestly I wish we had just eaten at one of the places in our hotel instead of having to get the car from valet and drive here.  with all the dining options in vegas, especially on the strip, i doubt i would be back.'

S"Certainly, the location comes across as the most beaten down strip mall in a city nicknamed Lost Wages.  Come here in the heat of summer and likely you will feel that you and your party have stepped into a Post Nuclear Bomb movie: your skin feels like 1,000 degrees and glowing. So the food would have to be the draw.  And it is!  This has some of the best Thai food in the ole' U.S. of A. (note: the original restaurant was in Hollywood, another city that has seen better days, so I have actually been eating here for two decades!)   The curry here is special, with the right level of heat.  So enjoy those beads of sweat on your forehead, because they will cool you down when you walk back out into the furnace!"

S"Ordered:\n-drunken noodles w beef \n-rad na w beef\n-lunch buffet\n\nCame in around 1:30pm on a fri and got seated right away... Unlike last time where came in the evening and waited an hour and eventually had to take to-go. \n\nFirst, it took them 15 mins for them to take our order. Then I was waiting for my food. Everyone finished their food before they brought out my dish. And when they did, they got the order wrong. After waiting another 20 mins, they got the order wrong a second time, so I asked for them to take it off the check. Considering that it wasn't that busy, I'm not sure why service is so bad.\n\nAlso, the lunch buffet doesn't really get refilled much after 2.\n\nFood's good. Service was terrible, and they didn't seem to give a shit. If we ever choose to come back, we'll probably just order to-go next time!"

S"One thing I really didn't like about this restaurant is that their portions are SMALL. Between four people we shared four dishes and from each dish we didn't even get the size of our hand (serving size). Another thing, our waiter didn't come around as often as we'd like. Our waters and teas were emptied out and he came around to fill them when we were done. Work on your service skills, you're in Las Vegas. Better service = bigger tips.\n\nOn the outside, this place looks like a true hole in the wall. On the inside, could use a little more remodeling/repainting. Maybe some statues. The wine cellar is pretty cool though.\n\nWe ordered papaya salad, curry, pad thai and pineapple fried rice. All delicious but I wish they gave more.\n\nWill be returning, skeptically."

S"Finally!!  I have been waiting and waiting to try out this thai resturant for----ever!  I''ve heard so many rave reviews about this place and this trip to vegas, i just couldn't pass it up.  I made reservations a week in advance, just to secure my table for 5!  Everything was really delicious and If i must say, a lot better than i've had in Thailand.  Their green curry is AMAZING and the best i've ever had.  Everyone at the table loved it so much we decided to order a second order!  The papaya salad with raw crab was also one of the best I've had.  My favorite is still on the street in Bangkok, but this one was almost just as amazing!  That salad packs a lot of flavor which i love because I usually have to wait overnight for all the flavors to be absorbed by the papaya, but not at lotus of siam!  That alone gets 5 stars and so does the green curry.\n\nWe also ordered nam prik noom which is a northern green chili dip that is really good with fried pork skin and plain sticky rice.  This was probably my least favorite dish, as the flavor of the green chili wasn't like the kind i've had in thailand.  it's still pretty good though!\n\nThe thai boat noodles was good, but the broth could of had more beef flavor.  If you like this dish, you should definitely hit up Yum Saap (or Saap as its called on Yelp) in West Hollywood.  Its the closest boat noodle to the kind in thailand!\n\nThe Nam kao Tod, was something I have never tried and I thought it was pretty interesting and yummy.  Some people at the table didn't like it because the sausage is sour, but its supposed to be.  If you aren't a fan of sour sausage, then maybe stay away from this dish.\n\nThe Put Prik King is also one of the best I've had.  We got ours with pork and the flavor of the prik is soooooo good!  Other thai resturants either make this dish too sweet or too salty or not much flavor.  Each bite of lOS's Put prik king is packed with flavor and is so delicious with hot fluffy jasmine rice! =)  \n\nI wanted to so badly order everything to-go so I could enjoy it back home in LA.  \n\nI highly highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants the best Thai food in the US. imo. haha prove me wrong!  =P"

S"DUCK NOODLE SOUP. \n\nI've never had anything like it...the broth was sweet, tangy, and addictive. I've had duck noodle soup at various other Thai restaurants in California but Lotus of Siam makes it incredibly well. Came here at 6pm on a Sunday night with 3 others. We made a reservation, so we were seated promptly. When we left at 8pm, there were about 20 people waiting in line. I would not come here without making a reservation.\n\nWhile vacationing in Vegas, several people were telling us about Lotus of Siam. Some went so far as to describe this restaurant as the best Thai restaurant in all of America. I'm not sure if I can confirm that statement, but it is pretty darn good Thai food. \n\nWe ordered:\nPanang Curry: (5/5)\nPad See Ew: (5/5)\nPad Kee Mau: (5/5)\nCatfish soup: (3/5) I would not get this again\nDuck noodle soup: )6/5) When can I come back here?!! Can't get enough of this stuff. \n\nRandom fact: they have an extensive wine menu and a poppin' bar area."

S"Last time we were in the Vegas area we tried Lotus of Siam. We had heard rave reviews and knew celebrities even frequented the place. When we first pulled up, we were a little surprised by the restaurant's appearance. It's definitely not fancy, and isn't in the nicest of neighborhoods. Nonetheless, we had heard such great things about the food so we were excited to give it a try. When we walked in, the inside was pretty cute. We had quite a long wait (as other reviewers said, reservations are a good idea). We thought we'd just go to the bar and have a drink while we waited. The bartender was AMAZING. I'm very picky about wines, and she let me taste a couple before ordering the one I wanted. When a table finally opened up, the dinner service was absolutely fantastic as well. Everyone was so friendly and attentive! As for the food, it was by far some of the best Thai I have ever had. I had the calamari garlic. I love calamari, but sometimes when I order it in restaurants it's really tough and chewy. The calamari here was SO tender. The sauce was spicy and fragrant: lots of garlic and cilantro. I just wish I could have it more often! Especially for the quality of the food, the prices are incredibly reasonable. Highly recommend Lotus of Siam... just be prepared to make reservations or endure a bit of a wait!"

(And my hot pepper-loving friend was very disappointed.) Otherwise we loved every bite of our food. I love Thai food and it doesn\'t get much better than this. We went on a weekend - make sure to call early to add your name to the list. If I ever return to Vegas, I\'m taking a cab straight to Lotus of Siam-yum!'

S'I give this place an overall 2.5 stars:\n\nThe Pros:  Great customer service.  Large dining area that can accommodate lots of customers.  Delicious, juicy pork satay. Garlic pepper chicken was wonderful and they used all white meat!  \n\nThe Cons:  Prices are a bit inflated (expect to pay $2+ on all dishes), portions are tiny for the inflated price you pay.  Location is in a run down strip mall in a ghetto, shady part of Vegas.  \n\nMy hubby and I came to the conclusion that this place is overly hyped. We had better pad thai from The Thai Noodle House on Spring Mountain (Chinatown) for a few dollars less and double the portion size.  It was a good thing that we were not too hungry as the portions they served us were comparably smaller to what other Thai restaurants may serve you.'

S"Just completed my annual getaway to Las Vegas, which always includes a pilgrimage to the dirty strip mall off Sahara for dinner at Lotus of Siam. It still reigns as the best Thai food I've ever eaten. They've renovated and expanded the dining space in the last year, and it looks much nicer. The decor is finally being elevated a little closer to the high quality of the food. Surprisingly, I didn't think my meal was as exceptional as my last visit in September 2009. It was still super yummy, but didn't have the same wow factor. Is it the remodel? Larger dining room? Or have I put Lotus of Siam so high on a pedestal from my last experience, it will never be as insanely satisfying as my first dinner there? Wine flights are no longer offered either."

That was easy to do.  Ask them for the cross street, because if you have a dinner reservation it's hard to find the place!\n\nEveryone says to get the Northern Thai dishes at LOS.  So we tried a few things:\n\nKhao Soi $10.95 - egg noodle curry soup.  We thought it was just ok, nothing special.\nSome red onions, pickles, lime on the side.\n\nKang Hung Lay $10.95 - red pork curry.  It was a small dish of just pork and curry sauce w/ some cilantro on top.  Tasted just ok, nothing special.\n\nNorthern Tom Kah Soup $10.95 - a bit spicy and sour without coconut milk soup, chicken is dry, some grape tomatoes flavorless, some mushroom, meh.\n\nSticky rice $2 - for 1 person, meh, dry.\n\nThai ice tea $2.5 - very sweet!  Had to dilute it with lots of water & ice.\n\nHot tea $2 - some container of hot tea w/ tea bag, nothing special.\n\nGlad I tried it, but probably won't go back."

Now don't expect this place to be a fancy schmancy restaurant off the Vegas strip, but you will get better food for less $$. Now their spice gauge is spicier than the typical mom and pop Thai restaurants that cater to white people. So if you don't like spicy tell them low and if you like spicy a 7 cause that was really hotttttt..\n Love love this place if you like Thai come here!"

After eating overpriced crap food everywhere on the strip, my palate and entire body was screaming with joy here.\n\nFirst off, what an interesting interior. The massive wine cellar and list is impressive. It still gave me a hole in the wall feel but it was a very large hole in the wall, unusually. The chandeliers were pretty to look at but it was hard to avoid the emergency exit sign/door that was next to my face from where we were seated. It didn't matter though, I was aching for some tummy comfort.\n\nPapaya salad, Musamun Curry and Salt & Pepper Prawns. Holy eff. It did more than the trick and I literally cried when the bear wouldn't let me eat the leftovers after we got back to the fridge-less hotel & they had been sitting out for a couple hours, I was aching for more of that deliciousness...\n\nI really wish I had gotten more chances to eat here and try some of their other specialties.

As a matter of fact, as you walk in, there are a number of awards, accolades and write ups about this place.\n\nI came with a friend so we ordered three dishes to split between us, two entres and one appetizer.\n\nTo start with, we ordered the stuffed chicken wings. These were my least favorite out of what we ordered. They lacked seasoning in my opinion.\n\nNext, we ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken and the beef Pad Thai. Both of these dishes were terrific. The Pad Thai came with thinner style noodles than I normall expect with Pad Thai, but still, very good!\n\nI wasn't particularly crazy about the service, as we didn't have a clear cut server, they kept changing, so we weren't sure who to ask for what. Also, their prices are sort of high for Thai food, but maybe it's because I'm comparing it to LA?\n\nOverall, not bad, I'd actually go again, but who knows, with so many incredible dining options in Vegas, it just may be a while before I do.\n\nFood: 3.5\nAmbience: 2.5\nService: 3\nValue: 3"

S"Probably not the best Thai food I've ever had since Thai Town in LA is closer than Vegas, but this place did impress me.  I don't think I can count how many times people have mentioned Lotus of Siam to me in passing.  Lotus of Siam is tucked away in a strip mall on Sahara away from the Las Vegas Strip.  It's somewhat small and unassuming but the food is pretty good.  They do have the chili condiments on the side if you request it because everyone enjoys different levels of heat in their food.  \n\nMy friends and I met up for a SoCal UYE of sorts while here on Yelp Spring Break.  We arrived before the restaurant opened for lunch.  At lunch they offer an AYCE buffet for $10.99 but you can also order a la carte too.  We decided to order off of the menu.  \n\nWe tried: \n\nCrispy Duck (5 stars) - By far my favorite dish, the duck was de-boned and fried to a crisp with excellent flavor.\nChicken Satay (4 stars) - I thought the chicken was perfectly cooked.  It's really easy to overcook chicken but this was great.  The peanut dipping sauce and cucumber salad condiments were spot on.\nYellow Curry (3 stars) - Pretty standard curry but the vegetables were undercooked.  I like my curry vegetables to be a little softer.\nPad See Ew with beef (3 stars) - Pretty standard.  The noodles were soft and the Chinese broccoli was good.  \n\nThe service was ok at best.  We did ask for a large table because we were expecting a large party, however, we were stood up.  The waiter expressed that they could split our bill into 4 but that was the max he would do.  After our dishes were brought out, he disappeared until we had to flag him down for our check.  No matter.  The food was good, we were happy.  No reservations for lunch but they take reservations for dinner."

S"In trips to Vegas, I've been fortunate enough to do the sixteen-course degustation at Joel Robuchon, dinners at places such as Picasso, Alex, Nobu, L'Atelier, Wing Lei, SW, etc.\n\nYet, the most delicious meal I've ever had in Vegas was at Lotus of Siam.\n\nFirst thing to know: this is really three restaurants in one.\n\n#1, there's a lunch buffet where rubes come in and pay $7.50 to eat potstickers and egg rolls.  Pretend this doesn't exist.\n\n#2, there's a normal Thai menu with stuff like phad thai and panang curry.  While this stuff is good, it's not unlike what you might eat at a good Thai restaurant in Seattle or San Francisco or New York.\n\n#3, there's a section of the menu with Northern Thai dishes and Chef's Special dishes.  This is the heart of the menu and what makes foodies cry with delight.  If you're coming all the way here (and it's a long walk from the middle of the strip), you must order off of these sections of the menu.\n\nWe've been here several times.  Most recently, we had the dry sausage, a green curry dip, and finally the special Beef Stew with peppercorn sauce (option A I think.)\n\nWhile all of these are highly recommended, the beef stew was one of the most delicious things I've ever had.  The meat was absolutely fork tender, flavored with aromatic and perfectly balanced Thai spices--the right mix of sweet and spicy and pungent.  Just amazing.  Totally beyond the flavors and textures you expect.\n\nThey grow a lot of their own herbs and spices because they're not available outside of Thailand.  As a result, you'll taste flavors and combinations you've probably not had before.\n\nAgain, order off of the Northern Thai or Chef's menus.  And prepare to be amazed."

S'First off. I came on a sunday around 7, alone. There was a wait for me of 30 mins. I didnt care because i wanted thai and didnt feel like waiting for another cab and taking it back to the strip. So i sat at the bar and enjoyed a singah until my name was called.\nI like to judge Thai restaurants solely based off the peanut sauce when I order chicken satay. If I want to take a whole jar home, sit in front of the tv with a spoon and eat it, I know their food will be just as good. This place isn\'t an exception. It was right up on my "most favorite peanut sauce" list (yes, I have a list of good peanut sauce restaurants, don\'t judge me). \nI ordered the chicken stay for an appetizer and na num tok or something...it was beef and beef makes me happy when I eat it. \nI wasn\'t expecting a crap load of thai basil and cilantro (which I don\'t care for) being on the plate when presented.  I managed to eat it and still enjoyed it with the exception of the couple cilantro bites I got. Probably wont order it again, but I will deffinetly be back here my next vegas trip. Huge menu and lots of things to try!!'

S'my b/f took me here for lunch one day.  i\'d never been before.  i love Thai food, and after reading all of the reviews on the wall, i couldn\'t wait to eat.  \n\nfortunately, we deviated from the standard buffet menu.  the buffet looked boring--like Thai/pan-Asian 101 for clueless americans.  we both ordered from the Northern Thai specialty menu in the very back of the menu.  \n\nFOOD--beef jerky: yummy.  i have no idea how they make it so moist!  i probably don\'t want to know... i think another reviewer said it was deep fried?  but it\'s good.  nothing as phenomenal as the pork dish described below, but still an experience in taste and texture.  \n\nFOOD--fish cakes: i guess they\'re ok.  my b/f LOVES them, says they\'re better than any he\'s ever had.  as for me, it\'s food so i\'ll eat it but nothing to write home about.  \n\nFOOD--Jack Fruit with Chicken: i\'m not a huge pork eater, and i\'m always a little suspicious of eating seafood in the middle of the desert.  could be just coast snobbery, but i just don\'t think seafood can be nearly as good a couple hundred miles from the sea.  anyway, i ordered the jack fruit with chicken dish.  i would have really liked the dish except i ordered it too spicy!  i said medium, but it was pretty darn hot.  even my b/f, who LOVES spicy food (he was in Thailand and even the Thais were impressed with the amount of hot peppers he consumed) thought it was pretty spicy.  not initially, but it crept up on you.  maybe b/c i\'m asian they thought i meant medium Thai, not medium american.  \n\nFOOD--Northern Thailand dry pork: my b/f ordered this dish 10 spicy.  even with the amount of heat, i tried a tiny, tiny bit of pork and i was blown away.   i don\'t mind heat so much as long as there is still flavor to the dish, and boy was this dish flavorful!!!!  omg, the tiny bit i tasted was phenomenal!!!  there was a warm, heady, complex spicy flavor that, had it not been 10 spicy, i would have devoured--even though i\'m not a huge pork fan.  \n\nwe were unfortunately too full for dessert--i really wanted to try the mango and sticky rice.  next time, though, i will get my dessert.  \n\nSERVICE: i thought the service was really quite excellent.  my water glass was always full--thank goodness!!!  and all of the staff made sure my b/f always had a full glass of diet coke.  he must have had 5 diet cokes while we were there--no joke.  he needed it, the food was really hot!  we were there over lunch, so while everyone else was going for the buffet, we were getting great treatment.  maybe it\'s different at dinner.  \n\noh, and the wait was reasonable.  i think we waited 15-20 minutes?  \n\nDECOR: who the hell cares???  the food is amazing!  actually, i kind of like hole-in-the-wall places, especially in vegas where everything is so manufactured and shiny.  i feel more like i\'ve discovered a little gem than when i\'m in a fancy restaurant.  and the past few times we\'ve gone to the fancy places, i haven\'t been so impressed with the food.  and i didn\'t think the decor is so bad.  not "romantic" by any means, but what kind of person would you rather date???  someone who cares only about external appearances, or someone who appreciates the quality on the inside???  \n\nNEIGHBORHOOD: i was only there for lunch, but i\'ve been near there at night before and have never felt unsafe.  then again, i lived in new york for three years and used to walk the streets of paris at 3am.  maybe i\'m too blase about the vegas "ghetto" to feel unsafe.  \n\nall in all, be adventurous and either ask the waitstaff for a recommendation or go out on your own.  you won\'t be disappointed... unless you get the buffet.  honestly, just how amazing beyond words can green curry really be???  you can get standard Thai anywhere.  if you\'re going to go here, you might as well get something you can\'t get anywhere else (outside of Thailand).'

S"We give this place 3 stars. The service was great but the food didn't amaze us.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nPad Thai: our favorite noodle dish that we always order.  The amount in the plate is fairly small compared to all the pad thai's we've had so I was disappointed.  The sauce and noodle ratio was off because there was too much sauce.  Despite this, we liked the pad Thai.\n\nShrimp Fried Rice: again, very small amount. We had to order two more sides of white rice (there was only two of us).\n\nPad Prik King: it was spicy and that was about it. I honestly don't remember the taste because it didn't make an impact on my taste buds.  There was nothing remarkable about this dish.  Won't be ordering this again.\n\nYellow Curry:  I LOVE YELLOW CURRY.  But this was probably the worst yellow curry I've ever tasted.  Not because it was disgusting, but because the chicken had no taste.  The soup part of the curry was good but once I bit into the chicken, there was no taste.  Absolutely disappointing.\n\nOverall, since we rarely come to Vegas, we probably will never be back to this place again the next time we vacation because there are so many other restaurants in Vegas.  The food in this place was a miss on our first visit so we will try other restaurants."

Of course there\'s going to be some backlash from all the publicity they\'re receiving.\n\nBut if you go to Lotus of Siam, and you look at the menu and say, "Hmmm, I just want to eat pad thai, tom yum koong, papaya salad, and a bunch of other crap I can get at every Thai restaurant in the world," I really don\'t care about your opinion.  And if you gave this place 1 star for your review of their buffet, maybe you just delete your yelp account.'

S"At the advice of a foodie and my wife's research we decided to give this a try.   We had  crispy rice appetizer and I must say it was fragrant and crunch and wonderful spicy (we chose mild).  The dish was a bit salty and the vegetables were great is perfect to offset it's saltiness - I just wish there was more vegetables to go with this dish.   I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup (I didn't specify and was quite spicy).  My wife had the Drunken Seafood Noodle (she wanted it mild) the taste of basil with the seafood is very good.  I suggest going with mild if it is your first time there.  Waiters are very attentive, friendly, and will answer any questions you may have.   Defiantly will be returning, the next time we are in town."

S"This is the best, most authentic Thai restaurant outside of Thailand ! \n\nMost Thai restaurants in the U.S. are really set up for western taste buds. Meaning, they are not really the type or the taste of food you get in Thailand. At Lotus of Siam, yes, they have the Pad Thai and things like that for those who do not like the spiciness of traditional Thai food, but what they also have is a great selection of true traditional Thai dishes, meaning they are spicy. \n\nIf you want to eat true Thai food, look on the menu under the Northern Thai section and the Chef's Choice. The food is great !\n\nThis restaurant also has a vast selection of wine. This is very unusual for a Thai restaurant. Personally, though I love a nice bottle of wine, I don't really think of wine in association with Thai food. But, they do have it, if you want it. Plus, they also have a good selection of beer, Thai Iced Coffee, and other drinks like that. \n\nThis restaurant is located in a strip mall. Though there are several other international restaurants around it, the outside is not inviting. Don't let this scare you off. Once inside the restaurant is very nice. \n\nFinally, this is a very popular restaurant. People pack the place every day and night of the week. It is best to make a reservation or you may be waiting quite a while for a table.\n\nHighly Recommended !!!"

S'There is a part of me that feels sad writing this review.  Why?  Because I used to love this place so much.  It had been a while since I was last here and I was really looking forward to a great LOS experience.  Several years ago, I ate here so often and brought in so many people that the staff even gave me a free shirt.\n\nAlas, those glory days are over.  Their portion sizes have shrunk, the prices have gone up, and the service leaves something to be desired.  \n\nI arrived early for dinner to beat the wait and when my party of 4 was seated, they only gave us 2 menus and no wine list.  After a little while, the server came over to take our drink order.  When we let him know that we wanted to order wine, but we still weren\'t offered a wine list.  I decided not to push the issue and went with just a glass of his choosing instead of a bottle and then placed our dinner order.\n\nOur appetizer was stuffed chicken wings.  2 chicken wings for $11.   They\'re good chicken wings, but not $11 good.  With a party of 4 people, I\'m surprised our server didn\'t advise us that there would only be two.  Try putting 4 on the plate and then the pricing might make sense.  \n\nThe combination beef noodle soup was very good. I\'ll admit - I\'m an Asian soup noodle guy.  Love the pho, wonton soup, beef stew, and ramen.  This is a nice dish that holds its own with the greats.  Beef, meatballs, noodles, fragrant broth, and garnished with fried pork skin.  Good portion at a very reasonable price.  \n\nOur Pad Thai tasted great, but the portion size was about half of what I remember them serving in the past.  Since we were all sharing dishes, it wasn\'t a huge deal, but it would take at least 2 of these orders to equal what you would get at most other Thai restaurants in town.     \n\nThe whole Thai BBQ chicken was meh.  Seasoning was okay, but I\'m guessing it had been left over from lunch (or earlier), as it came out of the kitchen at room temperature only 3-4 minutes after ordering it together with the duck (and before our appetizer).  It had that "stale chicken" texture that old supermarket rotisserie chicken has towards the end of the night when it\'s sat under the heat lamps for too many hours and becomes mealy.  Although it\'s cut into pieces, the chicken is somewhat small.  Not humanely raised tasty farm chicken small though.  The parts look like they came from a 22-24oz Cornish game hen.\n\nMy biggest disappointment of the evening came to the table in the form of panang crispy duck.  This used to be my favorite dish and I was really looking forward to it.  When the entree came out, it was a fraction of the size of its former self.  The duck was not fried to order and the panang did not have the same richness and depth that it used to.  Was it horrible?  No.  Would I order it again?  Absolutely not.  I asked the server about the portion size of not only this dish, but the rest of them as well and he replied that they all appeared to be fine.  I asked why the duck portion had shrunk so much and he informed me that the portion was only supposed to be 1/4 of a duck.  He said that he hadn\'t worked there very long but it\'s been that way as long as he\'d worked there.  1/4 of a duck with totally unremarkable panang for $25?  Yikes!  It used to be a whole roasted duck, butterflied, de-boned, and then flash fried to order for that price.\n\nThe verdict?  Completely average food, small portions, and big prices.  From now on, I\'ll be heading over to Spring Mt to get my Thai food fix when I\'m in Las Vegas.  I have to wonder what sort of horrible Thai food that the other reviewers on here are eating which causes them to give LOS 5 stars?  Oh, how I yearn for the days when LOS was a small hole in the wall and there was still a wig shop next door.\n\nThe good news out of all of this?  The gay bar at the entrance of the Commercial Center called Spotlight (which has always been and is still very straight friendly) received a full remodel inside and out recently.  Service is fantastic and well drinks and beer are still 2 for $4 during happy hour.  So, if your heart\'s set on overhyped mediocre Thai food, you can still grab a drink next door while waiting for your table.'

S'Ordered the top recommended items based off yelp reviews. \n\nCrispy rice, nam kao tod: Was not the best. \nThe crispy rice was interesting to say the least but the flavors were too strong. Too sour and too salty! \nDuck pennang: the best thing ever! This is a must get item. It was savoury and creamy and oh so delicious! We devoured this \nGarlic prawns: also very delicious. Fried with the shrimp shells. Not super duper garlicy. \nSoft shelled crab noodles: the soft shelled crabs were pretty good too but very small quantity for the price. \n\nThe service was also phenomenal! The waiter was quick to come by and checked on is fairly frequently. The food also arrived quickly.'

I've been all over Thailand several times, and I swear this food is just as delish, except you won't get diarrhea from eating it haha.\n\nI don't even know what to recommend...my mom is super Asian, so we just let her take the reigns and order to her heart's delight, family style.  I know we usually get the hot pot with seafood (not chicken, it's not as good), fried catfish salad, this peppery steak dish that I'm drooling for right now, and stuffed poultry legs of some kind.\n\nIf you reeeeaaaallllly want to know what to order, PM me and I'll ask my mom.  No joke.  She is like an Asian food master queen, and I'm that passionate about this restaurant.\n\nThis place is definitely a little hole in the wall, is always packed, and the area is more than a little sketchy looking.  There is even a sign that says to not leave valuables in your car.  Be prepared to encounter some homeless American citizens in the parking lot.  But it is so worth it.  Plus you'll forget about your car getting robbed for the hour while you are eating because the food is so good.\n\nOh and afterwards...go to the massage place to your right when you exit the restaurant.  Way cheaper and just as great as anything you will get on the strip :)"

If I would have watch the episode prior to going I totally would have ordered off that northern Thai menu. Instead I'm with my usual of Tom Yum soup and panang.  \n\nI was dumb enough to order it spice level of eight out of 10. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the food, the level of spice made it almost unbearable. One of my friends ordered it at a level of two and said it was the most enjoyable Thai experience he ever had, partially because I was so miserable.\n\nThe service was great, the location was a bit scary at a random stripmall off the main strip, but don't let that deter you from trying this place out.\n\nCan't wait to go back."

S'You guys have heard all the hype. All the awards, national media attention, the famous chefs of the world saying how great this place it. Now after a couple of visits I can confirm with all of them, LoS was probably one of the best meals of my life!\n\nI\'ve read a lot of reviews about many of the other Thai places in town. And, a lot of people would rather chose those spots to eat at, rather than go to LoS which they feel is overhyped. I\'ve been to a lot of those places as well.. So what\'s the conclusion? I don\'t think this place is overhyped at all. I believe that LoS deserves every single accolade it has received. It probably deserves more..\n\nPlaces like Komol, Weera Thai, Pan Asian, Archi\'s etc. etc., they make really good, in fact, they make really great Thai food! LoS is completely on an entirely different level. For example, take the classic, drunken noodles. At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says "this is drunken noodles." At LoS, it still says  "this is drunken noodles", but it\'s totally different from every one I\'ve ever had in my life. And, I mean different in a totally amazing, uniquely personal, life changing sort-of-way... That goes for EVERY dish on the menu. Also, if you haven\'t had the crispy prawns, do try them, quite possibly the best thing I\'ve eaten this year (them prawn shells..)\n\nWhenever I eat at a restaurant, I always come in with an open mind regardless of what others have experienced, positive or negative. This restaurant isn\'t just one of the best restaurants in Vegas or the entire country, this is a world class restaurant. This restaurant will continue to rack up the accolades, and deservedly so. Well done Lotus of Siam.. Well done!'

Tiny portions at a Thai place that looks like a hole in the wall.  I mean, the prices looked fair enough on the menu, and the decor reminded me of most Thai places I've frequented in LA, but the portions were more in line with upscale, overpriced restaurants you find in LA.  I was like, where's the rest of the food?  And it's not like we even had to wait as we made a reservation ahead of schedule and were seated immediately, so my dining experience should've been more positive, right?\nOn a positive note, as I mentioned before, the food was good and the service for the most part is quite good.

S'Oh. My. God. This would actually make me consider moving to Las Vegas.\n\nThe girls and I went to Vegas (from LA) for a girls weekend and we wanted, no needed, Thai food. Hangovers you see. So, some Tom Kha Kai was not an option but a necessity. We asked the conceirge at our hotel where some good Thai places were and once he found out we had a car he told us to go here and I am now going to call The Rio to tell them that guys needs a raise! The guy said it was perhaps "the best Thai food in the country" and I sort of chuckled to myself because I KNOW the best Thai is in Norwalk at Renu Nekorn. What did he know? Ha!\n\nWhen we got there I was ready to start talking sh#t because it was in some funky strip mall in BFE. But then I thought to myself, all the great local spots are in funky strip malls. So I wedged my way through the horde of people in the waiting area and saw the walls plastered with reviews from just about every news source you can think of. Thought it was a decent sign so I made our reservation and decided to wait the 25 minutes for a table.\n\nAs I stood by the wall my friend says to me, "hey didn\'t you guys live in Norwalk? This says the chef is from Norwalk." To my pleasant surprise the chef is the SAME EXACT chef from Renu Nekorn! How\'s that for a kick in the pants! Apparently he had enough of So Cal and moved to Vegas like every other person in the 702. I was even more excited to see that most of the items on the menu were identical to the menu from the Norwalk location. Happy day!\n\nI can\'t even tell you what I ordered because I was in a food coma from start to finish. I left full, buzzed, and happy with money left in my pocket which is more than I can say for my departure from the rest of Vegas.\n\nThey also do take out so you can pre-order and get it to go. If you\'re staying on the strip there were plenty of cabs waiting outside to take people anywhere they wanted to go so don\'t fret if you want to venture out sans self-transportation. However you decide to get there - just go. Now.  I will absolutely go back the next time I\'m in Vegas but this time I will do it with a reservation.'

S"Hmmm where is this at again? Commercial Cntr on Sahara? Isn't that location kinda sketchy? But I'm glad she was persistent and got me to go because it was one of the best hidden treasure this part of Vegas I did not know about at all. I wouldn't say hidden because this place was packed and very popular with the locals and I, being a native of Cali, this place was a good find.\n\nI'm not familiar with Thai food at all so I had to yelp it to see what people craved here. Only thing I knew on the menu was pad tai noodles.  Nam Kai Tod was a good appetizer to begin with. Some sort of sweet crispy brown rice. You have to try this if you have not before.  My partner in crime ordered the glass noodle salad which had a very lime taste to it.  I love sour food and the flavor was just perfect.  It's not an appetizer but it might as well be because even an anorexic can't get full from the amount of glass noodles that was served.  Best to order one for yourself instead of having to share it just as I and my friend did.  Next on the line was the drunken seafood noodle. I'm not very good in describing flavors but I'm just here to tell you this was freaking delicious. It gave many options of flavors in one plate, from shrimp to muscles and the noodles in it.  And the last was the dessert! Damn I've never had one this good. Coconut ice cream on sticky sweet rice. One word to describe this is, can I have some more!? Alright it wasn't one word but you know what i mean.\n\nThe only sour taste that came out from this was I had to pay for her too. Wtf, she's my ex, haven't the rules changed? I ain't gotta pay for you no more, but I hate looking like cheap boyfriend in front of the server because we look like we're on a date.  \n\nDefinitely give this place a try, especially if you're an out of towner because this place has won many food critics and awards."

S"We went to this Thai restaurant in the middle of nowhere just because of the yelp reviews. The place looked so rundown and was situated in a dilapidated strip mall. But when we went inside, it was bustling with people which was a big deal since it was the Christmas Day. The spicy Thai fried rice I had and the curry which my husband had we're both very tasty."

S"Seriously? How have I never written a review for Lotus?\n\nThis is, without question, my absolute favorite restaurant in the world. If I'm ever on death row, this is my last meal. If I ever moved away from Vegas, Lotus is probably what i would miss the most. I have been eating there about twice a month for the five years I've been living in Vegas. On her third or fourth nomination, chef Saipin Chutima won the James Beard Award this year - but the secret has long been out about this amazing, otherworldly culinary experience 3/4 of a mile and worlds away from the Strip.\n\nAlmost everything I have ever eaten here is absolutely fantastic, and for spice junkies like myself it's a legitimate challenge. They operate on a 1-10 scale, but there's actually a spice level 15. I don't recommend it. But if you like some serious heat to your food, a 10 will kick your ass. The 15 is just unnecessary.\n\nAs for the dishes, almost all that I've ever had are fantastic. Here are my recommendations from the gargantuan, 150+ item menu:\n\n11. Garlic Pepper Chicken Wings. These are bursting with flavor from the fried garlic and the green onions that practically drip off the crispy wings. I'm not really much of a wing person but I can go to town on these.\n\n13. Nua Dad Deaw. This Issan style beef jerky is, in flavor and texture, completely different than any jerky you've ever had.\n\n14. Nam Kao Tod. The BEST DISH EVER, and I mean ever. I order this every single time I go. It's a sour sausage salad over crispy rice with a complex and vibrant flavor profile that includes the always distinct and recognizable tastes of green and red onions, peanuts, ginger, mint, cilantro, lime, basil and chili. Seriously, I've never seen this offered anywhere else and it's unlike any other food on earth. You've never seen so many flavors, colors and textures all in the same dish.\n\n55. Nua Nam Tok. Charbroiled beef on a flavorful and tangy mix of lime, rice powder and green onion.\n\n59. Koi Soy. This Issan style steak tartare is unbelievably good. The rice powder makes for an incredible texture contrast with the beef, and the lime and chili mix almost cooks the beef the way that the citric acid in a ceviche cooks the fish. This one gets really intense when you turn the spice level up on it.\n\n66. Issan Sausage. Let me tell you a little story about their Issan sausage, cured for weeks in-house with a mixture of pork, wine, garlic and spices. They ran out of it for a period of a few weeks a few summers back, and they were the longest weeks of my life. I craved it like a crack baby. It's a dry, sour sausage that's paired with ginger, peanuts, fresh chilis and red onions. This is probably about my 2nd most common entree order. Be sure to get some rice to mix it with, and wrap it up in a cabbage leaf. That's how it's eaten when served off street carts in Thailand.\n\n72. Mint and Green Chili. Heat of spice countered by cool mint. I daydream about this sometimes.\n\n79. Pepper Garlic Sauce. Emphasis on the garlic. Lots of green onions on this one too, that combination seems to work well.\n\n102. Pad Thai. I've never had a better version of this dish, which all too often tastes too much of tamarind. But this is a subtle blend of the dish's strong flavors. Never had better.\n\n107. Kai Koowah. Like a more flavorful, less salty chow fun.\n\n121. Spicy Fried Rice. I feel like a gringo because I order the spicy fried rice more than any other entree. But it is simply a flavorful delivery system for some of the most intensely flavorful but not overwhelming heat in the whole desert. (I always order this level 10 spicy. I don't F around.) The garlic, basil, and fresh chilis add a bolt of lightning to a savory bowl of fried rice. Again, the best of its kind.\n\nH. Nam Prik Noom. This green chili dip is the perfect choice for when you just want something light.\n\nThose are my go-tos on the Lotus menu, depending on my mood. There's a couple other things that need to be said about Lotus.\n\nThe wine list is mind-boggling and affordable. It's a special treat for lovers of German and Austrian Rieslings.\n\nThe lunch buffet should be skipped. If you get it, you're missing out on most of the things that make Lotus such a special dining destination. Although I would be lying if I said I had never had the lunch buffet and piled on plate after plate after plate of garlic chicken wings and the world's best pad thai. But I'm there twice a month or more, that's a luxury I have that most Lotus visitors don't.\n\nIf you only eat one meal in Vegas, make this it."

They have huge selection of wines so, all you wine lovers definitely check it out. It is inside a glass case where you can see each wine. I ordered pineapple fried rice and Thai tea. The tea was amazing. It's definitely better than Archi's. The fried rice was quite dry. I don't think I'll order it again. The good news is that the shrimp in my fried rice didn't smell fishy. Overall, the service was great and I would go back even as a local. I doubt that I'll go during the weekends because of the long wait. I wish they took reservations or at least call aheads."

S'Everyone who frequents restaurants has what I like to call a "benchmark" dish.  At an Italian spot it might be Pizza Margherita or Veal Parmigiana, For French food it might be Moules Frites or the Torchon of Foie Gras.  It\'s the dish that, if prepared properly, signals that the cuisine is up to par.  When trying to ascertain whether the full range of offerings is worth exploring it must first be determined that the kitchen can get the basics right.\n\nMy benchmark dish for any Thai restaurant is Tom Kha Kai, a magical combination of chicken, chicken broth, coconut cream, galanga, fish sauce, mushrooms, lime juice, and chili oil.  Ingredients may vary from spot to spot, as they often will, but the overall composition is pretty consistent.  The rub, as I have experienced it, is in getting the balance right.  Some places have too much coconut cream, others offer just a hint of chili oil (or omit it completely.)  I\'ve had it with all kinds of mushrooms, and sometimes with huge chunks of galanga, and sometimes with none at all.  For one as obsessed as I, it grows a little tiresome.\n\nI have had Tom Kha Kai at countless restaurants in the Southland, and am still looking for one that is as perfectly put together as what they serve at Lotus of Siam, the celebrated industrial park oddity way off the strip in Las Vegas.  Everything is in perfect balance and when I that first spoonful slides down my gullet I almost tear up a little.  Seriously.  It\'s just that feeling one encounters when something is SO right.. there\'s a magic to it.\n\nThe rest of the menu can be a little hit-or-miss, as others have noted.  But there is so much on the menu that is off-the-charts terrific that it hardly seems to merit de-starring.\n\nSo five stars for the crispy duck with spicy mint leaves.  Five stars for the Nam Kao Todd, crispy rice with minced sour sausage.  Five stars for the spicy beef salad.  So what if the Panag curry is a little lifeless?  There is certainly no shortage of items on this menu that make my head spin with delight.\n\nAnd no, the decor is nothing to write home about.  I couldn\'t care less because the service is always so friendly and accommodating.  My blinders go on at Lotus and when I have an array of tasty treats in front of me I can\'t even SEE the decor.  Love really is blind, I guess.\n\nAnd eleventy-billion stars for the wine list.  Jeez LOUISE the wine list.  Nothing, NOTHING goes better with spicy Thai cuisine than a cold bottle of Reisling and Lotus of Siam has scads of them.  Rare and highly rated selections at rock-bottom prices.  Donhoff.  J.J. Prum.  Zind-Humbrecht.  All the heavy hitters are represented, and there are plenty of Goldkapsels at near-release prices. Achtung! A perfect match for every dish can be found here along with a staff that can guide you through the polysyllabic minefield that one encounters with all things Germanic.\n\nStay away from the buffet.  Make a point of ordering some Northern dishes.  ABSOLUTELY order a bowl of the Tom Kha.  When visiting at night be sure to make a reservation and DEFINITELY arrange with your cab driver to pick you up after your meal because the parking lot gets a little bit sketchy after dark.  But for me, no trip to Vegas is complete without a visit to Lotus.  It\'s a can\'t-miss.'

S"What a little gem off the strip!! One of the best Thai food I've, even better than most in the Bay Area. It's also where a lot of the celebrities goes.\n\nHere's what we had:\nGarlic  shrimp  - omg, it is really really good and a must try. A little expensive $21.95 but so worth it to try. The shrimp is taken out of the shell but they include the shell as part of your dish. They cook the shrimp shell to a perfect crisp, almost like eating a chip. \n\nKhai Soi - $8.95 - also very good. It's noodles in a curry sauce, almost like a soup \n\nTom Kah Kai - $4.95 cup - the best darn soup ever!!! It's very similar to tom yum soup but with coconut milk and a little spicier too. Mouth watering goodness and def. a must order!\n\nDeep Fried Sea Bass - $28.95 - very good but in my opinion, pretty small for the price. It's deep fried in some kind of a chili sauce.\n\nI highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back. The service was great, atmosphere was great, and the food....yum, FANTASTIC!"

S'Wow! This has got to be one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to! And this is coming from a girl who has been to the "good Thai places" in Hollywood aka Thai-town. I have to say at first I was skeptical because the exterior looked like the run down part of downtown LV but all that changes once you step inside the restaurant...what Thai restaurant has a glass wine cellar? The wait (good sign) was about 30 min: long enuff for us to look over the menu to decide what we wanted to try. When we saw what was brought out to other tables, the food looked so good that we had to change what we were going to order to what we saw! We were definitely getting more excited as the time drew nearer...\nI know that at Asian restaurants, a bunch of white people is usually not a good sign because that means that the food might not be authentic and made "Americanized". It was a packed house with about 50% white folks.. Got me a lil worried, but boy this time, the white folks must\'ve known something the Asian population wasn\'t aware of... Rundown of our dishes:\n1) Tom Kum kah: coconut soup. Was ok. Nothing special.\n2) Garlic prawns: highlight of the evening. The seasoning was the perfect balance of salt, garlic, and pepper. The exact seasoning you would expect if you order Chinese style stir fried garlic crabs. The most surprising part of the dish was how it was prepared: with the prawn shelled but with the shell semi- attached at the tail. First, you eat the perfectly seasoned prawn. Then, you got to enjoy the bonus: the crispy prawn shell. Biting into the shell was like biting into a crispier version of chicharron ( crispy pig skin). I have never seen prawn prepared this way. WHY hasn\'t any other chef/ restaurant ever thought of that?!!! Lotus of Siam, thank you for this ingenious foresight......\n\n3) crispy duck in panang curry: we had originally planned to order the crispy duck with Chili n mint leaves, but our waiter suggested we order this version since we already had a similarly flavored dish. What great knowledge of the staff to provide helpful tips! He was dead on to make this suggestion. My friend krystal kept raving about the sauce. I think if she was not in public, she may have licked the plate!! LoL!!!\n\n4) drunken noodle with sea bass: at first we contemplated ordering this dish.. It was the most expensive thing we ordered at $30, but we were sold when a patron leaving the restaurant overheard our discussion and urged us to order it saying it was "the reason why we come here". With a reference put that way, we needed no further convincing! The sea bass was extremely fresh n flaky. The drunken noodles were perfectly wok\'d: you could taste the "fire" of the wok. A sign that the wok has been well seasoned and the chef knows how to use that to intensify the foods being cooked in it. Awesome dish!\n\nAlas, we were too full to order dessert but the fried bananas with ice cream looked so good that we\'ll have to come back next time to try it. Oh YES, there will definitely be a NEXT time.. :)\n\nTotal for our party of 4: $103. Not bad at all.. I\'d come here any day over a buffet!!'

Thank goodness for reservations!\nWhen you first arrive it is located on a strip mall and very easy to find. We entered and the place looked kind of small I thought, then while we had to wait for table thought I would go to the bar and have a drink to wait. The place another dining section. While passing through they had a wine room I thought wow! \nHad a drink and looked at the table to see what other diners were eating and the smell of the dishes were making my mouth watery. I was thinking may not be bad at all to try Thai!\nWe sat down and ordered:\nGreen chicken curry= very good\nStuffed chicken wings= very good ( by the way the kids took it down to the bone)\nShrimp Thai salad= awesome \nSome kind of fish( was flaky and a little kick of spice) that was very good\nLobster ( almost like Cantonese style but different seasoning) that was good\nI have to say I had a bad experience long time ago in a Thai restaurant and never tried again but coming here and giving it a shot, wow! I am a fan now of Thai, hope when I get back Jersey I can find a place like this. Love the fish sauce and Thai pepper condiment if you like spice that is it."

S"You know, Lotus of Siam seems like one of those great things that they just happen to forget when they were writing the Bible. I came recently and I must say, I'm LOVING the remodeling. It's so bright and spacious now. But don't let the extra space fool you because you will still need a reservation to escape the extremely long wait. \n\n1st place winner: Garlic Prawns: I'm not sure exactly what it's called, but this place is famous for it apparently. What they do is that they have these prawns dipped in a light, garlic tempura sauce and then deep fried. Okay, one: it's deep fried, and two it's garlic with prawns. What could possibly go wrong? It's SUPER delicious! Like the shells from the prawns cracks off the meat and becomes super crispy. I personally think the crispy skins are the best part of it because it just has this awesome crunch and then you have this huge explosion of flavor in your mouth... (I just realized how wrong that last part sounds... oh well!) \n2nd Place: the Shrimp Pad Thai: I was really surprised about the execution of the Pad thai. Unlike most Thai restaurants, they use a thinner and skinnier noodle which actually absorbs the peanut sauce a lot better because of the greater surface area AND it's chewey which deserves my love and affection.\n3rd Place: all other food items. I can't really go into depth on what else you should order here because I'm already drooling enough as is after explaining the prawns.... hehe\n\nThe price is right and it won't leave your wallet crippled, which is excellent because everything else in Vegas is supperrrr expensive! If you want a breather from the strip and delicious food, come here and murder your diet. It is sin city after all. :)"

S'The wait at this "hole in the wall" (if you can call it that) is crazy.  I don\'t know why I thought that you can\'t make reservations, but the other ppl around me in line thought the same thing...well, at least misery had company.  A lot of it.  We were there 15min after it opened, but had over an hour wait for a table of two.  It was a real test of will power that we stayed since we had not eaten a meal today and had hiked through the Valley of Fire.  So by the time we sat down, we were ready to order.  Luckily, things came out within 10min of ordering.  Actually, we were sat in view of the kitchen and got to see Saipan herself run the kitchen.  She really does everything...she ran my container of sticky rice out.  I thought it refreshing that she didn\'t feel herself too important for such a menial task.  I ordered mostly Northern Thai cuisine:  nam prik noom (spicy green chili veggie dip to be eaten with fresh veggies, pork rind, and my favorite, sticky rice), koi soi (thai beef tartare), a catfish dish, and (don\'t think this is issan) drunken noodle with soft crab.  Everything was good.  Thai food is known for is cacophony of seemingly unmatched flavors that come together harmoniously in the final dish.  It\'s an experience for your mouth.  We\'ve been to the Northern area of Thailand, and it\'s very authenti...not that we need to tell you guys that.  Though my husband thought everything was just ok until we got to the final dish:  Pad Thai.  I know, right?  We\'re at a Northern Thai restaurant, and we order Pad Thai.  I read that it was good, and I wanted to compare this dish to others I\'ve had.  Though I disagree with husband on this one, he said that he\'d come back just for this dish.  I\'m not against that at all since there was a jackfruit dish I\'m still quite curious about.  (There were a lot of foods we didn\'t get to try on our trip.)  Though next time, we\'ll either call to make reservations, or just get takeout.'

S'3.5 Stars\n\nI was really looking forward to this place and had high expectations especially when Mr. Gold says this is the "Best Thai food in North America." We came on a Friday around 6:30 and were seated right away without reservations. I was really happy because the last time I tried coming here the place was packed.\n\nAfter reading some of the review highlights here\'s what we ordered:\n\nTom Yum Kai (with coconut milk) - very simple soup with basil, mushrooms and chicken, but the soup was delicious. I can taste the lemongrass and coconut milk and it was just a little spicy.\n\nNam Kao Tod (Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice) - Very interesting dish, I think it was a little to sour for me and not just from the sausage but it was nice to try something I\'ve never had before.\n\nBeef saut\xc3\xa9ed in a garlic cilantro pepper sauce, served on bed of green - beef slices were tender and I loved the sauce, this was my favorite dish but I wish they put more beef in it.\n\nKhao Soi (Burmese influence on Northern Thai egg noodle  with beef in a curry sauce and coconut cream) - I love Northern Thai food (Spicy BBQ in LA) and was happy to see a Northern Thai section. The beef was very juicy, a different cut from the garlic beef. This dish was a little more spicy but I loved it. After eating all the noodles we added the rice to mix with the curry sauce. Don\'t forget to use the limes, it made the dish better. This dish was my 2nd favorite.\n\nDrunken Noodle Seafood - this was ok, they did put in a lot of seafood but it wasn\'t mind blowing.\n\nDessert: A sample of Mango Sticky Rice, Fried Banana, and Coconut Ice Cream - I think this was the best sticky rice I\'ve had! The coconut ice cream was very refreshing with small chunks of coconut. The fried bananas were good too, not too sweet.\n\nIncluding 2 beers and 2 Thai ice teas, tax and tip the bill was slightly over $100, I thought that was pretty pricey for Thai food. Especially when some of the dishes had smaller portions. However service was good and they were very friendly to us. I probably wouldn\'t have ordered the Drunken Noodles and tried another Northern Thai dish. \n\nI\'d come back if I\'m in the mood for Thai food on my next Vegas trip.'

S"Yum!  As I have stated in prior reviews, I am NOT a Thai food professional!  Don't get me wrong, I like Thai food more than I should and I have been on a kick the past few months, but I rarely varie from Pad Thai or Curry.  That said, I was EXTREMELY tempted to wonder off my path and attempt a new item or two (but didn't due to a long road trip home and I did NOT want to chance something not sitting right - if you know what I mean).  \n\nThey did screw our order up (wifes curry WAY too spicy for her and my Pad Thai not nearly spicy enough).  We just swapped plates and enjoyed each others meals (no complaints from me, I really like spicy curry).\n\nThe food is good, staff is helpful and friendly.  The restaurant is not the nicest I have been in (you can tell from the outside you will not be experiencing fine dinning) - but again, I am not really complaining.  The place is clean, just older.\n\nMy wife and I enjoyed looking at pictures of all the famous people who have enjoyed a meal or two here and even though the place was packed, we got a table quickly and our food came out fast.\n\nOverall it was a great experience and next time I am in Vegas I will try something new at Lotus of Siam!"

S"This place get cracking! Its in a rough spot of town but don't let it scare ya! I've on a Thai kick lately. They recommend you to make a reservation here but unfortunately I did not make one. But I wanted to try their Larb dish. Been craving it lately ha. So right when i enter I was greeted. I ordered my food to go. I got the Larb/Pork. I was told it'll be ready about 15 minutes. I waited near the entrance and my food came. I could smell it already and can't wait to eat it. It was so good, very flavorful, the spice was right where I like it to be level 4. It was comes with cucumbers and cabbage to eat with. You can eat this with rice. I definitely will be making a reservation back."

S'Great food, but not amazing thai food.  Still, I would recommend this to people who are looking to get away from the chains, buffets, and mostly americanized food on the strip.  It\'s nearby and pretty good.  It seems more authentic than most other places and has a wide variety of Thai dishes.  \n\nNam Kao Tod: slightly sour, which is a little weird at first, but overall I really liked this dish.  Yumm crispy rice.  \n\nmusaman curry - To be honest the curry was a little thin and the flavor wasn\'t as deep and rich with spice as this place in Houston I love.  Ever since I ate the "masamun curry" there, that\'s the benchmark I place other curries at.  Lotus\' curry was just so so.  However, the beef was great!  Super tender.  \n\nDrunken noodles - Really tasty.  I would recommend this dish.  we got it with seafood, but there\'s a whole bunch of other variations you can get the noodles with.  \n\nI think the last thing we got was the red curry, but I\'m not sure - I liked it better than the musaman curry, richer flavoring.  Decent choice.  \n\nService: really good for an Asian restaurant in a sketchy looking stripmall.  The restaurant\'s a bit fancier than most asian places you go to, and the waitstaff is very polite and attentive.'

S"We've been eating at LOS for years and have been there so many times that luckily we've managed to order most of the menu. However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.\n\nOn a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalape\xc3\xb1o will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing! \n\nApps..\n\n#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalape\xc3\xb1o and sticky rice. \n\n#13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. \n\n#14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.\n\nSalads..\n\n#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. \n\n#59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.\n\nEntrees..\n\nA. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. \n\nK. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. \n\nDrunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors. \n\nGarlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us. \n\nDessert.. \n\nWe're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).\n\nAt some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us. \n\nBon appetite!"

S'My wife and I thought this place was great. We came with no reservations, and the hostess took our phone number so we could either go to the bar or leave during the 45 min wait. We walked around the "Around the World" strip mall and eventually got our call. (We call it that because you have Thai, Korean, American and Mexican themed restaurants and businesses all in one place). \n\nThe waiter was probably what really made this place special. He had a great grasp on the extensive wine list (We ordered a bottle, and he confirmed to see if we knew what it was we were ordering...we did, but nice that he checked) and gave great recommendations so we could share dishes and have everything still pair nicely with the German Riesling. My wife had the Panang Curry (at an 8 spicy level, which she said was perfect) with noodles and I had the crispy duck with chili mint leaves. The noodles made for a messy meal, because the curry splashed around as my wife and I ate the noodles. The crispy duck was something I\'ve been craving ever since, and may be in one of my top 5 meals ever.\n\nThe food came quickly, and our waiter was always nearby if we needed anything. He also came and brought a bucket of ice for our wine - something unexpected at a Thai restaurant. When I ordered the mango with sweet sticky rice (a staple at most Thai places), I was pleased when he advised against it due to the mangoes not being fully ripe.\n\nWill definitely be eating here again. And again......and again.'

S"Considering that Gourmet magazine said it was the best Thai restaurant in North America, AND that Frommers highly recommended it, I expected a lot more. My boyfriend and I both had the wonton soup (excellent) and the chicken with cashew nuts. Personally, I've had much better at other Thai restaurants. \n\nIt's a run-down little place, but obviously plenty of people know about it. Autographed pictures with celebrities adorn the walls. Service is okay, but nothing exceptional. It was often hard to track down our server."

S"I have had a lot of Thai food in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas and I have to say that Lotus Siam is the best I've ever had.  The food here is worth the visit to a part of Vegas I would otherwise go to.  If you are a fan of Thai food, this place is a must visit.  What makes this place special is the subtleness of the flavors.  Thai places often overwhelm - but here, the flavors are amazing without being overwhelming.\n\nMy favorite dish of the dinner was the Drunken Noodles with Crispy Duck.  We also had the Tom Yum Kai Soup, Spicy Thai Beef Salad, a Yellow Chicken Curry, and the Nam Prik Ong.  I would recommend all of the dishes we had - particularly the Nam Prik Ong.  Thank you to everyone on Yelp who recommended this dish!  This place is also a great value.  Great food + great value = five stars in my book!"

S"We came here for lunch buffet and dinner.  Lunch buffet was a bargain but didn't have too much variety.  The curry chicken was tasty.  Dinner was a bit of a letdown considering how high our expectations were.  The common thread to the dishes we had was that they were super thai spicy even though we asked for medium.  When we were in thailand, some food was spicy but theirs was certainly way more.  Water and rice couldn't help.  I wonder if that's their trick.  To get your taste buds so numb that you can't taste anything.  Overall, it was good but not as good as Sripraphai in NYC.  Sripraphai may have less heat but is full on flavor."

S'What can I say that my buddy Jay F didn\'t say in his review about this spot? \n\nWell, I was in town visiting from San Francisco over Memorial Day weekend, and Jay knew I\'m a bit of a foodie, so he mentioned Lotus of Siam early in the trip as a "must go" place to dine. We finally went the last night I was in town, and I was seriously blown away at how amazing the food was. And for the price, you honestly cannot beat it! \n\nI would be remiss without also mentioning their rather extensive and nicely executed wine list. Coming form the Bay Area, that is a must, and LoS did not disappoint. \n\nIn short...for details, read Jay F\'s review - otherwise, trust me when I say, GO TO LOTUS OF SIAM - you will thank me for it...at least until you\'re finding yourself craving it and being 1000 miles away...\n\nLike Arnie Schwarzenegger once said...."I\'ll be back!"'

S"Finally able to make it to Lotus of Siam to try the food. I made reservations for 3 people on a Saturday night at 8pm (took a few tries because the line was busy). We took a taxi from the Strip. We ordered our food medium hot and though everything was delicious, one dish was a disappointment.\n\nTom Kah Kai - The menu description listed straw mushrooms, we were disappointed when the soup arrived with regular button mushrooms. The chicken in the soup was dry from being in the soup too long. Minus one star.\n\nThum kah noon (pounded young jackfruit shredded) - We have never had jackfruit before. So this was a new dish for us. The meat was delicious with the rice. It would have made an awesome sloppy joe filling.\n\nNua Yum Katiem - Hidden spiciness in the cabbage in this dish. Mouth was burning, but we polished off the dish.\n\nSea Bass on Drunken Noodle - Delicious! The sea bass was deep fried and had great flavor.\n\nThe restaurant called a taxi after we finished dinner. A word of warning,  the location is off Strip, so it was impossible to get a taxi. We waited over 45 minutes for a taxi around 9:30pm. Minus one star. There were 3 other parties waiting outside for a taxi after us. We asked the restaurant to call again, and waited but still no taxis came (weekend of EDC). After watching cars cruise by slowly and contemplating hitching a ride with restaurant patrons, we decided to walk to the Stratosphere to catch a taxi back to our hotel and got to saw the real Vegas. Unfortunately/fortunately, it was super windy in Vegas with 30mph winds. This meant walking back in a sandstorm, but the wind kept us reasonably cool and the streets deserted. We were easily able to catch a taxi at the Stratosphere, and saw a long line of idling taxis there. \n\nI will probably go back again, but only if I have a car. I don't want to be risk being stranded again."

S'BUZZ\n- Garlic Prawns (4/10)\n- Drunken Noodles\n\nI ALSO TRIED\n- Tom Kha Kai w Chicken (5/10)\n- Penang Curry w Beef (4/10)\n\nFirst off, I haven\'t written a review in a really long time! I love the fact that I travel a decent amount for work, so I get to try a lot of new places and write reviews. Ironically, it\'s because of that travel that I haven\'t been able to write any reviews lately. I\'ve had so many jam-packed 1-day travels that, I might check in to a hotel on Yelp, but I\'ll knock out about 20 seconds after, then wake up, shower, and leave - all while still kinda sleeping. Even meals have been rushed. The business dinners might be in nice restaurants, but we\'re having such fierce conversations about work, that the food might as well have just teleported into our stomachs without ever being tasted.\n\nOK, now that that\'s out of the way, a little history. Pad Thai used to be what I thought Thai food was. Yes, I know that it IS Thai food, but I mean I thought that was all Thai food was! In 2007, I had Lotus of Siam and we ordered all sort of things and it was amazing. Since then, I discovered more facets of Thai food, namely Tom Kha and Penang Curry. Ever since I tried those, I\'ve been dying to try them at Lotus, because this is touted by some as the best Thai restaurant on the planet!\n\nTOM KHA KAI\nServer asked how spicy I wanted it, and then said "on a scale of 1-10." I was taken aback, because that\'s a really wide range! Even though I normally order "Extra Spicy" at other Thai places, the numbers intimidated me a bit, so I just said 8.\n\nIt tasted fine, but it didn\'t have anything in there that would make it taste great. No landmines, so that\'s good. The chicken was seasoned enough, but dry. The Tom Kha (and maybe this is just the style) was missing the tiny bit of sweetness that I\'ve come to like and expect. As for spice, the first spoonful, I thought I got duped, but then after about 3 more spoons, the heat started to rise! Not enough for me to grab water, but enough where taking bites of the hot garlic prawns were painful on the tongue. It really seemed like that if you just had the soup, the 8 would actually be like a 6, but I think the higher the number, the more pepper bits are in the soup, so you just have a higher chance of picking one up, and those peppers themselves pack a punch!\n\nPENANG CURRY\nSigh. It\'s missing that almost nutty flavor that I\'ve come to like, and it was a little too ginger-y/lemongrassy than I like. Consistency was about as much as condensed milk, and a spice level of 8, tasted more like a 4. The beef didn\'t really lend any helpful flavors, but hey, at least it was protein! Not the worst I\'ve ever had, but I\'m just really disappointed, considering how many people have this as their favorite Thai restaurant. Then again, it could just be different styles, which I admittedly don\'t know much about.\n\nGARLIC PRAWNS\nI remember when I was little, a friend of mine used to eat the shrimp tail. I was mesmerized! I had never even tried it before. So, I fearlessly started trying to eat the tail, and I was almost to the point of gagging. Fast forward 25 years and here I am at Lotus of Siam. \n\nThe shrimp comes out looking like the letter w. The left "u" is the shrimp, the right "u" is the shell of the shrimp, both still connected at the tail. The whole thing has been seasoned and deep fried. Now, I\'ve had Japanese sweet shrimp before, where they fry the heads, and it was better than eating that shrimp tail many years ago, but I couldn\'t eat more than 1. These were definitely better, but it took a lot of mental psyching and determination to eat several. \n\nThe shrimp is good. The shell is actually pretty tasty. Out of all the fried shrimp shell I\'ve had, this was the best. It was more crunchy/crispy than any other one I\'ve had by far. And it had a buttery flavor to it that helped take my mind off of the shell. For me, if I took a bite of shrimp and a bite of shell, that was a tumultuous bite, and I had to fight the urge to spit it out. The trick was to eat the shell by itself, like it was one big shrimp chip. The other thing was to keep my mouth dry. Once I took the bite, I had to keep saliva away (sorry to get so technical here) and definitely resist the urge to "wash it down." When the shell was dry and crispy, it shattered easier, which meant that it ground down finely so it was easy to swallow...like a chip. As soon as moisture was introduced, the shell no longer wanted to shatter, instead it would just flex, which meant that when you swallowed, it was that rough shell-like texture that made me want to gag. \n\nSo all in all, happy I tried it, but perfectly fine with never trying it again.\n\nLOTUS OF DISAPPOINTMENT\nI can\'t tell you how disappointed I was with the curry and soup. I\'ve been waiting at least 4 years to have an opportunity to come to Vegas to try these dishes, and it didn\'t deliver. It\'s not to say this place isn\'t good. I have had great meals here, but they\'re not good at my fav.dishs'

S"After hearing raves about this place from Food Network shows, I had to stop by during my Vegas visit. \n\nWe ordered the Crispy Duck Panang, Nam Prik Ong and Combination Fried Rice. The portions aren't as huge as you're probably used to from other Thai places, but that was enough to fill two people up. \n\nThe Crispy Duck Panang was the clear highlight of the meal -- tender duck, crisp skin, spicy & creamy panang sauce. On their 1-10 spicy level, we got a 6 and it had a perfect amount of spice to it. Definitely don't discard the basil garnish -- mix it in with the sauce, eat it with your rice. Yum! It comes with a small pot of sticky rice, so you don't really need to order extra rice, but I'm a fan of Thai fried rice, so we got the combination too.\n\nThe Combination Fried Rice was good -- not any better than other Thai fried rices I've had. The chicken wasn't particularly moist or tender, and it only came with 2 shrimps. I would probably stick to just beef fried rice or shrimp fried rice, since the chicken didn't really add anything to the dish.\n\nThe Nam Prik Ong was what I really came here for -- I'd heard Ming Tsai raving about it on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate -- and honestly, I was underwhelmed. Not sure if they were just having an off-batch, but it wasn't as complex or flavorful as I expected it to be. I was expecting it to be spicy, with earthy flavors, herbacious Thai basil & cilantro, maybe some lime for acidity. It had a bit of heat to it, but it was pretty one-note. It reminded me more of a tomato-based chili than anything. \n\nAll in all, I can see why people flock to this place. The menu is really huge and the prices aren't too bad (considering you're in Vegas).\n\nThe strip mall it's located in is honestly really sad and run-down looking, but once you're inside, the ambiance isn't bad."

S'Having just returned to Las Vegas for a quick business trip early this week, I had to make a few visits to some of my fave haunts when I lived here. Of course, LoS was high on the list and it didn\'t disappoint!\n\nLoS always gets the following accolades: "gotten the nod from the James Beard Foundation", "the place where all the local chefs come to eat", "one of the best Thai restaurants in North America", blah blah blah. Everyone has said it, heard it and knows it. Whatever. It\'s great and still my gold standard outside of kidnapping my friend\'s Thai mom and having her cook my dishes out of my own kitchen!\n\nA few noteworthy changes if you haven\'t been there in awhile (since March 2010 according to our waiter):\n1. They\'ve expanded into the now defunct Korean restaurant that used to be on the right side of the LoS.\n2. They\'ve remodeled the inside...it\'s no longer the "hole-in-the-wall" greatness it used to be...everything is def. more upscale albeit in the same dive Commerical Center with the Green Door*.\n3. They expanded the old wine "cabinet" into a friggin\' 15\' glass wine cellar centered prominently in the middle of the newly redecorated interior. Way cool!\n4. There\'s a nice new shiny bar on the far right side of the resto - cool.\n5. 2 sets of bathroom now - the older "boys" and "girls" side on the left and now the much nicer and (thank God) larger (multi-stalls) "men" and "women" bathrooms on the left side. No more waiting in the hallways!\n\nA few extra notes/details on the food (this visit):\n1. We ordered four entrees (Pad See Ew, Mee Krob, Tofu Penang Curry and a Northern style curry made with catfish) and 2 apps (Tom Kha Gai and Tod Mun) for 5 people. Plenty of food and everyone finished up the meal for bill of $75 including 4 drinks. Not bad!\n2. Spice level was low for this meal at a "5"  b/c we were catering to a wide range of palates, but as a note you can always request the pepper rack for those that want more. Honestly tho, if you do request the "10"...it\'s spicy greatness and you won\'t be disappointed...but just be aware. I love it at the level. \n3. What I loved the most (generally speaking) was the delicate flavours of the dishes. I didn\'t find any sort of heavy handedness when it came to the flavor profiles - not too sweet, not too gunky (no fillers), etc.\n4. The Penang was incredible and had this beautiful creamy nuttiness to it....you could taste the complexities of flavours in it - a richness from the coconut milk, not too sweet, with hints of the kefir in it. Just a note, if you haven\'t been here...most dishes can be substituted for veggie friendly (i.e., tofu) and they willingly suggest it if you can\'t find something you like.\n5. The Pad See Ew was gorgeous. It had that high heat smoky flavor to it I crave in the dish. Not too sweet and a balanced flavour with the basil leaves - i.e., not overly "basily" as some places make it. So good...you could taste the individual ingredients in the dish!\n6. I wasn\'t a fan of the Mee Krob, but it was tasty and well done. It\'s just not my favorite dish for Thai cuisine.\n7. The Tod Mun is done the way I like it. Thin patties that are just luscious and perfectly seasoned/fried and complemented with the cucumber dressing. The crispness of the cabbage and the cucumbers provides the perfect textural complement to the home made fish patties with bits of green onions throughout.\n8. The Tom Kha Gai had that nice bit of sourness and just enough heat to start off the meal properly. A very flavourful broth with the bits of lemon grass and galangal throughout.\n9. The unique and different item was the northern Thai style curry - it was very broth-like but good. Almost reminiscent of the Thom Kha Gai, but no lemongrass in it. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, but found it more mild in taste and the flavours were *VERY* subtle and refined. So, if you\'re expecting bold typical Thai flavours...be warned and you might want to pass on this dish. Otherwise, it\'s a nice change from the usual typical dishes one can order.\n\nA few notes on service:\nExcellent as always. Not too invasive, yet not too rushed. We had a leisurely dinner therefor several hours - even after finishing our meal, we sat and continued talking and never once felt like we were being rushed out. They even came by and refilled out drinks while we talked!\n\nIf you haven\'t figured this out...yeah, I love and miss this place a lot. Living on the east coast now really highlights how different and how much better the Thai food is out west. Eitherway, if you\'re visiting or you already live in Las Vegas, LoS is a helluva good joint! You won\'t be disappointed. Now, only if they would Fedex their food.....\n\n*If you have to ask...you don\'t want to know.'

S'I was really tossed up between a four and five star rating but the food just goes above and beyond some of the other little negatives (location from the strip and the overall atmosphere, but both of these are minor). \n\nOn to the food...as authentic as it gets. The crispy duck with drunken noodles was as another reviewer mentioned "life-changing". The flavor profiles that were going on throughout the course of the dish were AMAZING! The skin on the duck was just as good if not a notch better than The Peking Duck in Chinatown, NYC. (That\'s saying ALOT!)\n\nWe split a number of appetizers including the fried wontons, the spring rolls, and my favorite the prawns. A definite must try.\n\nNot overly pricey at all and well worth a little jaunt to a less than desirable part of Las Vegas, but hey that\'s what gives this place it\'s edge.'

S'Some of the best Thai food I have ever had! I am a Vegetarian and have tried all the curries with Tofu, with Panang being my favorite. It was really good and spicy.The only drawback is that there is a long wait and we need to make reservations to get a table in the evening. Many times they are booked already and the minimum wait time is close to 45 mins - 1 hour! Would recommend it definitely though :)'

S"The menu is huge! but the portions small and the price just not ok for Vegas especially for a Thai Restaurant. I guess the taste is OK, Unfortunately had better or I may have just ordered the wrong thing.\n\nDefinitely make reservations. We waited for about an one hour cuz of the people rush from the outlets and you got people going in front you cuz they were smart...also weird from a regular thai restaurant\n\nAlthough they had a big menu it was a difficult to understand or I was just exhausted...but what's funny is that after going here...thai menus are so confusing..for one they actually put names in thai and describe the ingredients to you...but everything is almost the same...\n\nWe ended up ordering four things, pad thai, minced ground chicken salad - i think that's what it was, and the wings...the people i went with didn't want soup so that took out a quarter of the menu. couldn't do the fried rice because we were getting white rice another quarter of the menu. got the pad thai can't do the other quarter of the noodles. There was the fish but it was market price (so expensive). We thought you know its thai big portions we were still hungry! so we asked for the menu again and it took so long for us to look and find we want and we just told the waiter what he recommended. We ended up getting something that was off the menu - chinese brocolli with fried pork and hoisin kind of sauce with garlic. Took forever though but it did the trick!"

S'I don\'t claim to know if this is the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. (the kids these days seem to like Jitlada in Hollywood), but this was a notch above the best places I\'ve been to in the Bay Area. Having failed to make a dinner reservation, we got there around 2pm on a Friday and hurried to place our orders before the kitchen closed. Nam kao tod (crispy rice with minced sausage) had very bright flavour. Chicken wings were fried immaculately. Khao soi noodles had an intense coconut milk sauce. Panang pompano and especially hoh mok catfish were the best Thai fish dishes I\'ve had by some margin. I even thought our veggie friend Dave\'s pad thai was tasty, and I have no love for pad thai.\n\nNext time we\'ll order it spicier: this time we asked for something like "spicy by American standards", apparently Bay Area spice standards are hotter than in most of the U.S. Otherwise, grand.'

The tom yum soup was very flavorful with a nice hint of fried garlic, but even at a spiciness level of 3 out of 10 it had tiny pieces of chopped up peppers that were very spicy if you bit into them.  The fried crispy rice with sausage had such interesting textures and flavors that I never had before, but I really loved it the more I ate it.  However, we didn't have a reservation, and the wait time they quotes us was 30 minutes, but we ended up waiting over an hour to get seated.

S"I had somewhat of mixed expectations of this restaurant as several friends/colleagues have raved about their dishes, namely the garlic prawns (fried version) and the duck panang; and others have not enjoyed it.\n\nMy SO made reservations here for 7:30 PM, which I'm glad we did, because we were seated immediately. There were groups of folks waiting by the door, and I overheard the host tell a party that the wait would be at least an hour and 30. yikes.\n\nAt the servers recommendation, we ordered the Tom Kha soup (he asked how spicy we wanted it on a scale from 1-10). The soup was okay- we ended up mostly pouring it over the white rice.\n\nWe also ordered the fried garlic prawns-- right below this dish on the menu, there is a fried garlic prawns with drunken noodles- and that is not the same thing. The server said they use different seasoning for the prawns. I was disappointed by this dish, as I felt it salty and underwhelming. We ended up eating only a couple pieces.\n\nI was deciding between the poached salmon and sea bass- server highly recommended the sea bass so I ordered it with the ginger sauce. The steamed sea bass was very buttery and so good! I would definitely re-order this dish if I come back.\n\nAlthough I did not enjoy their most popular dish, I would come back to order other dishes and the sea bass. The entrees came out rather quickly (less than 10 minutes) and the service was great."

S'The punchline unfortunately has to be "shockingly disappointing food".\n\nWe walked in without reservation and had a short wait of 25 minutes.\n\nWe began with Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice). The dish was not to my taste, as the sourness of the lime was too overpowering.\n\nNext we had the Tom Kah Kai. This mushroom soup with a coconut milk based broth proved inedible despite our best efforts and was unquestionably the lowlight.\n\nWe ordered drunken noodles with soft shell crab as our first entree. The noodles were passable but soggy, the crab meat was chewy.\n\nOur final selection, the musaman curry with tofu was mediocre, but the highlight nonetheless. It also had an unusual but pleasant sweetness.\n\nThough the food was a disappointment, staff was prompt, friendly, and attentive with wait staff checking in frequently (though not too often).\n\nThe price was also very reasonable for Las Vegas.\n\nOverall, I would recommend dining elsewhere.'

S'What an amazing find but MAKE RESERVATIONS!  \n\nOne review I read somewhere said this was the best Thai food in North America. I\'ve had some excellent Thai food in Chicago and this place was easily one of the top five I have had. Wife and I went here on our last night in Vegas and it was a real treat. We started with a fish cake, Issan style beef jerky, and a crispy rice with sour sausage. The first two were very, very good and the third was OK. The jerky was excellent and not too tough. It had very interesting spices and the sauce gave it a nice kick.\n\nWe decided to go with the Northern Thai menu options since they seemed really unique. I went with Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry) which is described as being "almost sweet". It wasn\'t but it was very spicy. Not quite Thai spicy, but a litle strong. It did not have as much sauce or broth as I was excpecting but it was a nice portion size and was well seasoned besides the spice. Wife went with Khao a Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle served in curry sauce and coconut cream. Waiter recommended beef and it was an excellent dish. For dessert we shared a nice dish of coconut ice cream which was a perfect end to the meal.\n\nWe arrived at 7:30 for our reservation on a Friday and there was consistently between 5 and 10 people waiting for a table. Call ahead an make reservations. It may not look like much from the outside and the mall it\'s in is a little sketchy (multiple \'social rooms\' like the Green Door and other similar places) but this is an excellent and popular restaurant. If you enjoy Thai food, this place is not to be missed. Why only 4 stars? Well, it isn\'t actually the best I\'ve ever had but it is very, very good. There were a few things that didn\'t quite wow me but on balance a great meal that capped off a great vacation.'

Although the food had a nice kick to it the fried rice was way too sweet the chicken salad was a plain stir fried chicken dish.

S"This CANNOT be the best Thai food in America!  I have had far superior Thai food.  Not to say it's bad.  It's just... well, good.  That's what my three star review says.  If this was my neighborhood Thai restaurant, I wouldn't hesitate being a regular.  But I certainly wouldn't fly across the country to come eat here like I would... say, for Arun's in Chicago. \nAfter my first visit here a couple of months ago, I hesitated in writing a not-so stellar review.  I was puzzled at what the other people were tasting that I wasn't.  The other reason why I was reluctant to write one was 'coz I felt it would be an unfair write-up after only trying mostly their Northern Thai dishes.  Yes, we enjoyed the nam kao tod - minced sour sausage appetizer a lot but everything else paled in comparison to what I expected.  The northern larb was far inferior to the regular larb, and the much acclaimed kung ka noon which is a spicy young jack fruit curry was far from yummy - almost a dish that requires an acquired taste.  \n\nI resisted from writing a two star review then... so today, we returned to order a bunch of food that weren't just what other moronic non-Thai- food-eating-'experts' claimed excellent, but ordered what we normally enjoy.  I feel that following food critics reviews on ethnic food may be a little tricky.  But having gone to Thailand a gazilion times since I was 3, went to cooking school there and grew up around the region, I know what Thai food (in the Bangkok area) should taste like.\n\nToday we ordered the vegetarian egg rolls, tod mun plar (fish cakes), and yum woon seng (seafood glass noodle 'salad') for appetizers; crispy mussel omelette, chicken green curry and pad thai for entree.  Yes, two noodle dishes.  I love my noodles :)  My favorite dish at this meal was the mussel omelette.  It was close to what it should taste like and I enjoyed the nice crunch.  This dish is enjoyed both in Thailand and some other parts of South East Asia (though oysters are often used - minus the crispy part).  The green curry, I felt, lack flavor and spice even though we asked for very spicy (7 out of 10 for spice).  DO NOT order the pad thai here.  It is NOT what pad thai should taste nor look like.  We make much better pad thai at home lol!  \n\nIt was a good meal.  I walked out pretty contented with my Thai food craving.  Service was pleasant and friendly as was our first time dining here.   I just couldn't figure out what the lady was saying 80% of the time so I just agreed and smiled :D"

S"Alright, let's talk Thai;  I could eat Thai food everyday, for every meal, I literally cannot get enough of Thai food into my pie hole. And I would gladly move to Thailand in a heartbeat if it weren't the sauna sweatbox of tropical equator hell, where  I'd look like a tool that had taken a shower in my clothes pretty much whenever I walked outside....  not pretty.  So as a consolation, I've been terribly fortunate to have the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. right in my own back yard, (well, ten miles away but whatever) within the first week of moving here, I had my first experience at Lotus of Siam and my world has never been the same since.  \n\nAnd what a surprise that here, in this archaic mish mash of tired trashy tourist sin reeking of cheap vodka and regret, there lies a culinary palace in the most unsavory of places, but a landmark nonetheless, (and ever since it's small cameo on Top Chef, the hoards of tourists have increased tenfold, making wait times to over an hour at peak times).  In a rundown shopping center east of the Strip, Chef Saipin creates some the loveliest, humble yet sophisticated dishes that make up for the lack of ambience.\n\nNow please, please do not be disparaged by the desolate location and crappy shopping center facade; yes, it is dilapidated and no, your car will not get jacked (many a friend have periodically checked to see if their car's still there) no worries, the homeless keep an eye out for ya!  They've even told me I had a brake light out, which deserved a buck...good people, those cracky addicts...\n\nAs you enter through what I can only imagine is akin to walking through the entryway of a Western Union in Compton, you've suddenly matrixed into a crowded, tiny vestibule that is indicative of the original size of the restaurant.  In fact it's recently gone trough an expansion, and when you've managed to squeeze past the herd, the room on the right is the expansion, while directly in front of you is the original dining room.  And the interior, although updated, has the exact the same finishes: green carpeting dark, mahogany wood chair rails, brass railings and oddly scaled glass drop chandeliers....it's like a time machine into retro...without the chic... which I have grown to absolutely love, like visiting grandma's house in the not so nice neighborhood during the Holidays.\n\nApart from your typical Thai Apps, (Shrimp Toast, Stuffed Chicken Wings)  The Moo Dad Deaw is an awesome starter, akin to a Bar snack item, to be eaten with a nice cold beer.  These succulent, juicy, tender pieces of pork are the precursor to chicken fingers, you can easily pop these suckers one after one in your mouth; as a good accompaniment, have some Sticky Rice to go with it; go ahead wreck your diet, you weren't serious about those New Year's resolutions anyways...\n\nMy favorite curry dish on the menu, which isn't you normal curry dish:  the Braised Short Rib with Penang Curry - this luxurious dish has all the depth and richness laid into it's protein not usually paired with Thai cuisine but definitely makes sense.  The hearty Short Rib goes so well with Penang, which is so good, Chef Saipin add Cognac into the Curry which elevates it to whole different level.  I bypass all the other curries cuz I know this one has the best flavor profile out of all of them.\n\nLotus of Siam has made me a Pad See Ew snob, ever since that first time I ate here, the quality and technique that is executed here is so superb; I honestly have to remind myself that it's not supposed to be this good!  First, the Noodles have that perfect texture; mochi chewiness but firm enough to achieve maximum noodle satisfaction.  Combine it with the Egg, Beef, Broccoli and sweet Soy, it's such an addictive dish that's light yet savory with just a hint of Black Pepper to tighten the palate...just yum.\n\nAnother all time favorite of mine:  Crab Fried Rice.  The way that Lotus makes this dish is pretty unbelievable, the rice is incredibly fluffy with a light infusion of crab broth.  I love finding morsels of Crab and Egg as if it's a treasure hunt and there's always a big hunk of Tomato wedge that's seems so out of scale with everything else that's on the plate.  But, as I've ordered this dish consecutively on numerous occasions, it's become a endearing and integral component that adds acidity to an otherwise aromatic, subtle dish.  It is a must-get item on the menu, but be warned, it's not an all out powerhouse of strong flavors, so you may want to order it as an earlier course before the heavier dishes arrive to your table. \n\nAs dining experiences go, it's all over the place except for the food.  And in the end, with moderate prices, I can't really say that anything else affect the fact that Lotus has the best Thai food I've ever had.  \n\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)\nFood:          5+++\nAmbience:  2 (much improved hole in the wall)\nService:       4.75 (they're always so busy, it can't be helped)"

They are the Crispy Duck with Cream Cognac sauce, the Soft Shell Crap Salad, the Tom Kah Kai soup, and the Spicy Catfish with basil leaves. \n\nThey have an incredible wine list with lots of depth including  many Riesling flights. Rieslings pair marvelously with spicy Thai. They have even brought samples to the table to help us decide which to chose.The proprietor is well known in town for his cellar, and his markups are very reasonable. It's also a pleasant surprise to have wine presented so elegantly in this location (just as one would expect in a Michelin rated establishment.) \n\nAs for the dishes you would order in other Thai restaurants such as Larb, and Pad Thai - stay away from them - this is not the place.

This meal was probably one of the top 20 dinners I've ever had.The grilled prawn (which is actually deep fried), is straight-up one of the tastiest things I have ever had. Cooked to perfection, it's fried and seasoned with garlic, salt, pepper, and secret Thailand magical flaver. The sweetness explempliflies the freshness of the prawn.

Ordered a SINGHA pint and enjoyed conversation and reviewing menu with my lady. Met a great couple from Houston who also came bc of Yelp and made the wait short.

We got to the restaurant at around 5pm and there was already a line outside.  \n\nWe ordered the stuffed chicken wings for appetizer,  chicken larb for salad, and drunken noodles with soft crab shell and dry pork curry noodles for entrees.  One word - Delicious! Delicious! Okay, I lied, 2 words.  Now I understood why the wait to get in.  \n\nThe place is clean and spacious, and the servers were really friendly.'

S"We came here for this place several times and everytime it is fully committed. But hey don't give up that's why we are here now! When I arrived, I asked for a party of 2, and the wait time is 30-40 min, it was barely 5:30! You can tell how busy it is so I will say if you have somehting planned later that night, make sure you have enough time as they do not take reservation. \n\n25 min later we got seated at a small table by the wall. The server came right away and asked for our drinks. They appeared to be nice and friendly. The place is a bit noisy because of how busy they are but that's how most Asian restaurants here, and I actually think it is more authentic that way.\n\nAfter looking at the menu, we ordered Beef Skewer (No.6 on Appetizer) It was amazing! The sauce that came with it is creamy and yummy! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered pork pad thai which is amazing as well. But for my yellow pork curry, I am not too impressed. I think personally I am used to Indian curry which is thick and creamy , so when I tried Thai curry , it is too watery for me. The veggie inside is not too cooked in my opinon, and I ordered a 7 out of a 10 spicy scale  which is way too spicy than any other 7 at other Thai places.\n\nAfter all, I still think of it as a good Thai food option, but I kind of think it is over rating on yelp, especially after a 30min wait. I still prefer Le Thai on Fremont Street better. \nBut I will return and try some other items on the menu if chances come."

S"Is it Lotus of Shame? \n\nI have been going to this place for over 10 years. I used to love it. Food was tasty and unique - and the service was great (tho, I hadn't been there for the last 2 years or so). \n\nRecently, my local friends stopped going to this restaurant, saying Le Thai in downtown was better - also, heard that two of my friends got food poisoning eating shrimp here. Well, I didnt take their words and went back with my clients who were staying here for a convention. \n\nHowever,,\n\n1. Service quality has dropped to the bottom line. \n\nWaitress were fine. But the real problem was these young waiters.\n\n(after writing what happened here, I was disgusted - I needed to erase all that. I need to forget. That was how they behaved bad...)\n\n2. Food quality didn't meet 5 stars,,, maybe 3.5. Used to be 5, tho.\n\nYou know, it is a bad example of a restaurant that goes bad when it become super popular. When you get tons of people, you have to cook fast and easy - waiters might forget about service - but then where is the quality that Lotus of Siam used to have? \n\nDon't get fooled by Yelp ratings. Trust your taste, because they treat you like a tourist who never go back and drop $$ anymore. Vegas quality. \n\nNo, I will never go back. As a local, I rather wanna go to Le Thai and Weera Thai.\n\nOh and yes, they were talking bad shit about me when I told all the things above. Rude. Very rude. I could rate as no star or one star for this, but I am a nice guy, haha."

S"Highly overrated and overpriced. Not a bad place, but I honestly think people say it's good just because other people say it's good. The prices were a dollar more expensive than people claim in Yelp, so they appear to keep hiking up the prices. People continue to line up and pay it, so I don't blame the restaurant for meeting market demand - I just don't understand it.\n\n1) Garlic prawns.\nEveryone says to get it, and the pictures look great. I ordered this, and the wrong thing came out. Turns out, there are two kinds and you need to clearly specify which one. The one in all the Yelp photos is the deep-fried version. Otherwise they give you the BBQ/grilled version. The grilled version is not bad, but wish I knew. $26 is a lot for the wrong dish.\n\n2) Khao Soi.\nIt's okay. I like how the noodles are fairly soft, but nothing special. \n\n3) Drunken seafood noodles.\nThis one was terrible. Normally I love wide, pan-fried rice noodle dishes, but this one came as a giant messy wet mush of dough as the noodles got soggy and fused together. I picked at the seafood and veggies and left all the noodles, which should've been slightly crispy on the pan-fried side and normally the best part of the dish.\n\nI want to note that the staff seemed friendly. I just don't get the customer ratings; the same food or better is readily available at every other Thai restaurant for about $6.95 a dish."

S"This place definitely lives up to the hype! My friend and I were in Vegas for 6 days for a conference and planned to come here for lunch on our last day. During lunch hours, they serve a buffet. I'm not sure what kind of food was in the buffet but it seemed very popular. We ordered off the menu and got the Nao Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, Garlic Prawns, and Roasted Duck Curry. You could adjust the spiciness for each dish. They go from scale 1-10. We decided on going with 5 for all the spicy dishes. The food took a while to come out but we didn't mind since we did come during the lunch rush. The Nao Kao Tod came first and it was a very interesting crispy rice salad. It was slightly tangy and when you eat it with the cabbage provided, it's the perfect blend of crunchy, zesty, and freshness. I have never had anything like this so I truly enjoyed it! The Tom Kah Kai came out next and this was probably my least favorite dish. I felt like the taste was off, maybe too much coconut milk? I've had better elsewhere. The Garlic Prawns were SO good! A bit pricey compared to the other dishes but the prawns were very big and juicy and were fried to perfection. The seasoning on the prawns was so delicious! The curry was the best I've ever had. The flavors were there and the duck was roasted to the perfect consistency and meshed so well with the curry. Service was great! All the waiters made sure our water glasses were full and always checked up on us. This place is definitely a spot I would need to visit everytime I'm in Vegas. Worth the cab ride from the strip and definitely worth the hype! :)"

S'For starters I\'m torn on my stars...It really should be like 4 7/8\'s (We had some service stumbles) I\'ll get to that later.\nWe planned a wedding in Vegas and the dinner afterwards was for my wife and I,the best man/brides maid an a spouse.\nWe got there a little early and had a seat at the bar, I asked the bartender what she recommended and she asked me if I was looking for something sweet, An I told her that I was more of a savory taste kind of guy. That is when she recommended a gin based basil infused rock candy drink with cucumber juice, If it wasn\'t for the fact that it was fifteen dollars I would have ordered 15 more.\nThen out of no where some young lady called to me by first name an told us that are table was ready.\nWe got to are table and that\'s when the first hiccup happen, We sat there for about 15 mins before someone came to the table to even greet us, An it wasn\'t even are waiter.\nSo I figured are guy was busy and I let it slide\nWhen are guy did arrive he gave us that stupid little Ipad so we could order drinks...An then told us that the meat cart was being used and it would be awhile before he could get it, because "seeing the meat may make you change your mind on what you are going to order"\nWell really it didn\'t..but we had to wait, cause the guy just diapered.\nWhen he did get back it was probably another 20 mins....\nSo 35 mins later we now had the chance to order but not before the 10 min speech of what kind of meat was on this cart.\nSo anyway......\nWell having been in the industry I told my table to order everything that they wanted an let them send it out when it was needed.(that in itself is a gamble but I didn\'t not want to wait another 25 mins just to get an app)\nSo having placed our entire order some 20 mins later my soup an app came out at the same time as did for the rest of my table. With my waiter no where to be found.\nthen some 30 seconds later my waiter did arrive an lean over to me an apologizes for the double dip saying that it was only suppose to be the soups that arrived...We are pretty low drama kind of people so I said no worries but it still kind a pissed us off.\nSo after we all finished our soups and moved to are app, we placed are pretty big size soup bowls in the middle of the table and their they sat foooorrrrrrreeeevvvvvvvrrrrrr \nAn when we all finished are apps.....Those plates sat in front of us....fooooorrrreeevvvvrrrrr..... So I don\'t know if it was busy in the back...Maybe are guy was new but no service then over service, kind stunk.\nI ordered\n1)Asparagus soup\ndungeness crab, parmesan custard, pickled white asparagus, smoked salmon caviar... The asparagus was green so I couldn\'t figure out where it was suppose to be white..but let me tell you this was by far the best thing that ate this night.\n2)Smoked Beef Tartare\nlemon zest, red onion, capers, guinness infused mustard seeds, yukon gold herb chips... The presentation was amazing because it comes in this smoke filled glass dome and they open table side. If you don\'t like capers stay away it was a bit over powering and with the home made chips the extra salt is almost an over kill.\n3)Roasted Beef Wellington\nI mean what can I say, This is the dish that has made this guys career, It was everything that I hoped it to be an then some.\n4)Mac & Cheese\nblue, cheddar, parmesan, truffle, This was simple amazing. It comes in a small stainless steel kettle and more them likely you will have enough to take home.\n5)Melon sorbet (maybe) My best man ordered the bread pudding that everyone is raving about so I went another route for 2 reasons. I just ate enough to kill a horse and knew that a bread pudding was going to be to heavy and...also giving the table a chance to see something different. An I was right, The bread pudding only got eaten 1/3 of the way an ended up in a box.\nThe sorbet was perfect,light,creamy,and a very very good pallet cleanser from the crab and the wellington.\nThe one redemption that I will give them is they over heard us talking about the wedding and when the sorbet arrived on the chocolate wafer read "Congratulations"  An they presented it to my wife, It was a nice touch and good catch by our waiter so I kind of let him off the hook on the hiccups.\nWith all that being said it\'s Gordon Ramsay and it was amazing!\nWe dropped a good buck that night  but I would do it all over again,having never been to a place owned by my idol.\nIf your there and don\'t mind spending...Go you won\'t regret it. hopefully the service will work itself out in the coming months because I do see that it is a issue in most of the posts.\nNow only if I could have heard him screaming "It\'s bloody raw you ass"\nThat would have made my night.\nCheers.'

S"I hate that I can't give Gordon Ramsey Steak 5 stars!  My wife and I planned our Vegas trip 6 months in advance and the number one thing I wanted to do was eat at one of Gordons restaurants,  especially GR Steak! A week before our trip went to make a reservation and all his restaurants stated they were booked solid for 8weeks! But what else would you expect, it's a GR restaurant, so I was disappointed.  We get Vegas and we're walking threw the Paris hotel and just to make sure we asked if they had any open reservations and to our surprise they had quite a few and made a reservation and we're beyond d excited!  We get to the restaurant which is amazing in and of its self.  We take our seats and I'm not sure if it's how they do things but it seemed like it took a long time to get our drinks and food, which we overlooked because we wanted to enjoy every minute. We order our food our first course arrives the British Ale Onion Soup, and it was amazing!  The best onion soup I've ever had, rich in flavor! I was sad after I ate it all because I didn't want the soup to end. For main courses my wife ordered the Roasted Chicken and I ordered the Beef Wellington, the roasted  chicken was beyond tender and juicy, the wild rice and crispy chicken skin complements the chicken very well. The beef Wellington was the best thing I've ever eaten! Definitely recommend it! You won't be disappointed. \n\nNow the reason I couldn't do 5 stars was because the service was decent, when your spending well over $100 a person you expect a certain level of service.  We ordered a side of Brussel spouts which didn't come out with the main course, we let our server know  and for about twenty minutes he would keep coming to the table and telling us there coming out but they never did. So we just cancelled them. And lastly at the end our meal after we had told our server we wouldn't be ordering dessert it literally took our server about 30mins to bring our check!  But the server assistant was phenomenal! Always kept our glasses full, checked in on us often but not to much, he was extremely professional, well mannered just an all around great guy! \n\nSo in conclusion even though service was not what we expected the food more than made up for it!  Maybe just a bad day for our server, we all have them. But next time we are in Las Vegas we will definitely be going back to GR Steak!!"

S"My wife and I went here for our wedding anniversary back in July and we had one of the most amazing dining experiences of my life.  I have a rather bad food allergy to onions of any kind which is an absolute drag when it comes to eating out as 98% of everything has onion of some form in it.  The crew at Ramsay Steak took care of me in a way I didn't know was possible by custom tailoring every dish I ordered to not have onion in it even if that meant changing the recipe for me which they did on several dishes that I really wanted to try.\n\nFast forward to today 9/11/12 and we took my father-in-law out to dinner at Ramsay Steak.  He is a retired gourmet chef and absolutely loved everything just as much as my wife and I.  The foie gras he said was the best he's ever had at a restaurant before and he's traveled the world.  The best moment of the night was the epicurean orgasm on the first bite of the sticky toffee pudding.  Dad just stopped everything he was doing, reached a higher plane of existence for a while then came back to finish the desert.\n\nAdd to all this that once again the fine group at Ramsay Steak took my lousy food allergy and worked around it, delivering a mind blowing meal and dining experience.  Bravo!"

S"Another night in Vegas, another wonderful steakhouse.  Gordon Ramsay steak is one of the newer upscale steakhouses in Vegas and is located conveniently in the center of the strip at the Paris hotel.  I have eaten at some of the other Gordon Ramsay eateries in Vegas and neither of them compare to this one.  In fact, very few steakhouses on the strip compare to this.  The decor, the service, and the food are all fantastic.\n\nWe first started with some drinks, bread (some of the best free bread around) and the seafood platter for 4.  This was one of the best tasting seafood platters I have had.  Everything was fresh and came with a variety of sauces which were amazing.  The crab and lobster was especially tasty. \n\nAfter the starter, I ordered the salmon and the table also shared a porterhouse.  The salmon was very good, and actually a very good portion size.  Normally they make the salmon with a cauliflower puree that when you squeeze lemon over it, it turns purple, but I think they did a seasonal vegetable with it this time (which stayed one color).  The porterhouse was as good as it gets.  Nothing to fancy on the cook, just a very flavorful and moist steak.  Make sure to get a few extra bites off the bone, that's where you get some of the best meat bites.  \n\nThe spinach at GR is also one of the best sides I've ever had.  Just a great blend of garlic and oil to make the spinach super tasty and not too drenched.  \n\nFor desert I tried the peanut butter bar.  Very good, but nothing amazing.\n\nOverall, one of my favorite meals in Vegas."

S'With all the buzz over Chef Ramsay\'s first foray into the fabulous and star-studded Las Vegas restaurant scene, we expected more. First con (at least for our taste), very noise, and I\'m not just talking about the bar. Second con, service was attentive but felt like it was very generic and "phoned in."  Lastly, the food was just -- eh, save for the fabulous sticky toffee pudding. The food was good, don\'t get me wrong, but compared to Le Cirque, Joel Robuchon, B&B, etc it paled in comparison and left us with a forgettable meal.'

S'Steak is a great passion of mine. It is one of the easiest and simplest thing one can cook, but definitely not easy to master, like sushi for example. With my respect for Gordon Ramsay, when he opened a restaurant called "Gordon Ramsay Steak," I just had to try it. \n\nThe first impression of the restaurant was, LOUD. Really, LOUD. It wasn\'t just the people, it was the music. The hostess at the door explained about the design of the restaurant and the artwork on the ceiling while walking me and my wife to our table, and I could not understand a single word from her, but it seemed interesting nevertheless.\n\nOur server came to our table and instead of asking about our drinks, he gave us an iPad to "browse" through the drinks. And he also gave us a menu for the special course meal, with a picture of Gordon Ramsay on the right that said "SAMPLE," and he said we would get a picture of him that does NOT say "SAMPLE" if we get the course. Did they think people would steal the picture if it didn\'t? It seemed a bit silly and distracting.\n\nWe were left alone for about 3 or 4 minutes trying to figure out how to use the stupid iPad drink menu. It seemed intuitive enough for me, a 25 year old graphic designer, but I doubt the 90% of the age group who spend $200+ on a meal would really appreciate this. And it froze on a screen and I didn\'t even get to look at anything until a moment before our server came back.\n\nThe course seemed interesting but it was about $165 per person and we wanted to look at the regular menu. I couldn\'t really understand our server because of the music and his accent so I just ordered a random beer and asked for a regular menu.\n\nI started to get a bit irritated at this point with all the noise and confusing menus. We got the smallest table for two, and we were having trouble even talking to each other. We did go there to try the food, but I expected a more quiet romantic dinner with my wife on our last night in Vegas, not a hipster club night.\n\nBut continuing with my review, we ordered a lot of food. A beef tartar, sauteed mushroom, bone marrow, a New York steak, a foie gras, a filet mignon, and some potatos. Presentation was... great. Interesting, pretty, and original. Taste? All appetizers and side dishes we ordered were fantastic. I wouldn\'t say everything was the most amazing dish I\'ve ever had, but they all had something unique about them, and even the stuff like mushrooms and potatos became more interesting somehow. The bone marrow and foie gras, weren\'t anything extraordinary. They tasted like bone marrow and foie gras.\n\nNow the steak, as a self-claimed world class steak critique, I would give it a 7 out of 10. It was delicious, don\'t get me wrong, but knowing that it was the most expensive steak I\'ve ever had, (I think it was $63) it wasn\'t much different from what I cook at home.\n\nFor the people who think getting expensive steaks at restaurants is a waste, when I tried the NY steak at MESA grill earlier this year, I thought it was THE BEST steak I have ever had and it was definitely something on a different level than my steak. So far, my second best was Ruth Chris\'s. But I couldn\'t say the same for the steak I had at Gordon Ramsay steak. The steak at MESA grill and Ruth Chris were both $50.\n\nOur dessert was great though. We had the toffee pudding with icecream as our server recommended it, and it was delicious.\n\nThe overall service was very nice, but in my opinion, that\'s a given at places this expensive. Our bill came out to be about $260 plus tip.\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn\'t come back or recommend this place for the steaks, but I would definitely like to come back to try some other dishes like the famous wellington. Considering the price and the atmosphere, I\'d highly recommend the MESA grill instead.'

S'A good British steak house in the Paris?  Why not.\n\nLove him or hate him, Gordon Ramsay is a multi Michelin stared chef.  Trying his London restaurants dispelled the myth for me that British food is bland and flavorless.  That said, at Gordon Ramsay Steak, the British signature dishes are the standouts.  As a steakhouse, it falls in the middle of the pack in price and quality behind Cut, StripSteak, and CraftSteak.\n\nTwo types of beef, limited cuts (epically if you are not sharing your steak).  28 day dry aged, prime beef is excellent.  Well trimmed.  Good marbling.  Beefy with the waft of umame.  The American kobe is feminine; tender, mild, almost sweet.  They claim the beef rates a BMS 10+ (Japanese A5), could be but it\'s nowhere near as flavorful as Australian or Japanese wagyu.\n\nThe signature dishes are outstanding.  Flavors are bold.  The Beef Wellington with a syrupy, red wine demi packs a flavor punch.  A classic.  The "Fisherman\'s Grill" is also exceptional.  Perfectly cooked lobster, mussels, scallops served with a silky curry sauce.  Oh yeah!.  \n\nSides meant to be shared.  The mushroom tart, gratineed spinach and blue cheese mac and cheese are good eats and make the perfect match to the dry aged beef by heightening the umame aftertaste.  Unfortunately their flavors overpower the kobe cuts.\n\nService is friendly and very efficient.\n\nVery good international wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.\n\nNote:  Use your Total Rewards casino card to get a slight (5-10 percent) discount.  Tier does not matter.\n\nRecommended'

S'Stepping into Ramsey is like taking a location warp from Paris to London. Decor is one of a fancy uk pub with short skirt tall woman (not necessarily a bad thing) taking you to your table. You are greeting by a team of folks and one has you an ipad with the wine list. Too bad the ipad froze often so no wine for me.\n\nThe feeling is that Ramsey aims for you to eat with your eyes first. Presentation is very chic and modern. I can see the Hells kitchen chef was actually cooking my meal as the kitchen is very open.\n\nBread basket was amazing with the volcanic salt and charcoal butter.\n\nThe deconstructed beet and salad with heirloom tomatoes was the most refreshing of all the appetizers of all four restaurants. Great!\n\nThe steak was slightly over cooked but had decent flavor throughout. The presentation was pretty to look at.\n\nThe french press coffee with Amaretto, Bailey, and Chombord liquour chocolate mixture was very impressive.'

S'My husband and I are fans of the Gordon Ramsey television shows. We planned a trip to Las Vegas for our anniversary.  My husband surprised me with reservations to Gordon Ramsey\'s Steak. After reading reviews, I knew it would be excellent. To say it was excellent would be an understatement. It was incredible! The food was definitely the "star" of the restaurant. However, we found the service was fantastic. Our waiter, Matthew, was very helpful and informative.  It didn\'t hurt that he was a doll either! In fact, the entire staff was attractive and professional. The beef Wellington was the best thing I have put in my mouth.  And running a very close second was the sticky toffee pudding with the brown sugar ice cream.  Amazing!  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to experience a truly memorable dinner. I only had one gripe, and it was with one of the hostesses. The day before our reservations, we just happened to be in Paris, and walked over to the restaurant, just to look at the menu, AGAIN, and get a sneak peek inside.  The hostess looked at us with a blank stare, and we Told her that we would be having dinner there the next night.  She didn\'t say a word and proceeded to look down and continue texting on her phone. She wasn\'t there the night we went so I didn\'t have to deal with her rudeness! All in all, GREAT! Hope this helped!'

S"I'm only giving Gordon Ramsay Steak 1-star because 0 isn't an option.  Gordon Ramsey should be ashamed of this restaurant bearing his name - he should have been in the restaurant screaming at his staff that they were failures like you see on TV, as in this case, they were.\n\nI went to Gordon Ramsay Steak with a friend to celebrate his birthday.  Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed.\n\nThe disappointment started when we were seated.  We originally had a reservation for 6 people, however only 5 showed.  Well, they seated us at a table meant for 4.  I might expect this had we brought an extra person, but we actually brought one less person than our reservation was for.  Given that this is supposed to be a high-end restaurant, that's downright unacceptable.\n\nMoving on, I was going to order a drink.  Their drink menu is on an iPad, which as a techie, I thought was neat in concept, except the menu was broken and I couldn't actually use it.  Oh well.  No drink.\n\nNext up was the appetizers.  I ordered Ravioli.  Never did I envision that when ordering Ravioli, I would get one, singular, ravioli.  Yes, it was a larger than normal ravioli, but for $13, I expected 2 or 3, not just one.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't particularly amazing, either.\n\nOn to the main course.  The cuts of meat were good. however the side dishes were just OK.  They used butter and fat as a crutch, and weren't actually good by design - they were just buttered up to taste good.\n\nFinally the check comes.  There is a $45 cookbook on the check.  Throughout the entire night, there was never a discussion of a cookbook, we did not ask for one, the waiter did not offer one, nor did we receive one.  It's possible it could have been an honest mistake, but given how bad the experience was overall, I'm not inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAfter we get the cookbook removed, the check for 5 people was a bit over $700.  No wine was ordered - that was just the cost of food.  I'm not complaining about the price (I knew it wasn't a cheap restaurant before going) - I'm complaining about how bad the food/service was given the price.  I truly believe I would have been happier had we gone to TGI Friday's and paid $700 for our meal at TGIF than here.  \n\nThis restaurant is a joke - even if I was offered a free meal there, I'm not sure I would go back.  Don't waste your time or money going here."

S"Simply outstanding.  Best steak I have ever eaten in my life!! Since I am a die hard Gordon Ramsay fan, I had to visit his steak house.  I had read mixed reviews but needed to see for myself.  The restaurant itself is in the Paris hotel, and is pretty chic.  Little things like high quality paper towels in the ladies room with the name of the restaurant imprinted make for a cooler experience.  Our server was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the menu and gave us a lecture on the menu that was accompanied by a very cool display of meats.  I learned a lot about meats and was able to see the ruby red colors due to the mirrors that showcased that top side of each cut for the whole table to see.  Interactive cocktail menu on the ipad was very cool as well.  The meal began with a nice selection of breads.  The one that stands out is the fig pinwheel...very yummy.  The Caesar salad was accompanied by a scottish egg.  The salad was crisp, the croutons were crunchy (not too crunchy so they cut your mouth), cheese was thinly sliced and the dressing was super fresh. Best Caesar salad ever.  Now, for the star.  The Beef wellington.  How can you not order this if you have seen his show!! It was AMAZING.  Fireworks amazing.  It just melted in my mouth. The temperature was perfect...it was just outrageously, sinfully perfect.  The potatoes and root vegetables on the dish were beautiful and tasty.  We ordered the truffle mac and cheese which was excellent, the asparagus which were pretty standard and the Brussel sprouts which screamed EAT ME! Don't STOP! They were seasoned eloquently and meaty in their texture and consistency.  Just a big fat YUM! Now, on to the most spectacular dessert! Sticky toffee pudding was to die for.  It was sexy on every level: plating, taste and sh-arability. The ice cream looks like a stick of butter and you can cut a piece for each piece of cake you eat.  All around this was a memorable experience in every way, and it helped I was with 5 of my dearest girlfriends and we shared everything (My friend that ordered the rib cap shared a bite and it was fantastic).  Kudos to Gordon for being able to dish out what he dishes out!!"

S"Gordon Ramsey needs to have this restaurant on his show Kitchen Nightmares!  My husband with another couple booked this reservation 3 months in advance since we have been excited to try this restaurant for 2 years. We arrived to our reservation on a high note from walking off a craps table with winnings near $1000, we were sad to walk away from the table but excited for dinner (should have stayed playing craps!) it took the waitress 5 minutes to greet us and offer the water selection which we selected tap. They have a tray of the cuts of meat they wheel around to explain our options that they stick in a corner to store rather than the cooler, while the waitress explained the different cuts all we could smell was rotten meat. We mentioned this to her and she admitted it should be placed in the cooler after being out for a few minutes and swapped with another but the staff doesn't have time for that. GROSS! We ordered oysters (excellent), french onion soup (excellent), crab soup (very bland) gnocchi (small and blah) as appetizers. Our dinner was a NY strip (average) filet(overcharred) short ribs(very fatty) lamb (tiny) with sides of Brussels (over seasoned) Mac n cheese (way to much truffle) chocolate layers (good but nothing special). Now we wait......and wait.....and wait.... For our server to get more water and the bill so we finally ask someone to get her attention. Oh, I forgot that now we learn we have been receiving $9 bottles of water (6 of them) remember we requested tap. So manager comes over and we only complain of the water and over truffled Mac n cheese which he apologizes and removes from the tab. So we go back to waiting.  Now I request another manager of which I explain the entire experience to (I NEVER complain as I understand the demand of the business but for this price and for what the restaurant is I am now disgusted) this manager continues to apologize and explain they appreciate the feedback and he is disappointed that we had a bad experience. He additionally took off the dessert. We were not looking for anything to be comped (just the water). So now we wait again for the tab with empty water glasses, after 5 minutes we ask another server to please bring us water. You would think with that being our biggest complaint you would hydrate your customer. I mean we only wanted FREE WATER! Nothing else free, on a $600 tab. We were all shocked that Gordon Ramsey allows a restaurant to run this way and serve the food they do.  I have since read other reviews and all seem similar to mine. Maybe it is time for Ramsey to read them."

S'This is one of my top 10 dinners of all time!  This place is awesome and I am so glad that we made a reservation to eat here prior to seeing the Jersey Boys.  It was AMAZING!!!!  My husband and I split the Kobe filet and it was so delicious and flavorful.  My Mom had the chicken and said it was amazing and for sides we had the sauteed spinach, truffle mac and cheese, and fingerling potatoes.  Unfortunately we didn\'t have time for dessert, but I will be back the next time I am in Vegas.  They have a great drink list and you need to try their version of a blue cheese stuffed olive.  Being that I\'m very particular on my olives, this place blew my mind.  They created a "bacon cheeseburger" type of olive - it was an olive sandwich with blue cheese, cocktail onion and bacon.  I added a pic, it\'s a little blurry, but it gives you an idea.  I never would have thought to do that with an olive.  Gordon Ramsay is a genius!    \n\nYou simply must try this place!'

S"This was fantastic! By far the best dining experience I have ever had. I went with my parents and girlfriend while staying at Paris. Let me start off by saying our waiter Charles and his assistant John were amazing. Extremely knowledgable and definitely knew what they were talking about. We took Charles' recommendation for a bottle of wine, it was exactly what we wanted, and he described it perfectly! All of they steals we ordered were tender and full of flavor, best steak I have ever had by far (Wagyu Rib Cap). We also got the Long Bone Rib Eye and Wagyu Filet, all of which were amazing with no complaints whatsoever. Finished the night off with the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Let's just say it was a perfect dessert, and was the best I have ever had. Great Job Chef Ramsey! We will be back and will definitely be requesting Charles as a waiter again!"

S"I want to give this place 5 stars. I expected to give this place 5 stars. As I write this, I'm still considering upping my rating to 5 stars...but I just can't.  Unfortunately the service is what's keeping me from doing so.  More on this later.  \n\nWe visited on Wednesday 5/30 for our big dinner on our last night in Vegas.  If you are looking for a classic steakhouse atmosphere, go somewhere else. This place is modern and trendy, including great current music remixes pumping through the restaurant. I loved the atmosphere 100%.  \n\nThe bar experience was excellent. IPads are there to review the specialty cocktails, and the drinks didn't disappoint. We ordered a Southside and an HK Antioxident. We were seated in a corner booth upstairs, and unfortunately had a limited view of the place - no big deal though.\n\nFor starters, I had the onion soup, which was hands down the best onion soup I've ever had. She had the caesar salad, which was also very good. For the main dish, I had the beef wellington, which was amazing. The meat literally melts in your mouth...outstanding. She had the fish & chips, which was delicious and the serving size was plentiful.  I also ordered the roasted bone marrow (1st experience with it), and didn't care for it...just a personal preference thing there.  Overall, an excellent food experience. \n\nBack to the service - the waiter's assistant was excellent. He was on top of the water, bread and cleaning the table. Very friendly and attentive. Our main waiter, however, acted uninterested, and barely spent any time with us. We literally received more attention from other waiters passing by our table, who engaged us in conversation about the restaurant, the menu and their recommendations.  Where was this great attitude for us from our waiter?  A few noticed that we sat there with finished plates for a good 15-25 minutes.  I understand our waiter was busy with a large party, but we were second thoughts to him, and it was clear we were not a priority. It really was too bad, and all the waiting and disinterest made our mind up for us that we would be skipping dessert.\n\nWe will be back for sure, but we will definitely ask for a table with a better view, and we will make sure we don't get the same waiter.\n\nFood, atmosphere, bar/bartender, other restaurant staff: 5 Stars!!\nService: 1 Star"

S'Had a reservation for 9:15 pm. It was very easy to find through the Paris casino. Greeted and seated very quickly,  shown the "chandelier" which was a very cool idea. Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff. The service was what I expected, very alert, my water glass never went half way empty. I ordered the ricotta ravioli, she ordered the pea soup. For entrees I ordered the beef wellington and she had the kobe skirt steak. For sides we selected the grilled mushrooms and a stuffed potato. I was disappointed that the risotto was not available to order on its own. The only way to try it was ordering the hells kitchen pre-fix menu, and at $145 per person I did not want to try it that bad. With the exception of the pea soup, all the food was very good as expected. The peas soup was more like a puree of peas with a very earthy taste and the carrot jello-like thing in the middle was much too large for the bowl. For drinks we only tried the pink cocktail, with acai and blue berries. I did not try it but she said it was very good.\n\nThe ravioli was a single piece which actually was filling, eaten one piece at a time. Very cool how an egg yoke comes out when its broken. The wellington was good, the meat was cooked perfectly, everything else (breading and filling) seemed a bit messy for my taste but was tasty. The mushrooms had very good flavor but I would have like more caps than stems. The kobe steak was very good. The skirt meat was fatty but so flavorful. The stuffed potato was huge, enough for 2 people maybe even 3-4 depending on how much you eat.  \n\nThe 2 things I did not expect and did not like about this restaurant were: 1) there were diners in jeans and tank tops, flip flops, t-shirts, and shorts. This really killed any idea of this being a fancy restaurant. They should require some kind of dress code or at least collared shirts and slacks. 2) The music was way too loud, I could not have a normal conversation with the person sitting across from me. We had to raise our voice way too much.\n\nOverall the experience was good. With the many choices in Vegas I will most likely not come here again but it was cool to try just to say I have.'

He spent time with our table and had a really fun personality. And he was an expert waiter - said he had been in the industry for 10 years and it showed. \n\nOverall great evening but very pricy.'

S"Ok let me preface this with the fact that I intend to go back and give this place another try because I want to try some more of Gordon Ramsey's recipes. However I was disappointed with my first experience because I did not feel the price was worth the quality. \n\nThe goods:\nImpeccable service\nbeef wellington was delicious\nThe ribeye steak that is cut different (I cant remember what he called it)\n\nThe bads:\nTwo of the three steaks did not come out cooked as ordered. My sister ordered medium and got medium rare. Same with her friend. WHen you spend 60 on a steak, that is pretty unacceptable. Half the table had started eating, so they just dealt with the bad steaks. We told the server the dilemma and he offered to refire it. Personally it would have been nice to get a free dessert after something like that. \n\nThe appetizers were also disappointing but I want to try a few other ones next time I go (maybe I just ordered poorly)\n\nI hope my next review on this place is better! I really want to be wowed! As of now, Bobby Flay's restaurant (Mesa Grille at Caesars) dominates Ramsey's steak -house. Sorry Gordon"

S"WOW......\n\nAll I have to say is this is probably the best steakhouse I've been to so far. I am a huge ribeye & porterhouse fan but everyone said Gordon Ramsey is known for the beef wellington so I decided to give it a shot even though I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms or mustard on my steak.\n\nThe wait staff was very attentive and friendly. They came out with a variety of breads that was pretty decent and different from the standard hot rolls or pretzel breads they serve to you now. My wife ordered his signature chicken and we shared a side of Mac & cheese. \n\nWhen the wellington came out it was cooked perfectly med-rare and the first bite was FANTASTIC. With all the flavor you wouldn't have known you were eating a filet. My wife who isn't a fan of steak or red meat loved it as well. The Mac and cheese was pretty good and her chicken dish was very moist, flavorful and juicy. \n\nFor dessert they are known for their sticky toffee pudding, which happens to be her favorite as well and she thought this was the best thing ever. I wasn't a huge fan of it and think the Monkey Bread served at Craftsteak is hands down the best dessert in a steakhouse. \n\nPrior to coming here SW was #1 on my list in vegas but this is definitely better and we will be back next week."

You need reservations to get in because they are always booked for the night. Our waiter Donnie And Sergio were surperb. The explanation of the menu choices was excellent. We decided on the 32 oz. porterhouse to share with mushrooms and asparagus. The steak was fantastic. Done to perfection medium rare.They brought out the meat after grilling to show us what it looked like before taking it back and slicing it for us. What great service!  You must make an effort to eat here when you are in Las Vegas. The experience is well worth the expense. Next time the Tasting Menu with their Signature steak - Beef Wellington.

The salmon and bourbon creamed corn were also great but not too memorable in comparison to the first 4 mentioned. \n\nOur server was fantastic and my water was always filled. Add in a glass of red wine and a bottle of passion fruit tea and bf and I were so stuffed for the rest of the night.

S"We were first seated at the 2-top at the top of stairs next to the bussing station and where every meal comes in and out of the kitchen.  We waited 10-15 minutes for service, and asked to be reseated.  We were kindly reseated next to the wine closet in the back corner downstairs.  Every time they needed to serve a bottle of lower-priced wine (high priced wine is stored elsewhere) somebody came and put their butt in our face as they opened the closet to get wine out.  It's not really a closet -- it's a double-deep fancy glass door case, by the way.\n\nAnyway, we waited another 10-15 minutes for service.  We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing -- $220 a pop.  First few courses were mediocre.  Beef Wellington was awesome and the dessert was awesome.\n\nOverall -- not worth the price.  Good, but not great.  And certainly not a $500 dinner for two given the service and complete lack of ambience."

S"Gordon Ramsay Steak is an expensive restaurant - don't expect to spend under $100 per person and probably more.  As such it needs to be perfect, and it isn't.\n\nOn the plus side, the steaks were flavorful and the meat quality couldn't be beat.  The service was impeccable, the side dishes top notch, and the water glass constantly refilled. The breads were A-1.  One of our two drinks - a sidecar - was excellent (they use apricot jam but it was still fine), but now to the minuses.  .\n\nThe other drink was pedestrian at best - almost tasteless despite fresh mint and lime.  Their American Kobe beef was very tasty but their standard variety was no better than less costly places.  The music was too modern for my taste and so loud at times that conversation was difficult (the volume kept going up and down).  Even our waiter had trouble hearing our order.\n\nOn balance, Steak was a good experience and better than almost any other restaurant I have been to this year, but even for Las Vegas, it was expensive.  Only a personal visit from Gordon Ramsay would have made it a good value, but alas he was not present."

S'My significant other and if were very excited to eat at this restaurant because it\'s Gordon Ramsay\'s establishment. We had reservations for dinner on Thursday October 3 at 7pm. We arrived at the hotel a little early than 7 to ensure we were not late. \n\nWhen we got to the hostess stand, the hostess wasn\'t very friendly at all. She had a major attitude problem and informed us that we will be seated closer to our reservation time. We went to grab my Total Rewards card to kill time. We checked back in at 7 and there was an elderly couple in front of us. The same hostess was there speaking very nicely to them and offered them to sit at the bar to wait until their reservation time. She even wished them a happy dining experience. When it was our turn, her stinky attitude was back and didn\'t really say much. She just handed our ticket to one of the girls who took us to our seats. This alone ruined the night as the hostess is the first impression of the dining experience. \n\nAs we got seated, the vibe wasn\'t what we imagined for a "fine dining" place. It was more of a hip and chic place to take a client or pre drinks before dinner. We were greeted by the waiter\'s assistant first about 10-15 minutes later. He asked us if we wanted water but we just asked for the wine list. The atmosphere was really loud so we could barely hear what he said. We finally met our waiter Donnie. He brought us our menu and took our drink order as well. \n\nDonnie and Reuben didn\'t seem very excited to be working that night and their energy was contagious and didn\'t make the experience any better that the hostess. \n\nWe finally ordered our food which was the following:\nHalf dozen oysters \nCaesar salad\nBeef Wellington\nSaut\xc3\xa9ed Mushrooms\n\nThe oysters were good because I was craving it from the beginning of the week. The platter featured each of the different type of oysters offered. 3 types of oysters and there were 2 of each type. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the Caesar salad. Even though it did not come with anchovies, the dressing was very delicious.\n\nWe had to order Gordon Ramsay\'s famous beef Wellington. Which on this particular I felt was overrated. Maybe it\'s because Las Vegas is close to Cali but the Wellington was more on the medium well side instead of medium rare. Throughout my entire entree I only had three bites that were moist and deserving of medium rare.\n\nThe waiter tried to sell us on their signature dessert but at that point we just wanted to go. We saw other waiters be more attentive to their tables. It was such a horrible experience that I would never go back. Maybe we went into the restaurant with high expectations but why wouldn\'t a person? I mean it is Gordon Ramsay. I think these particular employees need to get retrained in their position or just quit the service industry altogether.'

S"From the moment you approach this restaurant you're in for a treat.  Upon entering you are greeted by 7-10 20 something girls dressed in all black.  Then you enter the restaurant with a flawless totally Vegas decor.  I was in town on business and decided to treat myself since I'm a huge fan and have never dined at any of his establishments.  All I can say is it is worth every penny.  Be careful not to fill up on the bread because it is tempting.  I had the Bone-In Ribeye, Cajun Style cooked Medium Rare and I can honestly say it was in the top three steaks I have ever had.  It was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The dessert was absolute heaven.  Do yourself a favor and order the Sticky Tofee pudding with brown butter Ice Cream.  This is the best dessert I have ever tasted.  The place plays music from all decades and all of them are classics, which just adds to the ambiance.  There is a reason this place will do 25 million in it's first year in business.  It's pricey, but you're in vegas, so go big or go home."

S'If I had I choice I would personally have given them a 0 star rating.  It was that horrible of an experience. I have been to many upscale restaurant and watching all of Gordon Ramsay\'s show. I am usually glued to his tv shows watching how great of a chef he is and the service he expects his teams to provide. \n\nWe traveled all the way from Arizona to celebrate my boyfriend and his buddies birthday at Gordon Ramsay steakhouse. This was the only reason we traveled all the way to las vegas. We had high expectations and heard so many great things about the restaurant.  \n\nFirst off, it started by the multiple attempts to try to make reservstions. I had to call atleast 5 times with multiple run arounds. The first time, the reservation line told me I had to talk to special reservation since I had a party of 8. They provided me with a number. This number they provided me could not take reservations for less than 10. So then I call the reservation line again. The reservstion line tells me they cannot take reservations for more than 6. They told me I had to talk to the restaurant. So I ask them for a number. The reservation line tells me they don\'t have a number.  They tell me they can transfer me. So they do and I end up back at the same reservation line again. After about 3 attempts of transferring they provided me a number for a manager. I was irritated already at this point. However, I continued to try over and over because this was for my boyfriend and our friends birthday. Finally, I got in touch with a manager.  When I spoke to the manager and made the reservation I confirmed with the manager atleast 3 times if this was Gordon Ramsay Steak inside of Paris hotel. The mamager reassured that I was talking to the manager at Gordon Ramsay Steak. She even guaranteed me the reservation was there and not to worry that she had it taken care. I took her word for it and thought after this horrible reservation experience everything was going to be great. \n\nForward time a month later..we show up at the restaurant to find out the reservation as the staff claimed was made at the wrong restaurant. The restaurant also never even called to confirm our reservation for saturday night. Most restaurants call the day before to confirm. Had they called I would have known there was a "mix up" and made arrangements or gone to the correct restaurant...as they claimed I was absolutely wrong.  I had no Gordon Ramsay even had a pub and grill. We get to the restaurant and we are told the reservations were made at the pub and grill. I asked how is this possible I told the manager I was reassured and guaranteed that I was talking to the manager at the steak restaurant.  The GM happened to be standing there..I believe his name was JP. He was beyond rude. He did not once apologize for the mix up. Blamed it completely on me and stated that his staff would never do such a thing and I was absolutely wrong and had no idea what I was talking about. He kept trying to give me a confirmation number.  Great that you have a confirmation number but what is this going to do? The fact was..the "GM" who I could almost bet should have been hired for great service provided the worst service I have ever seen in a high end restaurant.  The GM could have handled this is very many different ways. Had he offered to even call the other restaurant to let them know we were on the way or even apologized for a mix up that would have been fine and I would have appreciated the help. The fact that he just continued to blame me and give me a snooty stuck up attitude that was terrible and made us feel as though we were not good enough for his restaurant. Words can\'t even explain how he talked to us and how unbelieve the "GM" was. I have never been so upset before. I have managed restaurants before..I also come from 12 years of customer service jobs. I can reassure you my friends and family will never be back to any Gordon Ramsay chain of restaurant.  We were extremely disappointed and let down by this experience.

S"I had extremely high expectations for the food.  I went with the Hell's Kitchen with no reservations and they sat me quickly which was great.  I ordered the pre fixe and wine paring.  I can honestly can say the food was absolutely fantastic and I couldn't have been more pleased with the Jessica the sommelier who was knowledgeable (as you would expect) but also had a great personality and smile.   Donnie who was my waiter orchestrated a wonderful experience and timed the food perfectly for me.  thanks Donnie.."

S"When my folks were here to visit, and staying at the Paris, we all agreed to and were excited to try this place.  Menu, pricey but attractive.  Wine list, quite good.  Service, spot on.  Food very good, not great.  Ambiance, is the downfall.  Very noisy place, with the music and lighting, more like a nightclub.  I guess that's to appeal to the new steampunk millenial hipsters. Usually going out to eat entails conversation, here, though possible, it is difficult, noise and seating is close, lacks privacy that you can expect at restaurants of the same price and caliber.  At first, they tried to sit us at tables facing the kitchen and between the staff, banging plates, and radiant heat, we had to go to the Maitre'd and ask for a better option.  They did take care of it and we only had to wait about 10 minutes over the 15 minutes past our reservation time we were seated. So 7:45 became 8:15, but that wasn't an issue for us. In my honest opinion this place is more about a celeb name and the kind of place to go and see and be seen/at the scene and post your status to social media to impress friends.  I had suggested we go to Flemings on W. Charleston, which is much more what I am used to as a dining experience.  When it's dark, club music playing, weird lighting gave everything a reddish hue, maybe that's a Hell's Kitchen thing??? \nSome of the other diners were trying way too hard to look important and chic.  \nWines we chose were a 2012 Patz and Hall Dutton Ranch Chard, was excellent as expected along with the 2011 Robert Biale Black Chicken Ranch Zinfandel.\nOur server Humberto was really exceptional.\nTotal tab was a little over 500 US dollars for 3 people.  Wine, 2 American/Kobe skirt steaks and 1 NY strip,  2 orders of oysters and a soup, 1 dessert and 1 double expresso.  Plus the vino of course.  Which was $200 for the 2 bottles.\nWas it good, yes, could it have been better, also yes.  \nFor the price, I'd recommend, Flemings, Ruth Chris, Del Frisco's or one of many other great options in town."

S'I was pretty happy about this Steakhouse (overall). I give it 3.5 stars, rounded to 4. Still hasn\'t hit the 5 star yet, due to the pricing of the food. Don\'t believe it\'s worth the value.\n\nMy husband and I double dated with another couple and our bill came out to about $800 (averaging $200 per person) - kind of a hefty price tag for steak, if you ask me.\n\nHOWEVER, what makes this place stand out amongst the others was how formal and how professional they presented everything. Right off the bat, after the hostess walked us into the restaurant, we were given a tour of the restaurant (gorgeous decor, by the way!) and seated upstairs in a quiet room. Our server - and assistant duo were also very friendly, attentive, and great with us. (forgot their names though, unfortunately).  They really wanted to help and I appreciate how their main goal was to focus on us.\n\nThey also did a presentation on a cart with all the different steaks, which helps clarify the different styles. I LOVED that!!!\n\nWe ended up each ordering a steak, some sides, and appetizers to start -- which included the bone marrow (yum!) and others which I can\'t remember on the top of my head. The bone marrow was rather delish -- never expected myself to like Bone marrow!\n\nAlso I thought it was professional that the "drink" menu was to be ordered on the iPad. I think that\'s very progressive thinking. Loved those parts of the restaurant and it makes it unique.\n\n\nOverall, my steak and food were good. Would recommend if you\'re ok with spending $200/per person easy and enjoy delicious food and service.'

S"Wow... just wow!  From atmosphere to service to food to everything else you might want to quantify in a restaurant review, Gordon Ramsay's delivered!\n\nI have eaten in many, many fine steakhouses from NYC, to San Francisco to Vegas to right here in the Queen City of Charlotte and Ramsay's is the equal of most of them and better than some.  Was in LV for my son's 21st birthday and this was our big splurge meal on night one in town.\n\nWe started with the chilled seafood tower which was shrimp, lobster, king crab, clams, oysters, mussels served atop an awesome ice sculpture with a number of dipping sauces.  Every bit of the seafood was fresh and delicious!  For our entree, we got the porterhouse for two and it was huge, sliced for us and cooked to a perfect medium rare, just as requested.  They also split a loaded baked potato for us and we tried the very grown up tasting truffled mac and cheese and they both were superb.  For dessert, you're kidding right?  No way, no how did we have room for that...  Would come back here any time!!"

We asked to switch to the balcony and the sound level was better. They charge you $9 a bottle for water.  Plan on paying an additional charge for sauce and side dishes. This place is all about worshiping Gordon Ramsay as a demi-god. The neon in the atrium representing his hand motions is just silly. The customer is king not Gordon Ramsey. This restaurant missed that point.'

S"The hubs and I spent a week in Vegas in October 2012.  With so many options in LV, we were looking forward to some amazing food and a great time.  For the most part we were not disappointed, until we went to Gordon Ramsay Steak on our last evening in town.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes prior to our 9pm reservation (which we had made 2 months in advance).  The hostess didn't bother to look up from her book when we checked in with her.  She rudely pointed out that we were early and that we'd be seated at our reservation time.  We proceeded to the bar where we had a few beers.  Our bartender was very warm and attentive (the only good part of the visit).  While at the bar we watched many couples/groups come in after us that were seated after a minimal wait.  At 9:30 I checked in with the hostess again.  She once again did not look up from her book and simply told me we'd be seated once our table was ready.  At 9:45 we had still not been seated (again, our reservation was for 9pm).  I can certainly understand a wait at a restaurant, but I didn't appreciate that everyone around us was being seated and we were not.  We asked the bartender to close our tab and we were prepared to leave.  However, she went and spoke to the hostess and all of a sudden our table was ready.  We contemplated leaving anyway, but decided to stay.  We were seated upstairs and, to my surprise, there were many empty tables.  \n\nOnce seated it took our server another 20 minutes to show up.  Before placing our order my husband mentioned having a food allergy.  To be clear, he never asks for a plate to be modified, he simply asks if the dish he is ordering is safe for him to eat, so that otherwise he can order something else.  The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to deal with this.\n\nAt the end of the day my husband had a filet and i had the short ribs.  My husband was impressed with his meal, but my short ribs were very gristly.  Unfortunately though, it really wouldn't have mattered if the food had been mind-blowing.  Poor service is just unacceptable to me, especially at an expensive restaurant.  We just wanted to get out of there, so we finished our meals and left, no dessert.\n\nWe had been so excited to eat at Gordon Ramsay Steak, I wish it had been different.  We were treated like we should have been grateful to eat there.  We will not be going back.  Too many great options in LV to put up with this nonsense."

S"Came here for my birthday on a Monday night in May, reservations at 8pm. Restaurant was pretty full but our table was ready within about 5 mins of our arrival. Service was excellent. The meat trolley was a really fun & unique way for them to display their cuts. I ordered the Wellington, and the meat melted in my mouth. Delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the rest of it, though. The meat alone was more than filling. One friend ordered the short rib, but it was too salty for her. My other two friends ordered the Fisherman's Grill & both said it was the best seafood they'd ever had. \n\nWe also ordered side dishes to share: the loaded baked potato, roasted heirloom carrots & the mac & cheese. I was pretty full by this point, so didn't try the potato, but they said it was good. The carrots were good but spicy, and the mac & cheese, we all could have eaten a gallon tub of it. It was divine. \n\nWe ordered the sticky toffee pudding w/ brown butter ice cream for dessert & it was worthy of plate licking (we didn't). SO good. They brought out a very yummy complimentary ice cream for my birthday. All in all, a delicious meal & a restaurant we'll def return to next time we're in Vegas."

It really is worth it to treat yourself to his brilliant menu. \n\nOur waiter and his assistant waiter was amazing. Yes, they have assistants. Lol. Anyways, back to the awesomeness. \n\nI had the HK drink and I loved it. It was light and not super sweet. The bread was just the best bread ever. So many different types as well. We had two plates of it while waiting for our food. \n\nAfter debating on what to eat from the menu, I ordered the famous beef Wellington. It was WOW! It's hard to describe it, but it was executed so well! Perfectly cooked. So worth it. My bf had one of the steaks, so many types of cuts to choose from! \n\nOverall, so happy we dined there!"

S"We went here to celebrate our 10 year anniversary.  I read the other reviews, and I mean I read almost every one of them, but I'm glad I did because it gave me some ideas of what items to order. What I found to be consistent was that even the people that gave bad reviews liked at least one item. The Beef Wellington, macaroni & cheese, and the Sticky toffee pudding dessert were among the top items liked. \n\nWe arrived 10 minutes before our reservation and we were sat immediately, so this was a great start. When we were lead in by the hostess we were given the little tour/explanation of the design and the decor and you could tell that she had given this spiel so many times that she was just going through the motions.  But we didn't really care anyway.  When we were seated, we were greeted almost immediately and given a drink menu. Again, another good start. After the meat cart presentation, we ordered the Beef Wellington, and Macaroni and Cheese, as well as fingerling potatoes and the Kobe rib cap.  We were told that the Wellington may take a few extra minutes but we didn't mind the wait and we appreciated the heads up.  We were brought bread before the meal.  It was a variety of different types of bread.  We especially liked the prosciutto pinwheels.   \n\nOur meal arrived sooner than expected, it was presented beautifully, and the taste was incredible. The Wellington and the Rib cap truly melted in your mouth and the macaroni and cheese and fingerling potatoes were a wonderful addition to the meal.  The smokey flavors in both side dishes matched perfectly with the beef.  After many minutes of silence at our table, we started to get full, and we had only eaten half of the meal. The portions were plenty for us.  We knew we had to save a little room for the Sticky Toffee Pudding and we are so glad we did.  It was unbelievably good.  The butter ice cream was amazing!\n\nBy far this was one of the best meals we have had and we will be returning every time we make it to Vegas.  If you have not been there, you have to at least try it once to form your own opinion, we are so happy we did.  The service, food, and atmosphere were top notch."

S"Being a huge fan of Chef Gordon Ramsay and his show Hell's Kitchen, I really wanted to have dinner at this restaurant especially since the Hell's Kitchen Season 10 Winner Christina Wilson I believe is the head chef for the restaurant.  I probably made the reservation specialist a little crazy however, she was very accommodating.  My three buddies and I arrived at the reservation time and were warmly greeted.  The staff requested we go into the lounge for a couple of minutes (we were early by a couple of minutes) to start our experience.  The wait did not even take that long.  We were quickly shown to our booth and as our server Chris was getting ready to wheel the display of steak offerings decided to actually show them to us after asking and we agree.  The display was phenomenal and Chris expertly advised what was on the display.  I personally decided to go with the Beef Wellington which is a Gordon Ramsay signature dish.  Chris advised it only comes one way which was I believe medium rare is what he said.  Not remembering if I have ever had Beef Wellington, I was very pleased with presentation and taste of the Wellington.  It was perfectly prepared, lots of good flavor and the accompaniments to the entree were tasty as well.  I also had the side of pan seared foie gras was beyond belief at how amazing it tasted.  I was definitely in heaven with my meal.  My friends that I was with were equally satisfied with their meals and the wine suggestion of the sommelier in regards to a nice red blend was pretty awesome as well.  I have done a disservice by not mentioning it earlier however, the bread selections in place of dinner rolls were just the right petite size with a ton of flavor.  The one selection I tasted was either with pancetta or prosciutto and was just amazing.  The only thing that would have completed the experience would have been meeting Christina Wilson who I actually saw however, Gordon Ramsay has found a gem for his restaurant as she was discussing something with another member of the staff and quickly disappeared again.  The sommelier advised that Gordon Ramsay was at the restaurant however, was in meetings with some of his staff and when the sommelier went to let Chef know that a huge fan was hoping to possibly meet him, Chef was already gone once again.  No matter what, I would most definitely have dinner at this restaurant once again.  Thank you Chris our server, the restaurant sommelier and the entire staff for an amazing experience and a fantastic meal."

S'This, out of all the experiences we\'ve had on our five weeks trip, is probably one of the most longed restaurant experiences. We booked the table as soon as we decided that we were gonna pass by Vegas, around 3-4 months prior to the actual visit. We didn\'t think that it was such a big deal, since we booked that long in advance. Apparently, the receptionist in our hotel in Vegas disagreed. Once we said this was gonna be one of the highlights in our trip, she commented:"how\'d you guys manage to get a table there?! You booked it 3 years in advance or something?" Boy, did our eyes popped out and our jaws dropped when she mentioned it. Well, luck was in our favour, I guess. \n\nSince we checked out on the internet how we were supposed to dress (business casual), my boyfriend and I slipped into something fancier than our jeans and tshirt. He slipped into a shirt and dark trousers while I into a pair of heels and a dress. When we got there though, we were left a bit disappointed and felt a bit silly with our outfits. We saw people with khaki shorts and checkered board yellow shirt, tshirt, and all those outfits that we never would\'ve thought to be categorised into "business casual". I thought if you want to have a dress code for the restaurant, it would be best to keep it that way.\n\nThe rest of the visit though, was beyond our expectations. We got a table upstairs where people were dressed fancier (plus and minus for us, since we totally missed Christina from Hell\'s Kitchen) and the waiter was very knowledgeable. He pulled out a meat trolley (yes, I mean it!) and showed us the different cuts and all the goodness that came with the cuts. In the end though, we were tempted by the Hell\'s Kitchen tasting menu. We got five dishes and all were accompanied by wine that matches it. To say that the food was great was to say the least. The scotch egg was perfectly cooked, the tomato heirloom salad got this vinaigrette that could turn a meat lover into an herbivore.  The risotto was creamy and scallop was seared finely. The wellington, it just melt in your mouth like it was nobody\'s business. The sticky toffee pudding was just heavenly. It was sticky, sweet, and you just want to lick your plate and ask for second.\n\nIn the end of the night, we left the restaurant very pleased, full and a bit tipsy. I don\'t know if it was the alcohol they kept serving us with each dish that made the food tasted superb, but what I know was that if I was to visit Vegas again, I would definitely make sure to make a reservation here again. Every penny was worth it.'

He was wonderful.\n\nMy fiance and I came in thinking, tv celebrity chef restaurant, how good can it be? It\'s probably all hype. WRONG WRONG WRONG! From the beautiful girl who escorted us to our table to the wonderful servers to the stiff drinks to the amazing food and triple amazing sticky toffee pudding, everything was perfection.\n\nSorry I don\'t have pictures because when food comes out I dig in immediately and don\'t remember to take pictures until I\'m halfway done..\n\nFood: \nHouse Bread and Butter- I\'m a pig and I\'m not ashamed in admitting I asked for more bread despite all the food my fiance and I ordered. \nHamachi Crudo- this was the only "okay" dish of what we ordered. I probably wouldn\'t order it again.\nAmerican Rib Cap with Foie Gras- Amazing. Perfectly cooked and so flavorful.\nBeef Wellington- OMGGGGGGGGGGG. How can something that looks so bland and boring be so jam packed with yummy goodness and flavor?\nSpinach Gratin- Another win\nAsparagus- Another win\nToffee Pudding- Triple win. When I get diabetes from eating this everyday, I will blame it on this dish and have no regrets.\n\nDrinks:\nCan\'t remember what wines we ordered but they were good pairings.\nWe ordered the cocktails and wines from an ipad. Can\'t recall what cocktails we ordered either but they were good and stiff. \n\nService:\nRichard and Jose are awesome!

S"The selection of steak is solid-- USDA Prime, dry aged at least 28 days, real Kobe beef grade A5 for the obligatory princely sum. Just make sure you have a reservation or else good luck getting seated...\n\nFilet mignon and New York strips are excellent, as is the Kobe. The ribeye, on the other hand, was just okay-- I expected better given the glazing and dry aging they claim to do.\n\nMuch like the ribeye, the seafood platter was also just okay. They actually had excellent clams, shrimp, and lobster, but the oysters were a serious letdown. The rest of the meal made up for it, though, with a delicious scotch egg, a solid baked potato, and a ridiculously good haricot vert (tempura-battered green beans). Gnocchi was also a hit.\n\nReal reason for this rating? We had perhaps the slowest meal in the whole restaurant. The tables surrounding us, we saw some had changed over twice in the time we were there, I think one might've changed over three times. The wait between courses was excruciating until the main courses all came out at once. The scotch egg? The seafood platter? I think they were birthing the chickens one by one in the back, and the seafood must've still be on the way from the airport when we ordered.\n\nWaiting for dessert (the toffee thing was awesome) wasn't too bad, but it was definitely more waiting..."

The hubby and I do not go out to expensive restaurants but we love Hell's Kitchen and wanted to try it out. I'm a burgers and fries kinda girl and the hubby likes everything so here are our thoughts on the food.\n\nBread-- yummy!!!! The best thing I ate by far. So much flavor in every bite... I'm sad we didn't get asked if we wanted more like other reviews had said.\nfoie gras--I couldn't eat it. Tasted like a chunk of fat to me. The hubby ate it with no problem. Licked it cleaned.\nEntree-- both got beef wellingtons. I think I enjoyed the carrots and pur\xc3\xa9e better then the Wellington I guess I imagined it tasting better but it literally is just meat wrapped in pastry puff.

Get yourself a new menu provider.  What a waste!\n\nWe had the Beef Wellington, which was a perfectly cook Filet.  However, the crust soon fell apart, although light and flaky in the beginning.\n\nI've found that the more expensive the restaurant, the higher the expectations, the less chance you have of feeling you got your money's worth.  Of course, I haven't eaten at every restaurant in Vegas, but for the 6 or 7 high-end places I've been, I have always been disappointed.

S"I adore Ramsay! So when I first hear he was finally opening up a restaurant here in fabulous Las Vegas, I was delighted!\n\nThe restaurant itself sits inside of the Paris hotel (how fitting) and the entrance serves as a tunnel into London and transforms into the bar/lounge area. Going further in to the right is the expansive yet nicely spaced dining room. Above the room hangs some type of abstract art resembling Ramsay as he cooks in the kitchen. Don't ask me to explain further, I'm still trying to figure out the piece myself.\n\nWhen you're seated and placing your order, a stainless steel cart of meat comes rolling by. All prime cuts served in the restaurant are displayed and your server thoroughly explains the desired cut and preparation. Fancy, I know.  I must say I commend any and all servers who studies their menus. It certainly allows the diner to trust your recommendations.\n\nI've been there twice now and both times, the service has been superb. I've ordered the French onion soup and lobster chorizo to start. Both divine. The onion soup had a nice bite at the end which cuts the richness of the broth. I love lobster and this appetizer keeps you wanting more. So succulent and cooked to perfection. I could even do without that chorizo.\n\nMy main courses consisted of the bone-in rib-eye, Kobe rib cut and beer braised short ribs.  The boyfriend had the rib-eye and the marbling was near perfection. An even amount of fat running through to deliver the most tender cut yet. I had the rib cut and the server wasn't lying, the fat content truly made the meat rich. I'm not one to be able to eat a whole slab of meat in one sitting. So seeing as the cut was less than 8 oz, I thought I'd be able to go\nfinish it. I thought wrong. although it was delicious, it was just too much for me.  The braised short ribs were melt in your mouth divine. Smothered over mashed potatoes...the creamy combination of goodness took me by surprise.  One of my favorite dishes.\n\nLast but not least, dessert. Never can I leave a dining experience without a sweet ending. And a beautiful ending it was. The sticky toffee pudding. Oh my *!!! If I've used the word divine too many times already, I apologize. It was heaven! Scrumptious glob of brown that looks more like bread. But when you cut into it, that sweet, moist, warmth takes over. Ahhhhhh like an orgasm in your mouth. Truly!\n\nOk maybe I got ahead of myself. Sorry again. I'll just end it by saying, go to Ramsay's Steakhouse, it's worth it, even just for that pudding. ;)"

S'I went with my dad on our trip to Vegas on a Sunday night; we went Friday but the kitchen was closed by 11:15, so we just stuck around for a Pimm\'s Cup, which was fantastic and filled with fresh fruit.  It was definitely a sign of things to come.\n\nTwo nights later we arrived for our 9:45 reservations, and it was packed.  The bartender recognized us from a few nights before and got us drinks at the bar while they prepared our table.  Pimm\'s Cup again for me, it was good enough not to care what else may have been on their cocktail menu.\n\nFor those of you unsure about the d\xc3\xa9cor, it was explained to me thusly: the entrance is the Chunnel, leading you from Paris to London.  There are pictures of the Chunnel throughout (in addition to some great shots of the Man Himself over in the corner) which completes the concept.  Also, the neon installation at the center of the ceiling is an approximation of Gordon\'s hands as he prepares the Beef Wellington.  I was kind of iffy about it on first glance, but the concept is cool, so points for that.  Also, a catchy if not somewhat out of place (for fine dining) playlist, but listening to Vampire Weekend and Stone Roses as I ate wasn\'t a turn off for me.\n\nMoving to the table, I figured wine was in due order, so I went with the Shiraz, which complimented the overall richness of the meal nicely.  I started with the onion soup, while my dad went with the iceberg wedge.  The onion soup was incredibly savoury, literally erupting with flavor.  Thank you, Gordon, I\'ll probably never enjoy onion soup again unless it\'s here.  It came complete with 2 pieces of what I can only assume was authentic-to-a-T Welsh rarebit, which added a nice thick, chewiness to an otherwise thin soup.  My dad\'s salad was excellent, but a bit too large for one person (considering what was to come).  The dressing (I don\'t remember what it was) had a nice bite, and the crispy pancetta on the side provided a nice salty contrast to the fresh greens.  In the midst, our bread selection arrived, and though none of the breads themselves were anything too spectacular, the imported Devonshire butter topped with black sea salt was incredibly good, and this likely ruined butter for me going forward.  If you\'re taking score, I\'m likely no longer going to fux with Pimms Cups, onion soup, and butter from here forward.\n\nI can\'t remember if the meats cart came before of after the appetizer, but it\'s not like it matters.  The waiter did an excellent job of describing every piece of steak, and my only source of disappointment at this meal was the fact that I couldn\'t just try them all.  He demonstrated great knowledge of the cuts and their unique characteristics.  As an aside, I would label the service as "alarmingly attentive" in the fact that our waiter seemed legitimately concerned that we weren\'t having the absolute best dining experience of our recent memories, which we definitely were.\n\nFor the entr\xc3\xa9e, I ordered the bone-in NY strip, medium, and my dad the Beef Wellington.  He made a joke upon ordering, asking if the waiter ever tried the Wellington from a bar in St. Louis, I think not fully realizing what he was in for.  This was the last joke he made of the night.  For sides, we ordered saut\xc3\xa9ed spinach and truffled-out fingerling potatoes.  In the time waiting for our meal (surprisingly not long), we mused at the fact that we were the only ones not affixed to our iPhones.  Seriously, people, put the phones down and soak it in at some point.  And take your stupid beanie hats off indoors.  \n\nThe main course arrived in spectacular fashion, and I think both of us weren\'t really prepared to ruin the perfectly-sculpted pieces of meat in front of us.  The Wellington looked particularly impressive, but both were quite large portions.  My steak was tender and cooked to a perfect temperature; a nice crisp texture on the outside which gave way to a warm, pink inner.  My dad\'s looked just as perfect, and we both dug in after gawking at it all for a minute or two.  I knew immediately I wouldn\'t be able to finish it all after the first bite--the steak was so rich and juicy, and the sides were delicious and filling in their own right.  The spinach was a bit too buttery (if that\'s possible) near the bottom of the serving dish, and the potatoes were quite salty, but both provided a nice context to the wonderful, tender steak.  I tried the end of my dad\'s Wellington and it was beyond tender, almost as if it had been slow cooked for days.  The duxelles and p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 underneath the crust provided excellent complements to the rich beef flavor, and the savoury sauce on the plate rounded out an excellent dish.\n\nWe were both satiated to the fullest extent of the word, and while I\'m a bit angry at myself for not ordering lighter and saving room for the sticky toffee dessert, but I don\'t feel like I missed out whatsoever.  We\'ll be back at some point to try everything we missed, and maybe next time we\'ll go all-in for the Tasting Menu.  5 stars.'

S"Well, I don't even know where to start and sorry for being so late getting this review in.  I had the fortunate opportunity to go to Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse on the Las Vegas Strip , September 13, 2012.   One of the most amazing meals I've ever had and I want to share the experience, so that if you should ever have a chance to dine there, you should!  \n\nEverything was just perfect and what started it off was the waiter,  Donald (Donny)!  I can still see his face and his attention to his job was impeccable.  Yes, I know it is a pricey dinning experience, but you should go there and order the Beef Wellington.  You will never forget it and after every bite that melts in your mouth, you will be wishing for it from now on!  Also, make sure you don't leave without eating the Sticky Pudding!  I can't remember the appropriate name, but that should be enough to get the right dessert.\n\nAnother highlight of the evening was Christina Wilson, that had just won Hell's Kitchen.  That was the night she came in to start her new adventure.  I got to meet her and she talked in length with me.  Probably because I was seated at the top of the stairs where she was going up and down, so I calmly yelled to her to come over.  Maybe it's a Texas thing!  Sure didn't want her to get away!  :)  She was delightful and I'm praying she is doing well there, because she deserves to be.\n\nSo, make sure you go to Gordon Ramsey Steak, on the Las Vegas Strip and have a couple of good drinks, the Beef Wellington and Sticky Pudding!!!  Enjoy and make sure when you make your reservations, try to ask for Donald (Donny) to be your waiter!!!  Who knows, you might even get to meet Christina!  You won't be disappointed, I promise!!!  All the Best to All that reads this and Happy 2013!!!! \n \nJama from Lubbock, Texas"

S"Wonderful service. To die for mac and cheese ( I am not a mac and cheese fan), delicious Strawberry martini's, and almost tied with my favorite desert of all time... Sticky Toffee Pudding. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the filet was not the best I have had, not close. It was good, but for the price I expected exceptional."

S'Fantastic place to have dinner, whether a celebration is taking place or for no reason at all. My wife and I had dinner on Jan 06, 2013 and the food was deliciously overwhelming. The "fury for flavor" will engage all your senses and leave you wanting more. The drinks are well mixed and delicious, well worth the 10-14 price range. Last but not least, the ambiance is phenomenal; from the staff to the attention to detail put into the decor and service. I will recommend this a to a friend and I will eat here again, again, and again!'

S'Buying an experience in Vegas as a tourist!\n\nExcited and had a small hype among friends over GR steak before my trip to Vegas.\nGlad that I was able to squeeze into the last reservation of the night at 10-ish pm on that day itself, thanks to the help of the concierge at Paris Las Vegas!\n\nGotta agree with other yelpers on "being lost after waitress at door asked you to proceed in to the restaurant". Basically you just sit and wait till someone notices you after you entered the restaurant. If not, bug them till they showed you your seats. Else not, you will just be left on the sofa waiting....\n\nAfter about 15mins, we were being showed to our seats, and had the menu to look at. Not long after, our waitress rolled out the beef parts and had an excellent introduction of the meat! So detailed, so good!\n\nI decided on the kobe fillet, paired with a glass of Belle Glos Pinot Noir with the waitress\'s recommendation. AWESOME!\n\nWe had side dishes too, some mac n cheese, sauteed asparagus and spinach for our table of 3.\n\nThe experience: AMAZING! (expect for that initial feeling lost part...)\nService: Good. Very attentive during serving, and very professional.\nFood: Really the best steak I\'ve tasted.\nPrice: Burnt a hole in my pocket but worth that try!\n\nPartied off the high scoring meat (fats) after our real late dinner at 11pm that night.\n\nI\'M IN LOVE, with GR AND VEGAS!'

S'I chose to go here because it was ranked the #1 steakhouse in all of Las Vegas, and I would have to agree with that ranking.\n\n\nOnce you arrive at the exterior of the restaurant, which is within the Paris hotel, you\'ll be greeted by a group of hostesses. They escort you to the door,  which from the outside appears to be a large glass/metal tube, but once the doors open, Gordon Ramsay\'s steakhouse is revealed. The decor is a lot of what you would expect when you think of Hell\'s Kitchen. It is black, red, dark and its wonderful. It has an extremely modern British feel, and it sets the perfect tone for a memorable night out to dinner. Not one single square inch of this restaurant went without some thought put into it. Above the restaurant hangs  an art piece, constructed of neon lights, depicting Gordon Ramsay\'s hand movement while making Beef Wellington.\n\n\n\nThe Food\n\nAfter greeting us, the waiter brought a food cart over with an assortment of all of the steak served at the restaurant. He gave us an option between a Hell\'s kitchen tasting menu which came with an autographed picture of Gordon Ramsay cooking, and he gave us a traditional menu. It was quite impressive. They even had Japanese Kobe available, however at $35 an ounce I had to pass. I elected to have the American Kobe filet, which was well marbleized and under $80.  Next the waiter let us hold and smell a white truffle, which is an option when ordering any Ramsey steak, but at $15 a gram and a three gram minimal order, I passed.\n\nI did op for the second best "truffle" alternative which was macaroni and cheese cooked and white truffle oil, and it was absolutely scrumptious. When our steaks arrived, about 45 minutes after ordering, they were cooked to absolute perfection and I could not have asked for anything better. \n\nThe wait between ordering and receiving your food however is a tad bit long, but it gives you more time to soak it all in.\n\n\nIf you\'re looking for a great steak and a wonderful experience and perhaps a memory that will last a lifetime, I highly recommend Gordon Ramsay\'s Steak, located inside the Paris Hotel Las Vegas.'

S"I consider myself quite the steak fan, and having been to vegas a ton of times, I feel like I have a very good sample of what the best this city has to offer. Whenever I try a new steakhouse for the first time, I judge the place by it's rib eye.\n\nI had a pretty decent 24oz bone in rib eye. It was definitely a prime cut, but the seasoning was very underwhelming. I always refuse to put steak sauces as I am quite the minimalist when it comes to steak, but almost ordered some sauce this time. This was actually a bit shocking, as Gordon himself is quite the critic on his TV shows about other chefs and cooks being shy with seasoning. I also ordered pan seared foie gras which was rather small for the price. Their wines by the glass were quite subpar as well for a steakhouse.\n\nFor those vegas goer's that are looking for a good meal with great music, ambiance, and a dog and pony show (they make up some stupid comment about some shuttle taking you from Paris to London har har), this is your place. For those that are looking for a GREAT steak, consider looking elsewhere, but i don't particularly think you can go wrong if you wanted to just try the brand. \n\nIf you can't get a table here, I'd consider these ranked by my personal opinion top to bottom:\n\nCarnevino (if dining for two as the rib eye for two is probably the best I ever had)\nDelmonico (perfect for those who are minimalists like me who don't mind a little butter)\nCraftsteak (good for ambiance too)\nCut\nPrime\n\nHonorable mention:\nEnvy\nLawry's ( not really Steak but damn good)\nGallagher's"

S'"We all live in a yellow submarine" cos\xc3\xac cantavano i Beatles nel 69, e in questo stesso modo era giusto iniziare questa recensione. \n\nPerch\xc3\xa9, vi chiedete... nessuno in particolare, avevo in mente la canzone da quando Fabio P. mi ha detto del sommergibile per infusioni che lui ed Elena M. hanno a casa (ce l\'abbiamo anche noi, peraltro).\n\nGordon Ramsay Steak \xc3\xa8 un\'istituzione, una leggenda, una porta socchiusa ai confini del sole e, perch\xc3\xa9 no, anche in incantesimo dischiuso tra i petali del tempo (per Rina). Il locale \xc3\xa8 esclusivo, forse uno dei pi\xc3\xb9 esclusivi in cui sono stato, e curato nei minimi dettagli. Il piano terra ha una parte lounge e arredata in stile moderno in cui le ragazze in nero, che hanno immediatamente charmato parte della cricca (di Dawson, vedi Dawson\'s Creek sempre senza alcun motivo) con cui ero andato, hanno provato ad infilarci prima di rendersi conto che per quella sera, la prima a Las Vegas, questa eccelsa steakhouse non ci avrebbe sfamato.\nSenza disperare (pi\xc3\xb9 di tanto) prenotammo un tavolo per il giorno dopo e fu cos\xc3\xac che dopo 24 lungherrime (si, avete letto bene LUNGHERRIME) ore abbiamo avuto l\'onore ed il privilegio (ed il pregiudizio, per non farci mancare nulla) di cenare qui, al primo ed elegante piano del locale.\n\nLa qualit\xc3\xa0 del servizio non \xc3\xa8 definibile, al contrario \xc3\xa8 lei ad aver definito un nuovo metro di paragone per i miei futuri Gimme Five (Stars, non la canzone di Jovanotti, mi raccomando). Abbiamo avuto un cameriere che ha portato una grossa ruota di metallo in cui erano posti i cinque pregiati tagli di carne scelti da Ramsay in persona per Steak. Il simpatico cameriere non si \xc3\xa8 scomposto neanche quando gli \xc3\xa8 stato detto che i filetti in Italia sono alti meno di 1cm (WTF! Lo possiamo dire in coro) e si \xc3\xa8 scusato quando la pasta ordinata come sidedish (paese che vai, usanze che trovi) era scotta (vedi ultima parentesi). Per gli alcolisti, anonimi o meno, si segnala la presenza di sommelier e iPad per la scelta dei vini... quindi puoi andare tranquilla Elisa V.!\n\nCercare di descrivervi il cibo sarebbe riduttivo quanto un filetto alto 1cm, \xc3\xa8 giusto che io lo dica. Tutto, e dico TUTTO (si sa, le scritte in maiuscolo sono pi\xc3\xb9 potenti perch\xc3\xa9 seguono lo stesso principio logico-scientifico del "da red wunz go fasta!"), era curato nei minimi dettagli! Persino la normale acqua era importata dalla Scozia perch\xc3\xa9 si abbinava meglio ai piatti serviti.\nOvviamente imperatore della serata (il re \xc3\xa8 quello allo zola) \xc3\xa8 stato il FILETTO ALLA WELLINGTON, un\'eccezionale esplosione di gusto racchiusa in una piccola crosta di pasta sfoglia (e per fortuna non in un minuscolo spazio vitale, altrimenti tutta la lampada di quel povero genio puzzerebbe di carne :( ) fragrante al punto giusto. Io l\'ho abbinato a dei funghi che esaltavo il gusto pieno e completo di filetto, pur\xc3\xa8 e riduzione di vino rosso splendidamente... insomma, se siete arrivati fino a questo punto della recensione dovreste solo guardare la foto che ho pubblicato ed invidiarmi, non avete altra scelta (tanto pi\xc3\xb9 che se un povero Balrog non pu\xc3\xb2 passare per un ponte di certo voi non avete il diritto di NON invidiarmi!).\n\nGordon Ramsay Steak \xc3\xa8 un\'esperienza unica ed epica (e, perch\xc3\xa9 continuiamo a non farci mancare nulla, anche un po\' power metal) che sarei pronto a rifare in qualunque momento, questo \xc3\xa8 il risultato della mia cena l\xc3\xac, e non solo... dopo aver provato questo desidero cos\xc3\xac tanto collezionare tutti i ristoranti di Chef Ramsay che manco Ash Ketchum riuscir\xc3\xa0 a sconfiggermi!'

S'In my opinion this place is overhyped because of the name attached to it. My issue(s) with this place: as have been echoed by many other reviews, the atmosphere is not what you expect for a $50 (minimum) a plate kind of place. The service was clearly catered to larger parties, such as the loud one of 11+ sitting in the same room as us. There were times when we would ask for water to have to wait until a new person walked by and we could stop them and ask for some water. The food was good, but nothing to write home to your mom about. I enjoyed by chicken (know that if you order it there is a 40 minute cooking wait time) but some of it was too" decadent". Rich with too many flavors at points as if the chef was really trying to show off how to use truffle oil crunchy crap and what not. I do have to say that the hostesses were nice. I just really wish someone would have asked the party sitting next to us to lower their volumes especially when one of them started to get vulgar'

S'Service was phenomenal as you would expect from a big name restaurant. Probably the best service I have ever experienced. It didn\'t seem pretentious like some other luxury restaurants. \n\nWe had the fried oysters, ribeye, beef wellington, mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and the sticky toffee pudding.\n\nRibeye was good. Tender, good flavor, cooked just right. If you love a fine piece of steak, you won\'t be disappointed.\n\nBeef Wellington was great. The beef melts in your mouth and the crusty pastry went well with it.\n\nThe sticky toffee pudding was the best dessert I\'ve ever had. It looks simple but the texture and flavor was unbelievably amazing.\n\nThe atmosphere is not really "fine dining," it has a lively atmosphere with a lot of energy. It\'s a great fit for Vegas.\n\nI can\'t think of anything to complain about.'

S"Arrogant!  NOT A CUSTOMER FRIENDLY EXPERIENCE, nor a restaurant I would ever visit again.\n\nA group of us were looking forward to trying Gordon Ramsay's restaurant Stake for the first time on a recent visit to Las Vegas, we were very disappointed with what occurred. When we arrived in the not so busy restaurant we were sat at the bar for 5 min. before we were ushered to our table.  \n\nOnce seated our waitress arrived with menus and a special VERY MUCH RECOMENDED tasting menu.  We discussed it and decided to try the tasting menu and wine pairing a $175 pp option not including tax or tip.  When we told the waitress that I do not eat beef (there was one item on the tasting menu that contained beef) and asked if we could have the chef substitute a fish dish or some other non-beef dish she flatly told us no.  We asked what if other four had the tasting menu and I would order instead off the menu, again we were told NO.  We asked to see the manager, a young lady came to the table and again said there is nothing they can do about this, she confirmed  it is true as few as two can share the tasting menu but it is served only to the entire table or nothing.  Because of this lack of accommodation and customer service we got up and left and all agreed never to go to another of Gordon Ramsay's establishments. What ever happened to the customer is always right?  This was a very disappointing experience and certainly a very customer unfriendly place. In this day and age it is amazing to find such a lack of customer concern, not to mention the $1000 meal they turned down, guess it is great to be independent and not need or care about business lost. I have but one word for the entire experience, Arrogant."

S'This has been a place I have waited a long time to attended and after my 6th trip to Vegas I was finally able to go, and let me tell you, it was AMAZING!\n\nMy one caveat is that you will pay for it, there is no economical way to eat here, so if you are not willing to pay a premium I suggest you take a pass. If you are willing to dish out the money,  I suggest you do it right (go big or go home right?) and do the whole experience from apps to wine to thick juicy steak and dessert.\n\nFrom the get go, it is made poignantly clear that YOU are the guest of honor, as a host of servers descend upon your table to take immediate and overwhelming care of you. Furthermore, our server was about one of the best servers I have ever had, with great charm and a genuine interest in taking care of us. Our sommelier was also absolutely fantastic, offering us a great recommendations without trying to blatantly drive the price up on us. Please take advantage of their extensive knowledge and care, as they love what they do, and offer an incredible service that you seldom find in other establishments(its not like your neighborhood Chili\'s will be offering you inside scoop on the grape variations from the Bordeaux region and which one more perfectly pairs with your "Top Shelf Enchiladas") \n\nEverything I ate here was amongst the best or the best of that particular offering I have ever had. The gnocchi, for example, was hands down the best I have ever had, as it simple melted away on your pallet with a symphony of flavors and layers. The entire presentation of their various cuts of beer is truly impressive and you simply can\'t go wrong, Our table decided to do a mixture so that we may all try the different cuts. I must admit that my personal favorite was shockingly Ramsay\'s signature dish, the Beef Wellington. They warn you it takes about 45 minutes to prepare, but it is oh so worth it. Across the board, these are amongst the best cuts of beef in the world, and you will surly be on the benefiting side of things. Your taste buds will be treated to a celebration flavors so few are truly blessed to have experienced. \n\nOn to dessert! (and trust me you will not want to skip out on dessert) This is the sweet exclamation point on what is a truly otherworldly culinary adventure. Please do yourself a favor and order the Toffee puddings, and buckle up as your mind is about to be blown! Words can no do this dessert justice, so just take my advice and go for it, you will not regret it.\n\nSo with that, I wish all of you who are about to embark upon this journey a Bon App\xc3\xa9tit, and hope that you enjoy your sojourn as much as I did. Remember, keep an open mind, be adventurous, and for the love of G-d don\'t wear shorts or sandals to a HIGH END RESTAURANT!  =)'

S'This was such a wonderful experience! The restaurant atmosphere was very comfortable and modern. The beautiful art piece on the ceiling was created, in part, by special gloves that Gordon Ramsay wore while making his signature dish, the Beef Wellington. We were served by an amazing team, Donnie and Mohomadu! Our dinner included the chorizo stuffed Maine Lobster and Hudson Valley Foie Gras to start, which was incredible, especially the lobster with chorizo (the spice of the chorizo didn\'t over power the lobster, they went beautifully together, a dish I will crave for a very long time). To follow... we ordered the Beef Wellington for 2 and fell in love! I have never had a filet that was so tender you could cut it with a fork! Our sides included Saut\xc3\xa9ed Spinach, Roasted Heirloom Carrots, in a hot wing sauce, light, spicy, deliciousness! To finish we indulged in Gordon Ramsay\'s signature Sticky Toffee Pudding that was incredibly moist with a heavenly brown butter ice cream (the creaminess is beyond words), a French Press Coffee (this could have been dessert in itself with the 3 chocolate dipped spoons lettered "A" for Amaretto, "B" for Bailey\'s, "C" for Chambord) and the Apple Tart Tatin with a frangipane filling (I wish I could tell you how this tasted, apparently very good since my husband devoured it while I was looking in awe of my dessert...when I looked up his was gone)! \n\nWe did not get to meet Gordon Ramsay but we did meet two very wonderful people, Donnie and Mohomadu, who\'s service was exceptional and memorable. We never felt unattended to, their grace, efficiency and mannerism were a representation of sheer excellence in fine dining and customer service. We will only ask for their service in the future. \nThank you, Donnie, for being so intuitive and Mohomadu for your warm smile! It\'s rare to find such a great team!!'

S'It could have been a great experience...but service totally ruined our "good experience". So why a 4 star? Because the food was still great, just service was... ugh. You would expect much more from a place like this. So when you come in, they only give you the drink menu to order, then 15 minutes come to get your drink order. Then 15 minutes later they give you the regular menu. 10 minutes later then come to get your order, and if you don\'t get an appetizer, the waiter "frowns" upon you and would tell you this "well your entrees are going to take longer to come out because you\'re not ordering a appetizer" That doesn\'t make sense? Because if we order appetizers, wouldn\'t it take even longer for our entrees to come out? I think he thought we were cheap, and that was not the case. \n\nWe ordered beers, and didn\'t want appetizers because we didn\'t want to get full. We didn\'t even touch the bread. We know with steak places like this, the steak is huge and appetizers would make us even more full. We also order 2 sides (potatoes & mac n cheese) and the waiter was like "you would usually order 3. We felt like he was trying to up sale on everything and gave us an attitude when we didn\'t take his recommendations. I felt he thought we were cheap and didn\'t want to order a lot. FYI, we had a show to attend and couldn\'t waste our time on food we didn\'t eat. Ugh, it\'s service like this! Vegas nobody gives you good service because they will always have people coming, but geez, this guy man... we gave him more than 20% tip too. He doesn\'t deserve it! \n\nThe steak was good. I shared a porterhouse for 2 with my bf, the filet melted in your mouth. Good filet part. The NY strip part was good, wasn\'t the best, but it was good. Not the best steakhouse I\'ve been too (probably service turned us off a bit too) Sides were great though, the mac and cheese was sooo good. \n\nWe made reservations a month in advance. We still love Gordon Ramsay. Just be prepare to be judged... but again, "that\'s Vegas" for you.'

S"Atmosphere: The hostesses were dressed in skin tight black dresses, and the wait staff wore white button downs with tucked in ties. Their attire wasn't my favorite; but hey, I didn't have to wear it so rock on, Gordon Ramsay Steak staff! The guests' attire was quite varied, even for Las Vegas - everything from jeans and t-shirts to cocktail attire was on display. \n\nThe d\xc3\xa9cor of the restaurant was very unique and sleek. You enter through a cylindrical tube and are immediately dumped into the bar area. Red is vibrantly featured throughout the restaurant, capped off with a custom humongous light fixture that was inspired by the knife strokes of Gordon Ramsay. Our hostess pointed this out while seating us, which I thought was an interesting and fun fact. \n\nAs we passed through the first floor and the front of the second floor, I couldn't help but notice how incredibly loud the restaurant was. Luckily we were seated towards the back of the second floor, so we were able to talk during dinner. \n\nService: Wow. Wow. Wow! Yarmon was hands down one of the best servers we have ever had in any restaurant. He was funny, helpful, extremely nice, knowledgeable, and attentive without being overbearing. I can't say enough nice things about him. He truly enhanced our dining experience! \n\nFood: We each ordered the American rib cap and it was delicious. We shared the mac & cheese and fingerling potatoes as our sides, and both were excellent. The food was outstanding! We asked for recommendations and details on drinks, and again Yarmon delivered. \n\nOverall, this was one of the best meals and dining experiences we have had. It will definitely be added to my list of must-visit restaurants for returns to Vegas!"

S'I would not recommend this place due to its lame services and overpriced food. \n\nI have been to several good restaurants in other places and was expecting at least similar level of services since I have been impressed with the shows of Gordon Ramsay. However, I was disappointed. \n\nThe server was not available during the meal. He was not checking whether we wanted any more water for at least 20 minutes. I felt ignored and not happy. Secondly, the server left us with the Hell kitchen menu for at least 10-15 minutes. Also when we already wanted to check out, he still insist that we look at the desert menu. \n\nI will not come back to this place.'

I don't know which is better. \nThe wine is over priced. But my $28 glass of Cabernet tasted great.\nI would eat here again but next time I would pass on the butter poached lobster tail and loaded baked potato. The lobster was OK but not worth the $38 for 4 inches of tail. That's $10 per bite. And the baked potato was no better than I could do at home. Very skimpy on the toppings."

Our waiter, Abraham, was the best. The sommmelier  (wine guy) was very helpful and unpretentious .  A very high end meal, but worth it!

S"Once I booked my hotel for a weekend in Vegas, I immediately called Gordon Ramsay Steak to make reservations for dinner. I heard so many good things about the place, and my expectations were met.\n\nWhen you first enter the restaurant, the hostess takes the time to explain to you the setup and decor of the restaurant. Not long after we were seated, our waiter came up to us to give us menus. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. He took the time to explain to us all the different cuts of meat available while displaying a cart with huge slabs of each type of meat.\n\nWe ended up ordering the Bone-In Rib Eye and Kobe Skirt, along with a side of Fingerling Potatoes and the Maine Lobster as an appetizer. Everything was delicious! Even the free bread (3 different kinds) was gourmet and not the typical cheap stuff. The lobster was stuffed with chorizo (yummy!) and the creamy sauce added nice flavors to it. We asked for both our entrees to be cooked medium, but the rib eye was little undercooked so we had to send it back. Aside from that, everything else about the rib eye and Kobe was great. I also enjoyed the truffle oil that was added to the crispy fingerling potatoes. Although we were full, we had to try at least one of the desserts and ordered the Banoffee. It was a delicious combination of banana (in small pastry tarts), toffee, and coffee ice cream. \n\nAlthough the food was great, the part that impressed me the most was the service. We had an early dinner at 5pm, but the restaurant got really crowded not long after we arrived. Despite this, we still received a lot of attention from our waiters. They were all friendly and polite, and often came by to wipe away crumbs or water on the table.\n\nThe food here is pricey, but I wouldn't mind dining here every once in awhile when I'm in Vegas. It also depends on how much you order and plan to eat. Between the three of us, we had more than enough food to get full off of (came out to ~$65/person after tax and tip). Also, make sure you give them your Total Rewards card to save a couple dollars on each dish!"

S"Let me tell you when I say I will definitely be coming back.  Let me tell you why... The experience, front to back, was excellent.  We get there 35  minutes early and head over to the bar to get a drink or two while we wait for our table. I don't understand that other persons comment about looking dumb standing there because no waitress came up to them.  Stupid... We just asked the nearest waitress if we could sit at this table ( we pointed at an  empty table)  and she said sure.  Easy!  Promptly at our 7 pm reservation time a waitress found us and escorted us to our table.  Now comes the real experience.  Our waiter,  Dennis,  was friendly, professional and casual all wrapped up in one.  He attended to our needs  without fault.  Matter in fact,  everyone there showed remarkable professionalism.  I had the Wellington for my main.  It was better than I expected.  My wife had the ahi  steak medium.  She said it was delish.  Although I was pretty stuffed,  mind you I'm a 250 lb  guy and yes I was pretty stuffed,  Dennis suggested the sticky toffee pudding.  That was one of the best desserts I've ever eaten.  Now, while all this is happening,  there's this meat rack cart rolling around.  My God,  the cuts of meat on there ,raw, made me drool.  Thus, the reason I'm going back is to sink my teeth into one of them humongous porter house steaks.  To top things off,I got to meet Christina, winner of\nHells Kitchen  season 10.  Got to snap a photo with her and Dennis.  What an evening.  Definitely one to remember.  And,I got to share it all with my awesome wife.  We're both avid Gordon Ramsay  fans. I 100%  recommend this place to all."

S"I am a fan of Ramsay and let me say I got what I paid for. Tried the beef Wellington plate. It was worth the wait of 45 mins! I loved that on the menu it stated how long the plate took to cook, everything tasted great from simple fries to the main entree. We didn't have a reservation but the host advised there was a lounge area available. I had my son and was a bit unsure if it would be appropriate to sit there but they allowed us to look before saying yes. It was 5 little dark tables by the main restaurant and bar, very convenient. More families where seated there throughout the my wait. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is I don't feel the restaurant was design for families, despite the fact we enjoyed our meal and there was other families there next to the lounge are we all seemed a bit uncomfortable. I get it is inside the casino and so are the other 2 Ramsay's restaurants. All 3 are very fancy and the tables are right next to each other, so even if they allow kids it doesn't give room for enjoyment. Loved the food and would definitely come back and pay $140 for 2 people!!"

S'Just had my birthday dinner here and I have to say that I wasn\'t too impressed. My boyfriend and I arrived to the restaurant about thirty minutes early. The hostess\' outside the restaurant were very friendly and escorted us into the restaurant. As we were seated, our waiter arrived and gave us an iPad. When I made a reservation at the restaurant, I let them know that it was for a birthday dinner. The waiter just asked who\'s birthday is it? And I said mine. He just looked at me and said oh happy birthday with no enthusiasm and stated that there were over 40 selections of beers to choose from and cocktails, and just left. After waiting over 15 minutes, our waiter comes by and takes our drink orders. \n\nWe finally ordered our entrees and our waiter continued to have almost like a cocky attitude. Never smiled. Never said thank you. Never even asked if we had any questions about the menu. He just said are you ready? I ordered our appetizer and my entree and our waiter looked at my boyfriend and said \'and u, what are you ordering?\' It almost felt as if he was talking down on him. \n\nWe ordered the shrimp cocktail $19. Three jumbo shrimp in a refreshing sauce. The watermelon cubes complemented the dish well! I loved the little salt on the watermelon also. The salt enhances the watermelon flavor in a unique way. I ordered the braised short ribs $40. The meat was a little fatty, but flavor wise it was good. It could have a little more salt. The spinach that came with the dish was very salty though. My boyfriend got the filet $54. The filet was good, but we had better tasting filets. The meat was not as tender as we wished. Our sides we ordered were Mac n cheese $13 and brussel sprouts $12. Both the sides were delicious. The Mac n cheese has to be the winner tho! \n\nFlying from Hawaii to celebrate my 25th birthday here I was expecting a better experience. At the end of our meal, our waiter just dropped off the dessert menu and said our toffee cake is the best and rushed off. We ended up not getting dessert. No complementary dessert was even offered. I expected a place like this would offer something small for a birthday or anniversary celebration, but I guess not. The saying "Don\'t expect anything because you\'ll only be disappointed" was how I felt about this whole experience. \n\nWould not recommend this place. Food is good, but there are plenty of delicious places on the strip. Not a very romantic setting. Loud. Did not feel special. Waiter sucked.'

If you are going to charge that kind of money for your food, your service better be top notch. Not what I expected for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. I know it's a Saturday night at 11 but you should give the same service no matter what time it is. I hope this is not normal. I would like to try it again maybe sometime."

S'"Nearly As Hawt As Me"\n\nIt was a nice evening so I parked across the street. I rode the elevator from the parking garage, cut through the casino and made my way outside. The fountains were still, tourists waiting with cameras for the show to begin. I was wearing a white Honolua shirt with tan Dockers and brown New Balances. I had just worked out and looked unbelievably sexy, so much so that I had almost cancelled dinner in favor of staying home to stare at myself in the mirror. But friends were in town from back East so my narcissism would have to wait. \n\nI crossed The Strip behind a sculpted Milfer, then swung left at Miracle Mile. It was a short jaunt from there and I strode in the side entrance of Paris Hotel/Casino. I winked at my reflection in a hallway mirror and hit the main room. Somewhat busy but not too bad, enough to have fun, not enough to feel smothered. I was early so I dropped a twenty in a Wheel of Fortune machine. I quickly doubled my money and cashed out. \n\nI toured the gaming area while searching for Gordon Ramsay. As I walked I passed Mon Ami Gabi, instantly remembering having eaten there years ago. Eventually, I spotted my destination and stopped at the greeting stand. Two nearly-as-hawt-as-me brunettes in skintight black attire plastic-smiled me and asked if I had a reservation. I said no, that I was meeting some people at the bar. They told me to go right in. I stud-muffined by another Robert Palmer Addicted To Love chickie dressed in black, deflecting her mannequin-like rictus with little damage. \n\nIt was dark inside the bar, and I slowly scanned the patrons. I hadn\'t seen these friends in nearly 20 years so I wasn\'t sure they had remained as attractive as I had; therefore, I was fearful of not recognizing them. But, alas, I need not have worried. They spotted me immediately and called me over.\n\nAfter the requisite hellos and how are yous and you look great nonsense, I sat between them and ordered a seven dollar Stone Pale Ale. We talked about people we knew, the old neighborhood, and our quickly aging selves. As we sipped our drinks I noticed a hairline crack in my glass. I mentioned it to our barman, but not until I had finished the ale. He sincerely apologized and gave me another beer on the house. As we rambled on we looked over the menu. \n\nMostly a steak and chop place, the average Gordon Ramsay entree looked to be around 50+ bucks. My companions had already stated that tonight\'s meal was on them, but I was never one to order something pricey when someone else was footing the bill. So I glossed over the more expensive items and went with a simple roasted chicken breast. My pal went with rib-eye and baked potato and his wife selected foie gras and caesar salad. The restaurant was pretty crowded so we decided to stay at the bar.\n\nThere were three bartenders at the counter. A blonde, a brunette and our man, Oscar. Oscar was the pleasant type, gracious and attentive throughout. When our food came he asked if our drinks were okay and then left us to our meal.\n\nMy chicken was a nice golden brown with some crispy skin on the side. It lay upon a bed of wet wild rice that I wish there had been more of. But the bird tasted good and I supplemented the poultry with a fine assortment of breads. I took a look at my buddy\'s steak and potato. Jesus Christ. That slab was shaped like the state of Montana and almost as thick as a Dostoevsky tome. And the spud? Honest to God it was the size of a football. He enjoyed both immensely as did his wife the liver and greens AND her new best friend beside her who turned out to be from our area back east. Her new bestie was a veterinarian, in town for a convention. \n\nAnyway, we chatted a bit more about good times and bad. More of the former than the latter, but neither of less importance. When the bill came my chum grabbed it immediately, charging it to his room. I asked if he needed any money, if I could please leave the tip. He waved me off. \n\nWe stood to depart and gathered outside. Slot machines rang and whistled as we said our goodbyes. I wished them well on the remainder of their cross-country trip and headed for the exit. As I hit The Strip I wondered to myself if I should not perhaps return to Gordon Ramsay one day. Foot the bill on my own and get a fat slice of beef with a double Scotch.\n\nI smiled as desert wind and tourist cologne whisked through my hair, now longer than it had ever been. \n\n"Yes," I whispered aloud as I walked with strangers in the night, "that sounds like the most wonderful of ideas."'

S'I gave this place four stars NOT because of the food.  That would have received 5 stars.  I gave it four stars for two reasons.  Allow me to explain:\n\n1. We had a magnum of wine we wanted to bring with us.  We specifically asked over the phone what the corkage fee was and if it was higher because the bottle was bigger.  They assured us it was not.  We were very pleased at this.  Only when we got there, they told us since it was the equivalent of 3.5 bottles, we would have to pay four corkage fees, for a grand total of $140.  Now, if that is your policy, fine.  But please have your staff tell patrons over the phone that this is the case.  When the person who came to tell us told us "he\'d make it right," we assumed he would.  Well, the bill included the $140 fee.  They eventually did  "make it right and only charged us for one," but you would expect a place of this caliber to not make these mistakes.  I mean, I know that $140 for four bottles of decent wine at a steakhouse is still a steal, but it was the principle of the inconsistency that bothered me.\n\n2. The decor and vibe of the place is great!  Very hip.  LOVE the Union Jack on the roof and the music.  BUT ... if you go in a slightly larger party (we had 7), they might stick you in a stuffy, typical steakhouse room.  I was so disappointed.  I wanted to ask if we could be moved, but my party was being complacent, so I shut my mouth.  LOL  Just be aware of this - that if you are trying to go because it\'s NOT the typical steakhouse but go in a group, you might get stuck there.  If you don\'t want this, I would tell them when I make the reservation.  \n\nHaving said this, the food was fantastic, as were the waiter and bus boy service. I agree that the commemorative and autographed Ramsay prix-fixe thing is a little tacky.  The fried blue point oysters were fantastic, as was the porterhouse for two (although it was a little cold).  The mac and cheese was also great, but anything that has truffle oil gets my vote.  The people at the table who had the famous beef wellington were impressed, and the sticky toffee pudding was amazing. Oh, and my martini had this olive in it with bacon added to the blue cheese olive (it might have had another cheese in it; can\'t remember .. bartender told me, but I forget).  Point is, it was delicious. \n\nI would definitely give Ramsay Steak a try if I was in Vegas.  I will probably go again just  in a smaller party.'

S"I went here on Friday night for my fancy birthday dinner with the BF. There were some definite highs and some lows. Let me start by saying this place was suuuuuper fancy. Like....they import their water in from Wales (I really don't understand that...seems extremely wasteful to me....), they present raw steaks on a special steak presenting thing with mirrors on it....whoa.... Also, they give you an ipad to look at the drink menu...this is kind of dumb because the real menu is not on an ipad, so it didn't really make sense. Anyway, on to the food! They start you out with 4 different types of bread...one more delicious than the next, with butter and volcanic sea salt or something fancy. One of the breads tasted like bacon....yum. I ordered the beef wellington and the BF ordered the short ribs and, at the waiter's recommendation, we got the mac and cheese. Well, the wellington was good, but it wasn't amazing. The beef was great, it was very soft, but the crust just didn't have much flavor. The potato puree was very very tasty and so were the roasted vegetables. The BF's short ribs were good, but not as soft as short ribs usually are. The sauce was very good though. The mac and cheese was too bleu chees -y (despite the waiter telling us you couldn't even taste the bleu cheese). Also, the portions were very large, especially for a fancy restaurant. I'm not sure why the waiter made it seem like we needed a side, we definitely did not. We ended up sending the mac and cheese back....it wasn't bad, but it wasn't to our tastes. We finished with the sticky toffee pudding which was ridiculously good. The caramel was rich and the butter ice cream was crazy good. The presentation was also cute. This place was overall good, but for the price, I didn't think it had enough 'yummyness.' I liked Spago better when I've gone in the past, but this place is definitely an experience and I'd recommend giving it a try."

S"What a dr jekyll and mr hyde dining experience!\n\nWe arrived about 8 minutes late to our 6:15 reservations.  our table wasn't ready yet so we were shown to the bar side / waiting area.\n\nFirst impressions,  Great decor, cool uniforms and very easy to tell who is a hostess, wait staff, bar tender, chef, etc.   I also noticed how loud it was in there..  just a tiny bit below the volume of a night club. \n\nI was there with my wife, 1.5 year old daughter, brother in law & mother in law .  the music turned up so loud it was hard to hear each other and hard to hear the staff.  we were given a tablet to looks at drinks . I couldn't hear what the hostess said about orders .. so we waited for someone to come over and take our drink orders.. but no one ever came. (maybe she said to order at the bar?)\n\na different hostess came into the bar / waiting area and said our table was ready.\n\nas we walked from the bar area to the dining area she said something about a cable car or train car? couldn't hear her over the music.   \n\nas we entered the dining area she told us about the cool neon artwork above us.. again I couldn't hear her. my wife who was next to the hostess had to repeat to all of us after we sat down what she said. (the lights are supposedly the hand movements of Gordon when he makes a wellington)\n\nI was holding my daughter and I sat down. I was given a menu, then despite the fact that I had both hands full I was given the wine menu , which I had to set down immediately.  \n\nthey gave my wife a tablet that had the drink menu on it. (tablet had to reboot before we could use it - no bigie)\n\neverything on the menu sounded great lots of amazing options .   although I quickly zeroed in on all the steak choices .  after just a short bit a staff member came over with a steak cart. it has examples of all the amazing beef cuts.  there is prime, dry aged prime, and real wygu beef.  I really wanted to hear everything about the steaks ... but (bet you can guess) I could not hear him over the music .    \n\nthe wait staff was very attentive and we had no problems ordering a dirty vodka marinti and a whisky sour..  both were very tasty, couldn't taste the alcohol..  I'm assuming its because they were mixed so well , and they were on the big side .  \n\nso the food we told the staff the Mac and cheese was for our daughter and please bring it out first.  they brought it out very quickly! the Mac and cheese was amazing, best I've ever had. my daughter loved it and we were all eating out of her bowl.    she also liked their yummy breads.  when we needed milk for her again it was easy to get tell a wait staff member who very quickly brought the milk.\n\nmy wife had a seafood plate with various fish and shell fish. she loved it all. my mother in law got the sea bass and also loved it. \n\nmy brother in law and I both had the bone in rib eye, medium rare.   the cook was dead one with a nice red and warm (not hot) center.  seemed seasoned well,\n\ncrazy thing. the steak was tough and chewy.  ? it was juicy and had good flavor, but it was tough and almost had some grizzle on it.. ? very disappointing.   I wonder if they got a bad batch or just a few steaks were tough? felt more like a roast than a steak in terms of tough/chewiness \n\nmy mother in law loved everything she eat, but said she wouldn't want to eat there again because of the loud music.  (house and top 40)  I actually really liked the music that was being played.. just not the volume.  \n\nI did mention that my steak was tough and they offered to refire and even change to a different cut.  which normally I would do, but there's only so long a toddler will behave NAD I didn't want to push our luck.   not to mention due to not being able to hear the wait staff my dining experience was already ruined. \n\n355$ for 4 and a toddler.   I spent 280 for 2 at the mix a year ago so its actually a good value.  but I had a much better experience last year.  \n\n=/\n\nwe have reservations for the Ramsay grill and pub so hopefully that will be a better experience.\n\n** update**  I canceled my reservations for his pub and grill  due to my bad experience at his steak house and went to Bachi burger instead."

S"It was a great experience! I had to make a reservation a month before though. What i thought was weird was that they gave us an ipad to buy drinks, i was like what the heck...just give us the damn menu, the waiters did spend  a lot of time explaining the different cuts of meat, but that didn't bother me, but it took a good amount of time. \n     I ordered the beef wellington, the pork belly appetizer and for dessert, the sticky toffee pudding. I can't explain how good the food was.  It was just amazing."

I started with something new for me, the Smoked Beef Tartare while hubby tried the Gnocchi. I can't believe how good this was! For our main course I had the Kobe Rib Cap and hubby had the Kobe Rib Filet, both in medium. For sides we shared the Grilled Asparagus and Fingerling Potatoes while hubby paired his steak with butter poached lobster tail. We savored every single bite! Because of previous reviews, we had to share the Sticky Toffee pudding, even though we were a bit full. We are both so glad we did! One of the most outstanding desserts I've ever had. Glad we went!"

S"Ever since I started watching Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef, I've wanted to come to one of Gordon's restaurants. This place is wonderful!-I mean, really it's all dat!!! and some! It deserve more like a 4.5-the steak could of taste better and it should have been warmer! But....The service-impeccable! The decor-trendy with a classy twist. The food-Great presentation, good food but the steak could have been seasoned little better! The Price-expensive!!!\n\n**Note: If you are dating someone that is amazing and you really love them then this is the place to take them for an upscale, intimate and romantic anniversary dinner! I wouldn't waste my money coming here if you are just dating causally!!!\n\nSo, check it...I ordered the  rib-eye steak, good but needed A-1 sauce, I had a side of mac and cheese-super tasty. I also ordered the Foie Gras, which was the best that I ever had-amazing! Oh! you have to try their iced teas-bottled passion fruit green tea or their the black sage ice tea-So darn good!!! You know, a lot of people really enjoy their toffee pudding BUT I didn't care for it, however, the presentation of the Desserts were great! I'll be back for the Beef Wellington!"

S"The service was amazing, we were well taken care of and the menu was explained very well. We ordered the pork belly as an appetizer which was delicious. My wife ordered the Filet and I ordered the new york strip, both were very tastey. We order the truffled potatoes as a side which was pretty good. You might be wondering why I am giving it a one star if the food and service were so good. Well that night my wife and I were both extremely sick. We fasted all day to enjoy the food so I am certain we were sick from Gordon Ramsay Steak. We were up all night in the bathroom and are still feeling the effects two days later. To think that I paid 200 dollars to get sick leaves me very upset. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I knew it would be a little over priced just because it had Gordon Ramsay's name attached but paying that much money to get sick is just unacceptable."

S'This was our second Thanksgiving dinner @ Ramsay\'s.  Last year\'s was far superior to this years.  The hostess think they are in the Robert Palmer video, and that they are all that and a bag of chips.  Our wait staff (esp. Johnny) was fantastic.  We had the tasting menu with the wine pairing again.  The scotch egg was great. The beet salad so so.  My risotto (no scallop ~ allergic) was undercooked and the mushrooms were full of dirt and grit. I understand that the mushrooms are "hand forged"  but you still need to clean the darn things. The wellington was just fine ~ and of course the dessert was fantastic.  This visit wasn\'t as memorable ~ and probably won\'t be back'

HUGE portion and we both got a side (baked potato is the size of my fore arm and the Mac & cheese super yummy),  we had so much in leftovers crazy!  No room for dessert but maybe we will go back tonight .  We had a 9pm reservation and were a bit nervous about dress code but we wore nice jeans and fit in just fine."

S'Great service. They are very accommodating. The steak, outstanding. The American Wagyu Rib Cap Steak is excellent. It melts in your mouth. The special worchestire sauce compliment the steak well. The add foie gras give it good texture. The foie gras at Botero is better prepared though. Would recommend this place to anyone.'

S"While visiting Vegas for my boyfriends birthday, he decided he wanted to celebrate with dinner at Gordon Ramsey Steak.  We had 9:15 reservations but arrived early hoping to be seated before then.  Unfortunately we were not, but we had a great experience at the bar while we did wait.  The bartender was friendly and answered all of our questions, he asked us what our preferences were and made drink suggestions.  I unfortunately can't remember the name of the drinks, but they were delicious! \n\nWe were seated at 9:15 and greeted by our very polite waiter and waitress.  They brought out a display of all of the different cuts of meat and explained each one to us, which I loved.  Now on to the food:\n\nBread Plate: A great spread of different breads, there is one with fig in it that's amazing.  As much as you'll want to keep eating- DONT!  Save room for the good stuff.\n\nAppetizer: Market Green Salad & Pulled Pork Tortellini.  The salad was good, the tortellini was just OK..it was a bit hard.  \n\nMain: Myself and my cousin both ordered the American Kobe Rib Cap, which was recommended by both the bartender and the waiter.  My cousins husband ordered the beef wellington and my boyfriend ordered the 24oz bone in rib eye.  We were super excited when our meals came out.  Unfortunately my cousin and I are both very salt sensitive and found our rib caps to be over seasoned and WAY too salty.  The cut of meat was very good though.  If you're sensitive to salt...definitely mention that to them before ordering.  The beef wellington was delicious, as was the rib-eye.  Both cooked and seasoned to perfection.  \n\nSides: Sauteed spinach, potato puree,  mac & cheese.  The mac and cheese and potato puree were both amazing.  I wish I had more room to finish them...I would have licked the plate.  The sauteed spinach is nothing special...we just wanted to add something green to the mix.  \n\nSince it was my boyfriends birthday, the waiter suggested a pudding with butter ice cream which didn't look very appetizing but was phenomenal.  A friendly waiter came over and sang happy birthday...beautifully!  \n\nOver all we had a great night, the super salty Rib Cap didn't ruin it for me enough to give it any less than 4 stars, I just know to order another cut of meat next time.  The bill came to about $500 with the tip for 4 people.  Not surprising for a nice steak house, and worth it."

S"The stars given are strictly for the food, which was amazing.  We were extremely disappointed in the service here.  Maybe because it's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant the staff is supposed to be aloof and not very accommodating- taking on Gordon's television personality of hard-ass, but we were not impressed and aren't likely to go back, we'll happily go back to our usual Craftsteak while in Vegas where the food is amazing and service is superb every time.  \nWe sat at the bar and our bartender didn't pour me a taste of the wine I ordered, just poured the glass and walked away, luckily I was happy with it.  The bread selection was great- 1 star for that.  We ordered a filet, bone marrow, spinach & potato puree- all was amazing- 1 star for that.  We let our bartender know we were sharing, apparently he couldn't be bothered to communicate that to the kitchen or runners, the steak was placed in front of my bf, the bone marrow between us and the sides at the top of my bf's setting... not even a warmed plate was left for me- apparently they thought I wasn't eating or was going to eat off of my bf's plate while in a nice dress and he was in a suit... far too likely i would have spilled on us so we asked for an extra plate.  When I've ordered bone marrow at other upper steak restaurants it is served with toasted bread, makes sense right?  Ours was not and when we asked our bartender for some sort of toast or bread he acted annoyed and like we were asking for something ridiculous or out of the ordinary.  \nWe weren't really checked on, we weren't asked if we wanted a second round of drinks, I don't remember being asked if we wanted dessert- everything we ordered was well worth the price because it was delicious, but don't expect friendly, courteous service as being included in the price.\nA week later after we were back home my bf was checking on all of his charges from our trip and was surprised by our lower than our norm total for an upper steak restaurant dinner out- I reminded him we didn't have a friendly, chatty, helpful bartender who cared to find out we are usually 3-4 drinks each diners and we never got the chance for a second round.  \nToo bad for you Gordon Ramsay, your staff didn't pump us for the $$ you could have made off of us."

S'I just want to start off by saying I am a very picky eater so going to fancy steak houses and resturants always makes me nervous. The resturant itself was beautiful and modern. While waiting for our table, my boyfriend and I sat at the bar and had a drink- the drink menu was very impressive. It had a nice verieity to choose from and none made with vodka which i loved. I ordered the English Garden it was great- great flavors and a beautiful presentation. The wait staff was well educiated with everything on the menu and made great recommendations. I ordered an appetizer as my dinner because like I said I am very picky - the angus beef sliders- I do not regret it. They were amazing - small but perfect size for me. I also ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes- bite sized potatoes with sea salt and a truffle glaze-they were outrageous! Overall I had a great experience and I recommend trying it out.'

S"I am torn between a 2 or 3 star. We had a terrible time getting a reservation. My friend was visiting and her flight was at 6am so she wanted to eat early. We had a 5PM reservation and they said they don't hold reservations. I arrived at 4:40 and there were 4 hostesses gabbing. I walked up to check in and they told me I had to get in line to check in?? I said can't I just check in and wait at the bar. NOPE. They don't open the doors until 5. Seems to me I'd open at 4 and get some cocktail revenue. Plus, wouldn't it be just as easy and more polite to just check me in? But hey, what do I know. They were pretty snooty and I don't know why. Bet they don't make enough to eat there. So I stand in line like an asshole and wait. Then at 5 she yells out who has a reservation. \n\nWe are seated quickly and the waiter brings an iPad with the specialty drinks. There are no prices on the drink menu. The tables are on top of each other NYC style. That would have been OK, if they didn't squeeze 5 people in a 4 top right next to me. The guy was huge and I had to keep myself tucked in like the middle seat on a plane. Luckily they were really nice and I had fun talking to them. \n\nFood-\nBrown butter tortellini $20  it was ok\nBeef Wellington $54 which is the signature dish. You can only get it rare, but it is baked so it isn't bloody for us medium eaters. The Wellington itself was pretty good. I hated the sauce it was floating in. It tasted like something from NASA. The root vegetables were fantastic! All 2 bites of them. \nCreamed spinach $12 was pretty yummy. \nFilet $78 She ordered it medium and I swear it was going to moo. She sent it back and it returned exactly the same. She ended up not eating it and taking it to go\nSticky toffee pudding $14 for dessert. Good. \nFrench press coffee $12 that came with chocolate spoons That was the highlight of the meal. A must have. \nOne Beaujoulais wine $12\nOne antioxidant cocktail $14\n\nPricewise, ridic. It was $210, plus tip. To be squished in, not able to breathe, rude hostesses, and pretentious and annoying assistant waiters. Our waiter was pretty nice and efficient.  So to sum up this rant. Don't bother. I'd way prefer STK, Craft, Nine, Gallaghers, even Outback, actually almost anywhere but here. Gordon needs to show up here and do some swearing. Def a tourist trap. Oh, and one last thing- I hated the music. annoyed the heck out of me."

S'DATE/TIME: March 24, 2013 // 10:15pm\n\nPRICE: $50-$100/person\nVALUE:  The prices are pretty typical of a higher end steakhouse.\nAMBIANCE: Lots of reds, blacks, and grays. As mentioned by many other Yelpers, you enter through a "tube" (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6uhas67fyLO3rEi1f1VMNw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg) that "transports you from Paris to London." Sounded kitschy to me at first but is actually more tastefully done than I initially expected. The dining area itself is a huge two-story dining room with large red neon artwork (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XbS7ww57AwhWY9VhmdPCsw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg) at the center of the ceiling, which the hostess pointed out as she seated us. It is an artist\'s interpretation of Gordon Ramsay\'s hand movements while making his signature dish: the Beef Wellington of Hell\'s Kitchen fame. Ambient lights are attached to a wire that runs across the walls. Music is a bit on the louder side, definitely not the typical stuffy place designed for hushed tones and mousey eating.\nSERVICE: Our server checked up on us frequently and filled up our waters often, but rightfully seemed a bit like she was anxious to go home by the end of the night. (We were one of the last people to leave)\nCHANCE OF RETURNING: 60%\n___________________________________\n\n[ ACTUAL RATING: 3.5* ]\n\nThis place, like so many of Gordon Ramsay\'s newer restaurants since I last went to Maze in New York, is clearly catered towards his Hell\'s Kitchen fan base. They even have a "Hell\'s Kitchen Tasting Menu." Seriously. Kudos to the growing empire for capitalizing on the media-inspired fame as well as they have.\n\nThe meal was definitely good - not quite mind blowing (don\'t expect something comparable to a Michelin-starred restaurant) but definitely a decent steakhouse. If there weren\'t so many places still on my list of destinations in Vegas, my chances of returning might be closer to 70%.\n\nThe wine and cocktail menu is available on an iPad, like that at Charlie Palmer\'s Aureole.\n\nUnfortunately, by the end of our meal we had no space at all for dessert. I might be back sometime before the end of this trip to try the STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING at the bar, which consists of a sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, and brown butter ice cream.\n\nTIP: If you don\'t already have a Total Rewards card, get one. It only shaves $1-$3 per dish but that\'s money you can allocate towards a higher gratuity for your hard-working servers! ;-)\n\n___________________________________\n\n:::: [ THE FOOD ] ::::\n\n* BREAD TRAY\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Pvi2lZcSgkHc0gEiaEpw7w&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [4/5 - We were served with 6 kinds of room temperature bread including a pancetta brioche, black truffle brioche, and blue cheese and walnut bread. On the side was a somewhat cold imported butter. My favorite hands down was the black truffle brioche, though the blue cheese and walnut bread was also pretty good. I couldn\'t really taste the pancetta in the pancetta brioche, which I was actually most excited about when the tray arrived at our table.]\n* SEARED FOIE GRAS - $25 \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QytfTD2Hpp1yWcvuV30xiQ&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [3.75/5 - Perfectly seared creamy foie gras, delicious huckleberry, and marcona almonds. This is nowhere near the top 10 foie gras dishes I\'ve tried, but that\'s coming from someone who actively seeks both Michelin-starred as well as regular mid-range restaurants who fellow Yelpers claim serve great foie gras. Be sure to use every drop of the sauce on the plate or you will find your foie gras disappointingly bland.]\n* ROASTED BEEF WELLINGTON FOR 2 - $100\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7sjGYKbej_1IkprjvGR1Sw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [3.75/5 - Served with a red wine demi glace, potato puree, and glazed root vegetables. The pastry portion of the beef wellington seems to be where all of the sodium is allocated, so be sure to portion your bites of meat with enough of it or you won\'t have even distribution of seasoning. The glazed root vegetables seems like an afterthought. Coming from someone who loves purees and generally soft, creamy, foods - the potato puree is a bit more liquefied than I\'m used to - it could\'ve been slightly richer and just a tiiiiiiiiny bit better seasoned. While I prefer to include a bit of each ingredient on the plate with each bite, I also like to start my meal by trying everything on it\'s own and am especially pleased when every element manages to "carry their own weight."]\n* MAC & CHEESE - $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MjlAOhIvQrSWmo0YRi7dPw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [3/5 - A combination of blue, cheddar, and parmesan cheese with truffle. Mediocre mac & cheese. Not that well-flavored.]'

I also love the colored sugar.  Call me crazy, but it's fun.  \n\nThe food is great here. I can count the number of BLT's I've liked in my life on one hand and the BLTA (avocado) at the Peppermil is one of them.  I get mine on rye, because rye is the best.  Fruit cups.  How many of us sigh at the fruit cup option?  They always suck, right?  Not here! The Peppermill fruit comes in a good sized bowl and includes strawberries, banana blueberries, grapes, and melon.  Yum!  Love the cottage cheese, love the chicken strips, love the Reuben.  \n\nIf you don't like any of these things, don't worry, the menu has a lot of options.

Even this dish was maybe a 2 star at best, the only positive of this place is having fun watching the waitresses picking things up off the floor.  \n\nIt was a good hangover pick me up, but then I got back to my hotel with a severe case of CHORRO!!!!....!!!\n\nKeep this in mind when considering coming here"

S'The Peppermill is highly recommended- even The Killers\' singer Brandon Flowers and guitarist Dave Keuning, who both live in Las Vegas, like this place because it\'s more local, and a break from all the tourists. But I\'ll stop and let this interview excerpt do the talking: \n\n"Flowers and Keuning head for lunch at the Peppermill, an all night restaurant on the strip. It opened in the seventies, and it\'s just the kind of place the Killers dig- a bit weird, and seemingly immune from vacationing Midwesterners. "We hate big crowds," Keuning says."You can always just pop in and get a bite here. It\'s a cool place." Eating their salads and runny egg specials, Keuning and Flowers stick out among the Peppermill patrons, most of whom are dressed in tees and tank tops. Flowers wears a cream colored, fake alligator skin jacket he got in London: Keuning is in a shiny gray vest and Dior aviators. But no one bothers them or even seems to recognize them, and you sense that\'s one reason they like places like the Peppermill. Especially Flowers."\n\nSo go on, maybe you\'ll even spot Vegas\' most famous rock band...\nhttp://thesponge-dani.blogspot.com/2011/10/victims-pilgrimage-killers-fans-guide.html'

S'The Peppermill is my new mandatory stop when in Vegas. The fireside  lounge is really cool, (kinda looks like a porn set shoot!), purple & pink neon lighting, round couch area to sit back and enjoy a cocktail. Over the top Vegas style, nice! The hi lite of the lounge is the water feature with flames emanating from the middle surrounded by a circular set of couches to kick back on. Our group  rolled in to get a Bloody Mary. Spicy yes, lots of good vodka, yes, big stalk of celery, Cucumber slice sidecar on the goblet, cherry tomato impaled on a plastic toothpick-very tasty indeed. We saw another group who ordered Scorpions, a massive 1/2 gallon goblet filled with Rum and stuff ; 24" straw included. Food wise , at breakfast,  I ended up going big , NY Steak & Eggs, perfect Med Rare cooked seasoned slab of cow, perfect scrambled eggs contained in a ramekin, Killer hash browns, Coffee was eh, but who cares. Good service , a bit more $ than other places, but I\'ll gladly pay more for the good stuff. Peppermill, ambiance, good food, strong drink, what\'s not to like!!\nWe\'ll be back!!'

S'The Peppermill is a must for a hangover breakfast or late night in Vegas. It is truly a Las Vegas landmark. I have been several times, but this most recent trip this past Sunday morning was great as usual. I have tried both the Marco Pollo omelet and the Peppermill omelet. Both were great. The highlight of this last trip to the Peppermill for me was the purchase of the rainbow turbinado sugar and sugar dispenser. I was asking the waitress about it when she informed me that I could purchase it! I WAS THRILLED! I got a 5 lb. bag of it complete with the dispenser. Best impulse purchase ever. The Fireside Lounge is also great to grab a drink while you wait for a table. The Peppermill is ALWAYS packed. Mimosas from the Fireside Lounge are on point! Must do.'

S"this place is hilarious. and we didn't even see the lounge behind the restaurant. \n\nthe decor is like over the top 80's chinese restaurant style with almost life-sized cherry blossom trees and neon all over the ceiling. \n\nwe almost didn't go in because it looks so much like a sketchy strip club from the outside.  \n\nthe food is good - not anything fancy. \n\nluckily before we ordered our three omelets the waitress informed us (thank god) that each omelet was made from TEN EGGS! - a piece of information that actually made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.\n\nwe ended up splitting one or two and getting a parfait which was cool but we didn't come close to finishing - but it was good."

S'Where do I want to go to breakfast when I\'m in Vegas? Does that question even need to be asked?\n\nI\'ve never, ever had a bad experience there, in the many times I\'ve been there over the past 15 years. It\'s amazing how little the place changes - maybe the management could update the waitstaff\'s cocktail-waitress-type attire from the Hawaiian nightmare it is now (and always has been), but that\'s about it. Service is sometimes slower when they get slammed (and they do get very slammed at times) but since I rarely get to bed before 2am when in Vegas, the crowd has usually dissipated by the time I roll in for breakfast at 11ish.\n\nI\'ve almost always been greeted warmly by the waitstaff (although they usually don\'t know me from Adam until my second or third consecutive morning in), the portions are so huge I can\'t finish my ham and eggs (and I can eat a LOT of ham) and the eggs benedict is one of the best I\'ve had anywhere. Prices are reasonable, and the coffee cups are large. (Tip: go easy on the sparkly colored sugar in your coffee - the stuff is even sweeter than "Sugar in the Raw.")\n\nThe only other place in Vegas that I\'d even consider recommending for breakfast in LV is the Grand Lux at the Venetian, but that\'s like being the second best golfer to Tiger Woods. \n\nAnd I do admit I\'ve never been in the lounge, but I hear it\'s awesome as well.'

Portions are definitely huge (especially pancakes) but prices reflect that so its not like you're getting some great deal.  Service was pretty slow with long waits to order and to get our food (simple breakfast stuff like french toast and omelets), food coming out at different times, and another wait to get the check.  Food was merely OK.  Our group had french toast (recommended by an employee, but nothing special at all), a fruit plate (very big), oatmeal (pretty good, but $11 for oatmeal?!?!), a caesar salad, and an omelet.  \n\nThe atmosphere is fine, but not as fun as I thought it might be from the other reviews.  \n\nNo one was impressed.

S'Spunky, surreal neon decor with leggy waitresses wearing shiny hose. Famous amongst locals and was in the movie Swingers I hear. Right next to the Riviera down a ways on the strip. Service was good and the food quite tasty. Lots of variety. I was in Vegas on business and ate there twice. The ribeye was quite good and they didn\'t overcook it which, to me at least, is vital. The next time I got the gyro which was tasty but the lamb was just OK. No one was displeased with their meal as far I remember. If you\'re cruising through Vegas and want to try something very authentically "Vegas" but also desire a good meal and don\'t want to break the bank, Peppermill\'s the spot.\n\nOpen 24 hours by the way and oh yeah, if you\'re a drunkard this place is also optimal as they have a fireside lounge which seems to cater to the party crowd.'

S"As for many things in Vegas, disappointment comes from over-priced, mediocre food complete with tacky neon lights. \nThe food there was bland and uneventful. I had the chicken pesto sandwich that could have been decent if it weren't for the pile of dry mixed greens smashed on the dry bread. There was cheese in there somewhere and little globs of pesto, but paired with a gristley piece of chicken I was far from impressed. And I know what you're thinking- it's diner food, right? Well, I've been to my fair share of diners and had some really decent meals. This was not one of them.  I got fries on the side which were, shockingly, also not good. Some were cold, some were warm, but all of them mushy. Gross. \nMy husband got an omelet with turkey and cheese and hollandaise sauce. He seemed to think it was okay, but not great. The egg was overcooked and made for a hard, chunk of omelet. \nThe best part of this mess... oh wait, there is no best part... the bill was $28 for the two of us and that was without drinks. \nI give this place one star for tacky, over the top, quintessential  Vegas d\xc3\xa9cor and ambiance. Also, the waitresses wear these terrible tie-dye colored outfits where you can basically see their asses. Except these are not asses you'd want to see.  And then cocktail waitresses come out from the fire side area wearing formal wear to take your drink order. This place is a mess and I recommend it only if you're desperate to go broke for crap food."

Tress surround the private booths and there is complimentary little glass bottles of peanuts. There is also large screen tv's that show music videos and live concerts of every genre of music.

S"I've eaten at the Peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. I usually arrive into Vegas on a later, after-work flight from the East coast. By the time I get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. Thankfully, the Peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. It is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. It's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. Also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. She does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. \n\nI have ordered many entrees, both dinner and breakfast selections, some of which include the following:  Berry Spinach Salad, Crab Cakes, Omelettes, Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta, Swiss and Mushroom Burger, Creamy Chicken Dijon, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Tomato Bisque, Chicken Noodle Soup. My favorite is the Creamy Chicken Dijon dinner. Two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the creamy dijon sauce.  It is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. I'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. The specialty drinks are excellent too. Cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the Fireside Lounge. I've ordered the Blue Hawaii a couple of times, and I have a friend that loves the Espresso Martini.\n\nAfter dinner, I usually get a couple of drinks in the Fireside Lounge. You get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. However, I have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines I've played at different locations in Vegas. You may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. All in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.\n\nI gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance."

This is the home of fire leaping up out of bubbling water that gently cycles through the color spectrum, surrounded by plush purple couches, and music videos of live performances that span the generations (The Beach Boys, Paul Simon, Aretha, Hall and Oats, Coldplay, you get the idea).  There is plastic bougainvillea everywhere, creating little oases of privacy, despite the mirrored ceilings.  Purple, pink, and turquoise lights add to the "ambiance."

I had their garden salad, mushroom cream soup, and some garlic bread. Sadly the only thing I liked much out of all three was the bread, but I didn\'t even finish it. My boyfriend had a cheeseburger & we had "heard" that the burgers here were humongous. His wasn\'t even big at all, and he claims it was "alright". However my nephew ordered a mushroom burger & his was big! I saw a few other tables who ordered the nachos (from the appetizer menu)..boy that thing is HUGE!!!

We arrived a 1:20 on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed.  We had called in and put our name on the waiting list (no reservation taken for afternoons I was told) but still had about a 20 minute wait. The potpourri of clientele ranges from families, with grandmotherly types  to young fashionably cool model types and everything in between.\n\nThe decor is retro coffee shop on a bit of LSD... lots of neon and cool black light effects... quite an interesting breakfast spot!\n\nI can't believe it took so long for us go there. So easy to get into.. no 6 level park garages and trudging through the casinos to get to a Strip eaterie.  Parking is easy and the menu is huge, with a lot of old American style standards, and also a few healthier alternatives if you scour the menu well.  The prices are very good and all three of us loved what we ordered. Our server (Destiny) was cute as can be, and very sweet as well as very efficient.\n\nWe had a nice bottle of wine and shared food and drink with each other and it was a treat. Christine had the Gourmet Shrimp Salad... with balsamic dressing...a really huge delicious salad, with fruit and avocado and some good sized shrimp. I had the pastrami burger with curly fries and our friend Maya had the Eggs Benedict.  We ordered a fudge brownie with ice cream for desert that that was huge and we didn't come close to finishing. Our total bill $104.\n\nOn the way out we checked out the Fireside Lounge which is a pretty sexy flashback to the late 70's early 80's with its hot pink furnishings and low profile seating around the fire pit... probably quite the pickup spot in the early morning hours... if the fire pit wasn't there a stripper pole would be a natural. :-)"

S"This place should be called Disco Denny's. There's also a Denny's like a block from here.  The decor, neon lights everywhere, fire pits, waitress outfits, flamingo lights over the tables is something to behold.\n\nPortions are huge and prices are fare.  I ate here before for breakfast and enjoyed it much more than my last experience.\n\nOur waitress was slow to arrive.  Although they were not busy they sat us way way way in the back next to the family with screaming/hellbent children that were literally kicking glasses of water on the table. yeah kicking w/ their feet, why you ask? b/c they were standing on the table.  \n\nNotice there was some garbage items on the floor when we first got in there, later saw a guy sweeping them up. Looked at the menu, tried to decide on some real diner food. No grilled cheese on the menu?  No tomato soup?  Ordered the Gyro with fries, friend ordered a salad with a grilled cheese [they can make one]  and my veggie friend ordered the Caprese sandwich [she had some issues finding something to order and mentioned it wasn't very veggie friendly]\n\nGyro arrived and it had this clumpy Tzatziki sauce on it made out of onions and something. It wasn't very good.  It was also very greasy.  I pushed some of the white slop off the top and ate the meat out of it.  The pita bread was soggie from the grease :(.  and it was also missing lettuce.  \n\nEveryone seemed to be ordering the sundaes.  Walked passed a guy who had his tennis shoes OFF and was eating his sundae, GROSS.\n\nI wasn't that impressed."

The fire pit is really neat! the drink price is average.The only downfall is, like all the vegas casinos,  they let you smoke inside (yuck!)

S'I remember going to the Peppermill in Reno when i was in high school and I remember the great buffet and the cool lighting.  On my recent trip to Vegas, we stopped by the restaurant and the atmosphere brought back memories.\nThe service was great and the staff was very friendly. We got a table the moment we walked in, but i think that was because it was a weekday. Waitress forgot about refilling drinks but apologized for the delay.  \nThe food portions are very large. We were able to try the other plates that our table ordered.  My sister enjoyed the multi colored sugar and she wanted to steal it.  They sell it at the counter so i bought her one when we went back the next day.  \nThey also have a really cool lounge that i might try to have a drink at when i visit again.  I will most likely go back when i visit Vegas again.'

S'We visit Vegas several times a year so we like to find new (to us) & interesting places to try.  In perusing Tripadvisor while sitting in the Firefly parking lot (our go-to place) we came upon Peppermill restaurant & decided to try it based on review of locals.  Oh my, what a trip.\n\nWe drove up to this restaurant down toward the older part of the strip around 11:20AM on a Saturday  morning; there were people waiting outside.  We decided to try it anyway & went inside the where the hostess took our name for a 35 minute wait.  We went to check out the lounge - you MUST check out the lounge.\n\nTacky might be a good adjective but fun tacky like a walk back into the 70s.  Neon lights, mirrors and silk/plastic florals & greenery throughout the darkened room illuminated with multiple tvs playing music videos from days past; seating is in semi-circular pit arrangements.  The bar was full with some patrons playing video poker while others just took in the scene.  The focal point of the lounge, however, is the step down fire pit with the flame glowing in the middle of a pool of water.  There was a guest of honor from a bachelorette party interestingly clad with various monetary units & mints hanging from her ensemble hamming it up two couples who wandered in with their 70\'s garb and took multiple "what happens in Vegas stays..." photos.  It was a free show!  Oh, the drinks were fine - my bloody Mary was a bit pricey but it did come in a hurricane glass (remember those?)\n\nWhen our name was called for brunch - we were seated at a window booth (all booth seating).  The floral motif continued and was accompanied by tiffany style lighting.  We saw omelets the size of your head go by - and the line outside continued.  Since it was the noon hour by this time we chose to order sliders & pesto chicken sandwich from our waitress wearing a carhop type of getup (short skirt).  Both food orders were really good and accompanied by a copious pile of fries. \n\nPeppermill seems to be a local favorite but many taxis came through too.  The after noon timeframe brought in a younger set of patrons - the line had gotten a bit shorter but it would no doubt get longer as the late night crowd woke from their night of partying.  It\'s on our list for a return visit.'

The atmosphere is great as well, down to earth, very old-school kitschy Vegas type atmosphere, which I thought was fun.  It's the perfect place to hang out with friends after you're done doing whatever it is you do in Vegas, shopping, clubbing, walking the strip and touring casinos, whatever, this is a place to go to wind down. I personally have not been at night, although I would love to do so, this review is based on my experience going in for breakfast.

S'I have been to the Peppermill a few times but never eaten here. Normally I go with friends and watch them drink while I have tea or soft drink in the fireside area. Which is a great place for a couple (you will be pleasantly surprised I Promise). We were there to eat and eat we did. The waitress was nice and looked 16 which I kidded her about but she was a good sport and a very good server. I found it to be a good time and I loved the pastrami sandwich (so lean) just writing this review makes me want to go back. I have not had a good pastrami sandwich in a while.

S"Love, love, love this place! The food is always excellent and the portions are enormous. I want to say their omelets have like 6 eggs in them (or more). Seriously, come hungry or be prepared to take home leftovers. \n\nWhen a place is 24 hours and they serve breakfast the whole time, I tend toward breakfast food. That being said, their eggs benedict is one of the best in Las Vegas. Burgers are delish and cooked to order (beware asking for rare...they take it seriously and will produce something pretty much raw on the inside). The service is great. Waitresses are attentive and friendly. There seem to always be cops eating there; take what you will from that. \n\nDownsides: The place gets crowded. Really crowded. Weeknights seem to be the best time to go if you want to sit down and eat quickly. Also, the parking situation can be difficult. They have an itty bitty parking lot in front (maybe more in the back, not sure!) right on LV Blvd, so getting out can be tricky. \n\nBottom line: if you haven't been, go for the decor. Stay for the food!"

Came back last week for some breakfast before our flight back to San Diego...Great variety on the menu still, huge portions as usual and good fast food with good friendly service.

S"I have been making regular stops to Fireside Lounge for a while now and I really like it. The lighting and decor would do it for me alone.  Booths tucked behind fake plants. Fire coming out of water.  It feels kinda like being in a fish tank. A pink fish tank. \n\nThey serve all manner of sweet, strong, and overly garnished cocktails. Tall ones, short ones, pink ones, and blue ones. Some of the drinks are the size of fish bowls.\nPink fish bowls.\n\nThe bartenders are in black and white and the cocktail waitresses are wearing evening wear. Drinking these crazy drinks in such an atmosphere can really have a good effect on the old disposition. If you know what I mean.\n\nSo I have visited the lounge a bunch and never so much as walked into the restaurant. So the last time I was in town it was time.  \n\nThe ambiance was the same as the lounge only a bit brighter and more restaurant like. Which might have something to do with the fact that it is indeed a restaurant.\n\nThe evening gown clad waitress came over and brought us mai tais and what not. The restaurant waitress was dressed interesting also, I think. All were nice.\n\nThe food was quite good and served in over sized portions. Pancakes, omelets, burgers and stuff like that. I personally had buffalo chicken wrap due to some reviews I have read. I would not normally order some such thing like that. It was really good. Everything everybody got was good. Big salads and other bullshit I don't remember. \n\nSo two good things in one building. And it's on the strip, albeit the ass end of the strip. And for desert you can go across the street to the Riviera. Go get it."

S"Wow, I really haven't written a review about this joint yet?  I'm pretty surprised.\n\nThis place surprises me.. so unassuming on the outside, you can literally drive past it a thousand times and not notice it's there.. inside it looks like old school, tacky vegas threw up in here.  Vintage plastic colorful booths, neon lights trace the ceilings, faux trees coming out of the booths... wow.  \n\nThere's also a fireside lounge which is all the rage, but I normally stumble into this joint on my very last hours of Vegas, tired, drained and out of cash, so I never have the time to check out the fireside lounge.\n\nThis place is known for their large 24 hour portions of breakfast.  They also serve lunch and dinner though.\n\nThere's an entire page of omelets.  Not a fan of the seafood omelet consisting mostly of fake seafood product and tasting slightly fishy.  I had better luck this time around w/the Maserati omelet filled w/jack and cheddar cheeses, mushrooms and smothered in italian meat sauce.  Very hearty, but def could've used more meat smotherin' since its a massive fluffy omelet. It's almost like a wall/brick of egg, so u need a lot of extras for all that egg.  I can't imagine how many eggs it takes to make one order.  All come w/hashbrowns, and your choice of either toast, or english muffin, or bagel or fresh blue berry muffin.  That's a lot of freakin' food!!! \n\nYou can also order some alcoholic bevs from the alcoholic waitress (heh) I had a mimosa given to me in a sangria glass.  Not very stiff, but still enjoyable w/my meal.\n\nHonestly, I'm never really the biggest fan of diners.. so if it weren't for my bf's tradition of ending vegas trips here, I probably wouldn't have come back a second time.... but w/its unique environment, nostalgia, heaping portions of food, so so prices, i can see how it would be considered a good diner."

I think it's my new favorite spot! I LOVED the little love seats surrounding the firepit and how CHILL it was. It's 24 hours so I hear it gets crazy later on but it was a Monday night when I was there, about 11pmish. We ordered ribs and a quesadilla, I had a Dreamcicle too which was DELICIOUS! i'm not a rib fan but HE is and he LOVED the ribs.

S"so there really should be two separate listings for the restaurant and the lounge because it's night and day. my friend chose this place to have a quick birthday dinner before a night on the town. the outside of this place looks very outdated and not classy at all. but based on the reviews and the location of this place, we decided to give it a try.\n\ninside is just as worse as it looks on the outside. its like a 1970's ate up the amazon forest and threw it up in here. decor is just horrible. we took a peak inside the Fireside Lounge and at least that part looked a lot better but unfortunately, they don't serve the full menu which was what most of the people in our party wanted. \n\nanyway, we were seated in a long booth for our party of 9, all facing the same direction which was really awkward so we asked to have a few extra chairs so that we could sit across from each other instead of sitting on a bench and having to yell like we were benchwarmers. luckily the servers were nice enough to let us do that even though we would be blocking the walk way. the menu was pretty extensive, but honestly, it's just like a typical diner. some of us ordered breakfast, some just a salad, some ordered sandwiches. none were spectacular. i shared the gyro sandwiches which came with a side of sweet potato fries for $12. it was OK. \n\nmy review may sound pretty rough but i'll still give it 3 stars because it wasn't too horrible. it's just a glorified Denny's on the Vegas strip...even though that's STILL not saying much. at least the service wasn't bad."

I prefer breakfast at this place more than lunch. I have had their roast beef dip with onion rings, and it was just ok. But the breakfast is AWESOME.

Starting with the host who had now important things to do than to tend to the people who walked in. The peppermill sampler platter is nothing but deep fried food with no flavor unless you like the taste of grease. Their steak was cooked improperly, and again no flavor. I see the Zagat award and yelp recommendations and couldnt belive how they could possibl have them. The girl at the cashier asked, "how was everything?

S'Boy, did the Peppermill hit the spot! First off, walking in is as big and wonderful a trip as anyone who appreciates neon would describe it. It\'s kitschy Vegas at its best. The seating is arranged in these amorphous islands of booths, which makes us feel like we\'re all neon jellyfish in the middle of the ocean deep, and it\'s enchanting. \n\nThe diner food is also as good as it gets. The three of us discovered that we are all "breakfast for dinner" people, and we freaking chowed down, sharing parts of our ginormous meals with each other but still managing to clean most of our plates.\n\nFrench Toast Collage - So good, and I\'m so glad I got to share a couple of my squares so I didn\'t have to eat them all myself. Eggs, bacon, sausage, all perfect.\n\nSteak and Eggs - Very good, quality steak, sunny side up eggs, and I tried the wonderful toast and real strawberry jam also. \n\nVeggie Omelet - Well received. \n\nDefinitely returning to the Peppermill!'

S"I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating.  First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.\n  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...\n    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  \n   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.\n  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.\n~G"

The food is decent, but nothing really special.  I recall my spinach and cheese omlette being pretty good though I could barely make it though half of it due to it's enormousness.\n\nAnd as is the usual story in Las Vegas, there isn't much here by way of vegetarian options.  They offer a veggie burger and a salad or two and of course breakfast food.\n\nThis trip I was determined to check out the Fireside Lounge.  And I'm glad we did.  We took a seat on the cooshy couches surrounding the fire and ordered some appetizers.  It was a Sunday night and kind of quiet which was fine by us.  The neon, the decor, the fire.  So wonderfully cheesy.  I loved it.  \n\nThey have a few small flat screen TVs affixed above the fire pit and they play music videos and live concerts which can provide some laughs, depending on your taste in music.\n\nI am glad I finally checked out the lounge as I read rumors that the Peppermill may be closing with no plan to relocate.  Which would be a total bummer.  But perhaps they should move it downtown.  It would fit in well there."

Peppermill is away from the hussle and bussle of the mega resorts but sits conveniently next to the Riviera Hotel with its own easy access parking lot right off the strip.  I came here with a friend's suggestion for breakfast and it was a refreshing change from the overpriced, small portioned offerings in the touristy casinos.  \n\nPeppermill has HUGE portions, I ordered the pancake combo for $12.99 which consisted of 3 pancakes as large as a dinner plate, 3 eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage.  Not only is this a great value price wise, but the portions are probably double of what you would get elsewhere.  My friend got the chicken and spinach omlete made from 10 eggs!  It was a monster of a dish and delicious at that.  The customers seemed to be a mix of vegas locals and tourists but the vibe was comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent and attentive.

Definitely big enough for two to split.  We got one garden omelette, a fruit cup, and an order of eggs Benedict to share for three people.  It was more than enough food.  \n\nWhile the food and the service were both excellent, the only bummer of this visit was the 30 plus minute ticket time to get our food.  The server repeatedly apologized, and was kind enough to not charge us for our coffee, iced tea and oj.  This is the minus one star.  Otherwise this place rocks!"

The food is great. Portion sizes are enormous.

S'Continuing my nostalgia tour of Vegas, I ended up at the Peppermill.  This place has not changed its look in about 30 years.  But somehow, it works for them.\n\nI remember going to the Peppermill with my folks when I was a little lass.  My pop would always ask for the cocktail waitress so he could "decide if he wanted a cocktail".  He just wanted to stare at her cans!  Well, the cocktail waitresses must be wearing the same black polyester low-cut/high-slit dresses.  My cocktail waitress, Maribel, was cute as a button and well-stacked.  I was wondering what the interview process was like for the cocktail waitress job.  I should have asked, but didn\'t.  Maybe if I had ordered more drinks....\n\nThe food is solid.  Breakfast is probably what they do best and is served 24 hours.'

We went for breakfast and had only a 20 minute wait, which we enjoyed by sipping Bloody Marys in the Fireside Lounge. \n\nVegas is the place for excess and the Peppermill abides by that spirit. The menu sports 10-egg omelettes and a 22-oz milkshake. I thought the Peppermill had an excellent selection of food. While not unique, the menu was extensive and has all the staples. The food was good and the prices were quite reasonable for Las Vegas. It's definitely a Vegas must-do."

You enter the super dark lounge through glass doors and there is a walk down roundabout with a pool (cool water which I tested) and a mini volcano erupting in the center, televisions all around everywhere but then again the ceilings are covered in disco ball mirror tiles and the walls alllll mirrors so maybe there was only one tv but the reflection in the mirrorS made me see otherwise...  anyway it was very calming after a rough night with the bright pink, blue and tiny lil white lights.  I honestly could have taken a nap here and nobody would have seen me.  There are all these small rooms tucked away amidst the mirrors, red carpet and red couches.  $8.00 Bloody marys which are served in a large cocktail glass along with a HUGE piece of celery, tomato and a slice of cucumber are a meal in themselves make it a double for and extra $2.00.  \n\nIts a good time, make sure to stop by next time youre dragging on a morning in Vegas.'

S"Two cliches apply to the Peppermill: everything you've heard is true, and words can't describe it.\n\nThere's no way to fully descibe the decor of the restaurant & lounge. It's kind of a retro-futuristic 50s/80s neon hybrid. The pink is bubblegum hot, the blue is sky electric, the mirrored tiling and faux greenery add to the surreal atmosphere. Recently several huge monitors were added to the entry/waiting area, and a widescreen travelogue of tableaus from around the world plays on them. A new one pops up every few minutes. Times Square, then Tokyo, then whitewater rapids. It's like a postmodern vacation.\n\nThe lounge is built around a circular flame pool, but there is also grouped seating available. The bar offers traditional seating. Be warned, the cocktails pictured on the cocktail menu are as large as they look. Pace yourself!\n\nThe restaurant is mainly diner-style booths for seating, with counter service available if you'd like to get a look at what's going on in the kitchen. Here even the menu is huge. I can recommend the Old-Fashioned Belgian Waffle, the Western Fruit Plate, the hamburgers, and the Nachos Nachos Nachos. This is also the kind of restaurant where sometimes just dessert is enough: recently a friend ordered a sundae thinking she would get something simple and ended up with a dish almost as big as her head.\n\nThe prices look a little spendy, but when measured against portion size, they're a geat value for a Strip experience like this. Go, and be prepared to be tempted to buy a bag of pink & blue sparkly table sugar as a souvenir."

Everything was pretty good.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Ruben, which was huge and overflowing with fries. Just as everyone says, the portions are large. The Ruben was good. The Cheesesteak was also really good.\n\nAlso had the Brownie Sundae which was yum and the Coffee was great. \n\nReally sweet and attentive waitress. \n\nI had an overall good experience with this place.

I also noticed that she told that to every single customer that and they ended up waiting just as long as we did if not longer. The decor is different, unique. The waitresses were on point and it seemed like they all worked together. The food was pretty good - worth the wait, it was an awesome amount of food too!

The soup was huge but too salty for me.  I only had a couple spoonfuls. I shared half of a roast beef sandwich with my brother. It was a good size. It was yummy and the veggies on it were fresh ! My cousin ordered the appetizer that came with chicken tenders, bruschetta, onion rings,  mozzarella sticks,  onion rings and butterfly shrimp. It was enough to share with the five of us.

But instead it had shrimp, crab meat (which I assume was imitation), "American" cheese and hollandaise sauce. What exactly is mediteranean about that? Definitely would not recommend this place.

And of course tell me I was wrong because that's the best way to keep customers in their place. Obviously the stringy cheese quality goes away when it's cold!! Way to go Martha! A plus service!"

I fill up fast, so I ended up taking more than half of my meal home. My aunt and I both ordered the Spinach and Feta omelette and I really enjoyed it. It had a good amount of feta cheese, which is a big deal to me. They serve it with potatoes and bread. I chose the blueberry muffin which was served warm. Yum!  \n\nMy mom ordered the fruit plate and it was enormous. It included strawberries, grapes, honeydew, banana, cantaloupe, pineapple and watermelon. They also give you a small banana nut loaf with marshmallow cream. It was so good!  \n\nMy grandma ordered the Pancake combo. It came with three large pancakes, three eggs, two bacon strips and two sausage links. It was a very large entree.

We have the rising sun. I thought the burger was just good, but not wow.  I was impressed with the toppings I just like bigger patties.  However, the wow moment did happen for me with the banana cream milkshake. That shake just made me want to cuddle up with a blanket it was YUM.  I had to go back the next day just for the shake. The ingredients are spot on and the flavor is not overpowering. Anytime I go to vegas I will stop by for one of these shakes they make you think other shakes are child's play.

S'Let me just cut to the chase on this review, DO NOT EAT HERE. I love fine dining and have no problem dropping a good amount of money on a good meal, but I\'ve never had a worse dining experience than at Holsteins. With that being said, let me explain myself.\n\nI had been to Holsteins once before my nightmare of an experience with them, and had a decent experience, the food was good, but none of the visit was anything noteworthy. On my second visit we came to celebrate a friend\'s 21st birthday, her having chose the venue. We were all dressed up and went to Holsteins sparing no expense and had plans to go to Marquee Monday after dinner. We were seated promptly, and all was well. We then each ordered several drinks, burgers, appetizers, shakes, you name it, and we were all just getting into our meals when our waiter came to fill our water glasses. As he filled our water glasses he accidentally knocked one over, spilling water onto my meal as well as my friend next to me.  We jumped back, as the water was ice cold and we were surprised. He panicked and then promptly began to mop up the water. As he did so, he leaned heavily on our table and the table toppled over, knocking our drinks and food into my friends lap, as well as mine. My friend was wearing white pants, so their cranberry and vodka and my birthday cake cocktail made their white pants look like a menstrual accident. Our waiter went to retrieve some towels, and another staff member tried to bring towels as well. The pants were not salvageable, nor was my barely touched meal. I had ordered a burger and fries, a 13 or 14 dollar cocktail, and an appetizer, all of which were destroyed. I\'d only had a sip of my cocktail, less than half of my burger, and just a mere fried pickle before my food was doused with cocktails and spilled into our laps. Our waiter apologized, but no solution was offered. No one asked if they could replace our soiled, inedible meals, or offered to cover our portion of the bill.\n\nI work in a company that prides itself on flawless customer service, and was appalled at the response I received. We were handed our bills and nothing more was said. My friend and I were livid! Any half decent restaurant manager would have comped our entire party and apologized profusely, but he didn\'t even come to see our party and apologize when the waiter informed him of the situation. We payed our bill and I asked the hostess to see the manager. He came out to talk to me and was the epitome of a young, overly confident prick. I recanted the story of what happened at our table and he stared blanky at me until I finished speaking. His exact words were "I am sorry about the inconvenience, but I saw the whole thing happen, and it was you guys moving the table that caused it." \n\nAt this point I was seething with rage. I told him that he wasn\'t even on the restaurant floor when it happened, and that we had completely leaned away from the table witht the initial spill. He just stared at me with glazed eyes, and nodded his head. I then told him that I knew he really didn\'t care what I was saying and I didn\'t appreciate him being patronizing rather than showing any form of empathy. Words cannot describe how horrific this manager was, and because of his lack of any sense I will never give any of my business to this restaurant ever again. I\'m quite frankly floored that such an incredible establishment like the Cosmopolitan would allow such people to run one of their restaurants.\n\nAll I can say is don\'t waste your time, the service alone makes this establishment boycott worthy. Save your money and eat elsewhere on the strip. I\'ve heard horror stories about strip eateries, but I\'ve never heard or experienced one as ghastly nightmarish as this.  So again, DO NOT EAT HERE.'

S"I completely happened upon this spot by chance. I had been wandering around in some labyrinthine mall full of ritzy stores I couldn't imagine shopping in, when I saw the sign for Holstein's Shakes and Buns? Sounds like a winning combo to me. \n\nThey weren't very crowded in the middle of the afternoon, so my gf and I got a seat real quick. I had a good buzz going, so we opted for something off the Tiny Buns section of the menu. I went with the Crispy Pork Belly Bun, my gf had the Meat Ball Grinder. We also got an order or shoestring fries. I contemplated getting an alcoholic milkshake, but I figured it would be a waste since the food & shake itself would likely counteract the effects of the alcohol, and I also assume the amount of booze in each shake is equivalent to one conservative shot. \n\nThe Meat Ball Grinder was good, but I also have yet to find a meatball anywhere on Earth as good as my Dad's, so I'm going to be biased eternally. The Pork Belly, however, was so goddamn good. The key was the Asian steamed bum it was served in. It's like someone sliced a little circle of fluffy goodness of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and used it to bundle up my delicious pork product. I've never eaten anything like it before. The fries were boring, although shoestring has never been my favorite. They're pretty typical for a place that seems to thrive on atypical offerings. \n\nI'm definitely coming back here with a bigger appetite to try some of their full-serve offerings, and maybe one of those gourmet booze-infused milkshakes. They aren't too expensive, and the food is killer."

The onions were sweet and really good. I added an egg which was cooked perfectly so it ran to create it's own sauce from its yolk.

There was cheese inside but not too much which my partially Asian stomach appreciated.\n- Fried pickle spears: had the bumpy kind of breading which I liked\n- Milkshakes: my friends loved these fun combos like smores or banana peanut butter cup (drunken monkey). See above comment for why I couldn't enjoy one, but I would've loved to. They do have fun vodka flavors on hand to make these like chocolate coconut which I do want to try.\n- Fried bacon: never seen this outside of a county fair, but was pretty good in a smooth crispy batter\n- Longhorn burger: the hub got this with BBQ brisket on the burger which seems crazy, but as a meat lover pizza type, he liked it\n- Sweet potato fries: crispy and the right level of sweetness. I couldn't stop eating them.\n- Decor: liked the fun art on the walls with toki doki-like characters\n\nMidlights:\n- Philly cheese steak egg roll: they looked like the Jack in the Box ones--which I love by the way--but with a tough exterior  that didn't work for me\n\nLowlights: \n- Service: our waiter had a fun personality but the service was nonexistent. \n\nHad a fun lunch here--I'd come back and hope for better service."

S"What a cute theme for a restaurant.  Holsteins offers burgers, fries, and shakes as well as some salads and other sandwiches.  Cute cow theme throughout the restaurant.  \n\nOn this day we stopped in for lunch and a drink.  We had a cocktail and I had some sliders with fries.  I originally didn't think that it would be enough food but it turned out to be plenty.\n\nThey offer adult shakes with booze in them, which is always a fun idea.  I stuck to one of their specialty cocktails, which was very tasty and actually had some booze in it.  \n\nService was quick, friendly and efficient, a nice stop while touring the Cosmopolitan casino."

S"There's obviously lots of glamour in this restaurant. What can you expect in one of the newest/nicest hotels in Las Vegas with lots of people traffic? Because of this, I wanted to like it because of the gourmet burgers and fries (my type of unhealthy meal). We had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table for 4.\n\nI had The Rising Sun (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado). While I thought it was good--it wasn't extraordinary to me and I remember that none of us 4 really enjoyed the joint. If I had to come back, I'd try something else.\n\nService could've been better--lots of room for improvement. I guess I would recommend coming here but don't expect super amazing."

S"I've eaten at a lot of nice burger places in my life, living in SF (Umami Burger, Burger Bar, Roam Burger) and the burger I had at Holsteins was the best burger I've had. This is one of the best casual dining places to eat at the Cosmopolitan. It's on the second floor, across from Race Sports, China Poblano and Marquee. If you're thinking of eating at China Poblano, go here instead - it's 1/3 of the price and 3 times better.\n\nThere were a ton of creative burger options on the menu, as well as great looking milkshakes (probably equal to your entire daily caloric intake). Everyone raved about the Rising Sun burger and I've never had a Japanese twist to a burger before, nor a Kobe beef patty before. It was as good as the pictures look, and as good as everyone raves about. For $17, the bun was toasty and fresh, the teriyaki glaze was not too salty or overpowering, and the meat patty was moist and delicious. I couldn't really pinpoint the exact taste of the spicy mayo and furikake, but I'm sure it just complemented every bite. The crispy yam bits and tempura avocado added the perfect crunch. \n\nMy only complaint was the burger was a little hard to eat (it was super tall), and hard to get a little of everything in each bite, but nothing that would prevent me from ordering this again and again.  I paid $2 extra for onion rings which were perfectly fried, crispy, and fresh.\n\nEach bite was perfection - my mouth is salivating thinking about this meal. I haven't eaten a lot of burgers in Las Vegas, but I don't need to try any other places - I'll just keep coming back here to repeat this burger and new ones."

S'So I stayed in the Cosmo from March 8-12 and this was the first restaurant that we decided to dine in. Honestly wasn\'t planning on it but some friends from Las Vegas wanted to meet up here.\n\nFirst Impression....Ambiance, music, decor were all spectacularly modern. Place seemed like the spot to be for a Friday night bite. We were seated immediately (arrived at 7ish). The beer list is top notch and that is a huge deal for me when I am getting the evening started. Took us a while to all decide on what we should eat. Seemed like the server got a bit frustrated with our inability to make decisions.\n\nI went with the GOLD STANDARD, based on the servers recommendation. I have never had a dry aged burger, but boy am I craving one now holy smokes. Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli....I usually like to dry dog my meat....not one for lubrication as far as condiments and such go. But they did a fantastic job focusing on not slopping up such a delightful cut... er uh grind of beef. Pretty close to the best burger I have ever sunk my teeth into. Didnt even get around to polishing off the sweet potato fries....first ones I have ever had that were actually crispy...I understand how dificult it is to crispify a sweet potato fry.\n\nServer really pushed the spiked shakes...but I was so full....he said "Dude I can put it in a to-go cup for you"....I caved into the Raspberry Cheesecake Shake it was damn good....even after a night in the freezer...Vodka shake is good for breakfast boys and girls.\n\n****Server Cheesed it up by fist bumping me*****\nthought that was kinda lame but whatever\n\nEAT \nAT\nTHIS\nPLACE\nWHEN\nGOING\nON\nA\nBENDER\nIN\nLAS\nVEGAS!'

The menu is so unapologetically predictable but I can't say I'm disappointed. \n\nOur meal before flying home consisted of:\n-- 'bam-boozled shake' brown cow ($11): whipped cream vodka, root beer, vanilla ice cream & pop rocks. Reason for 4-star rating.\n-- black & white shake ($8): comes with an extra tumbler. Yummy! \n-- fried chicken fingers & waffles ($11): horrid! I've had better at Denny's. Everyone's got their version of this comfort-food fave, but please do it right. \n-- 'tiny buns' Maine lobster roll ($16.50 for 2): the chive aioli overpowered the dish. Loved the cute, tiny hot dog buns. \n-- 'tiny buns' pork belly bun ($9 for 2): I wanted to try, but after bf showed me the sheer amount of fat, I couldn't do it. Yes, animal fat scares me. (sidenote: BF prefers chairman bao.) \n\nFour stars because I love the idea of 'tiny buns,' & because I want to try every single alcoholic shake on the menu.

I tried the red velvet because it was the bartender's fav. It's crazy delicious, blended with real cake and garnished with a mini whoopie pie. \n\nWe tried the ahi sliders and fried pickles. The pickles come as spears. All of this proved to be too much food and I wish I would have known about the to-go cups. \n\nThe next time, I would like to try the Urth Burger-housemade veggie burger."

S"We wanted to go and take a look at the Cosmopolitan and get something to eat but most the venues were very busy in the hotel so we ended up at Holsteins. This place is very trendy and with the music so loud it's like eating in the middle of a nightclub, on the plus side the music was pretty good. The decor is somewhat surreal but it adds to the quirky feel of the place which is topped off by a huge pink cow.\n\nBy this point of my Vegas excursion I was sick of eating burgers, steaks and hugely calorific meals so I opted for the Cobb salad. I also had a milkshake which was pretty good as milkshakes go but come on, it's pretty difficult to screw up a milkshake. The salad turned up and it was delicious, on reflection there were probably more calories in the salad than a burger but the fact it was salad made me feel less guilty about eating it!\n\nAll in all, a fun place to go and eat, next time I'll try one of the burgers."

S'After reading a bunch of reviews and having Holstein\'s bookmarked for a long time, we finally decided to hit it for lunch. I like the decor with the weird art and they also have a bunch of growlers on display which they sale too. It\'s a lot smaller inside then I thought and for some reason, I thought the seats were super uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway, I went with the Rising Sun and my wife went with an Urth burger substituted with beef instead of a veggie patty. That\'s one cool thing...they will let you do pretty much anything you want with the burgers, mix & match or whatever. The burger itself is juicy but pretty plain in flavor. Both burgers had a good amount of toppings but since the meat is so plain, it\'s all you can taste. My burger did have a tempura avocado on it though and that on it\'s own was killer!\n\nFor the price, I really expected more. They up-charge $2 to swap your fries for onion rings or sweet potato fries and neither of those were worth that. We also got a Drunken Monkey shake that seems to be really popular...it was ok but $11 is crazy especially since we ordered it "virgin". All in all, everything was just ok and the service wasn\'t terrible but I won\'t be rushing back anytime soon.'

The burgers were juicy, and they offer a diverse array of cocktails, beers, and milkshakes! I liked that you could grab a seat without waiting in any lines, and that the service was polite and quick.\n\n* Hen House ($15) - 4.5 STARS: Beef With Fried Egg, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato And Onion With Mustard & Ketchup. This was probably my favorite burger, even though it is so simple. Ordered medium rare, ofcourse.\n\n* The Longhorn ($17) - 3.5 STARS: Beef Patty Topped With Texas Smoked Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Creamy Cole Slaw & Dill Pickle. I thought for sure this would take the cake, but there was alot going on. Sometimes simple is the best way to go.\n\n* Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese ($16.5) - 4 STARS: Creamy Tallegio-Mascarpone Sauce With Maine Lobster And Black Truffle. This was uber cheesy and truffly.

When I got my bill (everyone had separate checks), the coke was still on and when I brought it to the servers attention, she said she would take care of it. I was then brought my change with a coke in a to-go container and it still on the bill. In addition to auto-gratuity it was $30. So not worth it!

My friend ordered the California Turkey burger. It was so wet, the bun was soggy and the entire burger just fell apart. It was too difficult to eat so she really didn't enjoy it. \n\nMy husband had one of the beef burgers, requested it medium-well and it was definitely undercooked.\n\nOur server was probably the worst part of the experience. He was condescending and very difficult to get his attention when we needed something. Specifically we wanted the bill and then to pay so we could get on with our night.

I had a tiramisu shake (and they give you the leftover mix, which I think is nice) and a spicy (forget name) burger.  Everything was awesome.  Since I was in a hurry we sat in the lounge.

Thats fried avacado. If you aren't already ordering this burger as we speak I don't know what else to say to you.\n\n\nWhat to Avoid\nNom Nom- this is pretty meh. Kobe beef should be so good it stands on its own (you are paying enough for that anyway)- but here it is covered in potato chips and 1000 island dressing- a dissapointment\n\nCalifornia Turkey- if you are trying to eat healthy this probably isn't the place for you but even the veggie burger is better than this"

S'I have mixed feelings about Holsteins! I want to love it so badly but I just can\'t! It\'s like the friend-zoned "I love you but I\'m not IN love with you" type of feeling. \n\nThe vibe and decor of the restaurant is cute and energetic and the servers are wonderful and attentive. The menu is also creative and has so many unique options for burger toppings such as cole slaw, tempura avocado, and fried egg. But when it comes down to it the food is just meh. Without even including the fact that the prices are a bit steep for burgers that are on the small side. On more than one occasion the shoestring fries came out overcooked and the meat undercooked (though I did ask for medium rare..). The unique ingredients and flavors also don\'t meld as much as I\'d like them to. \n\nI do however recommend the Fun-ghi burger which is underrepresented on this Yelp page (beef patty, grilled portobello, truffle oil, frisee) as well as the steak fries which are seasoned and plump. The Gold Standard has VERY strong flavors which didn\'t tingle my taste buds as much as I hoped it would. I found myself wanting to slather it in some other type of sauce which is never a good sign. Shakes are basic but love the alcoholic options. Also if you want to swap out fries for a side salad it\'s a $2 charge which is ridiculous because who actually WANTS salad over fries, usually it\'s an attempt to calm a guilty conscience. Overall, not everything here is delicious but there ARE some great menu items which are worth coming back for :)'

S'Updating once again based on experiencing the BILLIONAIRE BURGER.\n\nMy friend and I ended up eating here because we came to Cosmopolitan to eat at Comme Ca, unfortunately SEMA was in town and Comme Ca was hosting an event in their dining room. Being that we did not want to sit and eat at the overly crowded bar at Comme Ca, we walked over to Holsteins. We had to wait for a seat here too so I was really freakin hungry when we sat down. \n\nOne bummer about this experience was they did not bring out any complimentary popcorn. *womp womp*\n\nOther than that our server was very nice and helpful. He knew the menu well. BUT. My friend and I knew we were getting the Billionaire Burger because we HAD to have a burger with foie gras in it. Yep. This burger comes with a big chunk of grilled foie gras right in the burger. It has Kobe beef with frisee, port-onion marmalade and truffle mayonnaise. DANG. If you don\'t feel like hitting the high-roller tables after this burger something is wrong with you. I also added some cheese to mine. \n\nWe also split the "Snickers, Please!" dessert, which was decent, but I would suggest going with one of their bomboozled milkshakes and have it WITH your burger instead.\n\nHolstein\'s does it RIGHT in the world of fancy burgers in Vegas.'

S'While the rest of our friends were getting ready to go clubbing later that night, a couple of my buddies and I decided to grab some burgers before going bar hopping around Fremont Street.  I originally wanted to check out Holstein\'s after seeing them on our last Vegas trip, but there wasn\'t an opportunity to go since we had already planned out the rest of our meals.  After I read Yelp friend Cat C.\'s review though, I told my friends it was a must for our next trip!\n\nAlthough some Yelpers have complained about how long the wait was for a table, we didn\'t run into the same problem.  Luck must have been on our side because not only did it take just a few minutes until we were seated, but we also got a server (Jennifer?) who was both awesome and way cute.  Double win!  A bunch of the burgers on the menu sounded pretty appealing (especially The Rising Sun, The Steakhouse, and Korean "Bull"gogi), but somehow the three of us managed to order the exact same thing - the Gold Standard (Dry Aged Beef Sirloin with Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula, and Garlic Chive Aioli) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=vErdAOwPAfm6PP_uFDmjEQ).\n\nThe patty was cooked perfectly - just a touch of pink on the inside, juicy, and a light char on the outside.  Adding in the smoked bacon just made it that much better (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=t6cDviH3qCnh95L9pnFaVA).  While all of the condiments worked really well together, I have to admit all that aged goat cheddar got to be a bit much.  Not bad for the first half of the burger, but I was reminded during the last half why I\'m not a huge fan of goat cheese.  We all agreed though that the biggest knock was the bun - a bit dry and pretty plain.  Just making it smaller and less airy would have gone a long way.\n\nAll things considered, the prices for their burgers aren\'t unreasonable.  At about $13-$18 each, you actually get your money\'s worth for the most part (unlike China Poblano next door...).  Whichever one you get though, I\'d suggest choosing the shoestring fries to go with it (they\'re more like regular cut fries than "shoestring").  While the tin of steak fries that came with my order were fine, I thought the shoestring fries my friend had were crispier and a little more flavorful.  Now I just have to go back and try one of Holstein\'s shakes - preferably of the alcoholic variety.'

Get them with a drink and bounce hahah that's it. They charged an extra dollar for the Chipotle ranch. Il stick regular ranch.  Don't charge us a buck for Chipotle ranch....come on now. Include it  \nWell I won't come back! Not a fan."

S"It's almost hard to believe that Holstein's is run by the same people responsible for LBS at the Red Rock. I guess if I had to make an analogy, this place is like Michael Jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas LBS is LaToya (or maybe even Janet) and the LBS Patty Wagon is Tito.\n\nWhat that means, is this place rocks. The menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.\n\nThe Rising Sun ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, I had to look up furikake to know what it was... I'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. The ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. If I have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. The thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't Macauley Culkin say the same thing to MJ?).\n\nMy wife got the Gold Standard ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. She loved it and only let me have one bite. If you want a more traditional burger, go for this. But, I still thought the Rising Sun was better.\n\nEach burger came with an order of fries. So She got the regular fries and I got he steak cut fries. Both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.\n\nOur son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. That's always a winner with him. It came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.\n\nEven after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. Our choice... lollipops. The chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. The lemon meringue and red velvet cake were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.\n\nDespite the lackluster dessert, the burgers were so good I can overlook that misstep. We didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. I'm not sure if I'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed."

S"Came here to eat lunch during my last day in Vegas with a friend. We were looking for a place inside the Cosmo to eat (besides Wicked Spoon, which we went to more than once already) and ended up here. I was really disappointed by the food here.\n\nI ordered the California Turkey w/ Shoestring Fries, along with a fried egg on top. I've had turkey burgers at other places before that were tasty, but this place didn't get it right at all. The meat was dry and there was no flavor to it. What made it even worse was that they stuck the big toothpick right into the fried egg. The yolk broke and started running before my dish even got to me. It got to the point where I had to use a knife and fork to eat, because the bottom of the patty got so soggy that I couldn't even pick up my burger.\n\nService was okay. The waitress took our orders and brought out the food pretty fast, and checked on us occasionally. When we asked to split the check by a certain amount, the waitress said she could only split it 50/50.\n\nI would be very reluctant to come back and try this place again. I can get better tasting burgers for under $15 (about the average price here). They can't even serve a fried egg properly."

S"Despite the choice location and the cool decor, as well as the numerous glowing reviews, I have to say that I was disappointed in my trip to Holstein's. The service was standoffish, and though we ordered the things that were recommended in other reviews, I think we all walked away feeling like we were missing something. \n\nActually, to be honest, my choice, the Rising Sun burger, was probably at about a four star. It was an interesting combo of avocado, crispy yam strips, furikake, and teriyaki sauce, However, the selections that my dining partners got hovered at about two stars... or maybe even lower. One of my friends got the lobster roll and proclaimed it the worst she'd ever had. \n\nThose who got the steak fries seemed to enjoy them, but I got the shoestring fries and found them to be cold and a bit stale tasting. Apparently the shakes were mighty tasty as well, though I wasn't feeling something heavy and dairy-laden that day so I passed.\n\nIt's too bad because all I wanted after a long night out was a fulfilling, tasty burger and other comfort food selections. I wouldn't completely rule out giving this place another try because I feel like we may have just gone on an off day, but honestly there are so many choices in Vegas it's hard to overlook a bad experience."

S'Burger for the boys!  How about gourmet burgers?  Even better.  Holstein is located near the East tower elevators in Cosmo.  Right across Marquee nightclub.  \n\nMany yelpers recommended the "Gold Standard,"  and with that name, I went for it.  After sinking my teeth into the dry aged sirloin burger, a sudden disappointment hit me.  I might\'ve gotten a little too much goat cheese in the first bite, so went for a second bite.  No!  It can\'t be.  The Gold Standard did not meet my standard for a burger.  Oversalted and didn\'t go well with the goat cheese.  Yes, I like goat cheese too.  \n\nIt\'s okay though!! There\'s crispy pork burns on the table.  My first pork bun was at Ippudo in NYC.  I understood the hype within seconds and ordered a second.  The pork buns from Holsteins didn\'t let me relive that moment.  There was too much hoisin sauce, which made it overly salty.  Oh, the pork was also dry.  \n\nOur waiter was actually pretty nice.  However, the service was slow.  The restaurant was full and I saw him constantly filling orders, so I could sympathize.  I usually destroy my burgers and leave nothing but I just couldn\'t finish my burger and pork buns.  Salt was used very liberally.'

S'We were so looking forward to Holsteins for the burger fix we had been delaying for weeks before our visit to Vegas. So when we arrived at Cosmo, we headed up to Holsteins on the 2nd floor on a Sunday evening and walked to the hostess desk at check in. \n\nFrom the get go I already had a predetermination that we weren\'t going to get the friendliest girls to check in with. I figure, put your tasks aside, and greet your f\'in customer. At least acknowledge them immediately. Ok, so maybe it was that bad- she took my name, gave me the pager, and told me it will be just a few with a semi-courteous attitude. So we walked around out front a bit, I went over to the bar across the way and picked up a brew, went back to have a seat outside the restaurant. Then I noticed my pager was chirping. This wasn\'t the typical light up and vibrate situation we\'re all used to when they are paging us to check in. This was an intermittent chirp, no lights, as if it was possibly telling me the battery was running low. I don\'t know! So I got up, stopped inside to inquire about, or let the hostess know (she was the same one who helped me just like seven minutes prior) the pager, and she acted like if I was freshly coming in for the first time. (mind you I had the pager held up to the hostess desk... And my beer in my other hand) The first words out of her mouth, so directly were, "I\'m sorry! No outside drinks in here". That tripped me out and I told her about the pager chirping... "Well, it will light up when it\'s ready". I was like, ya I knew that I decided she can go F herself, I\'ll just wait a bit more. \n\nSo ok. We were paged, checked in, asked to meet the hostess down in the middle... She was a little more personable. So we sat, and sat... Well it was longer than it should have been. Got our popcorn :D, my beer, her coke, waitress was pretty nice... Told me the Rising Sun Burger I just placed my order for was the house favorite (Thanks Yelp!). It wasn\'t until she checked in on us, and at which I inquired about the plate I ordered when she got all defensive. I\'m sorry, but I just couldn\'t recall if my burger had a fried egg on it or not. Thanks to all the photos on Yelp! Excuse me if I got confused. She proceeded to say things like, "Well did you order one?", "Did you want one?" As I explained this to her, she just kind of gave me the stink eye and walked away. That is why you didn\'t receive a tip missy. Sorry if that ruined your day.\n\nBut with that said, the hostesses walking around acting like they were directing air traffic with their little radios and smug looks on their face... Holsteins, food maybe be packed full of flavor, possibly a little under portioned, you need to give your staff a lesson in attitude... \n\nWhen we visit Vegas, we drop money, lots of it. I don\'t care if your trendy or haute... Service is what bring the clients back.'

S"I ate here on Saturday, August 20th. There were two concerts that night, plus the fact is was Saturday made it very crowded. The 20 minute wait wasn't a problem. The fact that the pager went off to tell us that they were ready to seat us when they weren't was the problem. We had to wait another 10 minutes.  \n\nBe warned that the music is VERY LOUD. You have to yell at everyone which gets old. I'm use to loud music in a club but not when I'm eating.  The redeeming qualities of the music are that the bass is low so you can't feel it in your chest and the mix is arranged nicely.\n\nThe milkshakes are really tasty. They range from $11-14. You get two drinks for that price since you also get a completely filled shake container. My boyfriend liked his Korean Bull Gogi burger. I got the chicken and waffle appetizer. It wasn't anything special about it. I like that they gave us a small bucket of popcorn while waiting for our food. It didn't seem to take too long for the food to come out but they gave us popcorn anyway. \n\nA little annoyance for me that has nothing to do with the stars was the tie wearing. The waiters are suppose to wear ties, but they have to stick them in their shirts so they don't flop around. It looks weird, like they're wearing ascots. I think the restaurant should either give them shorter ties or supply tie clips.  \n\nI would go back here for the milkshakes, just the milkshakes."

S"After checking out the Cosmo hotel, we went on a hunt for something to eat. Most of the restaurants weren't opening until later that day (opening weekend of the hotel) so we didn't have many options.\n\nWe waited a while before being seated, despite the fact that there were numerous open tables and TONS of staff just STANDING AROUND.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes before anyone approached us. Staff was EXTREMELY disorganized, but I'll give that to them since the establishment had hardly been open for a few days.\n\nOur food came and it was pretty good, despite the fact that the kitchen didn't get our orders right. My medium well burger was pretty charred and extremely overcooked (well done).\n\nTHEN, MY FRIEND PULLED OUT A HAIR FROM HER BURGER!!!!!\n\nWe told one of our waiters (won't even get into the confusion with this), who informed the manager and told us he would speak to us. The manager never approached us. At this point, we were extremely fed up. After the waiter spoke to him again, the manager came to our table, apologized and asked to replace the meal. We ordered our friend a chicken caesar salad salad and a shake since the poor thing hardly had a quarter of her burger.\n\nOur waiter brought out the salad and shake to go along with our bill and informed us that the manager would not exclude the shake from our bill. Considering the above events, this was pretty ridiculous. \n\nOn top of it all, there was no chicken on the salad.\n\nTHE END.\n\nWish Jose Andres new restaurant upstairs was open as this was our first choice. At least we got a glimpse of the chef while we were checking that place out."

But that's ok, although my Longhorn burger wasn't as good, it's no flakeout in the burger department.  Just not as exotic an explosion in your mouth as the traditional Japanese flavors that are perfectly introduced into the western standard that is the burger on a bun called, once again, The Rising Sun.  And let me tell you, this burger planetarian will now orbit around this fabulous burger.\n\nThe beers are nice and cold and that's what I reverted to after an uber strong margarita on the rocks.  I treated it like a shot, cause at $14 there's no way I'd leave it sitting on the table.  We were seated immediately, the service was fast, extremely friendly and ready to answer any questions we had about the menu.\n\nI can't wait to go back, and guess what I'll be ordering next time?

Very chic and modern, pretty much the standard at the Cosmo. Here were a couple of things we ordered:\n\nGold standard- 4/5- Really solid burger. The bacon blended perfectly with the sirloin patty.\n\nRising Sun- 4.5/5- This burger is an amazing combination of kobe beef with tempura avocado. Super tasty.\n\nSmores milk shake- 4/5- This shake was amazing! However, it was dang expensive, $13 for a small shake! However, a little indulgence never hurts.\n\nOverall, our hostess was super nice. However, they seemed to be understaffed and I had to yell out to them to get their attention.

Sure you could go across the street and stuff your face for 1/10 of the price at Fatburger, but you wouldn't feel sexy like you do here.\n\nFrom the high class cheddar popcorn served in a stainless steel bucket to the wildly over priced beers on tap, you can rest assured you're dining on the Vegas Strip when you pay the check.\n\nEverything we ordered was on a level above.  From the perfectly cooked thick cut bacon to the freshest avocado that tasted like it came straight from your mother's garden.  Just reading the menu will have your mouth salivating and anyone who loves food will appreciate the interesting and creative combinations displayed in their menu.\n\nIt was a tough decision but I went forth with the Gold Standard.  How could I pass up an awesome dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli?  Oh man, my mouth is salivating just thinking about it!\n\nThe French fries were fresh and the attention to detail was impressive.  Our food arrived in perfect photogenic state and we didn't hesitate to flash a few photos of those beautiful burgers to honor the day.  Taking time to masticate our fine fare and truly savoring our meals only added to the experience.  A few beers later our very attentive wait staff had us mulling over the dessert menu.  Any other meal with a lesser burger and dessert victory would have been mine.  However, this burger deserved to be tasted the rest of the night.\n\nHere's to expensive burgers!  Cheers!"

I know it's the strip, but $11 for a dogfish head beer??  $11 for a drunken milkshake is one thing but the beer situation is crazy.  Speaking of drunken milkshakes, I tried the drunken monkey milkshake.  It's basically a huge milkshake with banana, reese's cups and Frangelico.  Was sooo good!  What was not so good is the massive gut ache I got shortly after eating it but that could be on me.\n\nThe fried pickles I ordered as an appetizer were pretty good and I have high standards being from the place which claims to have invented the frickled pickle.  The lobster roll I ordered, in addition to being kind of bland and all mayo, consisted of two teeny buns and were definitely not worth the $18 price tag.  For $55 before tip, I can think of many other places I would rather go.  I have seen reference to some popcorn in other reviews but I didn't see this while there.

S"#vakseen4taste At this point Holsteins has become one of those spots we hit anytime we're in Vegas. They have a great beer, cocktail and food selection. Last night we started with the truffled lobster mac n cheese. I've actually been dying to try this dish and it was pretty good. Not great, but good. I'd say it was more the seasoning (or lack of) and flavor of the actual cheese sauce used that could've been better. I expected something a little more rich and creamy. The best thing about this dish is that they didn't go light on the lobster. You had chunks in almost every bite. From there I had the Captain hook (Grilled atlantic salmon w/ frissee, pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo & house cured gravlax) which was excellent. I ordered the salmon medium and it came out a little closer to medium welll, yet it was still flaky and amazing. The combination of flavors in this sandwich are crazy! The house cured gravlax...WOW. Service was pretty quick considering the Final 4 was on and the place was packed. I'd actually recommend making reservations before coming because this place is always packed. Before I forget, our server was very friendly and barely clothed lol. I mean literally her ass was hanging out of her shorts, a LA Hooters. No complaints on my end, but the ladies found it pretty entertaining lol. Just a tip if you bring the jealous type. All in all, a great experience as expected. Food 8.5/10. Service 8/10.

S"Okay so once again I'm going to disagree with my fellow yelp reviewers and say that I was not wowed by my meal at Holsteins Shakes and Buns, and I think there are better burger places in Vegas. Holsteins is located at The Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino directly across the entrance to the Marquee Pool and Day club. Because of the location you will need to have a reservation or be prepared to wait with the diva's and meat sticks that frequent the place.  We did have a reservation and were seated on time. The decor at Holsteins is eighties cool. Cartoon Artwork dots the walls, boom boxes are painted in bright colors and a huge pink cow welcomes you in the bar area. After looking over the menu, my wife Simone ordered the Meatball Parm sliders and I ordered the Nom-Nom burger topped with melted cheese, Potato Chips and House made thousand Island dressing. The food came out fairly quickly, and on the side I had some tasty crunchy potato stick thin french fries. My burger however was overcooked ( ordered medium and got well done). An overcooked burger made with fresh ground meat ends up tasting like sawdust, and this was the case. The burger could have been saved by the dressing, but there was very little of the dressing on it. The Chips on top were the best part of the burger. Medium thin hand cut and fried perfectly, they stayed crispy on the sandwich and gave a nice contrast to the burger, but overall this burger sounded better then it tasted. Simone's sliders were the exact opposite of my burger. The meatballs had great garlicky flavor, they were moist, tender and tasted fresh. They were topped with a mixture of sweet marinara and basil pesto and lots of melted creamy mozzarella. I so wanted to steal them from her and I had total meat envy.  We finished off the meal with a Reese PB adult shake spiked with Frangelico called the Drunken Monkey.  Any monkey that could get drunk off this would have to be a lightweight because I could taste no alcohol in it whatsoever. It was still good, once again just not as good as advertised.  So in the end I would have given Holsteins a 2 star rating for my food however Simone's sliders choice saved the day...so overall Holsteins gets a three stars from me."

The service was slow  and it is a bit pricey but the atmosphere was nice. I am still not sure if foie gras should be in a burger, but it was tasty and I quickly devoured my half. Love the sliders, the little buns were soft and fluffy and the sauce was a great compliment to the dish. My mint shake was awesome, I couldn't taste the alcohol and it gave me a little buzz, but I am not sure if $11 is worth it. All in all pricey but good... use comps if you got 'em."

Did you know cake-flavored vodka existed? NEITHER DID I!!!! The roomie had Captain Crunch, which, yes, has bits of Cap\'n Crunch cereal in it.\n\nThe staff was amazing and friendly, even more than usual. It was a busy Friday night, with the Rodeo in town and Marquee getting ready to open for the night, but the servers made our table feel like the most important one.

S'"That\'s a pretty f****** good milkshake. I don\'t know if it\'s worth five dollars but it\'s pretty f******g good." Vincent from Pulp Fiction\n\nMilkshakes are delicious! Expensive, but delicious! Seriously, that was the first thing that flashes in my head when I think of that milkshake. We got the black and white malted, and unf, I would love to have it again. Don\'t know if it was worth the price though. \n\nSo I like it. Got the Bulgogi burger because 1) I love bulgogi burgers and 2) I don\'t remember the last time I had one.\n\nMy verdict? You know, it was good, but there needs to be more kimchi (hello, I\'m Korean), the marinade is weaksauce (seriously needs more), and I don\'t think I\'m a fan of a bulgogi burger made with ground beef and no mayo. It\'s not a bad burger, just not for me. I would\'ve liked it a little more like how my mom makes it, or how I\'m used to in Korea: lots of thin slices of delicious, tender, fragrant marinated beef with some mayo.\n\nAtmosphere was great. I like eating at a trendy place with a DJ spinning. It\'s nice and it gives it a club atmosphere. The wait staff was really friendly, and the food came out pretty fast. I love how things come out in little buckets. Cute!\n\nPortions are... on the smaller side. Maybe I\'m used to mountains of fries coming out with my burgers, but it was a little bit of a let down.\n\nI also didn\'t realize that this place only serves burgers. I felt so bad for my boyfriend because he does NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES for reasons fuzzy eat burgers. There was almost nothing for him to eat, and so he barely ate anything. He got the Meatball Grinder, and it was a super tiny order on buns, which he didn\'t eat. He liked the meatballs... but seriously wasn\'t enough food for him.\n\nIf you eat here, make sure that everyone is okay with eating burgers.'

S"Very loud atmosphere, across from Marquee. Burgers are hit or miss, depending on personal preference and type of burger ordered. Hubs loved his Billionaire burger, which had a good chunk of foie gras. I found my Steakhouse burger a bit salty. The tomato confit, sauteed mushrooms, and marmalade onions were tasty additions to the burger itself, though. \n\nBurgers are large, and the bottom bun is a bit too thick for my liking, although it stands up well to the toppings and creamy sauces. Fries were similarly salty. No option to sub a salad for the bun, which is rather disappointing. You can, however, pay more to sub a salad for the fries. For a heavy meal and a satisfying piece of cow, this won't disappoint."

S'When I had to make my way across the "skywalk" to work on the other side of the street, I always took a "short cut" through the Cosmo upstairs.  After our dinner at China Poblano, I learned to pay more attention to what else was up there, which was the reason why I zeroed in on Holstein\'s.  And hey - any restaurant serving burgers that even utilizes the COW\'S FREAKIN\' NAME, had better be ready to \'bring it\', as far as I\'m concerned.  So when Bear and I selected it for our burger fix, we were prepared for - at the very least - a \'transformative experience.\'\n\nSo was it THAT kind of deal? Nope, not really.  But you could do SO much worse.\n\nFirst of all - as promised - I have to give a shout-out to our server, Amanda.  Just that right, attractive combination of smiles, sass and \'savoir faire\'\' (NOTE TO MANAGERS: GET this woman a raise, STAT!) I\'ve always loved that in the better restaurants in town, the staff always have an \'inside/out\' knowledge of the menu and the daily specials, and in this particular area, Amanda did not disappoint. (Which is why Holstein\'s gets an extra star.)  With so many different styles of burger to choose from, it could have been an all-day task to select just one, but with her help, I chose the Nom-Nom Burger ($16.50), while Bear went "classic" and got the Gold Standard ($17.50). \n\nPricey? Well, DUH! What does anybody expect when they\'re using Kobe and dry- aged sirloin to craft the frickin\' burgers? (And don\'t forget - this IS a \'Strip\' joint we\'re talking about here, people!) And while we waited - but not for long - we got to check out the unique decor that included anime-style artwork of the Holstein\'s "mascot".  Cute...especially considering that he\'s on the menu as well as the wall!\n\nFor our \'intro\', we had the Buffalo Chicken Dip ($12.00) a cluckin\'-good twist on chili con queso served with warm tortilla chips, and Bear\'s \'de rigeur\' item to try, the Cuban Street Tacos ($13.00) a delicious menage-a-trois of roast pork, ham and Swiss lovingly drizzled with pickle and spicy mustard aioli. The bite I had of one of them made me wonder if I should\'ve gotten a separate appetizer as well....\n\nAnd then came the burgs.  Bear liked his Standard just fine, and I added some \'meat candy\' (aka BACON!) to my Nom-Nom for about two bucks more. I didn\'t know if I expected a burger with barbecue potato chips and 1000 Island dressing to actually work, but damn if didn\'t, and in quite a tasty way, too. (But then again...name one thing that doesn\'t taste better with bacon on it.)  It was quite the stunning companion to my Frozen Grasshopper Shake ($11.00).  And the fries served with were just the way I like them: crispy, spicy shoestrings, with none of the greasiness you get from other burger joints.\n\nSo, sure, Holstein\'s is giving up burgers, but not at Jack-In-The-Box prices, so it\'s always best to keep that in mind.  And as repeat visits go, I think we can file this one under "Special Occasions" mostly.  And we will always ask to be seated in Amanda\'s section...'

S"Burgers burgers burgers!\n\nIt ended up being a burger weekend for me in Vegas. After having my usual In-n-Out, Carl's Jr and Jacks, I decided I'd treat myself to a really good one. I didn't get to have dinner until 11pm and this was one of the few places in the hotel still open.\n\nBoy it didn't disappoint! I had the Steakhouse Burger and some hand cut fries. Decided to skip the milkshakes and have a beer instead. Brooklyn Pale Ale did the job.\n\nMy coworker opted for the Classic and had no complaints.\n\nService was fast and friendly. Besides, it was 11pm on a Monday night and the place was practically empty. Ask for Justin!\n\nLike most things in The Cosmopolitan, it's a bit on the pricier side. The bill for two can easily hit $50 and that's even before the booze. It's ok though because it was well worth it.\n\nBe warned though...the place is LOUD (Marquee nightclub is across the hall plus the restaurant had it's own DJ.)

From the menu description, the Fun-ghi burger contains: Beef Patty, Truffle Marinated Portabella Mushroom, Carmelized Onion, Gruyere, Mayonnaise, & Frisee.  We also added avocado to ours and ordered the patty to be cooked medium rare.  The burger was juicy and had an abundance of flavors from all the ingredients.  The buffalo wings were very good too.

S'Holstein\'s is such a cute place; I love the little cow! Well, maybe not just "cute" - it is also very well designed, spacious, and modern in addition to having a cute little cow as its mascot. But we don\'t go to places because they\'re cute, we go for the food, right? My boyfriend and I both ordered the ahi tuna sliders with the fries on the side, and he loved them. I did not like the sliders. They were creatively prepared and looked delicious, however, something about the tuna was off-putting for me. That is just me, though - he gives them rave reviews. Seeing that I had enjoyed a (huge) burger at a different restaurant in Vegas our first night, and ended up at Holstein\'s because our first choice had a much longer wait, I figured that ahi tuna sliders would give me enough variety and not make me feel like "ugh, burgers again?". Enough about my slight dislike of the sliders, though. The fries were amazing, and so was the chili mayo that they came with! Mmmmmmm....such a good combination, just the right mix of sweet and spicy (for the mayo). The service we received was warm, friendly, and enthusiastic (on all fronts, from the hostess to our waitress). I can\'t wait to come back, because the other dishes that I saw looked incredible and I definitely want to try those out (along with a boozy shake!).'

It immediately grabbed my interest. The staff is friendly down to earth and looked like they were having fun. ( who wouldn\'t wearing hot jeans and chucks to work everyday ) . I was entertaining friends so we immediately ordered the appetizers that were perfect for everyone ( the foodies at the table and the overworked and just plain hungry) We had the duck tacos .... AMAZING and the crab mac and cheese .... to die for ! For lunch our table was impressed with the array of offerings. We had everything from burgers, the homemade sausages and salads. Every dish tasted better then then the last. THEN .... the best part of every ones day... THE CANDY STORE. You must order it.

Our server was very accommodating and had all sorts of things to recommend. He brought out free popcorn for us as starters. It tasted very interesting, like spicy BBQ...\n\nI got the Rising Sun burger which was very delicious with the fried avocado inside! Every burger also comes with a side of fries. I had ordered sweet potato fries but they gave me the regular skinny fries instead. I didn't mind because they were nice and crispy but once I let them know about the mistake, they brought out the sweet potato fries immediately which was nice. I also ordered the Frozen Grasshopper which was one of their alcoholic milk shakes with peppermint and chocolate. It was also delicious and I could not taste the alcohol at all.\n\nTip: if you check-in on foursquare and show your server, they will give you a free pint of draft beer! (we got this and the beer was very smooth and did not taste cheap at all)\n\nOverall it was a very nice experience. I loved the cute cartoony cow deco all around the restaurant.

S"Wow... this establishment turned out to be a home run!\n\nWe were in Las Vegas attending a tradeshow and ventured out to Holsteins on a recommendation of a friend. Holstein is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. Just go up the escalator near the entrance of casino/hotel adjacent to Las Vegas Blvd. and you'll see it.\n\nFirst off, don't let the prices discourage you. It is very much worth it. It can be a little out of the way, but the trip is definitely worth it as well. For a burger entree, expect to pay $16-20 depending on which burger  you get.\n\nWe came in for lunch around 2PM on a Friday. There wasn't any wait and we were seated immediately. The waitress was extremely nice and accommodating. I did catch her name, but my receipt says her name is Tiffany.\n\nThere's a lot of good burger options and it was kind of difficult to find the one that I wanted to try. I ended up with the Nom Nom burger. The burger was really good. More like amazing! The french fries that came with the meal wasn't bad either. There wasn't anything really special about the french fries.\n\nMy two colleagues both ordered Classic burgers. I think they were a little more old school and wanted something less fancy smancy. Totally a preference thing. Both of them are usually pretty talkative, but once the food came out and they bit into their burgers, the table pretty much became silent. That's usually a sign that the food was really good. They thoroughly enjoyed their burgers and definitely agreed that it was worth the money.\n\nI rate Holsteins 5 stars out of 5. Great food. Great service. Burgers are amazing. Service is quick. There's not a whole lot to complain about. It was definitely a solid experience. If there was something to complain about, it would be the price, BUT given that it was Las Vegas it was ball park. We have had more expensive food that was drastically less tasty.\n\nTips: If you aren't near the Cosmo, Holsteins might be a little out of the way, definitely make an effort to go.\n\nHolstein charges $3.95 for Iced Tea. Might be the case with other establishments in the area as well.\n\nPrepare to be very lost with burger options... so many good signature burgers... maybe review the menu before hand?? I was torn between 3 or 4 burgers but ended up choosing the Nom Nom (Kobe beef, potato chips, Island dressing). No idea why... :P\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for directions... I think all the casinos are designed to be death traps and mazes."

I didn't get a chance to the weekend before but this past week, I did. After Marquee Day club, my friends and I headed over and waited about 25 minutes. When we got seated the server quickly came and took our order for drinks. For all you light weight alcoholic girls, this is the place to drink. The milkshakes are alcoholic but only contains 1 oz of alcohol. For many, that's way too less. But for me, give me my Peaches N' Creme! I'll be trying all the flavors, don't you worry. tasted no alcohol at all. But I love the fact of knowing I'm drinking in Vegas, still. :) \n\nI got the Rising Sun burger. It was a huge patty with some tempura pieces and avocado. Avocado always makes the burger better. They gave options for shoestring fries or steak cut fries. Uhh.. SHOESTRINGS FRIES of course. I absolutely love shoestrings fries of all fries. On top of that, I also ordered the Holsteins cobb salad. I have to make sure to keep my food light if I'm going to all these pool parties, you know. I like the cobb. I'm not sure why people don't think it's worth it. I did note that the avocado slices were not ripe. \n\nWe had decent service. Could have been better because they don't come around and check up on you much. We actually waved down our waitress a couple times. But, it was a busy afternoon. The food was good and convenient being right across from Marquee on the 2nd floor. It's pricey but gourmet burgers are always double digits so it was expected."

S'My Yelp friend Vi Y. recommended the Watermelon Bubblegum Icee - and I\'m glad I listened!  It felt like that time when I needed to look over my shoulder before my dad or mom caught me spiking my drink!  It was such a fun drink with a great grown-up vodka twist - so sweet and refreshing, and definitely made me a happy girl.  Their other bamboozled shakes are just as intriguing and fun - how could you not want to try a grown up root beer float like a Brown Cow (Root Beer, Vanilla Ice Cream, Pop Rocks and Meyer\'s rum)?\n\nAs for the food we love to nosh on the small plates here.  There is a maply-sweetness to the batter in the Southern Fried Chicken Fingers-N-Waffles and comes with a small and cute waffle.  The buttermilk sauce definitely doesn\'t come from a bottle. Some might think this is a small serving but I think it\'s just right as I get to indulge on something like this without the 2000 calories a full order would have, and still have room to try other menu notables like:\n\nLobster/Truffled Mac and Cheese\nCrispy Pork Belly buns\nShoe string fries\nSweet Potato fries\nKorean "Bull"gogi burger  (soy marinated burger with fried egg, kimchee slaw)\n\nThe huzbeau and I have come here with just the two of us and another time with a party of four, and wait was minimal with no reservations.  But its always advisable to call if you plan on coming here during busy times like before a show (like a lot of people do)!\n\nService was attentive and its a great, casual atmosphere.  The graffiti artwork on the walls is amazing and very classy-urbanesque.  A great stop to make if you\'re in town - located right behind the beautiful Chandelier bar in the Cosmopolitan.'

S"Holstein's is a solid upscale burger joint. The food is dependably good. The shoe string fries are crispy. The cartoon cows on the wall all dream about getting eaten. That's fun and quirky.\n\nNote: The hotel brochure tries to market this place as organic and natural. The only hint in the menu was that one ingredient of the salad was organic. If the beef were organic and free range, I'd come back."

S'Very good burger....\n\nI have eaten burgers here on three different occasions.  It is convenient since I often stay at the Cosmo while in Vegas.\n\nMy first two times I was here, I was not impressed by their burgers.  This 3rd time, I ordered again their Rising Sun burger (Kobe beef, teriyaki sauce, yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado).  The combination of different flavors worked really well together and this burger is definitely a hit with me.  The bun, a standard burger bun, was a bit stiffer than I prefer but the overall goodness of the burger makes me overlook this minor shortcoming.  I strongly recommend trying this burger.\n\nThe fries were ordinary and need salt, imo.\n\nHolsteins offers a good range of exotic beers which I always like to taste-test when I am out.  Perhaps about 15 beers on tap of non-standard-fare beers.\n\nGet a burger here and have the Rising Sun!'

S'My review will strictly be on what I ordered:\n\nBilionaire Burger - HOLY S***.  Talk about TOTAL MOUTH RICHNESS TO THE MAXXX.  Here\'s the thing.. I love foie gras to begin with so there was no hesitation at all to get this burger.  And being from Cali, I had to get it since it\'s banned here.  Anyway, they were very generous with the foie gras portion.  It was fatty, melt in your mouth goodness.  The "kobe" beef patty was fatty and meaty at the same time.  Huge on true BEEF flavor.  I quote "kobe" because we should all know by there that REAL kobe beef cannot be sold outside of Japan.  ANYWAY, the truffle mayo was the perfect schmear to compliment all the components in the burger.  The port marmalade onions helped to cut the richness and fattiness of the burger because it had a very distinct vinegar taste.  The brioche bun was toasty, crispy but soft, and buttery as brioche should be.  It holds up well to the rest of the burger.  The frisee was well, frisee and also helped to balanced out the richness of this burger.\n\nI did split this with my girlfriend because I knew beforehand that this burger would more than likely be close to overwhelming on the palette.  Each bite was so rich I felt as if I died each time.\n\nFrozen Grasshopper Shake - YUM!!!! I love chocolate mint to begin with, but when you add chocolate vodka to it, it just makes the shake 100x better.  \n\nOVERALL:  Enjoyed this place very much.  I would definitely consider coming back here to try what else they have to offer.\n\nLike I always say, YOU WON\'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!'

S"Came here for or first night's dinner on a Bachelorette party weekend. We showed up with 8 girls, and the first person we talked to told us it was a 45 minute wait. Then someone else in our party talked to the hostess, and she told us 10 minutes. Real time wait came to about 20 minutes. Which is pretty good, considering we were a large party with no reservation.\n\nButtermilk Onion Rings - big portion was easy to share, was crispy and came with a tasty dipping sauce\nAhi Poke Tostadas - very small portion, and the ahi tuna tasted old and fishy, came with a nice avocado-like dipping sauce\nCaesar Salad - was fresh, flavorful and delicious\nRising Sun Burger - requested this medium-well, but it was served medium. Was still really good, came with tasty teriyaki-type sauce, and tempura avocado!\nFries - came out warm, soggy and sad\nGold Standard Burger - requested this medium-rare, and it came out medium. Added a fried egg for another dollar, was good and had a lot of cheese\nBeef Sliders - three sliders that had very little cheese and a lot of bun. They would not let us add fried eggs to these because of size\nVegan Coconut Raspberry Shake - this was really good if you like coconut\nBrown Cow Float - root beer float with pop rocks! surprisingly good\n\nThe food here was OK to GOOD. Nicely decorated with modern cartoon type art. We were sat cramped into a circle table, and we could not scoot our chairs in because the chairs kept hitting each other. There were two large booths that  could seat 8-10, but they chose to seat 3 or 4 people in them instead of us. Considering the prices here, the service we received left a lot to be desired. The server took a long time to bring us water, and never checked on us after the burgers came out, and we ran out of water and drinks. Appetizers and salad also took a long time to come out.\n\nI would not come here again. It was OK, but not awe-inspiring."

Their bam-boozled shakes (milkshake for adults) are really good.  They paired the alcohol so well with the shakes.  My favorite is the Tiramisu shake which was so decadent it was like drinking a dessert.  I will be back to try the other shakes and burgers!'

S'I had high hopes for Holsteins. I love a good burger, and shakes with booze...yes please!! \n\nI was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn\'t be seated until our entire party was there. Not a problem, that\'s not unusual. By the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. We were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. Because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. They attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. We quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation. \n\nLobster corn dogs: good, but not great \nFried pickles: extremely tasty! \nLobster mac n cheese: I only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful! \nPhilly steak egg rolls (I think): ehhh \n\nSo far so good...I was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! I kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. I can\'t complain. I had it with steak fries which were also good. The overall consensus of the group was that the food was good. \n\nSo why the 2 stars? While the food was good, maybe even great, the service was TERRIBLE. Wait, I have to clarify, half of the table\'s service was terrible. While Pete\'s side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, Nicole\'s side of the table had several problems... \n\n1. the birthday girl ordered a classic burger with Cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon, wild mushrooms and NO TOMATOES. What she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. While I acknowledge this was not Nicole\'s fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! And throughout the whole time Nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates. \n\n2. Someone else ordered a burger (I honestly can\'t remember which one) with brie and grilled onions. When she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for Cheddar instead. This also took a ridiculous amount of time. \n\n3. Someone ordered a beer that never came \n\nDuring this time another one of our party decided to say something to the Manager, Steve. As soon as we said something to him, he brought the burgers out. He was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. The second burger was supposed to have grilled onions and it didn\'t, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let Steve now, he immediately said "Oh no, there are grilled onions on there, I saw them put them on" Then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on the burger. Obviously Steve was left a little red in the face. To his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. The birthday girl couldn\'t even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat. \n\nThe duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and I also enjoyed the onion rings. \n\nOh and the server (who\'s name I didn\'t catch) who was pouring drinks, then "tying his shoes" while we talked to the manager...you\'re not slick dude.  We know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn\'t you we were complaining about.\n\nWhat is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.'

The burgers all in all were good, not awesome enough that I'd want another one. And at the price point, I was expecting a little bit more. The billionaire burger wasn't worth it.

S"As a vegas local, I love trying new places... I took stars away mainly for service. I booked a reservation for 2 at 8:15.. showed up a bit earlier and they quickly seated us. I asked for a water with lemon and a few moments to look over the menu. Water came back with no lemon. I got a very weird vibe from our waitress, like we annoyed her. I ordered the classic medium rare with American cheese and onion rings. My burger came back and when I cut the burger in half.. blood came out of the patty.. Definitely not medium rare, this was rare beyond belief. Since i was starving I did not want to make a commotion and send it back. Despite the patty being undercooked, the onion rings were delicious. My date had french fries and those were so good. If this review was strictly based on food I would give it 4 stars, minus one for the undercooked beef patty. The portions are enough to fill you up, and it had a casual atmosphere. I will go back, probably just ask for a medium cooked hamburger instead.\n\n**reading other reviews, we did not get the complimentary popcorn either, that's a little disappointing."

S'Sub-par service and food for being inside the Cosmo.  I ordered the Big Fat Greek (lamb) and it was dry.  Perhaps they knew this was an issue because it was dressed with waaaaay too much stuff.  All I could taste was olive.  Our server seemed more interested in chatting with her coworkers than refilling our drinks.  I would have given them just one star but the graffiti art and fried calamari were just good enough to help boost the rating, but not nearly enough to convince me to go back again.'

S"I went to HS&B Christmas night. The Cosmopolitan was extremely busy, and the atmosphere was electric. I was looking forward to a well made gourmet burger all day. HS&B did not disappoint. The burger joint is located on the 2nd level, just take the escalator up and go left. We arrived for dinner @ 7 pm,  and were greeted by an attractive receptionist. She said their was no wait, to our surprise, and promptly led us to our table. Our waiter (heavy eastern European accent), took our drink orders. I tried a microbrew of some sort (nondescript pale ale). Boris explained the menu, and I settled on the Hen burger. It was a burger with a fried egg and bacon. Incredible! Loved the meat and egg combination. I was told that the restaurant has an onsite butcher. Fries were shoestring type and very tasty. We didn't order one of the alcoholic shakes, but the couple sitting next to us did, and it looked good. They even provide the extra shake in the metal container it is made in. I noticed that the manager was smart enough to hire young, pretty ladies and outfit them in short red dresses... Well done good sir! Nice touch! The tab for two w/o desert was $48 plus tip.  Great night, great food, will definitely return."

Well believe it because my friends and I were starving upon entering. The place was pack, but we were seated promptly. \n\nThe burgers here are divine. Excellent in flavor. Gourmet, simple, call it whatever you want,  the burgers are definitely worth it. I ordered the Captain Hook and the salmon was grilled perfectly. Not at all overcooked. The Herb Caper Mayonnaise is good, but if you are not a mayonnaise person ask for it on the side. The fries are just as delicious, you can choose between steak fries or shoestring. The steak fries are fatty. I ended up cutting off the ends and squeezing the potatoes out. Mmm, just like mash potatoes. \n\nThe seasoned popcorn is what they give you as appetizer. I believe it is tossed with vinegar and cheese. Different, but tasty. \nAnd if you want some booze in your shake, this place has it covered! I was not too inspired to try one, but the options sound just as good as the burger.\n\nWe left very stuffed. Too stuffed that we looked rather unflattering in our night clothes. Haahaa. Nonetheless, I will dine here again!"

S'I had nothing but high hopes for Holsteins, sadly my dining experience did not live up to expectations. It wasn\'t that the food was bad, it was actually good. What killed the experience for me was the horrifically bad service and the ridiculously loud music.\n\nI arrived at Holsteins at about 9:15pm on a Monday night, walked up to the hostess desk, and after being ignored for a few minutes was "greeted" by the snottiest hostess in the whole world. After some exasperated sighing and excessive eye-rolling I was told that they were full, the waiting list was full, and they wouldn\'t even take my name for the waiting list until after 9:30. Boom, that was it....and then she walked away. We were aghast! WTF? Oh, GAME ON! So, I walked 3 feet away, pulled out my phone, and looked at Opentable.com. Oh hey, look at that...there are reservations available for Holsteins...now. I promptly made a reservation for 4, pushed send, got my confirmation, and walked the 3 feet back to the hostess desk. Phone in hand and with a gigantic smile on my face I greeted the snotty hostess and said I had a reservation. She once again grunted and rolled her eyes saying, "oh, are YOU Carrie?" After I happily confirmed that I was indeed Carrie...THE Carrie with the 9:30pm Opentable reservation Snotty Hostess said, "I saw that you JUST made the reservation. (Eyes rolling up a storm) There is a long waiting list, but because you JUST made a reservation I will put your name at the top of the list. But just to let you know, it might take 20 minutes or more to get you a table." I honestly have never encountered a more snotty, hostile, and unaccommodating hostess anywhere. It would serve Holsteins well to hire hostesses with temperaments more appropriate for the position.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nBam-boozled "shakes" all $11.00\n\nDrunken Monkey\nFrozen Grasshopper\nCereal Bowl\nBlack Cow\n\nThey were all fine...nothing special and not very boozey. FYI, the Black Cow is a float not a shake, despite the fact it is not marked as such.\n\nBurgers:\n\nGold Standard $17.50 - \nLonghorn $16.00\nSteakhouse burger $16.50\n\nAll the burgers were cooked perfectly and they were tasty, but the toppings were very skimpy. I have indeed "experienced better." They are served with fries...two of us chose shoestring fries and one upgraded to sweet potato fries. Sadly, both types of fries were mediocre at best. Additionally we ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes which were also mediocre.\n\nOur server was fine, but not fantastic. The music was so loud we could barely hear the waitress or carry on a conversation. Overall our experience was a less than stellar one. The experience with the snotty hostess put a taint on the evening and there was nothing that happened during the rest of our dinner that made up for it. There are way too many other restaurants in Las Vegas with bigger, better burgers and better service. I will not be returning, unless it is to punch the snotty hostess in the face (I kid! I kid!)'

Nothing to really write home about and pretty pricey when it all comes down to it. I ordered the Nom Nom Burger, a Kobe beef patty with cheese and potato chips... it was good... but I'd rather call it the Nom Burger... definitely not deserving of the double Nom and far from the OmNomNoms majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory.\n\nTheir spiked milkshakes were super good. But that really wasn't enough to push the score higher.\n\nThe ambiance is fantastic though, a great vibe, excellent service, but then again... I come to expect that in Vegas... so this ends up being a wash... it's all about perspective ya dig?\n\nI don't believe I'd go again... but thanks for the treat and really... it wasn't bad...

S'I am debating between giving this place a 3 or a 4 star, but I am feeling generous given the outstanding service we received. \n\nThe food is just ok. I guess I was expecting an amazing hamburger and it was just very regular. I didn\'t enjoy the bun at all and felt the toppings were a bit lacking. I ordered the "Bull-gogi Burger" and was expecting a flavor explosion, but it just wasn\'t. Just a little blander than I was expecting. Still a pretty tasty burger cooked well, but nothing I\'m dying to go back and try again. My black cow alcoholic float was pretty good, but honestly I think I would have preferred it without alcohol. The fries were so-so. I got the steak fries, but they were really more like wedges and I wasn\'t really a fan of the seasoning. I tried my fella\'s skinny fries and preferred them. \n\nIt was my friend Ryan B\'s birthday, so we received a free round of jell-o shots and a plethora of outrageous desserts that none of us had room to eat. I tried the carrot cake and the funnel cake and they left a lot to be desired. They just didn\'t pack the punch I had been hoping. There were interesting, but if you\'re going to be interesting at least try to make them tasty. The carrot cake was shaped like a carrot and was a super cute concept albeit somewhat phallic. It was paired with carrot ice cream, but I really wasn\'t feeling it. The funnel cakes were topped with ground up cereal, but I would have preferred a fruit or creamy topping.\n\nAll in all, the service was amazing. Our servers were friendly and very helpful. That alone raised their star-rating. As for the food, it\'s pretty standard. The burger was pretty good, maybe if I tried different toppings, it would be better.'

Holsteins is located in the Cosmopolitan hotel on the 3rd floor I believe...right behind the escalator. \n\n\nLove the cool decor and paintings they have here, the music is really loud and it\'s cold in there so bring a jacket. Now on to the food, I got the lobster rolls which comes with a good portion size of 2 buns filled with yummy lobster and coleslaw inside and the mini buns are toasted. The boyfriend got the "gold standard" because the waiter convinced him that this was their most popular burger and boy did he love it...he loved the bacon, the dry aged beef and the baby arugula with it. The fries that it came with were also really good. Prices are decent with the amount of food they gave. \n\nSad to say that I did not get the lobster mac and cheese nor their shakes but I will be back on my next trip to try them.'

S"IMO Holsteins is an interesting burger joint. But I've tasted better burgers. I ordered their known and famous burger called Gold Standard. I expected more out of the burger since it was one of the Top Choice/recommended burger since many always ordered it. To be honest, I think In-N-Out would be more satisfying and well worth my money. Spending roughly $18 wasn't worth for what it is. \n\nI'd rather also go to Bachi Burger. The service here was okay. It took about 10-15 minute wait for my party of 7 to be seated. It was packed inside, but I mean what restaurant in Vegas isn't packed right? Nothing much to complain about them. As far as order whatever else. I'm not sure what else to pick since it's my first time here. I don't think id ever come back and or even crave their burgers. \n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't come here, but id at least tell you to check it out if you're curious about this restaurant."

S'Before hitting up Marquee Night Club (on Party Rock Mondays) we decided to stop by this burger joint.  I have been here more than once and though I enjoy the food the service not so great. It was a pretty slow night and not a lot of people were in the restaurant but the service was just just sad. \n\nPROS:\nBlack & white milkshake was excellent! (It is a must try)\nordered the Hen House burger (Beef w/fried egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, & onion w/ mustard & ketchup).  -- I really enjoyed the taste and it was perfect.\n\nCONS:\nfries - bland\nservice - was slow & our waitress was not very friendly.\nthe place was too loud - but then it was club night. \n\nI dont know if I am willing to come back, but for the milkshake i probably would.'

S"It's expensive, and in my opinion, not really worth the money.\n\nWe got the lobster mac 'n cheese, alcoholic tiramisu shake, funghi, and rising sun burger. \n\nThe lobster mac 'n cheese was good, with nice chunks of lobster and a creamy but still liquid pasta sauce (and campanelle pasta! nice touch), but there was just so little of it. It came in the same small, shallow cast iron dish that their dips came in (as we saw at the other table), and for a price of $17, too steep for my mac 'n cheese wallet.\n\nThe alcoholic tiramisu shake was not very noticeably alcoholic. And the shakes themselves are pretty much the same price as their burgers, but we just figured go big or go home. It was pretty delicious and a bit too sweet when it melted and tasted like liquefied tiramisu, which was the closest thing to refreshing when I got sick of all the savory orders.\n\nThe funghi was moderately disappointing, the not-disappointed side mainly because I was hungry.. It consisted of a beef patty, roasted portabello mushroom, carmelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere cheese, frisee as vegetation, and aioli...what type, I'm not completely sure. It was $16.50, pretty large and beefy, with a meaty portabello...but still, a bit bland for my palate...there wasn't much sha-zam in the burger, mushroom afficionado or not.\n\nThe rising sun burger was supposed to be the showstopper...the idea of it sounds absolutely ingenious, and I was initially very excited for it. Built of a Kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado, it sounds like someone took a delicious burger and prepared it with a Japanese pantry. And the individual points were all present with the burger, but I felt like the burger was overwhelming my salty and sweet taste buds. The teriyaki glaze was way too much, either too sweet and salty or too much sheer quantity for the burger. The nori furikake was actually kind of salty too, which disillusioned me from furikake for a while...the tempura avocado was soggy and the batter, too thick and not crispy. Which I guess happens when you deep fry and avocado and then stuff it between a huge slab of ground beef and a tower of toppings. After finishing it I felt the need to chug my glass of water...so the burger cost me $17 and an extra trip to the bathroom.\n\nIn foresight of these issues, we ordered two sides of raw onion...very nicely, thinly sliced, in a way that let it melt in your mouth so that you only tasted the sweetness of the onion, but yet it was a full indisputable bite of onion. Delectable. Those onions were a side dish to everything that night, they just seemed to make everything better.\n\nHolstein's is alright, you know? It really has some great concepts with the creative gourmet burgers and alcoholic milk shakes, but a little better execution would be valued. I'd give it a 2.5 - 2.7 stars if I could, mostly due to the steep prices for what was a semi-disappointing meal."

S'went for lunch today.  $98 + tip for 3 of us.  easy to find inside the Cosmo.  ordered two milkshakes (they were just OK and didn\'t live up to the "hype"), onion rings, two burgers, and the vegan burger.  my vegan burger was homemade, but i\'ve had better in Portland.  fries were average.  dinner salad was average.  so why four stars?  atmosphere and great service.  it felt like we had our own personal waiter (mycole).  he was very attentive.  he explained the menu after he found out we\'d never been before.  would I go back?  uh, I guess.  but for the $$ we could have done better.  overall, worth a visit.  my hubby said his burger was THE BEST he\'d ever had.'

Prices are competitive if not better than some of the other Las Vegas burger restaurants. \n\nThere wasn't much of a wait for the day we stopped in. Staff was friendly, prompt and checked in frequently enough. We ordered an appetizer to share and each ordered a different burger. Staff also took our drink orders which were refilled quite a bit. \n\nThe burger I ordered was the house popular one. Ordered medium rare and came as desired. Plenty enough seasoning, well flavored and paired with fries to our enjoyment.\n\nGood: food, service, and ambience. \nBad: nothing at this time.\n\nI would come back."

S"Having gone to the Cosmo a few times and walking by this place, I had been wanting to try it. I was pretty happy to go there on Saturday with some friends before going bowling, but unfortunately I was just irritated by my experience there and I can honestly say I most likely won't go back. When I got there at 8:45, I put in for a table. The hostess told me it would be 45 minutes. This was fine since I was still waiting for my party to show up. An hour later, I still had not received the text saying a table was available. I walked back up there from the casino floor and see that there are open tables and no line. I approached the hostess (different from the one I spoke to), and she happily says she can get me seated right away. The rest of my party was waiting in line to get in to the parking garage, so I honestly was not in a hurry to be seated. The guy showing me to the table asks why I was getting a table now if the rest of my friends weren't there yet and I said they are trying to park. Then the waiter asks the same thing as well as a busser. It was really irritating. The waiter treated my friend like she was dumb when she asked a question, and seemed overall irritated to being helping our table out. Next time I want a burger, I will be going back to Gordon Ramsay BurGR, or BLT. I was so irritated about this experience, I really have no interest in going back and trying again even though I liked the food. The food was the only thing I liked."

I got the Longhorn burger & added cheddar cheese. It was good, but not as flavorful as I thought it would be and incredibly messy. The steak fries were good. My boyfriend had the Hen House burger & added blue cheese. His was also very messy (with the runny fried egg) but he enjoyed the flavors. We finished off the meal with a chocolate malt shake which was very good, complete with his & hers pink & blue straws so we could share :) I still have another groupon to go back again, can't wait to."

Do not put ketchup on this burger!!! When they delivered my burger they gave me the great advice of not adding ketchup until I tried a bite. So glad they told me that because it was so delicious without it.\n\nI really can't tell you much about the fries. I think I liked them, but I was so into my burger that I couldn't tell you much about them. I actually ordered a Martini to go with this steak burger and it couldn't have been more fitting. \n\nThe service was great. I decided to sit up at the bar since I was rolling solo. Eating an amazing burger, sipping on a Martini and reading Steve Jobs biography. My most mellow dinner in Vegas ever! Enjoyed every bit of it. \n\nI will make sure next time I am in Vegas I visit and bring my friends for the best burger I have had in quite some time."

S"I was in charge of making reservations for a large group on our recent trip to Las Vegas. My first phone call was to Sushi Samba, which was (previously) my favorite Las Vegas restaurant. Sadly, they really let us down this time. \n\nWhen we arrived on a Thursday night, there was a sign letting us know that there was a filming in progress at the restaurant...interesting, since this was never mentioned to me in the three phone calls I'd had with the hostess (one to make the reservation, one to confirm, and one to move the reservation back an hour). The lights were up and the music was off, which wasn't the typical fun atmosphere I've come to expect.\n\nWe sat down and were immediately approached by the filming crew. Turns out, they were filming a promo commercial for the hotel and were wondering if they could film us. We were promised free drinks and appetizers, so we agreed and signed their waivers. We then had a full crew come over to light the table and were joined by the on-air host. He asked us questions about how much we loved staying at the Palazzo (we weren't staying there), brought out a round of drinks (which were essentially fruit juices with fancy garnishes...looks good on camera, but nothing we would have ordered), and proceeded to help himself to our Wagyu beef (at $32/oz). Our waiter was nowhere to be seen until the bill showed up....a bill which reflected absolutely no compensation for the ridiculous experience. \n\nI calmly asked to speak to the manager. The reason Sushi Samba was one of my favorites is because of the food and the experience. While the food was still tasty, it was completely ruined by the absolute lack of service that we received, especially given that we'd done them a favor and agreed to be in their commercial. We never received any discount on our bill, but I did get the manager's card and a lukewarm promise that if I called him, he'd make it up to me next time. \n\nThere's not going to be a next time. Do yourself a favor and go to Nobu instead."

S"My boss and I had an iffy business trip in Las Vegas but we were so glad we stopped by sushisamba for brunch. Brunch you say? yes, I was thinking the same thing. I work at a magazine and if I wasn't a food snob already, eating with my boss is gradually making me one. Their brunch was a wonderful surprise! We started with freshly squeezed juice. I ordered a blueberry/strawberry/banana combo. You can mix three juices in one. My boss also ordered her own combination. The brunch is family style and up to 4 dishes for $23 each person. If you have a bigger party, the servings will be larger. We ordered Eggs Any Style, Smoked Salmon Platter, Assorted Pastries and Bread and either the el topo tamago roll or the sunday samba roll.  We ate them all up. My boss even ordered a cappucino before our drive back to LA. They have locations in Chicago and NYC as well. The menu looks the same out there too. Yum, what a great finale! The waiters and manager were wonderful. They all stopped by to see how we were doing. It was a beautiful fusion of Peruvian and Japanese food.

She was mad because we wanted to order off the menu instead of having *her* pick our food and bring it out family style.  Why would we want her to pick our food?  I get the whole family style and how it makes it easier with larger parties, but at least tell a sister that when she makes a reservation instead of springing it on her when she sits down. \n\nThen don't refuse to bring menus, get pissed when we ask for them, or be brusque and rude when taking orders or bringing food.\n\nYou better believe I talked to the management and gave them a (nice) earful.  \n\nBut the food was good...as it is at all Sushi Sambas.

S'Waiting for my friends at the bar located near their entrance, I had a good feeling about this place.  It had all the bells and whistles of a nice upscale restaurant with a friendly bartender to start.  Unfortunately my good feeling about this place was short lived as our party was seated.\n\nOur reservation was for 9:15 PM Sunday night.  We didn\'t get seated until 9:45 PM despite having our whole party there by 9:00 PM.  I didn\'t care too much for this considering the place was moderately busy on a holiday weekend, and we weren\'t on a strict schedule.  So I let this roll easily off my back.\n\nAs we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was terribly unenthusiastic about his job.  He was considerate about asking  for food allergies.  Beyond that, all levels of consideration or customer service for that matter stopped there.  Granted, he warned us that our food would come out infrequently, but little did we know it would delay our dinner by over an hour.  A little honesty would have been greatly appreciated.  It took forever for most of our food to come out.  We didn\'t have utensils or place settings even after our food was delivered.  My friend even asked for the manager, to complain about our horrible service, or lack thereof.  The manager\'s response was something like: "Things are are a bit backed-up, we\'ll give you free dessert."  Now, I don\'t care how backed-up your kitchen is... that\'s still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service!  Dessert only puts a band-aid on a broken arm... why the hell do restaurant managers  do this?  We are not looking to get something free, we just want to make sure they get their act together... and fast!\n\nOur original waiter rarely came to our table after we ordered our food.  Another waitress came to our aid who was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  She was very friendly and courteous, it\'s unfortunate she wasn\'t our original waiter because this review would\'ve been completely different.\n\nOur unpleasant waiter did the weirdest thing.  As my friend was talking to the manager, being very open about our waiters horrible service, our waiter stood by our table as he refolded all our used napkins, tossing them onto our table.  Yes, our used clothe napkins.  Who does that?  In front of a party that is pretty disgusted by you no less.  It seemed as if he knew he was already in hot water and didn\'t give a rats-ass about making up for it.  In addition, he circled the portion of our bill they decided to discount for the unsatisfied service in a stuck-up negative manner.  In hind site, my friend said we should have taken that same pen, in front of our waiter, and scratched out his tip!  Of course, we\'re better than that.\n\nThe food is the only reason why this place is not getting a single star. The food was actually quite good with a variety of unique asian-fusion plates.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki (exotic right?) which was much more than I bargained for.  For such a simple dish, it had a variety of unique flavors with a side of extras that complimented each bite.  My friends ordered an array of food that looked just as good, and was commented on just the same.\n\nFor me, customer service will make or break any experience, no matter how good the food is.  In this case, their service failed horribly.  Our party ended up with a waiter that was a few cans short of a six pack regarding personality, who would probably fare better as a Chippendale\'s greeter than a restaurant waiter.  I hope management recognizes this and hires waiters that are actually qualified to interact with human beings.'

S'I flipping LOVE SushiSamba. I\'ve been here 3 times and it\'s just been incredible. This most recent trip, we were a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party. We had lucked out by getting reservations the day of and they didn\'t make us wait. I thought they seated us in a weird spot...but no, our reservations were just so early, the place wasn\'t that full, but the table ended up being fine.\n\nWe decided to do the omakase style for around $50/person. They brought out the cocktail tree with 9 glasses of the Samba Juice which was incredible and such a great way for them to start wooing us, haha. \n- First course: fried green beans with truffle aioli (my fave!), grilled jalepenos (big hit!), and edamame.\n- Second course: Fish tacquitos (loved the shell, very crispy), a mushroom tacquito & large salad for the vegetarian, and pork pot stickers (good not great). \n- Third course: the famed Chilean Sea Bass skewers (melt.in.your.mouth), scallops with like a chimichurri sauce (delicious), and the Peruvian corn (so unique). \n- Fourth course: Meat/mushroom coconut milk "curry" (I hate coconut milk, and this was the one dish that we didn\'t make a considerable dent in...and they don\'t serve rice with this! Weird).\n- Fifth course: Sushi. There were 3 different fish sushi rolls (salmon, tuna, and something else) and then 3 vegetarian (avocado, cucumber, and sweet potato--sweet potato was my fave!). They then brought out the dessert for my friend, which was comp\'d which was nice.\n\nIn my opinion, I felt like the chef prepared way too many fish dishes for this particular group because we had a vegetarian, we had someone who was allergic to shellfish, and we had 3 people who didn\'t like fish...and yet, we got A LOT of fish. I think a lot of people go to SushiSamba and expect sushi...but it\'s fushion, it\'s not traditional sushi. I would definitely recommend doing the omakase style to start out--you can do it for $30-$75 per person and it\'s really fun. I rate it 4 stars because I think they should be more creative for vegetarians--vegetarians eat more than mushrooms :) But the service is GREAT and the food is amazing. Definitely one of my most consistent favorite places in Vegas.'

The BoBo Brazil was one I had read about on here by another reviewer, which I am glad I did. The sauce on top really did the trick. We also go the Avocado Salmon Roll because it's my two favorite things put together!  I would recommend this place to any sushi lover who wants to try a little twist, and there are many other options on the menu."

S'Happy hour is a happy time.\n\n$6 for a selection of appetizers and drinks for happy hour. Good deal! Remember not to come on the weekend b/c there is no happy hour. I found out the hard way when I came back the 2nd day for more. The quality of the sushi is good and the staff are very friendly. Asian and Latin fusion - confusing combo but not bad if you like this kind of stuff and need a break from heavier food.'

S"I had an amazing experience at Sushi Samba last night.  Fair enough, it wasn't packed so I'm sure it was easier to pay attention to us, but still.  It's not too often that you get Brazilian/Peruvian/Japanese food on one menu.  Our server Javier was fantastic - attentive, helpful, knowledgeable, fun, but not the least bit overbearing.  The manager Hayes was the same.  We felt like we were constantly checked on and attended to - quite luxurious.\nThey helped us pick some amazing items off of the giant menu, and we were thrilled with all of the items we had.\nTempura green beans, yellowtail tiradito, the samba strip roll (possibly our favorite), and the churrasco (we got hanger steak, pork tenderloin and linguisa).\nThe cocktails.  \nOh.\nMy.\nGod.\nThe cocktails.  \nAmazing, fresh, delicious. . . . I had the monthly special (a strawberry mojito), and a lemon samurai which was seriously the most amazing drink I've ever had.\nMy only gripe with things that are flown in fresh from all around the world - impressive yes, but the environment scowls in your general direction Sushi Samba.  Situated in the largest LEED certified building in the world (http://www.commercialpropertynews.com/cpn/content_display/regions/southwest/e3i76b446d81cf85aa4fc437cba15737e76), you'd think this would be a faux pas.  \nTake advantage of it if your conscience allows - you won't be sorry.  The two of us got out after two cocktails each and the shared food mentioned for under $150.  Not bad for an upscale Vegas restaurant."

However, it\'s not just a feast for the eyes. I am usually skeptical of anything labeled "fusion", but this concept works. Even the Brazilian friend I shared my meal with agreed.'

It is located in the Palazzo hotel (my fave!!!)\n\nYou have to try their extensive list of Saki and their cocktails which are broken up by country: Japan, Brazil, Peru. Samba Juice is my favorite especially on a hot summer day.\n\nThis place is a little pricey but is well worth the splurge. I don't know where else you can find this type of fusion!\n\nOur favorites are:\n-Berkshire pork belly\n-Sea Bass miso\n-Neo Tokyo roll\n-Yamato roll\n-BoBo Brazil roll\n-El Topo roll\n\nAdd this to your bucket list!"

They will also accomodate dietary restrictions and preferences.

S"We got there around 6:30pm just in time for happy hour and the bar was still pretty packed. We waited a couple of minutes till there were 2 seats available. We really shouldn't have bothered to wait...\nWe asked the bartender for happy hour menus and then we ordered a mojito and a caipirinha. My friend loves mojitos, I don't care for them. He said these were the worse he's ever had. The mojito was slightly better than the caipirinha, but not by much. It practically tasted the same. We also ordered the Berry Smash and the Samba Juice which actually looked and tasted quite similar except that the Berry Smash has no alcohol! None of these drinks were very strong, nor tasted good. For around $12-$15 a drink, it really should've be made by a professional. We went to Craftsteak the night before and the drinks there were fantastic. The bartenders @ Sushi Samba are pretty, but they don't know how to make a decent cocktail. However, it's not all their fault since they were using mostly mixers and not premium alcohol/fresh ingredients unlike other upscale bars/restaurants. \n\nWe also had some apps with our drinks. \nApps: Spicy Tuna Roll, Yellowtail Seviche and Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos. \n\nFor a Friday night, their sushi was clearly not very fresh. The spicy tuna was okay, the spicy sauce that was placed on top instead of mixed with the tuna hid whatever flavor the tuna had. I didn't like the yellowtail seviche, but my friend thought it was okay. I thought it was too bitter from the lime. The worse thing out of this whole experience were the yellowtail taquitos. The fish tasted spoiled. My friend was sick all night. It could've been the ridiculous amount of alcohol we consumed that night since we went to Dos Caminos later that night, but my friend says it was definitely the yellowtail taquitos... The drinks at Dos Caminos are so much better than Sushi Samba's... the mojitos are strong and freshly made and the glasses are 2x the size :P"

S"Sushi Samba is a great sushi place if you like Americanized, fusion-sushi. Conveniently located in the Palazzo shops, its great for a quick bite if you're staying at the Wynn or Venetian and don't want to walk too far.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and the quality of the food is very good. I was particularly impressed with the huge portion of grilled yellowtail cheek I got for what I paid.\n\nThe sauces that accompany their sushi rolls are quite interesting - mustard, ponzu and soy-based. \n\nMy one complaint, and it's a major one, is that I had to order sake THREE TIMES before I actually got a glass. My first and second choices were sold out, and it took the waitress 15 minutes between orders just to tell me this. Finally, when I picked a sake they hadn't run out of, there was not enough left in the bottle to constitute a full serving. I wasn't charged for it, but it was too little, too late. What I ended up drinking was far from what I was in the mood for.\n\nIf you sell sake by the glass, running out during the peak dinner hour in Vegas is unacceptable."

S'Rounding out my three night kobe adventure was sushi samba.  This place was pretty darn cool. I give them 4 stars for the kobe and 3 for the rest.  The sushi was very good, but not "las vegas" good.  There are far better places if you just want sushi.  But this place is different, offering a spin of Brazillian flare on the Japanese standard.  I liked the playfulness.... \n\nbut back to the important stuff... the Kobe!  Grade A5 from Japan (I\'m guessing Vegas had a shipment of this because every place said they had A5 Japanese Kobe!)  Sushi Samba brought out a plate of raw sliced kobe next to a line of dry and wet spices/marinades.  Then came the huge hot rock.  We were then instructed to dip the beef in the marinade of choice, set on rock for 30 seconds a side, then sprinkle with preferred dry spice.  I watched the ladies at our table go first and I saw them immediately go to their "happy place" with the first bite.  After the rest of the table ate, I could see everyone counting the remaining pieces to see how many more bites they had.  Hahahaha!!! So much fun!\n\nGreat Sake list if you like that (which I do).  Hundreds of junmai daiginjo bottles going into the $1,000\'s.  I found a decent one for $50 (300ml).  So recap, get the kobe, enjoy the sushi... don\'t go if sushi is all that you want, there\'s better.'

S"I'm so glad I made reservations here\n\nI wanted to reserve a place that wasn't Italian or heavy in the Venetian or Palazzo for my group of 8 girls.  We arrived a little early for our reservation and was seated immediately.  My cousin told the waiter what we liked and didn't like.  He said he would create a meal according to what we wanted.  Everything was fantastic.  Below is what we had and its description:\n\nPork Gyozo-  Each dumpling was served on a delicious pumpkin puree.  Delicious!\n\nSushi Platter- We got 5 different types of rolls, 2 of each type.  They were all so good.  \n\nTiger Rock Shrimp- Yum!  If you like honey walnut shrimp then you will definitely like this.  It was perfectly made.  \n\nYellowtail Ceviche tacos- These were the best tacos I have ever had.  The sauce it came with was a yummy spicy foam hot sauce.  They were small but definitely satisfying.  They just melt in your mouth.  So good!  Probably my favorite thing there.  \n\nSteak- The Steak was served with collard greens, potatoes, rice, and black beans.  It also came out with 3 different sauces that were all so good.  The green sauce was my favorite.  \n\nSeabass on Skewers- This was served with some Peruvian corn.  The seabass just melts in your mouth.  They were perfectly made.  The corn was also really good and went perfectly with the seabass.     \n\nShots- Our shots came out beautifully presented on a shot tier.  Two of us didn't drink so our waiter brought out two that were watermelon juice so we could join in on toasting.    \n\nDessert- Dessert was a mix of the best vanilla ice cream, creme burlee, mixed berries, and banana.  It was nicely made and topped off with some sparklers.  \n\nEverything was so tasty and beautifully presented.  The food wasn't just all Japanese.  It was definitely a fusion but everything went together wonderfully.  I think for us 8 girls it was about $75 each.  It was very worth it and we all left stuffed and happy.      \n\nOur server took care of us really well.  I liked that he noted there were 8 of us and made the portions perfect for 8 girls.  One of our girls couldn't eat raw fish or anything spicy and he made sure she got her own individual thing.  He also made note that two of us couldn't drink and brought out shots for everyone with 2 virgin drinks.  He made great recommendations and was helpful.  He also took time to take a couple photos for us.  As for the the ambiance, it was beautiful.  We had a great time celebrating."

S"Having dined at Sushi Samba in New York and South Beach, we made out way to the Palazzo Casino complex for a tasty dinner of Brazilian/Peruvian and Japanese fusion cuisine. \n\nThe Las Vegas location is somewhat more showy than its original New York location, but given the competition of flashy restaurant decor in the new Las Vegas, this facility is a little overdone. Graffiti is sprayed about and swirled architectural accents are overly prominent. \n\nThe sushi is fresh and the entrees inventive, we'll return on a future visit."

S'Should be really 4.5 buttt I can\'t give it 5. The service was great, like Nobu\'s.\n\nSo I had no idea this restaurant had so many locations before coming to Vegas. Anyways, last month, walking around the palazzo, I checked the menu out as I had seen every single cab here with a Sushisamba ad on top. I was very surprised to see that they had many Peruvian dishes. I guess I just imagined it was brazilian with japanese because of the name. I did not expect to see peruvian corn (i miss you so much).\n\nAfter much convincing, my bf and I decided to come check it out. We ordered a whole bunch of things. We did not make a reservation but they had enough space to accommodate us. I ordered a plum wine cup which was better than Nobu\'s. I was very interested in the peruvian part of the menu so bear with me with my choices.\n\nBROILED PERUVIAN BAY SCALLOP shiso lime butter crust 15.00\n\nThis was really good. The scallops basically melted in your mouth and it kind of reminded me of the scargots at Bouchon. Very buttery.\n\nHUANCAINA FRIES 7.00\n\nI loved them. My boyfriend felt they did not have much flavor but he is not a big potato eater except when it comes to real french fries. Now, these are not really fries, they are boiled tiny potatoes with huancaina sauce and cheese.\n\nANTICUCHO\nRIBEYE aji panca and peruvian corn 13.00\n\nDelicious. I don\'t know why they don\'t offer the heart option but I guess people here in the US are not big on trying beef heart anyways.\n\n\nWILD MUSHROOM RED MISO hand picked organic mushrooms, wakame, white truffle oil 9.00\n\nI didn\'t like it. My bf liked it a lot he said it tasted "fresh"\n\nMOQUECA MISTA shrimp, squid, sea bass, mussels, clams with coconut milk, dend\xc3\xaa oil and chimichurri rice 33.00\n\nThis was the first brazilian dish I\'ve ever eaten and it was just ok. I didn\'t feel it was great. I think it was undersalted because it was very flavorless.'

Tasty and different.\nBerkshire pork belly ramen: Delicious. The pork belly was fall-apart tender, very flavorful and paired well with the spicy lemongrass soup.\nMiso-marinated Chilean sea bass: Buttery and tender, very tasty.\nLamb chop with red miso and yuzu: Not enjoyable; bitter.\nSteak: ?\n\nCut directly from my blog, EpicuriousTravels.com:\n\n"Our food took a very long time to arrive, one by one. Eventually it did and we finished everything, except the fourth entree which failed to appear. We asked our waitress about this who said she\'d check for us but she never came back. We then asked another waiter who said he\'d check for us and he never came back. Some time later, our waitress finally returns and says they\'d forgotten our entry, but that it would be out right away and taken off the bill. I then asked for a dessert menu.\n\nMuch later, our food and dessert menu both failed to arrive. Eventually, our waitress returns with the bill, apologizes and says the food (and the dessert menu, apparently) won\'t be coming, and presents us with complimentary miniature cocktails. My dining companion and I were both underage. Another while later, our waitress returns smiling with our change and asked if we enjoyed the shots, which were clearly untouched."\n\nWe basically waited an hour for our food, an hour for the bill...

Tried the lobster robata, cooked perfectly, but not sure if I enjoyed the flavors as much as previous items.  They do so much in the kitchen, that when you try so much, it's tough to enjoy everything because there are a vast variety of flavors.  Lobster robata had a spicy ikura vinagrette, with some heat to it.  Freshest sushi and sashimi i've ever had.  Signature dish for me is the sea bass robata anticucho."

S'Thursday Night. 9pm. \nOur reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, Mike Durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.\n\nMy Fiance and I were indulged with a 9 course specialized server\'s Omakase. The food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating. \n\nOur charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.\n\nFirst was the Otsumami, three small dishes: Green Bean Tempura with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (Incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.\n\nNext came Hamachi (Yellowtail) Tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (Spicy Aji Panca) on the side to top it off- This was filled with so much flavour It literally forced my eyes to roll back. A real Treat that I\'d highly  reccommend.\n\nAt this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. The bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. As the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  Kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  Alongside was the ever popular Nina Fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. Both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.\n\nTheir Mushroom Toban Yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with Bincho Tan grilled Lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. Their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a unique filling appetizer. My fiances words: That fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)\n\nThe Sashimi Tiradito I\'m always raving about came next. Still on a midblowing level, I noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the NYC location and the Las Vegas one. So if you think you\'ve had it before, you haven\'t. Though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. My favorite is the Kanpachi since I\'m a sucker for Yuzu (Japanese citrus) and My fiance was a big fan of the Hamachi- If you\'re torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won\'t have any regrets.\n\nOff the Robata Grill (Bincho Tan Charcoal) came the most decadant Crab Leg imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the Mastermind Talents of Chef Oscar Toro. Bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. A seasonal dish that may not always be available... So wonderful. If they don\'t have it on menu, go for the Spiny Lobster.\n\nAlso from from the Robata Grill we enjoyed The Miso Glazed Sea Bass with baby corn. Again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end Japanese restaurants- but Sushi Samba\'s brazillian take really heightens the tastes.\n\nAsk for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with traditional serving, paired with Yuzu Jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which Chef Oscar Toro will create specially for that oyster.- Both ways are unforgettable.\n\nMy absolute favorite dish is the KOBE ISHIYAKI. You grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized Kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot River Stone. You get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- Absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. Whenever I see this I must have it, and Sushi Samba\'s is THE BEST I\'ve had. Not enough people indulge in this and you Must must must!!! \n\nOur Sushi/Sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. We got the Neo Tokyo and the El Topo rolls- Neo Tokyo has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the El Topo is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a unique addition. It\'s like the movie "El Topo" you must try/ see both! \n\nFor dessert we went with Mochi; a soft and chewy Japanese dessert that is traditionally not overly sweet. Sushi Samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours. \n\nBy the end of our meal and a finished bottle of Sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal. \n\n\n**************\nBottom line, if you are trying to decide between Nobu and Sushi Samba, Pass on Nobu and put some Samba in your Seafood!!\n\nThank you again Mike and Oscar for such a wonderful Night!!'

I don't think coconut flavor go well with the meat too. \n\nHowever, their dessert is awesome! We LOVE their Peruvian chocolate cherry custard!! Don't let the name fools you. It may sounds like nothing special but they have a special way to make it special.

S"Ok now we were staying at Pallazo and wanted to try out this restaurant. It was somewhat crowded when we got there on Valentine's Day weekend although I should say I have never seen Vegas this empty compared to previous years during such holidays.  My first impression of the restaurant wasnt as expected, the tables were somewhat worn out and chipped at on the surface, and due to the place being crowded the tables and chairs were very close to the neighboring tables, it felt like the people who were setted next to us were actually sitting with us.  So that was kinda annoying.  Ok enough of negative :) now the positives.  Our waiter was excellent.  I wanted to eat sushi but i was thinking of trying different things on the menu, therefore our serves suggested that we order this special that they have.  He asked us how much we wanted to spend and according to our budget he would bring different dishes so we could basically taste their whole menu and have variety of foods.  Our waiter stated that if we dont like any of the food that is being served he would be happy to replace it with something else.  I was ready to spend around 70 a person so he started off according to my budget.  We had different variety of sashimi, cut rolls peruvian dishes with mushrooms and duck, crab legs etc.  He served us with 7 different dishes and we basically told him to skip the desert since we were very full at that point.  The verdict----good food, excellent service."

S"I was sorry to give this place three stars! I really wanted to love it!  My husband and I just moved back from the East Coast and we were really looking forward to some AWESOME West Coast sushi! We arrived around 9pm and were promptly greeted and seated by the  hostess. We didn't like the original seat she tried to give us so I asked her to sit one table in and also because it was a four top instead of a two top (you need room when you order sushi.....you either get tons of little plates or a huge plate that doesn't fit on a two top table). Well that must have frustrated her because she threw the menus down on the table I wanted and basically ran back to the hostess stand. ( yes she threw the menus!) we then proceeded to wait a good 15 minutes before anyone would come over and talk to us....not even give us water. Finally our waitress came over and apologized and we were ready to order drinks and edamame. Our drinks came quickly and we ordered the rest of our dinner with some suggestions from our waitress. Our first to appetizers came pretty fast as well but the waitress for got we wanted edamame so that came later in the meal. The oysters were awesome...the yellowtail with jalape\xc3\xb1o was AMAZING.....sushi rolls were good but the rock shrimp tempura was off....taste just wasn't there ( taste not spice.....it was basically no flavor but spicy). Our waitress talked up the mini doughnuts for dessert so we ordered them...only to find out they were out.\nOur bill was over 200$ and I left disappointed at that price.\nOn a side note the hostess tried to seat 3 other couples at the original table she wanted to give us and all 3 couple asked for different tables.....it wasn't a busy night.....she may want to take a step back and remember she is the first person people see....she needs to represent this restaurant better."

S"I'm from Los Angeles, so I know sushi, and I grew up in New England, so I know lobster.\n\nIt's 1:30 in the morning and we're in Vegas.  We're hungry, and tired and just wanted a good meal.  We found this place on Yelp with good reviews and decided to check it out.\n\nI ordered the lobster robata, which the waiter described as lobster cut in half, grilled, and finished with a sauce.  This sounded a lot like the way lobster is prepared in Mexico and I'm starting to see in other restaurants particularly in San Diego.  So I was excited to have it this way again.\n\nWhat a disappointment - what came to me was only half a lobster, the size of which could not have been anywhere near a pound.  It was grilled well and the sauce was very tasty.  \n\nBut seriously, for $25?  If I spent that much back home on lobster, I'd have enough to feed my entire family and still have some left over.\n\nMy wife had the Lima, which was very good.  For sushi, it was not like what we get in LA, but it's worth noting that if I ever find myself here again, this may be what I order.\n\nThe ambiance looks like Dr. Seuss on acid, but it was dark and cozy at the same time - it is an unusual setting.\n\nThe meal ended quickly as they were closing and, after several attempts by the waiter to get us to order more food and drinks, we were given our bill.  As I'm signing my credit card slip, I hear our waiter burst out in a confrontation with three foreign women seated several tables from us who apparently did not know or feel obligated to leave the waiter a gratuity.  The debate got louder, but mostly from the indignance from our waiter.  I'm not saying he was right or wrong - I just think there was a better way to handle that situation."

S"I'm back bitches!  \n\nUnfortunately, the review that I chose my return on isn't a glowing five star, but a glowering 1 star.\n\nThe only meal I ate in Vegas for 3 days ( I kid you not) was Friday not at this place.  It came highly recommended by numerous friends, so I thought this should be some great sushi.  \n\nBoy was I mistaken. \n\nFirstly, we had a 10PM reservation.  We arrived at 9:45 thinking we'll grab a seat at the bar and sip on a cocktail and people watch at all the bachelorette parties, etc.  Well, 45 mins later and we still didn't have a table.  My stomach was growling, and my face was scowling at this point.  \n\nThe hostess was rude when we would ask how much longer for a table, she would just say, You're next.  Really? I'm next you said that 10 people ago??!!\n\nWhen we finally got our seats, we ordered the following:\n\n--Rock shrimp:  It was tempura battered.  The first few bites were good, but as everything began to cool, it just became mushy.  \n\n--Fusion sushi roll was boring, bland and well, you get the point\n\n--The only thing that was excellent was the sea bass. It was moist, delicate and absolutely delicious.  But, $25 for 2 skewers left me wanting.  \n\nThe peruvian corn was awful..\n\nThe restaurant itself is everything that you would expect from Vegas. Upscale, trendy and expensive.  $200 for three items and 4 cocktails.  Not worth my only eating experience in Vegas that weekend."

S'When you first walk into Sushi Samba you would think its just a regular restaurant, but having them take you to the back area of the restaurant changes from being crowded to having it set to an intimate, dim ambiance. The restroom is also dim. I like the presentation they had in the bathroom. Lotion, candies, napkins. What more can you ask for.\n\nThe service was good  overall.Our server was attentive throughout the entire meal and making suggestions on our selection of foods. Its a fusion mixed with Japanese, Brazillian, and i dont remember the other one. Sorry....\n\nWe had ordered this shoju drink when it came out everyone was surprise because all the shots was on a drink tree. Nice presentation!!\n\nFood was good.

S'It\'s interesting that back home, I partake in sushi once or twice a week without fail  ... and yet in Vegas, while staying in a hotel where it seems every celebrity chef has at least one restaurant (and in many cases two)... I\'m drawn to a "sushi" place once again.  \n\nNonetheless, the Brazilian beats and atmosphere from the outside looking in made SUSHISAMBA seem different, and well worth trying. \n\nSo we did.\n\nSUSHISAMBA is a Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian fusion restaurant.  Hence the aforementioned "beats." \n\nThe visuals of this place are more "club" than restaurant, both from a lighting/decor perspective, as well as the patrons drinking around the bar.  \n\nThat being said, as we were seated at our table, the fusion influences did highlight how somewhat boring and "polite" the sushi places I normally frequent actually are.  SUSHISAMBA has a much more vibrant atmosphere.\n\nRegardless, I was in the mood for sushi, so I stayed within that zone on the menu. \n\nMy dinner companion fears the stuff... which made this place perfect.  I could indulge, while she self-cooked meat on a ultra hot stone in front of her (yes, that is an option).  \n\nThus, my sashimi/sushi/roll selection was served before me with zero guilt .\n\nEverything either of us ordered was very good.  No complaints on the quality whatsoever.  The only negatives are repeated from what other reviewers have mentioned:\n\n--  if you order outside of the Japanese realm, the price seems to go way up.  If you treat it as a sushi restaurant, the price is in line, even for Vegas.  \n\n-- Again, outside of the "sushi" realm, portion size could very well disappoint. \n\n--  The tables can feel a little too close for comfort with your neighbors.  But this varies depending on where you are seated.  \n\nOverall, I am a fan of the traditional sushi-restaurant  fare served here, because it trumps the overall experience I have elsewhere -- the quality is fine, the atmosphere is more fun.  \n\nVenturing beyond that will no doubt deliver quality, but you may end up needing to order more than expected to be satisfied, and end up with a much lighter wallet.  \n\nCalgary Yelp\'s 30 day challenge:  10/30'

S'This place is sooo good. They have a really nice atmosphere. My friend placed reservation here for my birthday. We got there perfect timing. The waitress and manager are so friendly. Service is really good here. Now the food, just great. We got the appetizer with salted bean, tempera bean, and grilled jalapeno. The beans taste good. The jalapeno wasn\'t spicy, but had a very sourish/"pickle" taste. It\'s different. We ordered a samba roll. That was really good. Crunchy, tasteful, and delicious. We ordered the tiger shrimp and sea bass. Both came with peruvian corn. It was my first time having peruvian corn. It is good. It\'s chewy and reminds me of "sticky" corn but larger size. The sea bass was very good. The meat was soft and sweet and melts in your mouth. It had a teriyaki flavor I thought. The shrimps was very good too. Both tasted very fresh, especially the shrimp. It smells like the ocean. We also ordered fried calamari. The calamari has a tangy sauce poured on top with mixture vegetable including good tomatoes and sweet plantains. They brought out warm banana chocolate cake for me. The dessert is delicious. Ice cream and a crunchy chocolate piece on top of warm chocolate cake in syrup with couple strip of fried banana. Just delicious. All the food were brought out in a very good presentation. The dishes are pricey. But if you want to eat fresh and good quality food, you should come to this place.'

He was very patient with the dietary restrictions that my friend had and made great recommendations.  \n\nHighlights were the peruvian corn which were colossal and meaty.  They disappeared very quickly.  We also shared the Rio Grande churrasco.  One of the 3 meats we had chosen were the rib eye which was medium rare and excellent with the red chimichurri dipping sauce (1 of the 4 sauces that came with the dish).  The lobster on the Samba Strip Roll was the best thing of the dish - everything else was a bit plain and for $20, I don't think I'll be ordering that again. We also had the tasty seabass skewers and topped our dinner off with 3 flavors of ice cream on a plate with a chocolate 'Happy Birthday' written on it for the birthday girls. The place is a bit pricey but heck, we were in Vegas!"

S'I was pleasantly surprised by Sushi Samba.  It was kind of a last choice for our big bachelorette party of 18 girls.  At first I was like... eh, I can try that in NY.  And you\'re always taking a gamble with Asian Fusion.\n\nBut, we knew the bride liked sushi and so we eventually caved.\n\nHere is the breakdown of my experience at Samba:\n\nDecor/atmosphere - dark, swank, very appropriate for the occasion.  They sat our party in the back room where no one else was seated.  That was nice.  We had privacy for the first hour or so of our meal.  The air conditioning was cranked up way too high but they said they turned it down.  I don\'t think they did.  I damn near lost my toes trying to keep blood flowing to the extremities.\n\nService - friendly, cute staff of slow-talking Brazilian boys.  They\'re good but something tells me they were hired as eye candy rather than for their perfect waiting skills.  As we sat down they asked if we wanted flat or sparkling water - don\'t you hate when restaurants do that and trick you into buying overpriced bottled water?  I specifically clarified "tap" after some of the girls said flat and they still brought out about 7 bottles all opened and ready to pretty much pour straight into our throats.  That was my one big complaint of the night.  Oh yeah, and I also asked them to box up some leftovers for us to take, which they never did.\n\nFood - surprisingly yummy.  We had a 7-course pre-fixe which included a shrimp appetizer, organic greens salad with carrot-ginger dressing, giant sushi platter, miso sea bass, teriyaki chicken over purple mashed potatoes, beef carpaccio(?), chocolate bread pudding and finally a tres leite (I have no idea what this is but it was delicious). The highlight for me was the sea bass.  Very similar to a miso black cod or butterfish.  I loved the chicken.  Usually, I\'m indifferent to teriyaki but it was moist and so unique with the creamy potatoes.  The beef dish was like a beef tataki - very rare (almost raw) and with nice acidity.  Desserts did not disappoint at all - I\'d say it was actually a highlight of the meal.\n\nWell done, Sushi Samba.  You were way overpriced but I have to admit I enjoyed myself.'

The two best dishes were the Yamato roll with foie gras and the uni (very fresh). Everything else was so-so with the biggest disappointment was the Samba Strip roll. \n\nOverall nothing was memorable.

Instead, just tell your Server the type of Sushi or Sashimi you like, your level of "experimentation", and your price range.   They will bring you wonderful dishes that you won\'t find on the menu!   Alice was our Server, and she is great!   I highly recommended the Japanese Tacos and Kobe Beef Surf & Turf.  Your eyes will roll back in your head with pure ecstasy!   Note: Bring about $200 or more (for two people).  It\'s not cheap, but I would rank this meal as a top 10 of all time!'

I had never been, and I love sushi, so I was totally ok with his choice.\n\nWe arrived and looked at the menu, but ended up not needing it as we settled on the option our server gave to us... tell her our likes and dislikes, and they'd make a custom menu for us to try a bunch of everything.\n\nWhat followed was a lot of food that we would have never ordered... and we were delighted at the items they brought us.  Our favorite was the chilean sea bass, which was so tasty.  It came with peruvian corn, which is like huge overgrown corn.  We also really enjoyed the yellowtail seviche taquitos and the rock shrimp tempura, as well as a few of the numerous sushi rolls they had brought at the end.  And our meal also included giant crab legs, some peruvian sashimi, and at least one or two dishes I'm failing to remember.\n\nThe music was a little loud and not to my dad's taste, but that's typical in Vegas.  The meal was definitely a unique experience, and we wouldn't have stumbled upon half the dishes without letting the chef do his thing.

S"We stayed at the Venetian and Palazzo over the weekend. It took us about an hour to decide on which restaurant in the Palazzo to dine at....because man are the restaurants SUPER PRICEY. Since we had friends that had to catch a flight we had to eat in the Palazzo so we decided on this place for a group of 9.\n\nThis place blends Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian cuisine....while it sounds like a great idea (never heard of such an Asian Fusion Combo)....I think this place tries way to hard to be different. The only thing that I really liked was the grilled sea bass....super yummy but it still was $16 for two mini skewers. It came with Peruvian corn which sounded interesting....but turned out to be huge corn kettles that tasted like buttered lima beans....yucko!!! As far as the sushi I tried about 5 of the 10 rolls they had. Wasn't too impressed with any of them. They looked pretty and all....but weren't so yummy. I tried a few other dishes too....it just seemed like they were blending unique flavors that just didn't blend well together. The few things preventing me from giving this place 2 stars was the great service (note: they do get 20% tip for groups.....so I do expect top quality service), cool ambiance, and hot guys. Check out the break down below:\n\n2 STARS - FOOD (Overall disappointing)....EXCEPT FOR THESEABASS \n2 STARS - PRICE (Expect to pay $40 - $100 per person if you want to get full)\n2 STARS - PORTIONS (I left still a bit hungry)\n4 STARS - ATMOSPHERE\n5 STARS - SERVICE (Really friendly waitress)\n5 STARS - HOT WORKERS!!! (seriously...do you have to be a model to work here....there was lots of eye candy dressed in all black)\n__________________________________\n\nJUST 3 STARS ALL IN ALL....OVERALL DON'T REALLY RECOMMEND IT HERE IF YOU ARE STRAPPED ON CASH....UR PROBABLY BETTER OFF AT A BUFFET ON THE STRIP IF YOU WANNA GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH.

S"I've eaten at SushiSamba many many many times and have never written a review until now.  There's never been a reason for me not to write a review but since I've been actively writing format of my other jaunts I figured its about time to do it here!  \n\nAnyway, I usually spend my time at the bar.   Personally I think it's the best place to sit back, enjoy great sake and have a fine meal while engaging with others.  Plus, I have absolutely NEVER experienced a moment of bad service in the two years and 15-20 times a year I've been to Samba.  Everyone behind the bar is always incredibly friendly, and though the faces change occasionally, it's always a pleasure to see the usual staff.  They always have a friendly smile and engaging conversation, obviously not for long as they have their work to do and other customers, but I see they treat everyone around the bar like family.  No wonder why I keep coming back!  \n\nMy last visit was Saturday March 2nd and I had a guest with me.  As always the service was outstanding and the ladies behind the bar went above and beyond to make our night special.  The food as always was fantastic!  We ordered the Kobe hot rock at the bar with thinly sliced Japanese A5 beef and cooking sauces, fun and entertaining tools your own special little treats.  We also hade surf and turf tacos as well as some amazing King Crab legs.  My date had a great time and we enjoyed a wonderful sake pairing with our meal and I enjoyed a great night of which I hold everyone working that night partially responsible. :)\n\nNeedless to say, I recommend Samba to anyone who wants to have a good time, good food, and great service!  Do what I do, sit at the bar, enjoy the people watching, and get to know your bartenders.  They are awesome!"

S"I'd like an order of pretension please, overpriced with a side of sushi.\n\nThat is my conclusion after eating at this middling-in-everything-but-the-cost restaurant. Some of the low points:\n\n- $6 tea. TEA! You know, the stuff you drop leaves in water to make?\n\n- $6 Edamame. Were they able to pontificate about the glories of Socrates vs. Plato? No? Well for that price they should have been.\n\nThe rolls were reasonable but after BC nothing compared to Tentatsu. Look it up. \n\nAvoid this restaurant unless you want to drop your cash."

S'Who woulda thunk to meld Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian flavors?  Glad these peeps did, because it really is like a carnaval explosion of flavors. The menu seems endless, with great friendly service who offers to pull a menu together for you.  Our table was a group of type A personalities, so we took that into our own hands - so many great choices -- tempura green beans, tuna taktaki, yellowtail taquitos, tuna ceviche with apple and jalapeno, sea bass, and the list goes on and on.  This is definitely one place that makes return visits to Vegas more appealing!  Great specialty cocktails.'

S"I didn't know what to expect with Japanese/Brazilian fusion, but this place exceeded my expectations. We tried a mixture of classic sushi, miso soup and some fusion dishes. The sushi was exceptionally fresh with unique presentation. \n\nFusion dishes to try: \nEl Topo (roll), which had salmon, jalape\xc3\xb1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion. It sounds absurd and it was just that... absurdly delicious. \n\nCarnaval (roll)- shrimp, avocado, yellowtail, soy paper. This one wasn't as good as El Topo, but still offered a cool twist on a typical Japanese favorite.\n\nMiso soup - it was a great miso but with added cilantro to lend to the Brazilian side of the restaurant. Amazing twist!\n\nWagyu gyoza - kabocha pur\xc3\xa9e and su-shoyu dipping sauce made this sweet, tangy, and a little spicy. We ended up ordered another batch after downing the first order in 30 seconds. So good!\n\nWe also ordered some Robata items, which were great, but paled in comparison to the fusion dishes and the sushi items. This place is absolutely worth a stop! Also, the price is right. We ordered a ton of food for 5 people and the bill was reasonable!"

S'The stars are for food quality and lush atmosphere, but that\'s generous.  The portions are small and, like everything else in Vegas, at least three times the price you\'d pay back home.  \nThe waitress was a nightmare.  I\'ve met used car salesmen who are less pushy.  She raved about the chef\'s special menu, which was $50 per person.  When we blanched at the price, she hinted that *maybe* she could "work with us" on a "tasting" menu at $30 per person.  For $30 I want more than a frickin "taste", I was an awesome meal that will fill me up.  We had to ask her three times, point-blank, if we could see a menu and order just from the menu.  She grudgingly brought ONE menu for the two vegetarians (of a bachelorette party of 12).  I had to ask the busboy for menus for the rest of us.  \nWhen we ordered from the menu, she gave us a dire warning that the food came from 3 different kitchens and wouldn\'t arrive all at the same time.  She gave one last push for the tasting menu.  I would have walked out and complained to the manager if I hadn\'t been in a large party.  \nI ended up paying $15 for edamame and rice.  It tasted good, and all the other dishes looked great - but definitely not worth the hassle and abuse. \nSushiSamba seriously needs to retrain their staff.  Focus on improving the customer\'s experience, not on cramming your own agenda down their throats.\nUPDATE:  The General Manager contacted me to apologize, and has promised to discipline/retrain the servers who have been the cause of the numerous bad reviews on Yelp.  Even with improved service, I still wouldn\'t recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking to fill their bellies or get good value for their money.  If you\'re all about atmosphere and haute cuisine, then samba on down.'

S"My dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall I say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. There were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. Typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  However, we were served typical menu items.  I think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders. \n\nThe Good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. The Bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.  \n\nInstead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following: \n(1) Tuna tataki: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish. \n(2) Wagyu beef dumplings: Not enough brought out so I never got to try it. \n(3) Mini yellow tail tacos:  I liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish. \n(4) Crab tempura: How ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and I had to share one bite of one piece? This wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche. \n(5) Sea bass and shrimp skewers: Again, not enough so most of us shared skewers. \n(6) Steak and mushroom stew: Everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful. \n(7) Sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but IMO were rather underwhelming. The sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. We were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which I easily could have eaten by myself.\n\nI felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple). \n\nYes, our server was pleasant and friendly. Yes, the food was quite tasty.  And, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. Sure, I expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what I didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more."

S"Went for my first time with a group of 7 and was blown away at the service, ambiance and not to mention the food was AH-MAZING. I've been to a lot of top notch sushi restaurants, and this was probably the most unique concept with Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian inspired dishes. \n\nWith a group of 7 with a variety of tastes, likes and dislikes, one of the best things Sushi Samba does is offer a chef's selection of 3 or 4 courses based on (A) how much each person wants to spend (we chose $40/person) and (B) what each person likes, dislikes, is allergic to, etc. and (C) how many courses (we did 3).\n\nWe didn't know what to expect, but the first course/starters came out and there was a piece of each starter for each person (don't you hate when there is an odd number?!) and the girl who likes chicken over fish got a steak skewer instead of raw tuna. The second course included this fabulous Peruvian grilled and butter sauteed corn that I am seriously in love with. Each kernel is the size of your index fingernail, sweet and lightly grilled for a slight chewy texture. Where can I find this at my local grocer or farmers market?! The third course included a variety of sushi including non-fish, non-raw rolls for the non-fish eaters in our group. \n\nWe were a hungry bunch and left very happy. Bring your appetite because the portions are nice. Service was 5 stars with attentive staff start to finish. Our server came by regularly to check-in, the staff orchestrated plate and settings changes after each course, and we even got a complimentary strawberry vodka drink on the house."

S'I\'m biased. I love sushi, and my Brazilian blood will never let me forget the exotic tastes and textures of northern-Brazilian cuisine. So here you have Sushi+Samba... what in heavens can go wrong? Culinary orgasm for sure. I booked a table for 4, but my buddies stood me up, so I went alone.A super friendly and beautiful Asian-American young lady took me to the sushi bar, and in a matter of seconds an even more beautiful mixed-Asian waitress showed up. If the food is any good this place is paradise! Anyway, I had to go exotic, so I ordered two appetizers (Carnaval= shrimp, avocado, yellowtail tartar, crispy rice paper and the Samba Strip = Maine lobster, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry) and a "half" main dish (Moqueca Mista = shrimp, squid, sea bass and crayfish with coconut milk, roasted cashew, dend\xc3\xaa oil, chimichurri rice ... this is a very typical Brazilian dish)\n\nThe moment I started savoring the spices, the seafood, the dende oil... I was taken back to Bahia, incredible beaches, sea-breeze, mulatas in tiny bikinis... I had to snap back in order to continue my sensory trip to food nirvana.\n\nBefore they rate my review XXX and ban it from Yelp, I will summarize: just go, order without fear, enjoy the smells and tastes (and the view), go exotic, try "positions" you never dared before.\n\nLook, once you go "sushi+Brazil" you never go back.\n\nCheers!'

S'These 5 stars goes to the lady who was so damn good at her job by fulfilling every aspect of our dining experience that the food was more like a plus. I wish I got her name to credit her but we were a party of 8 girls staggering in late in high heels for our dear friend\'s bachelorette reserved dinner on a Saturday night a week ago.\nWe got the run down quickly on doing their style of "omakase" after mentioning we had a show and had to finish by 9pm. We gave her free rein with a price per person between $30 to $40.\nNow, I was the only one who had been here before for the same concept so I was expecting the same good service and food. So I discreetly asked the lady server to make sure to add the Miso Sea Bass skewers. She happily replied, "I gotchu girl!" \nWe were then offered the extensive sake and wine menu, which we had to forgo. And one of the girls almost ordered the cucumber martini but didn\'t.  \nAfter the time it took for a buzzed dude to walk over, show us his awesome swim trunks, (clearly forgetting to dress his bottoms to match his sharp shirt), wink and share a charming smile, and then leave...our appetizers were presented by a team of 3 servers.\n- Otsumami: trio of edamame, tempura green beans with amazing truffle dip, grilled shishito pepper :)\n- Pork Gyozas (ok)\n- Rock Shrimp Tempura (wasn\'t as succulent or saucy but still good)\n\nOur waters were always filled. Thank you water guy!\n\nThen after enjoying our appz for about 20 mins, came out the yummiful skewers, 3 specialty rolls of sushi (could have asked for the El Topo roll but decided try the others) and an entree split by 2 plates to share. It was the teriyaki chicken with fried onions atop mashed purple potatoes. This is so yum because the chicken was juicy and flavorful!\n\nWe were having our fill and we were on schedule. Then the lady server got us a surprise sake tree of their cucumber martini! Also very refreshing and yum to end our meal.  We had to pack a bit of to-go and we were happy with the service. She lined our meal down the middle of our price range to about $36/person (plus tax+tip $45).\nSo exceeded my last experience here!  I recommend the omakase style because the servers really do know the menu. Trust!'

I had the Neo Tokyo Roll as well and while it may not have been anything "super fancy" I thought it was tasty and would have gladly eaten another piece or two.

S'Dinner here completely blew away my expectations.  I expected corporate lackluster service, dishes and an over hyped Vegas restaurant.  I was glad to be proven wrong.  \n\nA Sushisamba was short lived in Dallas and now I can see why...this would never fit in Dallas.  A very lively restaurant at the back end of the Palazzo Shops.  Once seated the very charismatic server explained that the menu, influenced by Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine, is designed to be shared by the table.  Definitely an odd sounding combination of countries for a menu but it worked out well.  Peru and Brazil are heavy on the meats, and with Peru having an Asian influence in their culture, it made perfect sense to fuse the three together. \n\nWhen dining with a large group here it can be very confusing as to what should be ordered with a shared menu concept.  Someone at the table should take charge of the ordering or ask your server to lead the way.  We relied on our server to guide us through.  He listened to our likes and dislikes a delivered a wonderful sushi platter.  The rolls were small but great flavor.  We enjoyed it so much we ordered a second platter.  Try the Samba Roll...lobster and mango served with a curry peanut sauce.  Still hungry we ventured to the Peruvian side of the menu and ordered the anticuchos served with Peruvian corn.  A sweet and heavy starch corn, much different that what we have in States.  The skewered meat was very sweet and tender.  Next were the fried mushrooms...a recommendation from the server.  These were outstanding...deep rich flavor fried in tempura.  This sounds like a lot of food but it is not.  I left quite hungry but satisfied with the quality of food and service we received.\n\nFor as busy as they were, the server did not skip a beat.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The restaurant can get pretty loud if you catch it later in the evening.  With this type of shared menu the bill can jump pretty fast.'

The service was very prompt and attentive.  \n\nOnce we ordered they brought out warm bread rolls.  They were soft and pretty tasty.  Nothing out of the norm though.  We each had steaks and they were fabulous. Cooked to perfection.  The sides of potato puree and asparagus were both quite good.  The roasted corn side dish was heavenly.  I honestly don't know what all is in it but it was the most awesome corn I've ever had....and I'm not a big veggie person.\n\nServings are generous on the side dishes and everything is served family style so you can pass them around and share.\n\nWe were so full we weren't able to get dessert."

S"Now this is eating.  American kobe steak.  The hands down greatest steak I have ever eaten.  American kobe (wagyu) beef is a cross between the full Japanese cow and Angus.  This was done because the wagyu beef is extremely marbled, almost white and thus not as appealing to Americans.  Plus American kobe is alot less expensive since you only need one kobe cow to tango.  That being said Craftsteak does actually have 100% wagyu but it is crazy expensive.  They also have non kobe steaks, which are damn good.  Have tried the new york and it was awesome.  But I am here for the kobe steak.\n\nSo back to the meal, Craftsteak is located in the MGM Grand hotel.  I've been here twice now.  You can either order a la carte.  Steak, appetizers, sides, deserts etc, similar to other places like Ruths Chris and Flemings.  Or you can get a one of their taster meals, the basic one being $130 a person.  Pretty damn expensive but wow, that is eating like a king.  I've tried it both ways and its great either way.\n\nAppetizers include kobe tartar which is awesome.  Sides like baby broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, and the spinach are good.  The potatoes are not as good as other steak places I've been to.  The deserts are pretty solid as well, ice creams, monkey bread, etc.  Most importantly though are the steaks.  The Flat iron is noticeably different from other steaks, but the kobe skirt steak, their signature steak, and kobe ribeye are awesome.  The ribeye is richer, almost too rich, than the skirt and is probably better but the skirt is definitely more manageable.  Both are great but if you are ordering a la carte and have to eat the whole steak yourself, get the skirt.  A la carte, the skirt is also 35 dollars cheaper as well.    \n\nThe various samplers are expensive and worth it if you are very hungry.  But most people will not finish their meals and to leave any kobe steak over would certainly be a sin.  Also remember that kobe steaks are more filling than regular steaks, so choose wisely.  I find that I am fine ordering the kobe skirt and 1 side.  This place is excellent."

S'The food here is mediocre at best!  I guess when the waiter "suggests" the tasting menu, that might be the only thing good...everything else on the menu tasted salty and the chefs failed to cook our steaks twice!  \n     We came here and decided to go straight to the entrees & sides.  My friends shared the ribeye, new york strip, and t-bone.  None of these were american or japanese kobe, just the regular steaks.  First, our steaks didnt even come out on time...they brought out two steaks and sides, then 5mins later our third steak arrives...cmon chefs you can do better than that!  Second, the first two steaks that came out (new york strip and ribeye) were cold and overcooked.  When I say cold I dont mean "warm," it was luke-warm at best..it tasted as if it had been sitting on the counter for 10min... Third, they overcooked the steak, or maybe it was sitting on the counter for so long that the steak kept cooking and also became cold at the same time..who knows, either way the steaks came out medium and medium-well, when we asked for medium-rare.     We told the waiter about our unsatisfied steaks, and he took our steaks back and had them recook it without questions!  A+ on the waiter\'s part for taking back our steaks NO QUESTIONS ASKED...unfortunately he tried to double charge us on our bill!\n     We also ordered sides of mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and sauteed brocolli.  The mashed potatoes were very good!  The mushrooms and broccoli were way too salty!  Our t-bone steak came out okay, but i felt like the meat was a little bit tough and didnt have much flavor...then again I hardly eat t-bone.  So we waited and waited for our two steaks to come back, the waiter swung by a couple times to tell us our steaks would be here shortly..but it took almost 25min for our steaks to come back..way too long in my opinion!  Finally our steaks came back, but this time the steaks were way too rare!  The waiter tells us he cooked it rare+ (which is somewhere between medium-rare and rare).  But, we didnt ask for rare+, we asked for medium rare...the rare+ was raw on the inside, it looked almost rare, and the inside was not even cooked (it was cold).   Of  course, at this point we were dissapointed and didnt want to tell the waiter to take it back again (it might have taken another 20min of our time).   We decided to eat the side pieces of the meat and avoid the rare parts..the ribeye was actually a good piece of meat, but its hard to eat rare meat.   The new york was a little chewy, but that could be because it was undercooked!  \n       Another thing to add to our experience here was the waiter kept dissapearing on us, we waited almost 30min for our check, and once he brought our food out, he would dissapear for 15-20min...service was way too slow here...we even asked the other waitress to get our check, but she insisted our waiter would be here shortly.  \n      Overall, this place failed to deliver quality steaks and service.  The service was slow, they kept us waiting on food and our check, which makes a very unhappy customer.  The steaks we ordered weren\'t from the "recommended" menu, maybe thats why they didnt turn out good, but i\'d expect quality food on the whole menu!   The chefs really need to learn to time the entrees, all food should come out at once.  The steak also needs to be cooked right, which the chefs failed to do!       \n     Ohh one last point, when we sent back our steaks, the waiter tried to bill us twice for both the steaks, we notice\'d a double charge on our bill..pretty shady by the waiter!  He tried to play it dumb when we told him, but it was so obvious he tried to double charge us for no reason...bad food and service overall!  But maybe its because we didnt order from the tasting menu, which is 100+ per person.'

S'If you want a really good steak, this may not be the place for you. After hearing such great reviews on Yelp for CS I was shocked how my food was prepared. \n\nHere is what my girlfriend and I ordered:\n\n2 - Bone in Rib Eye (Medium Rare)\n1 - Side of Sweet Corn\n1 - Side of French Fries w/ Paprika. \n\nFirst, our Rib-Eye came out medium well. The server asked my girlfriend and I to slice the steak in half to see if it was overdone (although it shouldn\'t matter), we did and she said she\'ll take our steak back. IMO a server especially at a steakhouse should never ask you to cut your steak in half. I\'m paying $50! It better be perfect!\n\nAs we munch our french fries and sweet corn, the manager came over to let us know another medium rare steak would arrive soon, and they will give us a new order of hot sides to make sure everything goes well together. I wasn\'t mad nor angry simply because I had faith they would get things right. Again, when the food arrive, it was medium (close to medium rare) once again. At this time, we did not want to send the food back and just decided to eat it anyway instead of waiting for another 30 minutes for them to correct it again.\n\nA steakhouse should know how to prepare a medium rare steak. Although it is the hardest to prepare, a good restaurant should be able to execute this with ease. I\'m glad I didnt go "all-in" and order the Wagyu ($110) over the rib eye. I would have been pissed if I had to keep sending my Wagyu back.\n\nBone In Rib Eye 16oz ($50 each) - 3 / 5 Stars\n\nFrench Fries - 5 / 5 Stars. The fries were insanely good.~$13\n\nSweet Corn - 5 / 5 Stars. The second batch of corn came out hot and it tasted better than the first one.~$13 \n\nComplimentary Bread - 4 / 5 Stars. 6 amazing rolls served hot and warm.\n\nThe sides can actually be split between 3 - 4 people. The steak itself was more than enough, I recommend splitting 2 sides between 3-4 people. The sides were good, but it couldn\'t save CS from a 3 star review. It would be a misleading review if I gave CS a 4 star. If you really want a good steak, I would recommend heading to Delmonico (@ the Venetian). The steak here relied more on some sort of marinating sauce. The Bone-In Rib Eye (18oz) @ Delmonico used a pepper spice and it simply melts in your mouth.\n\nLastly, CS felt a lot more like a casual restaurant. You see a lot of people ordering steak and eating by the bar. Not ideal if you\'re looking for a romantic dinner, but it didn\'t bother me.'

S"I did the Chef's Tasting Menu (pre- Cirque du Solei- KA). The amount of food you are given is insane so don't be fooled by the 3 course description. Why it is only an appetizer, entree/side, and dessert menu, you are given at least three large dishes for each course! The service was fine, and we finished with plenty of time to make it to the show. I will say, for as hard as Tom Collichio is on the participants in Top Chef, I was expected a little more.  Don't get me wrong, it was very good, but I wouldn't return unless I was invited by someone else. My favorite part of the meal was the either the whipped potatoes (side) or the maple/cinnamon flavored bunt/sticky cake thing."

S"The most I have ever spent on dinner and I say worth EVERY penny.  I had the most memorable and enjoyable birthday dinner here.  I'd say a must visit while in Vegas.  Go hungry!\n\nMy boyfriend and I had the chef's menu with two cuts of steak.  Probably the best steak I've had in a restaurant.  I loved the presentation of the steak- in a skillet with the meat cut into strips with care.  The sides and starters were definitely not a throw away.  I think I could have licked the bowl of the lobster bisque.\n\nThen when I though we were done, the dessert came!  Came with our chef's menu.  In addition- they gave me a happy birthday monkey bread!\n\nThe service was top notch.  Not a flaw and perfect timing from when we sat down all the way to dessert.  While the service was in teams...which I am not sure I liked...they really made sure we had what we needed and were enjoying it.\n\nMinor complaint- the chef's tasting menu was a little hard to understand when reading from the menu..but our waiter was very patient with us.  I am glad that we decided to order this!\n\nI am definitely going back to Craftsteak the next time I'm in Vegas."

S'The only problem I had was I could not eat all the food.  We selected the 3 course sampler with no alcohol.  First out was our soup and salad course that went very well with the butter rolls..yum!  Soup was lobster bisque with 3 variation of salads.  If you do not eat large meals, I would suggest taking it easy during your first course even though you will want to eat all of it.  We chose the surf and turf for our second course that included a Wagyu skirt steak, a Wagyu ribeye, and a 2 lb lobster.  The steaks are served med rare, and are absolutely outstanding cuts.  The lobster was slightly overcooked, but still pretty good.  Our second course came with 3 family style sides.  Asparagus, gratin potatoes, and an assortment of mushrooms.  Again, all three were delicious.  Third course topped it off.  They gave us two scoops of ice cream with one being a pistaccio flavor, and the other I forgot.  We also had a variety of nicely cut up fresh fruit.  The third plate of dessert had a chocolate bar of some sort and another ice cream scoop.  Since it was our birthday, we received a plate of their monkey bread with MORE ice cream.  SO, now you know why it was so hard to walk away from food on our plates.  $160 per person.  You can dress up or go casual.  Either way it is cool.  Enjoy!'

S'this could have been one of the best dinners i have ever had, though just my luck, talk about matters turning for the worst. \nstarted off with a couple of don julio/anejo margis at the bar; excellent!!! bartender  was also very nice/professional. my gal and i were seated and we started off with their seafood sampler which was the absolute bomb. i think it was around $52.00 though it was worth every dime. real generous servings of king crab, lobster, 4 oysters, 2 large prawns, caviar, and etc. all the seafood is chilled.  anyhow yummy it was. as for our main course my gal ordered the rib eye, and for myself i ordered the filet mignon. we also ordered gratan potatoes & spinach for side dishes. o.k. here is where things started going south. when our steaks came out in these metal skillet type dishes, and we started digging into our steaks, i can honestly say that our steaks were both at room temp. not even warm. just to give tom colicchio some credit, i will say our steaks were barely warm. i looked over at my date and asked her how her steak was, and basically she replied, "this is one of the worst steaks i have ever had due to the fact that the beef is actually cold. not even warm." of course i felt the same way about my filet. we were thinking of having our waiter take our steaks back and warm them up a little, except for the fact that both of our steaks were over cooked. when our waiter came over and asked us how everything was, i mentioned to him that our steaks were cold. our waiter was an older/nice latino man, and i liked him in the beginning, though when he started to bullsh_t me about that they don\'t serve their steaks warm/hot, i lost all respect for this guy. i was thinking to myself, does this guy think i am some kind of idiot? actually the problem is that i am 46 and i look about 33. my gal looks quite young too, so people take for granted that we are kids and that we won\'t know any better. they under estimate us all the time. well sure enough here we go again, except i never thought i would get this unprofessional service at such a nice restaurant. later on that weekend i called my good friend up who recomended this restaurant for dinner  and asked him about the steaks/skillets coming out cold. his story was completely different from what the waiter. he mentioned how the skillets should be hot and that you should be careful of them. mines wasn\'t even warm. so basically what happened was our food was forgotten about for a lengthy amount of time, our dipsh_t waiter didn\'t pick up on the fact that he was bringing us cold food or just didn\'t think we would catch on to this, and worst of all, our saturday night dinner was ruined, because of their weak staff. bringing cold beef to our table; hello. mc donalds serves hotter food than you shmucks. should have went to matros or nines. actually the sizzler would have been better. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!! They need to find better staff/waiters, ecspecially if they are going to be be bullsh_tting their customers. It amazes me, just with a little bit of effort, this could have all been avoided. But no, the waiter had to make lame excuses and make matters worse. not sure if management is aware what i going on at their restaurant, though i will be calling them tomorrow to let them know. oh and by the way, tom colicchio, your name is on this food, and i just want to let you know you get two thumbs down when it comes to your steaks buddy. your cooks are equally at fault for letting cold food leave your kitchen. you definetly don\' know the first thing about running a kitchen. shame on you and this restaurant.\n\nDid a little more research, the waiter was not the problem and I take back what I said about the waiter. Did some research, from what I understand this restaurant lets their steaks set for a while before they are served. The manager says that this helps keeps the meat\'s juices inside the steak according to them. The only problem I see is if you let them set out in the open to long at room tempature the steaks come out to the customer cold, which was our case. If you eat at this restaurant, be sure to tell them to maybe not do this for so long, that way you have a warm steak.'

S'After many good reviews, I decided on trying Craftsteak at the MGM Grand.  My husband and I each had the surf and turf with a fillet and crab legs.  The fillets were a bit dry and overcooked. I think I had a similar steak at Outback. Nothing special. The crablegs were fine, but had too much butter. The weird thing is that nothing is plated. It is served to you in a skillet. I guess to keep the food hot, but I expected a plated dinner.  Overall, it was nothing special and the only impressive thing were the steak knives. Nice and sharp with a special spot for your index finger.'

S'Let\'s first get something straight here: If you know you will be eating here, don\'t eat much during the day or you will not have sufficient room in your stomach.  My mistake.  Wish I could go back in time here.\n\nWhat I did eat was fabulous, no complaints on the food.  As other reviewers state, the lobster bisque was awesome!\n\nThe service, however, was a little puzzling.  It only takes one person to make you feel out of place, and that one person was our first waiter.  He and another waiter took turns coming to our table, and while the second waiter was stellar, the first was aloof and condescending.  We had looked at a menu prior to our visit and thought we would do the $140/person domestic Waygu dinner.  But after eating a bit too much during the day, we were rethinking it.  Had several questions regarding the meal, but our waiter was abrupt and was like "Yes, you\'re getting it"  and walked off. No patience, just abrupt.  Okay, I guess we\'re getting it.  When the items starting coming to the table, there was one item I wasn\'t sure how to eat (sorry, we don\'t have such fancy places in our town).  When I asked, I was made to feel stupid.\n\nI mean, holy crap, we spent over $400 for a meal with tip, don\'t be such a condescending ass.  Just not a pleasant experience for spending a months worth of groceries.\n\nWe were also seated at a round booth near the pathway across the restaurant.  Behind us is where the servers all gathered to talk and tell jokes.  Very distracting.\n\nTried it once, and done.'

S"I was really excited to eat here, but was really let down.\n\nWe ate here right before we saw Ka.  For appetizers we got the frisee salad and the lobster bisque.  DELICIOUS.  The frisee had big chunks of bacon and the broken yolk  made the bacon taste 10x better.  We order a half bottle of red wine that was well worth the price too.  My like for Craftsteak ends here.   I got the flat iron steak and tried the surf and turf (ribeye and lobster tail), I can honestly say I've had better.  I'm from Texas and we've got plenty of good beef here. \n\nI was disappointed in the rolls since I heard so much rave about them, they were good but nothing special.  Have you ever had a yeast roll from Hartz Chicken?  If yes, then you've had a roll from Craftsteak.  I wish I could say more about this place."

S'"Have you ever done 69?  It\'s the BEST."  It\'s the red head sitting at the table to the right of me talking with her girlfriends.  And no, this wasn\'t some metaphor for how good the steak was.  She was talking about sex.  "What about sex when your legs in the air? The motion--it\'s so amazing." \n\nThe four of them--chic young professionals, like the crew from Sex in the City minus ten years, impeccable make-up and evening wear--could have passed for porn stars.  And no, I\'m not a chauvinist.  On the table to the left of me, there were 8 salivating males, a pack of alpha dogs, peering over constantly like hungry jackals as if our table was completely transparent.\n\nIt was just a matter of time one of the guys mustered the courage to leapfrog our table and exchanged a few words with the ladies, "Where are you ladies going tonight?  I heard great things about TAO.  Yeah, you should check out LAX."  He went nowhere fast.\n\nA few minutes later a couple other guys came over from the table behind us to say hi.  Before you know it, the girls were getting free scoops of sorbet.  On the way out, two of the girls even went to another table to sit on an old guys lap and take pictures, even though his wife was at the table.\n\nThere\'s certainly no scarcity of meat Craftsteak.\n\nIn fact, it\'s a food marathon.  Dinner at Tom Colicchio\'s Vegas establishment was hearty to say the least.  My girlfriend took me here as a belated celebration for landing my new job.  And my, did we celebrate.  We went for the surf and turf dinner sampler for two which included kobe tartar, tiger prawns, Caesar salad, Kobe skirt steak, Kobe rib eye, a two pound lobster, and desert which included chocolate cake, ice cream, sorbet, and a sugary puff pastry with a sweet dipping sauce.\n\nI could go on and on about the taste and presentation of each dish.  Take my word for it, it was pretty good.   The obvious problem was that we couldn\'t finish it all.  The waiter reaffirmed, "Nobody ever finishes the sampler dinner."\n\nThat left a bittersweet taste in my mouth.  Dinner and drinks came out to four bills.  The waiter could have warned us that we had ordered enough food for three or that we were going to walk out with the most expensive doggie bag ever (luckily our hotel had a fridge).  Had we been served an adequate amount of food, I would have been a lot happier--Craftsteak loses one star for overkill.'

I checked out the menu online and knew exactly what I was going to order. I had the spinach/pear salad, the 16oz ribeye and Maui onions. Everything was ala carte. The bread came warm to our table with a touch of sea salt on top. Everything was delicious. The ribeye was cooked perfectly but I barely touched it. I was already full from my salad. I was happy that the ribeye was cooked on the bone as that is where all the flavor is. Not once were our water glasses empty. The. Waitstaff here is exceptional.'

S"My dining companions arrived at 520.  Ten minutes prior to service starting.  We were escorted to the bar while the wait staff was finishing up their pre dinner preparations.  After ordering a round of cocktails and sipping those for a few minutes were introduced to our table.  \n\nHello nice table, How are you?  \nI'm great, please enjoy sitting in my extremely comfortable chairs and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nThese chairs were amazing.  The leather was so soft.  After discussing a basic meal strategy, we agreed upon, a salad to start, followed by our entrees with a few sides to share.  \n\nFor my salad, I ordered the frisee, warm egg and bacon salad.  OMG OMG OMG....  When I cut into that egg and all the yolk ran out onto the frisee, the blue cheese, and the bacon and I tasted it, I knew we were in for a real treat.  The bacon chunks were cooked perfectly.  All the right flavors came to the party.  Salty was there, he brought his friend Savory, and he brought his cousin Tangy.  And let me tell you, these flavors knew how to party.  The salad was big.  I tried to eat as much as I could but there was.... Well let's just say I wasn't going to be the guy who couldn't finish his steak because he went big on the salad, ok?\n\nAfter my two dining companions helped me polish off the remainder of the salad we started to dip into that bottle of 2006 Honig Cabernet.  This wine tasted great on its own, I couldn't wait to pair it with the Steak.  Queue the steak.  Drum roll please.......\n\nAh yes, my I present you with la surf and turf.  A 6oz Fillet cooked to medium rare accompanied by his old friend half a Maine lobster.  It was clear that after tasting this dry aged beef and all of the amazing flavor that comes with the aging process that these folks cook with a lot of butter.  Hey, you only live once, right?  Seriously though, the steak and lobster were both cooked perfectly and I couldn't have asked for anything more.  \n\nMy friends got the strip steak and the skirt steak, both of which I sampled and I'm happy to report that both tasted amazing.  The three of us split the potatoes au gratin and some maple carrots.  Each of the sides was great.  \n\nAs we worked to polish off the bottle of wine, and reflected on the past weekend, I was a little sad that I was going to be leaving.  But what an amazing way to cap off a Las Vegas weekend than a wonderful dinner with great friends."

With the group size we had, we didn't have full access to the full menu, but a well thought out tasting menu.  Two things that stood out was the Kobe steak and the different assortment of desserts.  I've never had Kobe up to that point, but it truly is an experience.  The way it was prepared, and I'm sure you've always heard how it melts in your mouth, well...it really does melt in your mouth.  Now the dessert, what I remember from this experience is, the pepper flavored ice cream.  You say pepper?  Yes, pepper.  I can exactly say its for everyone, but if you have an open mind and enjoy trying out new things, it's worth a bite."

S'Overhyped and totally underwhelming.  What a terrible disappointment it was. \n\nI have no doubt that the ingredients here are top notch. I in no way doubt the chef\'s ability to make food into art and his overally ability to make people want to inhale a week\'s worth of fats, sodium, and choloesteral, and calories into one seating--BUT this was certainly an off night for the whole establishment as a whole.  So terrible--that it\'s highly unlikely that I would ever give this particular off shoot of the Tom Colicchio family again.  And I LOVE Tom Colicchio.  Oh--to boot--there was a rather shocking event (or 2) that only helped to deteriote my opinion of this establishment. \n\nI made reservations for 7 people for Saturday night at 6pm. We were all jazzed up about dining here.  We were greeted and seated immediately at one of the round tables.\n\nAfter going through the menu and drooling over everyone\'s choices--we ordered the following:  Rack of lamb, 3 T-bones, NY strip, Filet Surf and Turf, Ribeye, 2 caesar salads, Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, and fries.  We asked the waiter if he thought that would be sufficient and he chuckled and said we could feed a small nation.  Sounds good.  \n\nFood\nBread--B+:  Fresh hot buns sprinkled with sea salt.  Winner.  \n\nCaesar Salad-- A:  You can\'t really go wrong here.  Very tasty--especially enjoyed the anchovies.  Very light and not overly dressed.  \n\nYukon Gold Pureed Potatoes-- D:  We all saw the pictures before hand.  We saw the layer of melted butter sauce that drowned this particular side.  It spoke our language.  This dish really proved to us that just because it\'s swimming in butter--it doesn\'t mean it\'s going to good.  The glutton in all of us echoed the same thing--Fail.  Aside from butter--this really didn\'t taste like much else.  If you got lucky--you had some chives.  Bland and rather tasteless.    \n\nAsparagus--A:  Look, I love asparagus so it in all ikelihood was going to get top marks from me--but these were superb.  Young, tender asparagus in olive oil and cracked pepper.  These were so succulent, and the flower had a perfect dry "crisp" bit to it.  HUGE fan of this dish. \n\nStrip--C minus : I asked for Medium Rare.  Waiter told me it will be slightly bloody and I told him I partially wanted it to Moo when it got to the table.  My steak came out well done.  Yes--well done steak.  No red, no pink--just brown.  I don\'t think I need to go into detail about how this tastes.  Okay--i\'ll give you one word--dry.   I wanted to send it back, I wanted to sent it back so badly.  But I didn\'t.  I was dining with a group of friends, and I didn\'t want to make a scene.  I wanted everyone to enjoy their meals.  \n\nI can\'t go into detail about how everyone else felt about their food since I only took a small bite out of each dish.  My feelings--good, not great.  \n\nFor most of the meal, we all seemed to come upon a general, silent concensus--This was craftsteak?  Not only did no one rave about the food, but no one even said anything all too complimentary.  \n\nNow--at the end of the meal, we all burst.  We all expressed our disappointment in the food.  Mediocre.  Nothing stood out.  Tasty? Yes.  But for the same price--I would gladly dine at Mastro\'s, Mortons, or Delmonico\'s (which despite its lower rating here on Yelp, is a wonderful and top notch establisbment).  Whereas we originally planned on ordering all the desserts--we were all so disappointed we decided against it.  \n\nSo--a girlfriend and I both didn\'t finish our steaks.  They offered to pack our steaks for us and said complimentary sweets would be served soon.  \n\nNo more than 4 minutes after our waiter left, a man a yeard away from our table slips/faints/whatever and hits his head on the wheeled cart.  We were shocked.  My boyfriend gets up to make sure the gentleman is okay, but is stopped short when the waiters and the fallen man\'s friends rush to his side.  It\'s a frightening.  He is obviously dazed, and it becomes apparent that he is now bleeding.  A staff member rushes over to his aid with more napkins and a bucket.  \n\nWe are all in shock--as was the entire restaurant.  But we were the closest--only 4 ft away.  Then the man started to vomit.  It didn\'t stop.  3 times--and we had front row seats.  He was finally moved to a different part of the restaurant and awaited the ambulence.  No one addressed the incident with us--even though we had a front row seat to the bleeding and the vomit.  We ask for our take away boxes--and after coming up empty handed the first time, returns to tell us it has been thrown away.  Now these were in no form dinky portions.  It was half of our entree. He apologized and said he would have the kitchen whip up new steaks. He brought out 2 boxes 15 later and we left.  It wasn\'t until we got back to our hotels did we see what were in the boxes--1/2 cut up strip, asparagus, and rolls was what we got for my strip and 1/2 her t-bone.  \n\nMassive fail.'

The service is IMPECCABLE and the food is outstanding. \n\nI had the Farmer Jones' mixed lettuces (dark, bitter lettuce - the caesar salad looked as if it would have been a better choice for me), the surf & turf with fillet mignon and scallops (perfection), shared sides of Yukon gold pur\xc3\xa9e (silky smooth - I could eat it for the rest of my life) and asparagus with my cousin, the chocolate souffl\xc3\xa9 (fatty) and two apple martinis.

S'Got the Wagyu tasting with 4 other brave souls who would go in on it with me.  I think it came with 5 cuts (prob about 1 lb per type - filet, ribeye, sirloin, short rib, etc.) and almost all the apps, sides, and desserts.  It was definitely not cheap (~$200pp), but in hindsight I think you could actually order that tasting for 2 people and then get 1-2 other entrees and basically share it with 4 or 5 other people.

S'A friend made reservations at Craftsteak for our group of seven and, after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, I was a little worried. Well, let me say that all of my concerns were unfounded. We were seated promptly, and the service was first rate. Our waiter was wonderful, and tended to our every need quickly and fully. We all ordered the 3 course Angus Beef dinner, and it was spectacular. The variety and quality of appetizers, side dishes, and deserts was awesome. The beef was mouth watering, and cooked to perfection. This dinner is not cheap (with wine and/or cocktails, about $200 to $250 per person), but worth it for a once a year special evening.'

S'Eventhough so many people gave this place good ratings... I would say that the complementary bread deserves the big HYPE for this restaurant.\n\nI went with a party of 6, which we all had very high expectations. The first let down was the atmosphere. The tables and chairs did not seem sturdy, I\'m sorry call me picky, but I feel like if a restaurant is going to charge me $50 for a rib eye steak then I need the tables dressed with white lining and the servers with white gloves on. \n\nThe bread made up for the Ikea furniture, as soon as the bread hits your mouth theres a buttery sweetness with a hint of salty, melts in your mouth and warm comfort goodness.\n\nI ordered the rib-eye with gratin potatoes with warm salad with bacon and egg. The salad was very good, unusual but delightful. The steak could have used alot more flavor and the potatoes was just okay (I\'ve had BETTER). The only other thing that stood out was the short ribs and the broccoli. There was another dish which I can\'t remember the name, but it was a rosotto like dish with brown rice, butternut squash, mushrooms and other components that I can not recollect. \n\nLastly, which may seem very trivial to everyone else but my party seem to take offense to it as well. One of our friends needed his food togo so the server took his plate to bag it up. To come back with a "THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU" bag (YES THE SAME BAG) any chinese fast food restaurant would give you for togo order. Then to add insult to injury the server sits his plastic bag which has his food in it ON THE FLOOR!!! We all had this "WTF" look on our face.\n\nThis would be my last time coming here, I rather go to Ruth\'s Chris any day.'

S"First off, I love this place.  I've eaten here a couple times which is saying a lot because I like to try new restaurants everytime I'm in Vegas.  For a restaurant to bring me back again is big.  The service staff at Craft is fantastic, from suggestions on entrees to wine pairings.  They are very knowledgable and attentive.  The tomato bread soup was the best I've had, and the steaks are high quality and cooked to perfection.  Everything was delicious down to the sides and desserts.  On the pricey side, but well worth it."

S'Wow, I was so disappointed. The service was 5 star, but the food was barely 3 star. The lobster bisque was great. The beet salad was not. It had a dressing that was... I guess olive oil, and not much else. There were little globs of something else that probably was supposed to add flavor (bright red in color), but didn\'t. The only flavorful moment was when one little leaf of anise flavored tarragon managed to work it\'s way into the mix. My filet was done to perfection and delicious, but the scallops were slightly over done. My husband\'s $56 ribeye was only about 3/4" thick and didn\'t taste as good as the supermarket cut we had barbequed ourselves last week. The risotto was delicious. The shiitake mushrooms didn\'t even look like shiitake. We come from Portland and eat wild shiitake all the time... The brussel sprouts were bitter and the bordelaise sauce was invisible. In summary: The meat was pretty good, but the side dishes were a total fail. \nI do have to compliment the service. It made the experience itself special, even if the food didn\'t. However, $100+ per person should include wonderful food. Next time we\'ll try Gordon Ramsey.'

S"The dinner was good but there are a few blemishes which knocked them down to average. For an expensive steakhouse like this, I expect good service and everything to be cooked to perfection.\n\nWe were promptly seated. I was drinking a house Pinot Noir which I started at the bar - $17/glass for Meomi which is a screw top bottle which can be purchased for $17/bottle outside of the restaurant. It was tasty, just surprising that they charge premium prices for a low end wine which doesn't even have a cork!\n\nStarters - I had the heirloom tomato salad which was divine, though it was drenched pretty heavily with olive oil. I scraped most of the oil off the tomatoes and thoroughly enjoyed the dish.  My companion had the cucumber spinach salad which he said was average - nothing special.  The bread was very good and tasted fresh baked out of the oven.\n\nEntrees - I had the filet mignon which was good, but surprisingly not stellar. I like my steaks to have a nicely seared outside with a medium rare center. The sear was not as good as I have had at other steak houses - but then I'm from Texas and we know how to do steaks right here. My companion had the salmon which he said was incredibly average. He regretted not ordering the steak.\n\nSides - All sides were served family-style with large portions for everyone to get their fill. The brussel sprouts were yummy and the risotto was fabulous. In fact, the risotto was the best thing we had. We also ordered the Hen of the Woods mushroom sides since neither of us had tried it before. I enjoyed it but my companion thought the taste was a little strong - I believe the preparation was done well, it was just personal preference. I wish I had tried the mushroom sampler instead but hindsight...  \n\nService - After appetizer plates were picked up, the new plates which were sat on the table for us were dirty - they actually had dried food on them!!!  We finally flagged the server and let him know and got new plates. I also sat for some time with an empty wine glass until we could flag our waiter.  Towards the end of the meal, our waiter just disappeared and then we were being served by another waiter who offered us dessert (we didn't have time or tummy room) and eventually brought us our check. I thought maybe our waiter left or something but I saw him waiting on other tables. Weird. Maybe he was embarrassed about the dirty plate thing? We weren't mean or anything, so I don't know.\n\nSo the meal was good, it just wasn't stellar and I don't think the food and service merit the hefty price tag. I don't mind paying for a good steak dinner, I just want to make sure I get value for what I'm paying. I don't think this restaurant *quite* cuts it, though the meal was tasty overall."

S"It pains me to write this review but it must be done.  I was so pumped about going to this restaurant while in Vegas unfortunately, it totally let me down.  We started with cocktails and salads.  I love a poached egg so I was excited to order the warm frisee salad.  It was just so so.  Next I ordered the sea scallops and brussel sprouts.  I know it is a steak house, but isnt like every restaurant in Vegas a type of steak house?  Therefore I had to stop eating steak at some point and try something else.  Can I say underwhelmed?  Lack flavor and just not worth the price tag.  My husband ordered the bison strip. It was eh, but the sauce was amazing.  Yum! I'd say the real star of the meal were the rolls they give you at the beginning of the meal!  I'd give it another try next time i'm in town because I love Tom Colicchio."

S"I was really disappointed by my experience at craftsteak.  Ate here with 5 of my dearest oldest friends for my bachelorette weekend.  Huge fan of top chef, and when I discovered tom collichio owned this place I just had to try it for our big saturday night meal.  We are all big foodies.  And no, I was not wearing a veil and tiara or any blinking jewelry.  We are all in our late 20s early 30s and were well behaved, at least til the end of the night when we had consumed several martinis and bottles of vino.  We may have been laughing loudly but we never got rowdy...and we were practically in a PDR for chrissake so I could've mooned the table next to me and only about a dozen or so people might see.  Not that I would.  Just sayin, we were hidden away.  All that being said...service was freaking awful.  Our server was an older gentleman, and he was downright rude.  If 18% gratuity had not been tacked on, I honestly might have gone 15% (which I NEVER do being a former server and bartender myself..I have maybe done this once in my life!).  I ordered the surf & turf - a splurge - but usually one of my favorite things to eat.   The filet was a tad undercooked for medium rare, but I kinda like it in between rare and med rare so it was fine by me.  One of my friends couldn't handle it!  The lobster was so rubbery and chewy and coldish and flavorless...did it come out of the fridge?   Side dishes bored me (and everyone).    My opening salad was good - but only because we shared a ton of starters and I mixed the mozzarella salad with the tomato salad to make my own caprese.  I think one of my friends enjoyed her short ribs.  Nobody raved about anything.  Except maybe the hot sticky buns that come out in the beginning.  Truly sad we did not enjoy it!  Should've eaten elsewhere.  Will not return."

S"Went here for a friends bday dinner. Service was great, shout out to Edgar and Justin, but the food was just ok. For appetizers we had lobster salad, shrimp cocktail, and the Bibb wedge. I think the appetizers were the best part of the meal. Lobster salad was delicious as was the Bibb. My friends each had the 18 oz ribeye while I had the 10 oz filet. We shared sides of risotto, eggplant, and mushrooms. The sides are definitely big enough to share. My steak was good, nothing memorable. My friends felt the same about their ribeyes. Risotto was on point though. And for dessert we had monkey bread, souffl\xc3\xa9, and we tried all the sorbets they had. Monkey bread was disappointing. Was way too sweet and trust me I love sweets but this was hard to eat. Souffl\xc3\xa9 was grainy we didn't even finish it, but the sorbets were nice and refreshing. Being a big fan of Tom Colicchio I guess I was just expecting more."

S"We were in Vegas for a friend's birthday and his wife had planned a great evening out for us one of the two nights we were there. Craftsteak was on her list, and I read some pretty awesome reviews so my expectations were pretty high...needless my expectations were never met.\n\nSO disappointing. First we made reservations, and I made the reservations. Due to our large group they have a policy (9 or more people) that we'd have to order some sort of set menu that was $110 per person and 18% gratuity is added automatically. Ridiculous...I always think it's the restaurants way of saying we know our waiters/waitresses are being tipped so it's ok to give you crappy service cause we know it's being paid. WELL, to avoid this, I booked up two tables, first, I didn't want everyone to HAVE to pay $110 (Which was close to what we paid anyway), to eat something they might not have choosen, AND I always think tipping should be according to service. I use to be a waitress, I tip accordingly..if it's fantastic 20%, if it's ok 10% etc etc...\n\nFirst we had reservations, but we still had to wait over 30 mins for our table, meanwhile they sat a table of 8 ladies moment before we were supposed to sit down. I had us sitting at a table of 6 and 7....not even an apology was given that they didn't have our table ready...and now we were all sitting together so again they have their 18% gratuity included.\n\nEverything was a la carte, which most restaurants like this usually are. I must say the sides I did try and the ones I didn't I heard were great. The asparagus was grilled perfectly. Not too soft, not too crunchy, and the perfect char on them. The mushrooms were awesome, but you can't screw up mushrooms really. Potatoes and sweet potatoes were great, from what I heard. \n\nOK - So bf ordered the bison steak, which is what I wanted but since I like to sample lots of things and bf knows he'll be eating half of my meal we decided not to order the same thing. I went with surf and turf..6 ounce filet mignon and half lobster tail. The lobster WAS delicious...the filet wasn't even cooked correctly. I always order medium rare...half of it was medium, and the other half was somewhere between medium and medium rare. I don't think they even SEASONED the steak. It just tasted like a piece of meat..no melting in your mouth, no flavourful bite, nothing. Bf's bison however...that WAS great. Cooked perfectly and accompanied with some delicious red sauce, a little sweetness to it with a little tang, along side another small dip...great. \n\nWe had some martinis, those were delicious..similar to a chambourg martini, with one more ingredient.\n\nSomeone else had the braised short ribs, and those were done well..but anything you braise for 24 hours will be fall off the bone delicious. Food was ok, not the best I've had, and certainly didn't live up to it's expectations....\n\nIt was packed, no doubt due to the name and Tom Colicchio being a judge on Top Chef..but for someone who made reservations two days ahead of time, and they didn't have our tables prepared...without even some complimentary drinks or BREAD for our 35, almost 45 min wait was extrememly disappointing of a five star restaurant...\n\nThis is a place you pay for service, and we certainly didn't get it...The waiter..he was the only saving grace of this place. He was awesome. I'll never go there again..for a great steak a fraction of the cost I'd even rather go to the Keg...at least they can cook a steak point on each time.....\n\nOh and ps. For the two birthdays we had and let them know..not even a whole piece of cake...just three itsy bitsy pieces of dessert. One small tiny square of what tasted like a skor bar, one small little cookie the size of a quarter, and some candied fruit thing that was gross...not even a nice piece of chocolate cake or something...thanks Craftsteak...we certainly won't go there again..."

S"Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.........\n\nI had the most scrumptious Valentine's Day of my life.  Craftsteak definitely delivered on its Yelp rating.\n\nWe arrived on time and were seated immediately in a little screened in booth. All of the ladies were given a rose that evening.  :0) \nThere was plenty of room for the four of us, and we were served immediately by our two waiters, Kevin and Robert.  \n\nThey were fantastic, really knew their stuff, and were even able to teach me a thing or two about beef!  And I have watched about 4,000 hours of foodtv.  We wrote a note to the management about how wonderful Kevin was, he really knew how to sell and treated us all to impeccable service.\n\nWe ordered their current special, the tasting menu, but as far as tasting menus go this was fantastic.  We didn't have to choose one item per course, it was served family style and we were able to sample everything off of the menu for $60 per person.  What a flippin' deal.\n\nWe had roasted red peppers, beet salad, a green salad, as well as quail to start.  The sides came out, yukon gold mashed potatoes that were almost liquidy they were so smooth, shitake mushrooms, and bacon brussell sprouts.  Then we had skirt steak, flatiron steak, diver sea scallops, and we ordered an additional pot of short ribs to share.  THESE WERE AMAZING. I would swim in the short ribs if I could... but I can't so I just had to settle with eating too much.\n\nDessert was also incredible, served with sides of home-made ice cream.  The liquid chocolate cake was by far my favorite... served with coffee ice cream.\n\nWOW.  Get here any way you can and bring an empty stomach.  You are going to need it for those short ribs."

S"My fiance is a HUGE red meat fan since he is from Omaha.  So I sent him a list of steakhouses he wanted to go to while in Vegas.  He chose Craftsteak seeing as he had already been to Cut in LA.  We sat down for dinner and the customer service was on point.  The waiters were beyond helpful.  My fiance and I decided to split the meal since we had a large lunch earlier in the day.  So I took a look at the menu and immediately honed in on the lobster bisque.  We ordered that up as well as the T bone, shitake mushrooms, and yukon gold potato puree with chives.  The restaurant kindly split our meal for us at no extra charge.  The bisque came out pipin' hot and had large chunks of lobster in it.  There was no skimpin' involved.  Following the bique was our entree.  It was soo freakin' good and couldn't even finish all of it.  The staff packed up our little doggy bag.  After dinner the man and I went out for drinks and strolled in around 3am.  I start to get ready for bed and discover my fiance had devoured all the leftovers.  Now I know never leave him alone with a steak dinner doggy bag."

We got the Ka show and dinner menu with the wine pairing ($20 extra per). There was so much food, to be shared family style, that we couldn\'t finish it all( a first). The chicken was a little overcooked, but the rest of the meal made up for it.  My GF usually hates scallops, but their seadive scallops won her over. "I never knew they could taste like this" was her exclamation. In short, the dishes were delicious.\n\nThe decor was warm and inviting.  The service was on point, very helpful.

S"Tom, this was a hard decision to make. You left me at a 3.5 but since yelp saved you with a 4. Meat? Delicious. We both had the American wagyu to celebrate and my god, that skirt was the best compromise of quality and price ever. Fantastic at every bite, you could feel the marbled fat melt into tender, buttery meat. Foodgasm that brough silence to the table. The ribeye (which was double the price) was delicious but lost out some of it's flavor due to the fact that it was just sooooo thick. That cut was close to 3 inches thick and made it hard to be a consistent medium all around. \n\nMussels were good although I wish there was spoons to taste the rich wine broth. The risotto we ordered as a side went untouched once the steak got here- flavorful and buttery but forgettable even with chunks of bacon inside. \n\nThe service was pretty perfunctory, it wasn't that they didn't try to stop by but it felt rushed and a little insincere since there were just so many other tables they had to pay attention to. There was also a fly that kept visiting our table- when you're dropping over $300 on a meal, you shouldn't be waving flies away. \n\nThe atmosphere and logistics was what failed the most here though. The LA Craft is romantic, with beautiful layout, quiet atmosphere and amazing service. The tables here are so close, I had to tuck my purse in close next to me so it wouldn't touch the man in the booth next to me. You had trouble getting in and out of inside seats for fear you would brush up against people's dinner plates. The worse were the lounge style dinner tables right out by the front. Total failure of keeping that upscale feel when you feel like you're being packed in like money sardines. If they could give me the LA feel with that delicious wagyu, I'm all Tom's."

S'In this all american steakhouse we ordered filets that cost more than a full tank of gas on an escalade.  Despite sitting at the bar, however, the ambiance was perfect with low lighting, fresh baked breads, and very curteous staff.\nThe food is the average american fare of steaks, sea food, and salads; prepared with simple ingredients, served a la carte, at not so simple prices.  One filet and one steak, asparagus and garlic potatoes au gratin on the side, chased down by two jack daniels and a coke: $175.00.  Good food, but not worth the price.'

S"made reservations for 5:15pm (the earliest they could seat you) because we had to catch a 7:30pm show in new york new york. \n\nThey seated us right away and we were given a menu. We ordered the prosciutto ($14) for appetizer, which was basically a ginormous plate full of proscuitto slices. For some reason I thought it was going to be served with something else, not just plain prosciutto. However, it was the best tasting prosciutto I had in my life, recalling back to the taste of fresh ham from my childhood in Bolivia, though thinner and chewier, and possibly fresher. \n\nentree: I ordered the bison ($39), and my bf ordered the kobe flat iron steak ($58, if i remember correctly). The bison was tastier than beef. I chose it because I read it on yelp somewhere that bison is just really good. I thought I'd try it at Tom's restaurant so I could blame him if it sucked. It didn't. It was juicy, tender, lean, and it had a kick to it. My bf's kobe was a hit. He said that it doesn't hit you (how good it is) until you're about to swallow. I'd say the taste and texture of kobe definitely develops as you chew it. Perhaps next time, we can try the wagyu (still have yet to try it).\n\nFor sides, we got the yukon mashed potatoes ($11), and the asparagus ($11). Next time, I'd just get the mashed potatoes and save myself an extra $11. The asparagus was great, too, but it wasn't to die for like the prosciutto or the mashed potatoes (which also tasted like my childhood mashed potatoes that were made with fresh cow milk and loads of butter).\n\nOur server asked us what kind of wine, if any, we would like to pair with our steak. I asked him what went well with bison, since I never had it before. He suggested the pinot noir. I personally like zinfandel with everything so he gave me samples of each to taste (I chose the zinfandel, $17). My bf sampled the merlot and the shiraz and went with the shiraz ($18). \n\nThe total bill was $204, tax & tip included.\n\nthe experience? priceless. I'd say this is the best steak house we've gone to so far. \n\nThe only pet peeve I have is eating a steak that gets colder and colder as you eat. I'm sure there is SOME way to combat that, considering that some steakhouses serve your steak on 500 degree plates or cast iron skillets that are still hot. \n\nWe told our server that we had a show to catch and we were out by 6:45pm. However, the wait time for our food was about 45 minutes. We're not the most patient people but I think this is somehow normal in vegas.\n\nI'd totally go back, and with more money next time."

Excellent and extensive wine list.  The porterhouse for two  was cooked perfectly. And as a side to the steak we had the potato puree. I could drink that stuff straight.

But being a fan of Top Chef, I figured I gotta see what's up w/ Colicchio (sp?).\n\nLuckily we were there for Restaurant Week so we did their special menu that came with a bunch of sides and 3 different cuts of steak.  We also ordered their yukon gold puree w/ truffle oil.  Can't go wrong with that - 2 of my favs yukon gold & truffle oil in one dish?!  More please!  :)\n\nEverything was good, including the steak.  I guess I was expecting GREAT steak and so was a little disappointed.  I must say the portions were good and everything was definitely worth the price (mind you, it was a discounted price for restaurant week).  Other than the puree, nothing exceptionally special.

S'I know there are a lot of restaurants in Vegas that might draw you in.. but if you are near the MGM.. you MUST eat at CraftSteak! \nI went recently with a friend who shares the same love of food as I do..we literally grilled our poor servers with questions like, "Okay, seriously..what should we get? Whats the best steak? Best potatoes? Whats your favorite"\n\nAfter careful consideration, this is what we ate(and if you go..I recommend it all):\n* I should also note that we shared it all.. including the steak..which was a good call since there were so many things on the menu that looked delicious)\n\n-Lobster Bisque-  really tasty.. not too salty.. nice pieces of lobster.. Creamy but not overly heavy.\n-Arugula salad- waiter recommended the heirloom tomatoes but since we live in California and get them all the time we chose this.  Good salad. nothing special but a nice way to break up the heaviness of.......\n-Domestic Wagyu skirt steak..  Amazing. perfectly cooked( we got it medium per the waiters recommendation.. the steak was so tender and marbled it helped keep it together and gave it a nice crust- still very pink inside) The steak had a light sprinkling of sea salt and came already sliced in a jus that was to.die.for.\n-potato puree- really.. dont even look at the other starch options. Just get this.. trust me it will be the best potatoes you\'ve ever had.\n-Brentwood corn- I couldn\'t get enough of this! Someone else\'s review called it \'crack corn\' and I totally agree.\n-Monkey Bread- Oh yes.. we saved room for dessert and this was worth every bite. In case your not familiar with Monkey Bread( which you can find in the frozen section of Ralphs/vons) Its basically..gooey bread covered with a buttery cinnamon-y caramel sauce.. kinda like a cinnamon roll with out the frosting.. but not really. hmmm..  its just good and you should get it!\n -As for drinks I had 2 glasses of wine.. which the sommelier will gladly pair with you meal.. and my friend had 2 cocktails. Total our bill was a little over 200.. Totally reasonable for a memorable meal like this.. plus we got a lot! The portions are generous and very sharable.\n- I would also note that the wine list was very extensive and well-rounded... everything from 1982 Chateau Margaux to a 40 dollar bottle of Mendoza malbec.. something for everyone!\nService was excellent..ambiance was great..bathrooms were clean...Not pretentious but still classy and special..\nHope you stop in and enjoy as much as we did!'

S"Since we didn't hit Craftsteak on our last trip to Vegas, I made a point to eat here this time. No tasting menu this time now that my husband and I have lost 120lbs together and are just eating differently. So, we were a tad more conservative, but still splurged and left with our bellies full. \n\nWe split the lobster bisque to start, which was good, but cannot compare to Kokomo's (which is now closed to make room for Tom's Heritage Steak BOO). I didn't like the large pieces of tarragon on top, which feels like chewing on pieces of grass, but it was tolerable. The lobster was nice and tender.\n\nFor dinner we split the 10oz filet, the potato puree and the risotto.  This was still so much food! The risotto was made with butternut squash and prosciutto and was so rich and creamy and really wonderful. I know this is what properly made risotto tastes like and how easy it can be to get it wrong.  The puree and filet were absolute heaven.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake and I was pretty disappointed. It was a small circle of mushy pumpkin with a vanilla cream of some kind on top of it. I hate to say it, but Cheesecake Factory cheescake was better than this stuff. Major bummer, thus the deletion of a star. When you pay $15 for dessert at a place like this, you want to shove your face it in and eat 15 of them, not just pick at it and wish it were more like at a chain where you hate their food."

S"This is one of the best restaurants we've ever been too. The service was excellent and so was the food. We had the surf and turf. My wife had the steak and lobster and I had the steak and diver scallops which were the best scallops I've ever had. We had the scalloped potatoes and the brussel sprouts which were great too. And don't miss the lobster bisque. There must have been a 1/4lb lobster in there. We were a little disapointed to here that Tom  Colichio has not been there in awhile though. The wine was great too."

S"The decor of the restaurant was unusual resembling a modern barn.  The service was excellent.  We ordered a calamari appetizer which was the worst that I have ever tasted.  Each Calamari was stuffed and as I cut into it, the stuffing would escape through the small orifice.  It looked unappealing and tasted worse.  I asked to send it back and the server explained she didn't think I was going to like it as it is often sent back.  The main courses were awesome.  The steaks were prepared as we asked and tasted great.  I would say overall I was expecting more because of the name."

We had diver scallops, arugula & pecorino salad, proscuitto San Daniele, grilled Pacific prawns, shortribs, the flat iron steak, roasted free range chicken, pureed potatoes, asparagus, shitake mushrooms and carrots. Everything was delicious and a month later we are still getting thanks for such a wonderful dinner. Next time we are in Vegas we will be sure to visit again. The only complaint I have is that while the rest of the restaurant's decor is nice, the private rooms are a bit bland."

S"I have to say that my expectations for Crafteak were very high after reading the yelp reviews and the menu. We ordered the summer tasting menu, which I probably won't do next time because I really wanted to try the short ribs. First off, the ambiance and the service is excellent. For starters we had buffalo mozzarella, quail, fennel salad and a persian cucumber salad. Everything was great except for the cucumber salad which was way too salty (we couldn't even eat it).  For the main we had the diver scallops, skirt steak, and the flatiron steak. I ate both scallops since BF doesn't like them - the first one was okay..but the second was gritty. Now, I should have sent it back I know..but I am always reluctant to do so.  So, that was a big disappointment..it ruined the flavor. The steak was very good, a lot of thyme in both marinades.  The skirt steak is a chewier cut of meat and I would never order it a la carte.  The sides were amazing!!!!!!!  The corn was so good and so was were the mushrooms and yukon gold mash. A vegetarian would be in heaven here. Seriously...I am a serious carnivore..but the corn was the best thing on the menu. \n\nThe dessert was some of the best I have ever had - blueberry cheese cake and chocolate lava cake with fresh mint ice cream. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. My BF is a cheesecake fanatic and said it was the absolute best he had every had. \n\nBasically, Craftsteak loses one star for the gritty scallop and lackluster-oversalted starters. I would definitely go back since some of the dishes were absolutely amazing as well as the service and ambiance."

S"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday in January 2012. We're big fans of Top Chef, so expectations were high. We ended up ordering the Chef's selection, which includes an appetizer course, main course, and desert course. It was a TON of food. Quantity was not an issue here.  What we got:\n\nAppetizers\n1. Lobster bisque \n2. Shrimp cocktail\n3. Casear salad \n4. Wild arugula salad\nMain course\n1. Three steaks (NY Strip, Filet Mignon, Porterhouse)\n2. Sides (potato puree, mushrooms)\nDeserts\n1. Cinnamon Monkey Bread\n(there might have been another desert, but I forget... I was in a food coma by this point).\n\nThe appetizers, sides and deserts all deserve 5 stars (the lobster bisque is one of the best I've had). Ironically, the steak was the weakest point of the dinner. We asked for medium and the filet mignon was more like well done. The NY strip and porterhouse were better than the filet, but they were just ok. I've had much better steak at other restaurants. BTW, I also recommend the cocktails. They're very good.\n\nOverall, an excellent dinner and restaurant. However, given the issue with the steak, I can only give Craftsteak 4 stars. Sorry Tom."

S'Ya, not so much. \n\nI visited Craftsteak for a birthday dinner. There were three of us at the table on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was busy but by no means "Vegas busy". We were seated promptly for our 7:30 reservation and greeted by one waiter and then another telling us that they would both be assisting us that evening. I was impressed!.....but then that was it. Our waiters went totally AWOL after taking our drink orders. After checking back with us 10 minutes later we were finally able to order. I waited 25 minutes for my (cold) salad to arrive to the table. Making the total time we waited for our food about 40 minutes (3 med rare steaks, 2 sides). The timing was obscene! AND when our food came the waiter(s) still never checked back with us. The most attentive person in the entire place was the bus boy (I wish I could have tipped him and left our waiters a goose egg). \n\nAs for the food, it left much to be desired. I had the filet ($58) and it tasted like a $20 steak you\'d get at any restaurant, anywhere, ever. The other steaks were just as disappointing. The BEST menu item is the free bread.\n\nWe did tell the manager how disappointed we were in the service. Whether she did anything or not, I\'m not sure but I\'d like to hope she did and that the service will improv.\n\nSKIP CRAFTSTEAK (Unless the food and service dramatically improve.)'

S"There is a god, and shim resides in the culinary wonders that come out of the kitchen of Craftsteak. I had their Kobe tasting menu, and I barely made it to the Kobe part of the meal! Each course came with 3-4 different items, each better than the one before. With only two of us eating all of this food, it was one hell of a heavenly chore.\n\nStandout parts of the tasting menu were the beet salad, the wild mushrooms, and both kobe dishes. my dining parter sure seemed to enjoy the chocolate dessert at the end as well, but since I'm not much of a chocolate fan, I stuck with the decadent berry cobbler and sorbets.\n\nI will definitely be going back to Craftsteak.

The side dishes were very noteworthy as well. Particularly a corn which was carmelized so perfectly, it could have passed for a dessert!  Speaking of dessert, the choices were nice, but I would rather eat a few more of the AMAZING dinner rolls. \n\nPricey is a matter of opinion.  You dont eat a meal like this often so go ahead, splurge on the tasting menu. It's the best value on the menu and you won't be let down!"

S"This review is for the Vegas Uncorked Mother's Day Brunch.  \n\nI arrived about 25 minutes early and there was already a line almost back to the casino floor.  While we were waiting they passed out Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's.  Definitely a nice way to pass the time.  When we were seated, Food Writer Alan Richman and Chef Tom Colicchio spoke about Mother's Day and the changing face of hunger in America.  It was quite special and moving to see these esteemed professionals share such an important message. \nNow onto the food:\n\n1st Course:\nScones with Creme Fraiche and Market Preserves.  The Scones were so good I finished mine without putting anything on them!\n\nSeasonal Fresh Fruit.  A nice selection of Melons, Berries and Pineapple.\n\nPickled Farm Egg with Roasted Beets, White Anchovy.  Never thought I'd like this, but the combination of flavors was just fantastic!\n\nChilled Maine Lobster and Artichoke Salad.  I KNEW I' d like this one and I Loved it!\n\nWild Arugula with Shaved Pecorino.Standard Salad, but the cheese took it to another level.\n\nHouse Made Porchetta with Mustard Fruits. Wonderfully rich and fatty with a contrasting sweetness from the fruit.\n\n2nd Course\nBelgian Waffle with Warm Fruit Compote.  My least favorite dish of the meal.\n\nSous Vide Eggs, Asparagus, Morels, Ramps.  Stunningly delicious.  The Morels were absolutely fantastic!\n\nWagyu Skirt Steak, Salsa Verde.  Tender and Flavorful.\n\nBraised Kubuta Pork Belly.  Best Pork dish I have ever had!  It almost brought a tear to my eye.\n\nCreamed Spinach Gratin.  Just OK.\n\nDesserts(So full I only tried two.)\nFrozen Chocolate Souffle.  Rich, Creamy, Chocolatey. YUM!\n\nLemon Verbena Pavlova, Strawberry Sorbet. Light crispy shell, sorbet tasted just like fresh strawberries.\n\nThis was a fantastic dining experience. The restaurant is wheelchair accessible and based on the quality of the food and service, I will definitely return for dinner in the future."

S'I apologize in advance for gushing...but I likely won\'t be able to help myself.  The meal I had at craftsteak last week was one of my top five meals ever...easily...and it was Vegas Restaurant Week.  \n\nCollicchio\'s menu had it goin\' on.  The best part was that there was no choice involved because you were served EVERYTHING on the special menu.   A first course of roasted red peppers, arugula and some of the best prosciutto ever cured was paired with a delightful sparkling rose.  The main course was a trio of kobe beef sirloin, tender roasted chicken, and grilled diver scallops accompanied by yukon gold whipped potatoes (yum!), roasted sweet corn and sauteed shitake mushrooms and served with a perfect shiraz that surprisingly paired perfectly with each component.  The dessert was spectacular...and I am not usually a huge fan of sweet things.  Pineapple sorbet, mint chocolate chip ice cream, chunks of cantaloupe and pineapple, chocolate molten cake, and (my favorite) sweet monkey bread with a light caramel dipping sauce.  This course was paired with a lovely sparkling muscat.   W-O-W!\n\nAnd wimpy portions these were not.  All courses were served family style and with just me and my fiance eating, we had plenty left over.  In explaining how full we were to his best friend he said, "I left meat on my plate."  If you knew him you would understand that this has likely never happened!\n\nOf course we did make the mistake of arriving early to sit at the bar and enjoy some appetizers.  The grilled Hawaiian shrimp were fabulous!  We also tried the kobe beef tartare, which was ok, but didn\'t blow us away.  The consistency was pate-like and I think we were both expecting chunks.   For two cocktails and two appetizers we ended up spending more than it was for one person to enjoy all of the aforementioned food and wine pairings.  The bar bill was $90 with tip, but the full menu was $50.07 plus $20.00 for the wine...a true steal!\n\nI can\'t say enough about the service at craftsteak, either.  Fabulous!  The servers, bartenders, and hostesses alike were all informative, professional, relaxed, and definitely not stuffy.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and very classy. \n\nLovely...super...totally worth it!  The regular menu is definitely pricey, so try to hit one of these deals or eat an appetizer somewhere else beforehand if you don\'t want to splurge.  If you do, go for it and enjoy!'

S"Visited on a Saturday night and was seated promptly.\n\nMy brother and I went for the prie fix menus with the Kobe rib-eye and flank with mushrooms, yukon gold potatoes, and asparagus. The dinner also came with prawns for appetizers and 4 sorbets/liquid chocolate cake for dessert.\n\nThe food was great. Very well seasoned so I didn't need to add anything, which is rare. The appetizers were simple but tasty. The meat was perfectly med-rare-med. Both the rib-eye and flank were excellent and were like butter. The sides were tasty as well. The potato puree was awesome and balanced out the meat well. Dessert took some effort after a big meal but it was really good. The sorbet assortment were refreshing and the liquid chocolate cake and creme brulee were ridiculous caloric intake but worth it.\n\nThe service at Craft stood out to me. Our server's name was Kevin and couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. The staff was very professional and knew what they were doing leading to seamless transitions between courses. Amazingly polite and didn't rush anybody to finish and get the hell out. We got to relax and enjoy it all.\n\nGreat eating experience from the food to the service to the decor.

Good wine selection.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving it a fifth star is the atmosphere. It's not an inexpensive place and the atmosphere strikes me as a little too well lit and just not as intimate as I would prefer. I understand it's in the MGM and set up to serve a lot of people, but I think the decor and atmosphere could have been done better.  It's still good enough that we regularly go back though."

S'Boyfriend & I had dinner here on a Friday night.. We started with Chilled Shrimp Cocktail and baby artichoke salad. For the main course he ordered the 10 oz. Filet Mignon /Diver Sea Scallops and sauteed spinach , and I had the halfsteak 6 oz. Angus skirt steak (which came w/ two "half" sides), Baby Shiitake Mushrooms, corn, and can\'t forget the wine... a nice bottle of Susan Balbo malbec. \n\nFirst off, we would have never chose this place if it weren\'t for the $100 credit... with that being said I\'ll start this lovely review!\n\nCraftsteak is a pretty trendy looking place, nice big bar and lounge area to hang out in. Servers are very nice, only complaint is that we had to refill our wine once ourselves, no biggie. The bread is SO GOOD. It\'s freshly baked w/ sea salt on top, it doesn\'t dissapoint! Shrimp cocktail was good, artichoke salad was great. I\'ve never had anything like it and was very satisfied. Boyfriend\'s filet was ok, scallops were better, spinach was nothing special. My halfsteak was more like a full steak! Corn was delicious, mushrooms were not. For dessert we had the crunchy rice pudding (think rice pudding in fried pastry) w/ pineapples on the side. YUMMY. At this point our bellies were very full. Bill came out to around $250 w/ tip. \n\nWould we come back? Probably if we were ever in MGM again (highly unlikely.. I hate MGM =/).

S'Maybe my review is biased because I received 30% off of my bill, but I think I still would have given it 5 stars even without the AWESOME discount!\n\nWhile in Vegas my boyfriend and I were treated to a freaking VIP experience. They seated us in this amazing booth and the manager and chef came out to welcome and greet us. The chef had prepared a tasting menu for us, and we really felt like royalty. It was pretty crazy. I\'ve literally never had so many people waiting on me (and this is a steakhouse... not The French Laundry or anything). \n\nOur tasting menu consisted of the biggest damn "tastes" ever. One of our waiters even told us we were being served the half-portion. I can\'t even imagine what a whole portion looked like!! \n\nOkay... so here\'s what our tasting menu included:\n\nAppetizers:\n1. Baby beets and pickled egg (I don\'t like beets OR pickled egg, but yes... this was pretty good)\n2. Italian Buffalo Mozzarella (Hello Heaven)\n3. Vermont Quail with kumquats (I could have left happy with only this)\n4. Arugula & shaved pecorino (sort of forgettable, but tasty)\n\nMain Course:\n1. Filet Mignon (Melt in your mouth insanity)\n2. Angus Flatiron (Mmmmmm)\n3. Japanese A5 Waygu Beef (Seriously the best piece of meat I have ever consumed in my entire existence on this place that we call earth)\n4. Maine Lobster\n\nSides:\n1. Yukon Gold Puree (The softest, most decadent, buttery mashed potatoes you will ever encounter)\n2. Italian Kale and Smoked Bacon (Not the most memorable dish of the night, but definitely nice)\n\nDesserts:\nNow, at this point we were both beyond full. As I said, this tasting menu was nothing like a tasting menu. This meal could have easily fed a whole family. But of course they insisted that we try their dessert selection, and they brought out no less than 6 desserts for 2 people to eat... insanity!!!!!! These insane plates included:\n1. Butterscotch Mousse with Brown Sugar Meringue & Pecan Praline Cookies\n2. Cinnamon Monkey Bread with Pecan Toffee & Banana Brown Sugar Ice Cream- THIS ONE WAS THE BESTTTTTT\n3. Chocolate Ganache Cake with Cocoa Nib Brittle & Sweet Cream\n4. Warm Apple Tarte Tatin with Spiced Streusel & Vanilla Bean Ice Cream\n5. Chocolate Souffl\xc3\xa9 with Hot Fudge Sauce & Sicilian Pistachio Ice Cream\n6. Ice Cream/Sorbet Tasting plate with the following flavors: Vanilla Bean, Milk Chocolate Malt, Sicilian Pistachio, Orange Basil, Cabernet/Syrah Grape, and Grapefruit\n\nOkay... so if you count all of that up, my boyfriend and I were served a grand total of 16 plates, all of which were delicious and different than anything I\'ve ever had at any other steakhouse. Tom Collichio, sir, you have made me a very happy girl with your gargantuan portions and your stellar staff/selection of food.'

S"It is with a heavy heart that I give Craftsteak two stars.  Part of it was expectations, and part of it is the actual experience.\n\nExpectations: Top-notch service, tasty food, atmosphere, advice on wine.\n\nExpectations met on... atmosphere and wine.  The Malbec that the sommelier recommended was really and truly delicious.  \n\nExpectations not met on... service or food.  The appetizers (scallops!) and the lobster were fantastic, but this is Craftsteak.  I expected out-of-this-world steak, and we were sorely disappointed.  The ribeye we got must've been a bad cut, because the best word I can think of is 'grisly.'  Points to the staff because when we mentioned it, they did take a little off the bill.  I would've rather gotten a bite of good ribeye, but whatevs.\n\nThe dessert was awesome.  If I go again, I'll have an appetizer and dessert!\n\nThe service started out like any high-end dining experience, but then things got weird.  We got a sort of family style four-course meal that included multiple appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts.  It's a little annoying to have three entrees brought out at once - for two people.  We couldn't possibly eat everything while it was hot, so that was LAME.  We felt this way on every course - we couldn't enjoy and take our time, we had to stuff our face before stuff got cold.  Our server also mysteriously disappeared after the orders were taken until the meal was over.  \n\nWe actually refilled our own wine glasses.  After waiting about 10 minutes to see if the server would be back (as expected at high-end places, or am I off-base?).  When they were nowhere to be found, we took matters into our own hands.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon - there are so many great restaurants in Vegas!  I would skip Craftsteak."

S"Always nice to spend anniversary dinners at nice Vegas restaurant.\n\nFor 200 bucks, I think I got a great meal. We were planning to get the tasting menu before we got to Vegas, but my friend and her bf went the day before us and didnt like it at all. So we went for the straight menu, our server Wallace (i think thats his name) was great. Also he introduced us to this Malbec that went so well with our meaty dinner!\n\nWe started off with the Wagu Steak Tartare, my first time trying meat tartare. WOW it was soooo good, and they give you a generous amount! My gf got the Surf and Turf, filet mignon and diver sea scallops. OMG she fell in love with the scallops. I got the rib eye that was cooked perfectly, with a side of asparagus that was nicely seasoned. I was so stuffed that I took half my meat back to the hotel. They also give you these personal sized A1 sauce. They gave us these little treats for our Anniversary + our sorbet desserts. Made us happy campers!\n\nWhat an awesome dinner! Me and my gf have been 2 for 2 now on anniversary dinners in Vegas. I think the only reason I didnt give this place a 5 star is that they had served some people who literally looked like they came out of the pool area with their board shorts and drinks in hand. That kind of makes the place seems a bit tacky. \n\nI was pleased at the food though, atleast I can say I ate at a top chef judge's restaurant. Tom gets a thumbs up!"

S"Craftsteak is a nice place to relax with its amber, gold, and brown colored interior. They even had wine flasks lined up along the wall, and a huge painting on the wall that sort of looked like a meteor shower falling into a lake. Of course, this place is a steak house....Unfortunately, I was not able to try the steak here, since I gave up meat for Lent. However, I did order the salmon, and it was very good. The skin was left on, which was lightly crisped, and lemon juice was drizzled all over the salmon. For sides, my friends and I ordered baby spinach, the mashed potatoes, french fries, and mushrooms (Roasted Hen of the Woods, which was VERY GOOD!). The sides were about $11 each, but big enough to share. My friends ordered the Rib Eye, the Filet Mignon, and the Porterhouse. All of them raved about it! \n\nAgain, this restaurant was comped, so my friends and I decided to eat to our heart's delight! Expect to pay about $50+ for an entree. I will be back for the steak..."

S'I was very impressed with this place. I have been to a lot of high end restaurants in Las Vegas and this one is on my list. The mixed drinks are great and the wine list is extensive. However, it is the first place that I have ever "dismissed" a Somelier. My family was shocked. The guy was a jerk.  There is a girl Somelier who is much better.

S'One of the best meals I\'ve had for a weekend of xs (the whole city is excessively fun...). Service was exquisite and so was the food.\n\nThe sommelier introduced himself, who was very helpful in our wine selection. We had a 2004 Chateauneuf du Pape, which was an outstanding choice and would highly recommend ($90).\n\nThe butter rolls arrived, and like all the other yelpers have raved, it was so good. They come in a batch of six, and by the time we had finished 4, another set had come. Great service.\n\nApps - We had the Seafood Platter and Kobe Beef Tartare. The seafood platter was delicious, comprised of oysters, clams, prawn, lobster, seaweed salad, alaskan king crab, and caviar. One person in the party said the only problem with this platter "was that it wasn\'t bigger." This seafood app blows Mastro\'s out of the water (seafood lives in water....). The beef tartare was equally amazing, which was raw kobe beef with a raw egg on top, served with miniature bread pieces. The tartare prepared us well for the main course ahead.\n\nThe Main Course - 16oz. Grilled RIbeye steak, charred rare. The steak was perfectly marbled, with a high fat content, which ribeyes should have. Cooked perfectly. I also got to sample my friends\' grilled NY Strip and Wagyu Ribeye. All were delectable, and was able to distinguish the varying textures of the cuts.\n\nSides - Bean Sprouts, Hen of the Woods Mushrooms, and Yukon Gold Puree. Bean Sprouts were interesting in a good way. Paired with bacon, the sprouts were well prepared with a great texture. The Hen of the Woods (I\'m told this is a Colicchio signature dish) were interesting as well. It didn\'t blow everything out of the water, but it was very good, with a good texture. I love mushrooms, and this was like nothing I\'ve ever had before. The Yukon Gold Puree was a very buttery bowl of mashed potatoes, prepared thinner than regular mashed potatoes. It was awesome.\n\nDidn\'t get to dessert because 1) I don\'t like dessert (I\'d rather have more steak) and 2) was very full.\n\nWent for halloween weekend, but the candy wasn\'t just for trick or treaters. There was plenty of eye candy as well ;) It was funny seeing a  cow walk into a steakhouse.'

S"Ok, as a Top Chef fan, I wasn't going to not stop by Tom's place while in LV!\n\nLet me preface by saying I read all the reviews on here before I went...so this is why the first thing I immediately ordered was the Lobster Bisque as my First Course.\n\nWhile delicious, the serving of bisque is ENORMOUS, and soooo rich.  I should have stopped about 1/2 way through, but because of the intoxicating flavor I couldn't.  While I sipped my wine waiting for the meat course, and anxiously awaiting the yummy tenderness of the Waygu Skirt Steak...I felt my tummy start to turn.  Then, I felt it start to do flip-flops.  Uh-oh, the creamed soup had reared its ugly head.\n\nI ate about 5 slices of the yummy steak and about 2 forkfulls of the creamy yukon gold potatoes before I just couldn't eat another bite.  I was officially sick to my stomach.  I took a couple trips to the restroom, but just couldn't shake it.\n\nWe left without dessert (WAH!) and spent the rest of the night in our hotel room regretting the bisque. And paying $250 for a dinner we could barely eat. \n\n I'm sure it would have been great if I just hadn't eaten that bisque."

S"I have been here on 2 separate occasions. The first was to have a dining experience and to be honest I was not impressed at all. We had a reservation and ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes for our table. That drives me crazy and is usually a bad sign.\n\nIt took a while to get our wine and place our order. I really don't feel that it was that busy. Here is a list of the items ordered:\n\nApps: Calamari Chorizo, Polenta, Arugula, Hand-cut Wagyu Tartare* Crostini\n\nSalad: Italian Buffalo Mozzarella Hazelnuts, Warm Fris\xc3\xa9e* Farm Egg, Smoked Bacon\n\nEntrees: 8 oz. New York Strip, Japan, 24 hour Shortrib Cipollini Onion\n\nSides: Braised Kale Bacon, White Beans, Bordelaise, Potato Gratin Roasted Garlic Cream\n\nDesserts: Peanut Butter Mousse and Clemence Pie\n\nIt took a wile to get our food and the food was just okay. Nothing stood out at me as amazing. I was expecting a lot more from this place. \n\nMy second visit was just for drinks. I was happy to just get to the bar. I ordered the Key Lime Martini and Cucumber Gin Martini. Both were really good and I would definitely return back for drinks, food probably not."

S"As a fan of Tom Colicchio from Top Chef I really wanted to love this place.  Today's rating reflects the disappointment I felt. The rating is also based upon a comparison with comprable restaurants as Craftsteak would get five stars if I compared it to Sizzler. (sorry all you sizzler fans)\n\nI expected an overpriced steak house so the three rating is not a reflection of price so much as it is of value.  For instance, I have had 5 star experiences at Hank's and Delmonicos.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, I was disappointed.  While I expected a somewhat less glitzy environment, I felt like I was in the Hofbrauhaus as the place was jam packed with tables, noisy and the decor seemed uninspired (cow paintings, really? And not very good ones either).  \n\nI have to give a shout out to the 5 star service we received.  The waitstaff was amazing.  Yet I found it disconcerting that the dining manager was out in the dining area discussing issues and business within four feet of the diners.\n\nWe started with the diver sea scallop appetizer which was exactly as advertised and well prepared so I began to feel at ease.  The waiter suggests the scallops or the lobster bisque but we knew we could never finish two appetizers and our meal. The drinks, although pricy were creative and excellent as well.\n\nI ordered the rib eye and my dining partner ordered the surf and turf.  We ordered sides of mixed exotic mushrooms and grits with bacon.  The sides were excellent and the grits may well have been the best dish of the meal even if grits aren't your thing.\n\nThe main course arrived and well I can only say I was overwhelmed by the size and underwhelmed by the taste.  The large 18 OZ ribeye looked so good in the metal pan that I couldn't wait to dig in.  But first I have to rewind.  I like my steak medium rare most of the time but I find good steakhouses tend to think rare = raw, medium rare = rare etc.  So I asked the waiter what the chef's medium rare was.  The waiter told me medium rare was red center, pink surrounding and medium rare was pink all the way through.  So I went with medium rare.  Unfortunately it came out red all the way through.  Im ok with that but I would have gone with medium had I known.   The steak was well seasoned but the meat was much tougher than I have had at other steak houses and the marbling was not rendered down enough causing a rough cut.\n\nThe Lobster was nearly flavorless and chewy.  The filet was cooked medium but was actually medium rare so we enjoyed it but it too did not pack a punch.\n\nWe looked at the desert menu but I was already disenchanted so I refrained.  My dining partner had the souffle which was not in the top 5 souffle's we have had, even at less distinguished establishments.\n\nSo while the meal was above a chain and probably above most off strip places, it earns a 3 which according to Yelp means A-OK which satisfies my review standards.  4 would mean I was a fan which I am not and will not go back short of someone offering to pay for the meal which was pricey (2 people, 4 drinks, 1 app, 2 steaks and 2 sides nearly $400.00.  \n\nThey do offer fixed price meals with choices which would have given us more food for only a little more money but we didn't finish what we had and were glad we didn't opt for the extra side and dessert.\n\nBottom line, while this is a premium steak house there are many equal or better choices for the same price or less within 15 miles.  I could list about 10 off the top of my head if anyone wants to know.  I'll make a list if some of you readers ask."

S'Great food, decent service, and downer of ambiance is the only way of describing Craftsteak. Almost everything we ordered was amazing. The mood of the restaurant was a downer on the night that we went. No subtle mood music, in fact, I was more aware of the staffs conversations then what was going on with my party.\n\nOnto the positives! The Kumamoto oysters are ordered individually and were delicious. They come with the traditional mignonette, horseradish, lemon, and cocktail sauce. The steak tartare is a staple for my group now. We are trying to find the best in Vegas. Tom Colicchio has a solid one, but not the best. The flavor components are sound, but something more impressive than a plain crostini is needed. The stand out appetizer was the warm friscee salad with blue cheese vin and a poached egg. All very simple ingredients that combine to make magic. Once the salad is tossed and the egg broken, it adds another dimension to the dish. I have never been more dissatisfied with dining family style. I wanted it all to myself.\n\nMoving on to the 8oz of Australian wagyu. It is seriously butter. It melts in your mouth and makes you go limp. At a hefty price tag, it is still worth it. The filet and New York strip were delicious, but pale in comparison to the wagyu. The rack of lamb comes in four pieces and marbled to perfection. No need for forks and knives, they are to be treated as lollipops once my party got to them. The diver scallops are tender and the fennel salad compliments them so well. The yukon gold mashed potato is what everyone raves about. Are they good? Hell yes, please keep dishing it out. The assorted mushrooms are rather dreamy as well. The Maui onions could keep on coming.  The one downer were the grits. They sounded awesome but fell short. \n\nAll in all with two bottles of wine and split between 5 it still comes out to a hefty price tag. It is just hard to put too much emphasis on money when the food is of this standard.'

S'Being a fan of Top Chef, vising Craftsteak was must on our trip to vegas! We didnt have a reservation, but were able to get seated on a cute table right by the bar. It was alittle nicer than being in the inside hall, since the lighting seemed to be brighter outside. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaruant is very nice.. it is very calm but very professional at the same time. We started our order with Lobster Bisque. This is a must get if you have never tried it..or a fan or lobster. It taste like... wow did you melt the shell inside it too?? that is how deep and strong the flavor of the lobster is. They mean business when it comes to getting the flavor. I loved the soup!\nFoie Gras was also delicious, cooked very nicely and it went well with the Kumquat.\nThe potato guratin was a little heavy, but it went well with everything. \nThe main course the meat... i had the Filet Mignon, which was cooked very nice, medium rare just the way i like it. Perhaps it was not the best piece of steak that I had, but none the less it was yummy!\n\nI also have to rave about their bread! Talk about coming straight from the oven! The outside was crispy and the inside was fluffy! I think the bread was also the highlight of the evening!!'

S'I love Tom Colicchio, really, I do. It pains me to say that my experience at his MGM\nrestaurant was less than stellar. If this had been "Restaurant Wars," I don\'t know if we\'d see Tom advance to the next round...\n\nWhen we approached the hostess desk, four hostesses/servers were present and not one greeted us until about three minutes had passed. \n\nI had the lobster bisque and found it overwhelmingly over seasoned with cinnamon. It tasted more like cake batter than bisque. \n\nNext, I had the arugula salad with lemon vinaigrette. They actually refused to add tomatoes to it! For the first time in my life I had to send food back to the kitchen. The taste of lemon was so intense, I felt like I was biting directly into one with each bite. I couldn\'t muster the courage to finish the dish. \n\nThe risotto that we had as a side had a taste that reminded me Betty Crocker Instant scalloped potatoes. It was sticky and undercooked. \n\nI must say, the service was wonderful; very attentive and friendly. Other dishes that we got (scallops, Wagyu tartare, and hangar steak) were delicious. \n\nOverall, a disappointment. I still love\nTom though.'

S"There's not much else that can probably be said about this place.\nThe food is amazing - you can tell that attention has been paid in selecting every ingredient.  Skip the rolls.  They look great in the photos and in person, but there's nothing special about them. \n\nWe opted for the tasting menu for two - one with the wine pairing.  Typical wine pairings offer one glass with each course.  I cannot remember how many times they brought refills in the same course!  With the tasting menu we each had a cup of lobster bisque, three salads, two cuts of steak, three sides (one starch, two veg) and four desserts!  Entirely too much food - not complaining, but even coming in fairly hungry, we still didn't put a dent in half of it!\n\nThe two standouts of this meal? The pistachio gelatto and peach sorbet pairing and the service.  (Don't get me wrong, the lobster bisque, salads, meats and sides were phenomenal!!  Oh and I can't forget the FOUR desserts we were given!!)  But we literally sat here for almost 5 hours eating, talking and drinking and the only thing we finished were our drinks and the gelatto/sorbet!"

S'Steak, Chicken, mash potato, salads,  cheeses, bread, muffins, oh my! My girlfriends and I went to Vegas to celebrate the last "hurrah" for our single gal pal. The only thing she wanted to do was eat at this restaurant. We tried to make a reservation, but it was almost impossible to do. One of my girls had to sign two, not one, contracts to get a reservation. In addition, they weren\'t very specific about the details until the last moment. While that was annoying and very upsetting (hence the lost star), the food was incredible! OMG. I ate so much that I had to roll back to my hotel. The short ribs were so juicy and tender that I didn\'t even need a knife to cut them. The vanilla cheesecake is a must. The drinks were just awesome. A great selection of wine.

When looking through the hundreds of restaurant choices in Vegas, we came across this spot in the MGM and with Tom's name on it from Top Chef fame we had to try it. We are so glad we did. \n\nFrom start to finish this was one of the best meals I have ever had traveling. Even the hot lightly salted rolls were delicious. The drinks, appetizers (seafood platter/carpaccio plate) to the main course surf and turf filet and lobster were to die for. The beef was so tender it cut like butter and you could slice it with your fork. The service treated you like a king and who the heck cares about price in a place like this, it was worth every penny and let me tell you there were a lot of them in this bill so bring your wallet or maybe two wallets. For four people this was like a small downpayment on a car. \n\nI will be sure to visit the other Craft steak locations as this blew away every type of chain steak restaurant out there including Capital Grill and Ruth Chris. They arent even in the same league! Do yourself a favor and make this first choice when in Vegas!"

At the table, it takes them a while to come back for your order, to get you bread, to even come back to ask how things are going.  \n\nAs for the food quality.  The steaks are good, I've had the Hanger, the Skirt, the Rib-eye, and the waygu style ribeye.  All cooked well, not the temp, but well as in cooked decently.  But nothing memorable.  \nI can remember the first time I had a Ruth Chris steak with it's butter topping sizzling on it, it tasted great.  Or at Delmonico's where there was this superb crust on their ribeye that I can still taste and dream that all future steaks I eat will be like that.  \n\nAs it stands, at over $100 a person, both times we've been there.  I've had better experiences at other steak houses for that price.\nSide note, the Craftsteak in Los Angeles was a better experience."

S'What can I say that hasn\'t already been said here. I\'ll caveat with the fact that I\'m not a huge steak orderer. I\'ve had Kobe beef in Kobe, Japan, and the freshest beef in the world outside Rio in Brazil. Both of these experiences had the meat as the showcase, no more flavoring added then the sear of the grill and some salt. Having enjoyed such great beef, I find it best just NOT to get my hopes up again, and not bother with steaks at restaurants (to much disappointment). We went to Craftsteak for a Vegas style birthday. The weekend was already filled with amazing food adventures, but they all culminated in a great dinning experience thanks to our favorite Top Chef.\n\nThe dinning room, although dim and buzzing with waiters and busboys was never so loud I couldn\'t talk across the table to our party of 9. The sommalia was great at helping us settle on several wines for the table, one of which he comped (with out us knowing till the bill came) for the birthday girl! Our waitress was all sunshine with out being annoying, and our food came out quick. I had the surf and turf, New York tri with a lobster tail cooked Medium. AMAZING!! Simple, a good size on both the tail and the steak! My friend got the Rib-Eye...IT WAS MASSIVE, so juicy and simple. The side dishes aren\'t really worth mentioning, because here, the steak was front and center. The table played pass-the-piece and we tried half the menu. Finished the meal off with coffee and monkey bread (with candle in it for some happy birthday singing) and you could have stuck a fork in me, I was done!\n\nFrom the hostess, to the bill, Craftsteak delivered the total dinning experience and made me believe that I don\'t have to eat the extreme A+ in steak, there is plenty of room for the "regular" A\'s at the top of the curve as well!'

We ordered, risotto, broccolini, asparagus, mushrooms, and scalloped potatoes for our sides.  And we started our night with the beef tartare, fries and a caeser salad.

We were there for an hour and 45 minutes total, the manager never arrived. \n-Our second attempt at ordering drinks fell flat. Third time worked. \n-Had to stop a different waiter to get a wine menu that our waiter was coming right back with, 20 minutes earlier. \n\nTo the food:\n-3 of 4 steaks were grossly overcooked. \n-Lobster bisque was bland.\n-Salads were mediocre, at best. \n-Asparagus was good, but that\'s easy. \n\nIn all, everyone at the table agreed this was the worst restaurant experience any of us have had. Very disappointing as a close friend that is a major foodie described it as a "life changing meal" for him. I guess technically it was for me too, just not in a good way.  I\'m appalled that we spent more PER dish than an entire meal for four at the likes of Outback Steakhouse and left wishing we had gone to Outback Steakhouse. \n\nI will stick to Les Artistes Steakhouse when in Vegas. \n\nThanks for a horrible ending to our fabulous wedding day.'

S"You gotta do at least 1 fancy dinner in Vegas and staying in MGM and this was most convenient for us. We were seated right away with Opentable resos and checked out the really warm, wood-filled decor on the way to our table. We were seated and told we had 2 servers because 1 was in training. Ok, cool. We had the complimentary bread (the best part of everything), bottle of wine, lobster bisque, salmon for me and ribeye for him. Service was a little odd, again with 2 servers. It seemed like they didn't communicate well and didn't know if we ordered something or the tables near us. It also took forever and a day to get our meals. \n\nThe lobster bisque was as cold as Chicago in February and this was no gazpacho. My fish was good but the veggies paired with it were crazy bitter. I don't understand why they'd pair these together. Hubby loved his steak and said it was a game changer since he never orders rib-eyes. They gave us little rich chocolate squares for celebrating our anniversary and brought the bill.\n\nIdk if they were trying to be slick or a genuine error, but they charged us one of the most expensive wine bottles in place of the regularly priced one we ordered. We had to wait quite a while for this to be corrected, since the server in training didn't have authority or whatever to correct the issue. It was fixed but just left an even more bitter taste after all those bitter greens. \n\nI was hoping TM's would blow me away but it was just ok."

S'Although I have been wanting to try Craft for about a year, I ended up here on a whim. This place exceeded my expectations, by far! \n\nWe began our meal with drinks. There were beers, cocktails, and wine. Tons of options at various prices. I ended up getting the prosecco, which was wonderfully crisp. We settled on the grilled calamari as an appetizer. It was OK, but nothing to rave about. I ended up ordering the surf and turf, which was FANTASTIC. This can easily be shared. The lobster sauce was buttery awesome perfection. However, I think the largest highlight was the monkey bread. An explosion of flavors for sure! \n\nOverall, the food is great. The drinks are strong. The staff is knowledgable.'

S"The food here is high quality. Our favorite thing surprisingly wasn't the steak, but the scallops. The outside was seared to perfection, while the inside was nice and tender.  They also have delicious mussels, bathing in a yummy broth.  \n\nOne issue we had was initially they sat us at a table right in the front, completely exposing us to the drunks walking around the hotel. This might appeal to some; however my husband and I were looking to enjoy a romantic evening alone. We asked to move and thankfully got seated in a more secluded location, providing the intimate experience we sought.  \n\nThe service was a little on the weak side. Much of the time we were waiting on our server instead of him waiting on us.  I don't know that we'd return, but we had a nice time."

S"Went to Craft steakhouse for a bachelor party dinner.  I didn't have high expectations because I haven't been to many steakhouses on the strip and I'm used to typical Ruth Chris or wolf gang type places.  I must say this is probably the best steak I've ever had.  I had the wagyu rib eye with snap pea risotto, potatos, mushrooms for my side.  Steak was cooked and seasoned to my liking and the risotto is so delicious.  We order the shrimp cocktail appetizer which was good but nothing special than any other restaurant.  The monkey bread dessert is to die for.  Heaven in your mouth... \nI will say the one down side is the price... def the most expensive steak dinner of my life.  But worth it.  We ordered 2 bottles of wine so my portion of the bill came out to $200."

S"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.  Why am I giving it 4 stars?  It's because it's so damn expensive.  The steak and the sides were great, the portions were humongous, the desserts were delightful, but was it worth $460 for 2 people?  Uhhh....not so  much.  Yes the meal was better than your run of the mill chains like Claim Jumper or TGI Fridays, but for half the price at a place at let's say....Ruth Chris' Steak House, I would say I'd stick with that.  We had the pre-set menu with the American Wagyu Surf N Turf.  For a special occasion, like Valentines Day, yes it is well worth it.  But would I go on a regular basis?  Probably not, I'm going to stick with Morton's or Maestro's for my usual Steak cravings."

S"Outstanding experience from beginning to end. Tom Colicchio's got it down.\n\nI was a little bummed that I missed the restaurant week menus by a day. However, my dad and I were recommended the chef's menu, which turned out to be a great deal and a whole lot of food. For $130 per person, the two of us shared: grilled prawns, 3 salads, 3 side starches, 2 wagyu steaks, and 3 desserts. I'm not usually a huge salad fan, but the frisee salad with bacon and poached egg, and the arugula with pine nuts were fantastic! The wagyu filet and ribeye were to die for. The best, most buttery steak I've ever had. They had a wonderful sear on the outside too. The mushroom risotto and sweet corn are a must get.\n\nJust when we thought we were done, completely stuffed with delicious food, out comes three desserts - the famous monkey bread, peach pavlova, and fruit sorbets. They were all amazing in their own way and worked great together. The price was steep, but this would be the place to spend your money. It was all worth it. An amazing dining experience.\n\nService equally matched the fantastic food. Our waiter was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. He recommended dishes to us and was right every time. The wine and beverage pourers were also super friendly. It felt like like we were in a local dining establishment, where everyone knew us. This was a fine dining steakhouse, but it was comfortable, not snooty. Overall, one of the best food experiences ever (Chez Panisse is still up there). Highly recommended."

S"I was at a conference in Vegas recently and my chef and I had the pleasure of dining at Craftsteak.  Like Tom Collichio or not, he's undoubtedly an accomplished and talented restauranteur and chef.  Craftsteak is in the MGM grand, which is a gorgeous hotel and casino.  Sure, we could have experimented with a little more adventurous fare, granted, but we were in the mood for a man's night out and Bobby Flay is such a douchebag that his restaurant (Mesa, also in the MGM) was a no-thank-you.  So, Craftsteak it was.  The staff at this restaurant, whether it was the maitre'd, the barstaff or the waitstaff - should be a model for every other restaurant.  It was simply impeccable.  Polite, courteous, not phony - just perfect.  We sat at the bar for a few moments and enjoyed an expertly prepared Manhattan while they prepared our table.  Moments later, the maitre'd invited us over to the table and had our drinks refreshed and sent over as well.  10 points.  That probably cost them about 25 cents worth of booze, but was just a classy move.  Our server, Kevin, was without a doubt, the best waiter I have ever had.  He was knowledgeable, friendly, could talk wine and food like he was a chef himself.  We took a look at the small, but gorgeous menu and wine list and were discussing the various options with Kevin, who made suggestions of the tartare and the foie gras - both favorites of ours.  Order up!  The food took and appropriate amount of time to arrive, and was plated and prepared without a single flaw.  The flavors were dead-on and the ingredients, you could tell, were nothing short of the freshest.  The foie came heated on a castware dish with some lovely fig-balsamic reduction.  Very rustic but elegant plating - and the taste was absolutely wonderful.  Full, round, deep foie, like I had never tasted before (even in Paris!), and the reduction matched it wonderfully.  The tartare was a wonderful portion of perfect-temperature hand-chopped kobe.  Complete with a beautiful egg yolk on top that oozed perfectly throughout the dish.  There was just the right amount of seasoning, but not too much as to mask the wonderful rich flavor of the beef.  It was a very traditional tartare, but done perfectly.  Tartare is one of my favorite dishes, and Craftsteak wins hands down for quality and flavor.\nWe took a while to digest our first courses and ordered a bottle of Champagne to cleanse our palate and never felt rushed by Kevin at all, in fact, he was perfectly unintrusive when we were relaxing and very attentive when we were ordering or had questions.\nAnyhow, after about 15 minutes, it cam time to order the main course.  My chef chose a Kobe Wine Flight and I enjoyed a simple Kobe Flatiron.  For sides, we chose creamed spinach, potato puree and grilled asparagus.  (Note: although the sides are pricey, they are meant for 2.)\nThe steaks arrived soon after, perfectly cooked.  The beef was excellent as were the traditional, but perfectly made, sides.  The vegetables were wonderfully prepared and obviously, by the fact that the chef didn't have to 'dress them up' too much with excessive seasoning, were of the freshest quality, as well.  In Las Vegas, the land of overcooked buffets, it's nice to see some fresh veggies!  Kevin assisted us graciously when we purchased some champagne for a nearby table of business acquaintances, and was just super classy throughout the night.  \nWe were thoroughly stuffed after our steaks and each enjoyed a glass of wonderful dessert wine and calvados.\nWe spent a few minutes with Kevin, just talking about his experience with the restaurant and he seemed very happy to be there, he really does enjoy his job and truly cares about his clients.  If Mr. Collichio is reading - Kevin is a tribute to your organization.\nThe bill was quite hefty, needless to say, but good food and (a lot) of good booze doesnt come cheap (the full damage, including tip was just over 700 bucks).  Plus, it's Vegas - you'd probably just gamble it away anyhow.  \nTruly a next-level dining experience and worth every penny."

We had a reservation and were sat within minutes of arriving.\n\nThe wait staff encouraged the tasting menu (to the point of being aggressive about it). We went with their suggestion which turned out to be a great decision. We received 6 apps, 6 steaks, 6 sides and 6 desserts. The portions were generous and everyone got to try everything (we even had some leftovers for the next day).\n\nWe had 6 different steaks and everyone choose a different one as their favorite. My personal favorite was the Wagyu strip steak. Perfectly cooked and just melted in my mouth. Every dish was delicious however a couple were a bit boring (grilled asparagus, roasted vegetables, caesar salad). \n\nOverall we had a memorable New Year's Eve dinner and I will be back for another Wagyu strip steak on my next trip to Vegas."

S"Craft steak was flawless in every way.  I arrived with my party about 10 mins early just in case there was a wait.  As I sat there I noticed the interior, perfectly classic steak house, wood everything.  Dark oaks, redwoods and even pine.  Aw the faint smell of wood finish is unmistakable and wonderful when you sit down to a hearty meal.  There is just something about the smell of pine and oak that goes with a 12oz steak.\n\nOur server came over to us promptly and introduced himself.  Charm filled the room, every wait staff had a smile ear to ear.   The Floor manager came over next.  We were all dressed in business attire and casual wear, nothing special at all.  After all it was 110 degrees outside so some of us were in shorts.  None of this stopped him from coming over.   He just came over to introduce himself and make sure everything was to our liking. \n\nWe started our meal with artisan breads. The favorite of the table was the kalamata rosemary bread. Wonderfully salty and airy, perfect way to get us to drink 2 more cocktails each.  A good restaurateur will understand the need to up sale through cocktails and a good way to do that is salty snacks,\n\nI had the New York strip with Natural Ju and Thyme.   It came sliced into perfect  inch cubes with a  inch fat cap still attached.  All I could think was thank god you kept the fat on there.  I got a side of roasted mushrooms with my steak. I'm a sucker when it comes to mushrooms, especially when they are prepared as simple as possible. They were simply pan roasted in clarified..... also known as liquid gold.\n\nAll in All for experience, atmosphere, food and service they get a 5, but when I go into a place like this I expect nothing less then a perfect evening."

S"The best part about Craftsteak was their dinner rolls.  Hot, fresh, salty and perfect with a slab of butter.  Other than that, the steak and sides didn't impress anyone in our group.  I shared the Porterhouse for two and quite frankly didn't even end up finishing it.  The steak wasn't seasoned well and had bit of gristle and huge chunks of fat.  For the sides we went with the turnips which were just ok.  Everyone else ordered the surf and turf and weren't impressed as well.  Next time we'll have to go to CUT."

S"I came here with my girlfriend and we tried the Winter Tasting Menu. We were escorted to the back of the restaurant and were seated facing the entire restaurant. The decor was very interesting and modern. It is very dim inside like most upscale steakhouses. We were first served with the Hawaiian rolls, and at this point we were starving so I scarfed them down, but I tried to refrain myself from eating too many because I wanted to leave some room in my stomach for the entrees. The tasting menu came with 3 types of salads including a baby beet salad, roasted red pepper and mixed baby lettuces, and a grilled quail. Honestly, I can't choose which of those appetizers I liked best because they were all so good. My gf loved the beets, however. Our main course came out, and we were stunned at how much food we were getting for what we paid for. We got flat iron steak, beef skirt steak, scallops, potato puree, shitake mushrooms and brussel sprouts with bacon. We worked so hard trying to finish our food because it was so delicious, but there was way too much for us to handle. \n\nFor dessert, the waiters brought out the monkey bread with hazelnut ice cream and banana bread pudding. They were soo good that we ate it all even though we were stuffed from the dinner. We were in serious pain for about 2 hours while watching KA."

S"After dining here, my husband and I decided that we will never, ever eat a fancy Vegas restaurant.  The service was spotty and the food was good, but definitely not good enough to justify the price.  WAY overhyped and expensive.  After living in the bay area for a few months, we know what good, quality food should be like and how much it should cost.  I can't remember exactly how much each item was (not listed on their online menu), but let's just say that we ate 9 courses combined with 2 wine pairings at Gary Danko in SF for the same price.\n\nI'm usually a bread FIEND, but I was not into their bread at all.  It didn't taste like much even with butter.  We started out with their lobster bisque and it was good, but I know I can find better for cheaper in SF.  For our entrees, we ordered the shortrib and scallops.  The shortribs came out in a little pot still in its juices, so it stayed moist and flavorful and the scallops were average.  So, for the sides, we didn't realize that they were meant to be shared, but we had leftovers for a midnight snack.  I would think our waiter would've told us the portion size when we ordered the braised kale, potato gratin, baby spinach, and baby shiitake mushrooms just for ourselves, but oh well.  All the sides except the spinach were delicious.  Spinach was good too, but I'm sure it would've been better with bacon.  Ha.\n\nOverall....................... seriously not worth it!"

The dry aged ribeye (med-rare) is consistently cooked to perfection (slightly bloody) and the flavor always gets high marks.  The only real questionhere  is what sides to get.   The saut\xc3\xa9ed mushroom variety is surprisingly good but the dinner rolls are enough to fill you up before the steak.  The service is pretty good and the attire is casual so you don't have to get really dressed up.  Reservations are a must."

S"Came with a group of 6.\nOrdered the group Angus course, which was salads, then steaks and sides. Deserts at the end. Comes out to $129/ per person.\nI enjoyed most of the salads, except the kale - heavily salted. \nThe steak cuts were mostly enjoyable. The horse raddish sauce was powerful. \nOf the sides, I enjoyed the pureed potato the most.\nThe deserts were good, but overkill after all of that. Not a bad deal though.\n\nMy biggest gripe is with their sommelier and their wine list. She needs a clue: \n\nI wanted a good dinner wine. I usually like leathery Grenache wines from Rhone Valley. I've had great ones for $40-$80 per bottle. Dinner wine/table wine. Instead, I'm inundated with a list of $1000 to $12000 wines. I like table wines. Great wines can be had for under $100. If a sommelier needs to keep pointing at pricey wines in order to recommend me a good wine for dinner, then they're not doing their job to me. They are a piss poor sommelier. \n\nI just want a decent dinner wine at a fair price. Get a god damn clue, and save your most over-priced grape juices for the whales. Understand how to read your customers so a simple dinner doesn't have to be so awkward and idiotic.\n\nI had to settle for a martini and a beer rather than a reasonable wine to go with my dinner. I was annoyed by that.\n\nSummary: \n\nPro:\nSteaks were decent.\nMost of the appetisers were decent.\nSome of the sides were great.\nDecadent Deserts.\n\nCon:\n1.) They wouldn't take phone reservations. Forced us to come downstairs and forced us to wait around.\n2.) There needs to be a reasonable wine list for reasonable people - some of those thousand dollar wines are to be savored for an experience someone might want. I want a decent dinner wine. Get a clue.\n\nFor half the price, I had a better experience at Wolfgang's CUT"

S"So glad I had a chance to try Craftsteak.  The good parts:  Setting is fabulous, very posh and yet comfortable.  The Parker house rolls were so good that I ate way too many.  Crusty tops with salt and pillowy soft insides.  The Wagyu beef tartare was as good as others here have said.   And yet...  The frisee salad was majorly overdressed.  Yes, it is a warm salad so the frisee won't be as crisp as normal.  But the egg, bacon, and cheese used for the freshly tossed dressing should have been used on three times the amount of greens.  Then it would have been an enhancement instead of glops of saltiness that hid the taste of the greens.  So sad.  I'm sure Chef Colicchio didn't know it was that way because, after watching him so long on Top Chef, he would not have stood for it.  Wish I had been hungrier so I could have tried other items.  \n\nOn a side note:  All throughout my dining in Vegas I was confronted with soup spoons given to me for my dessert course.  When the sorbet scoops are the same size as the spoon I'm to eat them with it is not a good match.  Craftsteak was one of the offenders.  Find smaller spoons for diners to use for dessert please!"

The potatoes au gratin was not quite cooked all the way. There were a few layers of potato that was a bit crunchy. The eggplant side was delicious though.\n\nCraft didn't have the worst food but I left thinking, eh. The decor for the most part is appealing except the portraits of cows lined up on the walls which made me think that I was eating the steak of that cow so I find that to be in bad taste.\n\nThe monkey bread dessert was delicious. \n\nThe price was typical vegas price--about three times the amount it should be.\n\nOverall. I wouldn't spend my own money or suggest this place with so many other options in Vegas."

S'Jon Gosselin has a gut!  I would too if I dined at places like Craftsteak every night.  He was also obviously bombed as his face red and eyes glazed.  Women around him didn\'t even care.  They all think he\'s a jerk.  One lady told me she thinks he\'s a "jackass".  You don\'t even know him.  Actually, I did too until I saw him in person.  He looked sad and lonely.  It seemed like he\'s using alcohol to get his mind off of the media scrutiny.  I actually felt bad for the guy even though he looked ridiculous with those earrings and a smoke in his hand.  So what does that have to do with Craftsteak?  Absolutely nothing!\n\nWe also saw Jason Priestley (90210 alum), Annalynne McCord (Naomi in the current 90210) and Dahntay Jones (NBA guard) dining at Tom Colicchio\'s establishment.  Craftsteak must be the place to eat while in Sin City.\n\nThere is so much hype about Craftsteak.  I\'m not sure if I was bitten by the hype but I truly enjoyed the experience.  All I can do is be honest and honestly, everything was quite good.\n\nThe service was impeccable.  Not one but two waiters took care of us.  Both were extremely friendly and on top of their game on making us feel welcome and comfortable.  Psychic abilities must have also been a prerequisite because they also read our minds.  They would bring things right before we ask.  And they timed everything perfectly.  Well done!\n\nWe couldn\'t decide.  I asked the waiter for advice.  He suggested the Summer Tasting Menu ($60 per person).  It was a prefixed menu with appetizers, steaks, scallops, sides and desserts.  That sounded good to me.  Everything tasted fresh and the ingredients used were of high quality.  From the appetizers, the quail and buffalo mozzarella were my favorites.  They were absolutely delicious.  It was full of bold flavors and it made me wanting more.  Both steaks were tasty, juicy, tender and a perfect medium rare.  The scallops were delicate, light and cooked perfectly.  Of the sides, the roasted shiitake mushrooms were heavenly.  It was seasoned nicely and full of earthy flavors.  Unfortunately, I\'m not a fan of sweets so the desserts were somewhat forgettable.  But my wife enjoyed it.\n\nAlso, the lobster bisque ($18) was awesome.  It was creamy, well spiced and full of large lobster pieces.  I\'m drooling...\n\nAbove were just a few dishes that stood out.  There were a total of 12 dishes on the Summer Tasting Menu.  My wife and I both had major food babies after just the appetizers.  We doggie bagged whatever we couldn\'t finish for later drunken consumption.  Five hours later and speech sluring, everything still tasted great!\n\nGood is good regardless of hype and in my opinion, Craftsteak is good!  The Summer Tasting Menu is definitely the way to go.  Our total bill was about $220 after tax and tip.  Expensive yes but it was well worth it.'

S'Beautiful, delicious dinner. Awesome service. It was a fantastic experience. First of all the Porterhouse rolls were a little bit of heaven, with some flaked salt on top and just-right butter (not too soft or hard). I ordered the Lobster Bisque (yummm - enormous chunks of lobster meat in a bowl, then they poured the bisque over it from a copper pot- fantastic), and the warm Frisee Salad with Egg and Bacon to go with. Our server said, "This is good if you like blue cheese." Which I DO. It was rich and fantastic. I love a soft egg as dressing. I split the entree shortribs with my friend it it was melt-in-your mouth amazing. Our sides were potato puree (MMMMMMMM), baby spinach and brussells sprouts. Just incredible. It was one of the best meals I\'d EVER had. Impeccable service, wonderful decor. The only thing that didn\'t fit was the loud music, which somehow didn\'t add to the ambiance. I still give it 5 stars. Loved it.'
