S'Disappointed.  I had such high expectations for this place and the food was just OK at best.  \n\nThe bacon wrapped dates was the best item that we had and even then, it was super oily.  Everything was just way too greasy and salty.  On the bright side, the portions and prices were reasonable ($5-15 plate). Parking is easy and service is pleasant.'

S"I am a fan of all things Sangria, and Firefly has to have some of the best around.  I love places with a great happy hour, atmosphere, and patio.  Firefly has all  three plus great tapas.  The service is always fantastic they are very attentive and friendly.  I can't think of a better place to start off a weekend in Vegas with your friends than this place.\n\nThe must haves for me when I go is of course the Sangria (red) and the stuffed mushrooms with chorizo and chicken.  The Calamari is quite good, and on my most recent visit the Shrimp a la Diabla was fantastic.  I look forward to my next visit to Firefly which will be very soon."

My favorites were the stuffed mushrooms, shrimp ceviche, stuffed dates, and thai beef salad. Everything was delicious! I haven't tried the downtown location yet, but it's definitely on my list."

S"Preface: On Friday & Saturday nights - naturally the busiest nights - they do NOT accept reservations for small parties.  Expect about an hour wait, but the cocktail bar makes it go by quickly.\n\nThe entire experience with Firefly was pretty good.  It was jam packed on a Saturday night when we showed at 7:30, and we did wait about an hour for our small two-top in the back corner.  The restaurant is pretty small and it was full of larger parties - more than one bachelorette party, or so I'm assuming by the amount of pink boas and other paraphanaelia I noticed.\n\nI enjoyed almost everything we had.  Started with a pitcher of red sangria and it was amazing.  A little sweet though; by the end of the pitcher we couldn't even finish our last glasses.  Then again, both the bf & I are dry martini drinkers, so don't let my experience sway you from trying it.\n\nWe had the tuna tartar - awesome, shrimp ceviche - awesome, surf & turf skewers - awesome, & mac n cheese - passable.  I live for mac n cheese, and I could have lived without this one.  It was extremely sharp in flavor, and that's just not my style.\n\nThe only thing I didn't try that I really wanted was the cherry chocolate bread pudding, which I hear is great.  Next time.\n\nFive stars for the atmosphere, cocktails & service.  Four stars for the packed in tables (I couldn't get out of my seat without bumping the table next to us...and I'm not a big person) and food.  Next time I'd like to try the patio seats and maybe on a weekday when it isn't so crazy packed."

S"I'm still a fan of Firefly, but for some reason I think this place is beginning to rub me the wrong way. Maybe it's because when they had their place downtown I really enjoyed going there over going to the Paradise location and now I'm forced to go to the Paradise location because the downtown location closed.\n\nI went here last night and shared Sangrias with a group of friends and also ordered some ceviche. My boyfriend had never been here before and he didn't seem too impressed. He (and I) were incredibly annoyed by the very, very loud group of girls to the right of us. We were seated in the front part of the restaurant in the couch area and they were directly to the right of us. At times I couldn't even hear my boyfriend and he was sitting right next to me. Good luck trying to hear the other people in my party.\n\nThe sangria was good, our waiter was attentive and nice. The atmosphere is the same 'ol. Maybe I'm just ready to move on to a new place..."

S'Our dinner at Firefly happened so quickly.  It seemed like moments after we would order another dish it was at our table.  The restaurant is loud and small and very high energy.  The tapas were of a good size to split four ways and we ordered about 7 or so total.  The sangria was ok, not the best ever.  \n\nI have to say that I have had much better tapas in other cities.  While they were good and I love Spanish food, there was not a single one that stood out to me as outstanding.  I may return on another trip since its nice to get off the strip sometimes and my friends that live in Vegas don\'t always like going to dinner on the strip. (Not that I blame them at all)   It\'s a very un "Vegas" like experience and more of a "find this in any city" kind of experience.  (Just depends on what you\'re looking for)'

S"I adore tapas and am thankful Firefly is in Vegas because the only other tapas plus in town sucks. \n\nBut...Firefly can be really uneven. When it's good, it's wonderful. When it's not good....it's pretty stinky. \n\nBest thing on the menu...stuffed dates! The sweet of the dates and the salty smoky flavor of bacon and the sharp pungent taste of blue cheese is a smash hit!\n\nOther favorites are the tuna tartare, ceviche, terra y mare skewers (shrimp, beef, and chorizo)\n\nWorst on the menu? The spicy beef salad is supposed to be Thai food (which really doesn't belong on a tapas menu anyway) and might be one of the nastier things I've ever tasted. \n\nThe roasted eggplant canneloni is bland, but at least it's edible. I'd say about the same for the duck rolls.\n\nWhen  this place is good, it can achieve awesome...but be careful of what you order. I give it 4 stars because if you know your way around the menu, you can have a great meal here."

S"Perfect starter to a wild Vegas night.\n\nI love tapas joints and this is one the best.  The menu here is excellent with a wide variety of original dishes that wont break the bank.  The ambiance is loungey hip and the service is excellent.  Ive been here several times with large groups and they have catered nicely to us each time.  Place is pretty popular so dinner time usually has a wait but there is a bar for you to pass the time.  \n\nHere are some of my favorite plates:\n\nFilet Mignon Sliders - Juicy patty full of flavor and deep fried onion strings on top give it a crunch.\n\nFirefly Fries - Goes great with the sliders and good item to share.\n\nChorizo Clams - Delicious! Chorizo adds richness and the broth makes a great dip for the bread.\n\nCrispy Duck Roll - Kind of a small dish, but if your into duck this thing is bomb.\n\nStuffed Dates - Just a real tasty little concoction with great flavor.  Very good appetizer to start things off.\n\nThis place is an off the strip secret for some great fine dining and a perfect warm up to some good times.  Parking is a little tough but you'll manage."

S'The sangria is excellent, the appetizers I had during a tour event stop were also freshly made and delicious. The appetizers and drinks were complimentary to the tour event that I was on. Many kinds of food types for all tastes were available.\n\nI would go back with no more than four people. The restaurant seems to have a smaller overall space and it gets very busy starting on Friday, lasting through the weekend. I would also only do a late lunch or a super early dinner because the restaurant quickly fills up starting at dinner time.\n\nIf this location is super busy, you may also visit their second location in the Downtown Las Vegas Fremont Street Experience.'

Yes, of course there is, however for atmosphere, service, location, and consistency this place gets five stars. The crazy thing is that it is reasonably priced as well!!

S"A couple of dishes disappointed me this past weekend, but I still had a wonderful time at Firefly.\n\nTip: They do not accept reservations for parties of less than 10 on Fridays and Saturdays, and this place can get really pack. I highly recommend going before 7:30 P.M, or you're going to wait 30 minutes for 2 people, and more depending on the size of your party.\n\nI ordered the Paella (my favorite dish) and it did not disappoint me again. For $18, you get a well made dish and a lot of food here. You can easily share this dish with 4 people. Since it was my favorite dish, I ate 75% of it.   5 / 5 Stars\n\nDo not order the fries here. The portion of the fries were generous (a basket actually), but it was not prepared well at all. McDonald's fries are out of this world when you compare them to Firefly. 1.5 / 5 stars \n\n-Empanadas:  first time eating Empanadas and I actually liked it.  The ground meat inside had a nice textured and it was stuffed inside a pie-like crust. 3.5 / 5 stars\n\n-Mac & Cheese: Macaroni Shells were used in this dish, a little different, but I was fine with it. I would probably avoid ordering this simply because it wasn't as cheesy as I would like, and it definitely did not have a thick crispy layer of cheese crust. 2 / 5 stars\n\n-Stuffed Dates: I actually enjoyed my dates a little more this trip. I definitely enjoyed biting into the almond and tasting bacon at the same time. 4 / 5 stars.\n\nWatermelon Mojita like mostly reviews mentioned, tasted a lot like a Jollyrancher. I'm not a fan of this drink. I would avoid ordering, and stick with the Sangria. 2 / 5 stars\n\nFor dessert, I had the Bread Pudding and it came out cold. I spoke to the server and they corrected it. It was my 2nd time trying this dessert, a lot better the first time. 3.5 / 5 stars"

It's a few blocks off the strip (cab it people, don't walk), and it's happily not as Vegas-y and glitter-y as other Vegas establishments.  We had a variety of tapas plates, but the mac and cheese was my favorite.  The white sangria was also delicious with lots of fresh fruit.  You won't be disappointed!"

S"My wife and I dined at Firefly on Paradise tonight. We ate an early dinner at 5pm on a Monday. It was also a holiday, but it wasn't as busy as I expected. Happy hour was in full swing though and the outside seating area was packed. My wife and I weren't there for the happy hour so we were seated immediately inside the restaurant. We had the option of choosing a regular table or a table with a couch. We chose the table with the couch. It's nice especially if you're planning on staying to lounge for a while.\n\nThe service was excellent. The waiter checked up on us frequently and drinks were constantly refilled.\n\nOur dinner: \nEmpanada - $4.50, Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms - $5, Filet mignon sliders - $7.50, Paella - $20, and the Dessert platter - $12. After tax $52.97, not including gratuity. Not bad. We were both stuffed and ordered more than enough food. We even had to take some home. \n\nThe food was pretty tasty, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. The best I've had was in NYC, but the food there is always the best in my opinion. However, Firefly is still good. If I were to go again, I wouldn't order the Filet mignon sliders and the dessert platter since they weren't as good as I'd hoped for. The Filet mignon sliders were decent, but I would skip the dessert all together."

The selection and portion of food is perfect, sometimes you go to tapa's places you get A shrimp with your order or if you are vegetarian there aren't any options. At Firefly they have it all- Seafood, Beef, Chicken, Pork, Veggie. . .Some of my favorites are Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Warm Spinach Salad, Stuffed Dates (TO DIE FOR), Diablo Shrimp-Truly have never had anything bad there. \n\nAlso, the Sangria and Mojito's are phenomenal, but I will have to say, they made a damn good Dirty Martini!  Great place for a date, girls night out or starting point for a night out on the Las Vegas Strip. . . . Get there early though it get's busy!"

While their drinks are pretty tasty, all their mojitos are made with juice concentrates rather than real fruit or real fruit juice. They are a little sugary sweet and artificial tasting for my palette, but to each his own ! The bacon wrapped dates are freaking incredible (they have the best ones in town!), and I also love their mac and cheese. Sliders are hit or miss. Skewers are just ok. I attached a pic of the white drink mixes they buy to put in all the drinks. I watched the bar for 30 minutes last night and didn't see one drink made without some concentrate out of a white canister."

S'I have been a Vegas regular for many years now. Growing a bit tired of my "on the strip" restaurant selections, I\'ve been making it my goal to branch out.  I actually came across Firefly on Yelp and from the reviews was anxious to try it.  We ate here on 2/10/12 and...what can I say....the food was excellent, the prices were fair and the sangria was potent!!  I can\'t wait to go back and share this place with my family and friends.  One thing to remember - it\'s not like this place is a secret, you can tell it\'s a favorite of locals and tourists who ask around will hear about this restaurant.  It\'s incredibly busy and you will wait for a table - so, be sure to account for that when you are making you after-dinner plans.  Enjoy!'

S"The gf never been and wanted to try this place and for so long, I kept saying it's overrated as I've been quite a few times and it was very average at best.  So last week, felt like hanging out more than eating so decided to take her to a great hang out spot: yup, Firefly, where there's always a nice crowd.\n\nSurprise, surprise. Since I was the veteran, I ordered the mojito, bacon wrapped dates, the lobster escargot, and the Ribeye with Firefly fries. All of it was not bad at all.\n\nThe knock was for the lobster escargot. When it came out, I thought the server had served us someone's leftover by mistake but to our surprise, that's it. Picture about 6 little lumps the size of m&m's if not smaller served in a garlic plate.  True story, after eating about 2 little lumps, the busser came by and asked if we were done with the dish, and I looked at him and he looked at me and realized that we had just started on the dish. Despite this little awkwardness, the service was excellent. I will be coming back more often.\n\nNote: I always hear that Firefly is cheap. It's not. The menu price is deceiving because the portions are SO small that I've never walked out of that place for less than $50 for 2 despite usually not even drinking alcohol."

We used to frequent Cha Cha Cha back in SF so when we discovered Firefly a few years back, we knew we had to check them out!\n\nSo here we are, 4 years later, and I still love Firefly each time we go.  It always seems like it's packed so reservations are your best bet.\n\nAlright, down to the chow:\nSangria- both the red and white are good, depends if you are a white wine or red wine person.  The pitcher is well worth it cause you get almost 3 glasses per person ( based on two ppl)\n\nBacon wrapped dates-love them! This took me awhile to get used to as I'm not a fan of sweet/savory but this combo really works.  And they really char the bacon, just how I like it, crunchy and salty on the outside and sweet and chewy on the inside...YUM\n\nCamarones Al Diabla- SO good!!!! The sauce is what makes this dish..it's slightly sweet, tangy, salty...SO good to dip your bread in, this dish is a MUST every time..\n\nLamb chops- I love lamb so they couldn't go wrong with this, just don't overcook it and we are good.  It came out pink in the inside and had a nice char on the outside..perfecto..\n\nOverall- this is definitely my go to restaurant when I have visitors in town or special occasions..."

Plan to wait... but the staff is really accommodating and will call you on the phone/ hold your table for a few minutes if you aren't front and center when your name is called. I recommend visiting Kelly's down the way and getting a drink while you wait. So on to other stuff...\n\nThis place is super crowded. The menu is not huge but literally everything is great so it's tough to make decisions. Our party of 6 ordered one or two things each and shared in true tapas style. Prawns were a particular hit, as were the skewers. My favorite was the ceviche, which had avocado in it (I don't even like avocado and I still loved it!). I hear the sangria is amazing and I really regret not getting it. I did however order a few desserts to share, and all were  well received. We tried the bread pudding and the dessert platter (cheesecake, tarts, tres leches). The bread pudding was the favorite, as well as the cheesecake.\n\nEnough talk- go eat here!"

S"Tapas and sangria... check.  Dim mood lighting... check.  Noisy, boisterous drunken conversation... check.  A long waiting list at 10pm?  Very impressive.\n\nFirefly is a hip, party type place and very popular.  Unless you are going on a Monday night, don't think you are going to stroll in here on a Saturday night (even at 9pm) and get a table right away.  Make a reservation and get yourself opentable.com points.  I arrived 20 minutes early and was promptly seated.  Perhaps it was because it was just a party of 2 or perhaps they are just on the ball.  They generally had several large parties, so I am sure it is coordination nightmare.\n\nBe sure to confirm your reservation and show up on time.  Otherwise, they will give away your table.\n\nService is as good as one can expect for a super busy restaurant.\n\nFood consists of small dishes running about $5-10, with a few large dishes such as paella for $15.  You can see the menu online with exact pricing.  Expect that you will need 3-5 dishes per person depending on appetite.  Alcohol is fairly reasonable, though not really a bargain.  I figure a $6 sangria is fair for the most part.\n\nWe had smoked salmon on toast with cream cheese, paella, beef skewers, duck rolls, warm spinach salad and fish sticks.  The only dish that sort of missed the mark was the paella.  It had pockets of extreme flavor and pockets of extreme blandness.  I guess they didn't mix it enough or maybe that is how paella is supposed to be?  Each order, aside from the paella, serves two... maybe three, so plan accordingly.\n\nThey is no valet parking.  Just swing around behind Ruths Chris to find ample parking.\n\nA pretty good strip mall for restaurants.  Yolie's is here, too."

Although I was eating different items, I could not find a dish that was so stellar that  I yearned for when I lie in bed. My tastebuds weren't on fire but I was OK with that because I was having a lot of fun catching up with my friends who were vacationing from California. We were chatting and picking at food and when we got thirsty we had a gulp of sangria and went back to chatting and picking at food. In the end, we ate and drank everything. I think this is a great place to hang out, eat a little to hold you over for dinner, and loosen up for the night ahead. So don't expect an excellent meal here but do expect to have a good time with your buddies!"

I had a couple of beautiful glasses of red wine, pretty fantastic wine choices considering the not so great quality of the food.\n\nI have to say, that this place would come in handy if you are drunk off your gourd and needed some heavy friend food to dissipate the feeling.

S"Have you ever glanced over a menu and had the urge to order practically everything, but resisted because you otherwise would have a plethora of to-go boxes to take home?  Well, thanks to small plate servings such as dim sum and tapas, adventurous foodies can now have their cake and eat (all of) it too!\n\nThis past weekend, a few friends and I trekked over to Sin City to celebrate a dear friend's twenty-seventh birthday.  After checking into the Vdara Hotel (which is simply gorgeous in a minimal and contemporary fashion), we taxied off the Strip and arrived at Firefly to meet with some new friends for birthday dinner #1.  Since some of us skipped on breakfast and/or lunch, the ladies and I got a tad carried away with ordering.  But hey, we were planning on sharing.  And you know what they say, sharing is caring!\n\nAmongst the extensive tapas offered, our entire group of seven probably ordered about a quarter to a third of the list (there were so many plates in rotation during dinner that I might have forgotten an item or few.)\n\n*Tuna Tar tare\nSmoked Salmon Toast\n*Stuffed Dates\nSausage Plate\nThai Beef Salad\nStuffed Peppers\n*Manchego Mac N Cheese\nFried Calamari\n*Steamed Mussels\nLobster 'Escargots'\n*Ham & Cheese Croquetas\nSteak & Mushroom Skewers\nCrispy Duck Roll\nPaella\n*Flavored Mojitos\n\n* = personal favorites\n\n Although all the plates were delicious, I had a few noteworthy items that I wanted to spotlight. \n\nStuffed Dates: It's been a few days since our tapas dinner yet I can still taste the delicious flavors of the dates.  The bacon that wrapped around the date & bleu cheese was cooked perfectly - slightly crispy but still chewy enough to enjoy each bite.  The sharpness of bleu cheese was a wonderful compliment to the sweetness of the dates, all enhanced with a red wine reduction glaze.\n\nSteamed Mussels:  I'm not a huge advocate of mussels, but these were pretty darn tasty.  No, not because of the mussels itself, but because of the aromatic coconut curry sauce that it basked in.  Coming from a Southeast Asian background, I have a strong appreciation for cuisines that infuse coconut into its entrees as well as desserts.  The concoction was so good that we were all dipping our bread into the sauce, long after the mussels cleared out.\n\nHam & Cheese Croquetas:  I absolutely love the chicken croquettes at Portos Bakery (Burbank, CA) and never failed to order some when I'm dining elsewhere.  The smokiness of the Serrano ham and the buttery texture of the melted Manchego cheese was a match made in food heaven.  If we didn't already have a quarter of the menu sprawled out on our table, I would have suggested ordering seconds!\n\nI was extremely surprised at the serving portions of each tapas plate.  After my last experience at Viva Madrid (Claremont, CA), I anticipated on having to pick up a snack on the way back to the hotel.  Luckily, that was far from the case at Firefly.  The portions were generous and sufficient to share amongst the seven of us.  Also, if a pitcher of mojitos is on your list, I would suggest the Mango flavored one - delish!\n\nWould it be wrong of me to say that I want to come back to LV just for Firefly?"

Very disappointing. \n\nThe menu is pretty huge with a little something for everyone. Our server recommended 2-4 plates per person though we totally over ordered, 4 plates each was a little to much for the 3 of us. Below is the laundry list of dishes we order along with quick comments. \n\n+Tomato bread is chewy bread topped with tomatoes though the juice of the tomato along with salt and vinegar has soaked into the bread making it really moist and flavorful. Loved it.\n\n-Artichoke toasts.. to be honest I don't even really remember eating these. I guess that would mean they were just alright. \n\n+Sausage plate was one of my favorites. Thin slices of various cured Spanish sausages along with mustard, pickles, olives etc.. \n\n+Tuna tartare was huge and for the price a great value. Super fresh tasting with a light seasoning just enough to enhance the flavor of the fish. Winner winner!  \nStuffed dates are addictive and their bacon wrapped version packs a whole lot flavor into one tiny bite.\n\n-Baked tetilla was alright, melted cheese really. There are better things to order.\n\n+Manchego Mac n cheese was pretty good. Nice and gooey with a decent crust. \n\n-Thai beef salad was the weakest dish. I'd say its more like Thai light as there really wasn't a whole lot of flavor from the beef or the dressing. I wouldn't order this salad again.\n\n+Pulpo asado, grilled octopus, was slightly chewy but had a decent amount of flavor. \n\n-Chicken and chorizo stuff mushrooms were insanely hot temperature wise, be warned. I thought they were just okay but probably wouldn't order these again either. \n\n-Ham and cheese croquetas had a good texture but not as tasty as one might imagine.  They needed dipping sauce.\n\n+Filet mignon sliders were pretty good though I wished that they came out hotter. \n\n+Baby back ribs were pretty awesome, sticky, porky meaty and satisfying. \n\nSo over all a good time with lots of tasty bites. Definitely great for either a light meal or like we had, a serious tapas feast. Be sure to make your reservations ahead of time!"

S"One of the best tapas restuarants I've been to.  My second favorite is the Firefly in Summerlin.\n\nI like the overall ambience here.  Everyone mingling and everyone having a good time. This place can bring you at ease. You almost feel like you're in a club in this location.  \n\nThis location get's pretty busy compared to the Summerlin location. So, expect a lot of people, but don't expect to wait. I've never had to wait to be seated at this place. \n\nWhether you're visiting or local, you have to try Firefly at least once. This a great place to hang out with friends, take a date or significant other, mistress, and even some co-workers to relieve some work related stress.  But I wouldn't suggest this place if you're taking the family out or if you're by yourself.  I've been to this location about 4 times and the Summerlin location 2 times.  Almost everytime, there's a group or single person not handling their liquor well.  \n\nMy Suggestions:\nArtichoke Toast\nMac N Cheese\nThe Skewers: Forgot the name but has shrimp, filet mignon, and some pork\nFried Calamari:  Not uncommon for us to order extra\nChicken Skewers\nPetite Filet\nStuff Mushrooms\n\nAll the portions are small and very inexpensive.  You can come out of here spending very little.  The drinks will cost you more than the food. The experience...priceless."

S"I had the privilege to go here for a girlfriend's 30th birthday party. There were just 6 of us and we were seated right away at a table near the door (which was perfect so we could see our friends arrive). We started with a pitcher of red sangria, which was absolutely perfect. It goes down WAY too easy.\n\nWe ordered dishes bit by bit. The highlights were:\nBacon wrapped dates - a must have whenever you come here\nLox on toasted brioche, creme fraiche, tomatoes, capers with a dill vinaigrette - So light and an excellent new find\nTomato basil bisque- I HATE tomato soup usually...until I tried this...served with a grilled cheese sandwich.\nCalamari - will a garlic lemon aioli...not good for you but so dang tasty\n\nThe only thing I wasn't a fan of was the ahi tuna skewers. They weren't awful but they just didn't do it for me. Too much pineapple and mango and not enough tuna. Gotta take the good with the bad.\n\nOur server was pretty attentive until the end. It was close to midnight and we wanted a round of shots to cheers the end of my friend's 20's. By the time he came back...there was 3 minutes left. We didn't get them until 5 minutes after so we were a bit bummed but still bid her last decade farewell.\n\nOverall it was a great night and we had a blast...will be back soon :)"

My wife and I have a handful of things that we enjoy, but after coming here many times with various people with different tastes, I have not had a bad dish here.  You can get out with a cheap lunch without drinks, but it is still reasonable for a full night of dinner and drinks.\n\nFirefly is packed late night, but if you can manage to get a seat it's a great late night snack."

S'I came here wanting to try a really good tapas restaurant and ever since , trying to find one to compare has been difficult back home. Their Manchego Mac n\' Cheese is a must because something about that cheese gives it that extra "mmph" in your mouth. You should definitely try their patatas bravas as well, they are different from your regular french fries because they are cut into cubes or thicker pieces and then cooked until the potatoes are crispy on the edges and soft on the insides, spiced with good seasoning and drizzled in creamy aioli. Service was great as well. I\'m just hoping my visit to Vegas will be very soon so that I could update my review for this place.'

S"4 1/2 stars. Came here about 8pm on a Sunday night. There were a handful of people waiting and although the hostess said it'd be a 20-25 min wait for our party of two, we got seated in 10 min! Several different dining areas- outside, the main inside, and another inside dining area adjacent to the main one accessible from a separate entrance. The interior was nice and somewhat dark, good for a date or even a large party.  \nThe mojito i ordered was really really good! I could've easily downed several although I kept it to one. I tried the red sangria which was good too but very light, almost watered down. We tried several of the waiter's suggestions- the stuffed dates (SOOO good), and the Tierra y mar (Shrimp, filet, sausage skewers) which was also good but not to die for.  The Tuna tartare was really really good! But the Grilled octopus was not what I expected. But I prefer raw over cooked octopus and I had the whole plate to myself which was even more unpalatable. The Petite filet was very good and the Fish sticks were so good and crunchy and meaty n tender on the inside. 6 tapas and the 2 drinks for $65. I would definitely return."

S"We were visiting Vegas and decided to go off the strip for some local flavor. Thanks to Yelp, I decided on Firefly and made reservations the same day. We arrived a little early, but even though it was very busy, they had our table ready. We ordered the camarones a la diabla, stuffed dates (they aren't mentioned 28 times on Yelp for nothing), empanadas, and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. Everything was yummy. I listened to Katelynn L's review and avoided the dishes she mentioned. I would suggest the first 3 dishes for sure. The mushrooms were good, but nothing special that I would reorder. \n\nBy the time we sat down and we finished our dinner, it was 30 minutes. Talk about the fastest service ever!! I don't think it was even 5 minutes before our dishes started coming out after we ordered. The food is wonderful, ambiance is dimly lit but fun. Seems like a great place to go to with a group. The server suggested 2 tapas per person and you can move on from there. We had a large lunch, so 4 plates were perfect. Its a 5 min cab ride to/from the strip, about $8. Its located in a strip mall behind the Palazoo. Cabs are abundant in the evenings when leaving and it seems to get really busy here even on a weekday. Our total bill was $35 and that was also with 2 glasses of sangria.\n\nIts a definite revisit next time I'm back in Vegas. I wish I was hungrier so I could have tried more of the tapas. I'm usually not a HUGE fan of tapas, but I love Firefly! We have a Baba-Reeba in Chicago and I would suggest this place over that, though I haven't tried the Baba-Reeba in Vegas."

The drinks are half price and the restaurant is less crowded.\n\nThe mango mojito was the best that I've ever tasted.\n\nWe ordered a lot of food and couldn't finish everything, so I'll just review the favorites. The mac 'n cheese was extra cheesy and creamy. The vegetables and lentils had a fresh citrus flavor. My boyfriend liked the duck dumplings, but thought that they had too much sauce (I'm sure that you could ask the chef to go light on the sauce). The ham and cheese croquets were my boyfriend's favorite. They looked like gourmet tater tots and were very creamy.\n\nEven though we were stuffed I ordered the caramel flan for dessert. It wasn't that gelatinous stuff that you get a Chevy's. It was delightfully creamy and smooth.\n\nGo to Firefly even though it's not on the strip.

The prices were decent and it's something different from the fast food court. We came to this specific location for lunch one day and we all got different things. I ordered the half salad and pasta de telefono. The salad was a spring mix and was good, and the pasta was very cheesy but since I enjoy cheese it was delicious.

A must-try if you\'re looking for just a tad bit of an adventure!\n\nAnd although my company was footing the bill, I was still peeved that many of the drinks (beers on tap, mixed drinks) did not have a price associated with them on the menu. \n\nI ordered a plain old (or so I thought!) caesar salad for dinner. It was under the "small salad" listing, but it was definitely large enough to share between two people and certainly big enough for an entree for one. I only ate half of mine. \n\nOverall, this was a great choice for a large group because of the diversity of the menu.

S"Summary: Fantastic!  Better than I remembered of the one in Beverly Hills.  Great food, selection, service, and value.  Nothing to complain about; only compliments.\n\nMy buddy and I were in town for CES and in need of a no-reservations-needed dinner at around 8pm on a Friday.  I had been to the Beverly Hills Grand Lux numerous times in years past and always enjoyed it, but it never really stood out as a great restaurant to me.  When I called this Grand Lux there was no wait time, so we made our way there from Caesar's and were immediately seated.\n\nWe ordered a couple of drinks (I ordered the house Chardonnay, which was by Beringer and was a great deal at $7 and really good), looked over the menu and decided to share a few items.  The three we chose were:\n\nShort rib sliders - Four little sliders on brioche buns, stuffed with super tender and flavorful braised short rib and topped with a creamy horseradish sauce.  Fantastic!\n\nAvocado-Chipotle Cheeseburger - A pretty massive cheeseburger.  Messy and kind of hard to eat, but with delicious ingredients.  A nice kick, too.\n\nSpicy Carnitas Sandwich - An excellent mix of textures and flavors.  Crisp on the outside and super tender on the inside.  A great sauce was provided with this one and it was delicious.\n\nEach of the entrees came with a side salad, so for around $35 we had a great quality meal and were satisfied with the quantity of food, too.  Can't recommend this place enough."

S"For years, the Grand Lux was the best 24 hour coffee shop in Vegas in my opinion.  I don't know if that's true now, places like Central at Caesars are certainly giving it a run for its money, as casinos are investing more thought and money into these 24 hour joints.  But, Grand Lux is certainly an excellent place to eat any time of day, and you'd be hard pressed to find better food in the middle of the night.\n\nThe menu is expansive, which is not surprising given that it's owned by the Cheesecake Factory folks.  Most sandwiches are a good bet in my experience; the club is a favorite of more than one visitor I've taken to Grand Lux.  The fries are good, but they are rarely seasoned.  The buffalo chicken spring rolls are a favorite of mine, whenever we get appetizers they get my vote.  They are made like traditional spring rolls, but with the buffalo and blue cheese flavor wing fans will like.  The Grand Lux Burger Melt is another menu item I've ordered more than once.  Served on grilled parmesan bread, it's a play on a patty melt.  Certainly not appropriate if you're looking for a light meal, but it's a great burger.\n\nMore than once, I've had the breakfast buffet in the morning.  It's very simple:  pastries, fruits, eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, etc.  But, it's all fresh and hot, and they make omelets or hash browns to order.  I prefer my hash browns extra crispy, so they made some and brought it to the table.  Since Venetian doesn't have a buffet, this is a nice option in the morning.\n\nFinally, I love the strawberry lemonade, but it's too sweet.  I get it without the sugar lining the rim, and that does the trick for me.\n\nService can be spotty during peak hours, but I've never had any major issues."

The guy that helped us made sure we had everything we needed so we wouldn't have to come back down from the room."

S'Oddly enough I\'m by no means a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but with the same people behind it I remained sketchy about eating here. However, after the breakfast I consumed here I just maybe have found a change of heart.\n\nI had a baja omelette I think it was called. It had loads of sour cream, veggies, and really felt like I was chowing down on a fajita, but without the meat. My wife had chilaquiles which was certainly the best I have tasted and had a perfect blend of kick, but not overpowering. \n\nWe went early morning so it certainly helped with the wait time as we got seated instantly. When we finished with our meal there was a giant line, but I think there was a huge party that was the root cause of that. Our waiter was amazing and very cordial during the entire meal which created an uplifting mood. \n\nI still get tripped out by saying (in the style of Arnold) "I\'ll be back"'

S'I guess the comparisons to cheesecake factory is fair.  But I think the food quality is better and their cooks aren\'t as sloppy.  \n\nI drove the herd here on a weekday morning for breakfast.  Just beat the morning rush hour....10am-ish. \n\nStarted with a "Paul Bunyan" sized Latte.  Very good.  Then I ordered the corn beef hash and eggs.  HANDS DOWN, the best CB Hash i\'ve ever had.  Sure its pricey, but its rare to see REAL chunks of shredded corn beef.  Not minced and ground like mush, but chopped strips of beef.  Damn....it was that good.  Throw in a couple of fresh eggs over easy, and wheat toast with preserves.  Definitely in my top 10 breakfasts of all time.\n\nI really liked the decor and seats.  All oversized so it was a big thumbs up for me....especially for those who are 6FT and over.... I was comfy.\n\nService can be spotty.  Servers can get preoccupied with shop talk, and they get distracted by other customers.  Otherwise, they were quite friendly, but hard to flag down.\n\nLooking forward to trying their lunch and dinner menu someday.  It looked pretty amazing.'

S'I hadn\'t planned on eating here. The only reason we went was because I had a huge hangover from the night before and it was the closest restaurant to the bottom of the elevator. We headed in at about 2 in the afternoon for a nice breakfast to get the morning going and the restaurant was virtually empty. We were a party of 8 and we were sat immediately. We were "that" table and our group kept growing by one or two people but the wait staff was gracious enough to let us slide a couple of tables over to accommodate. \n\nThe service was quite good. As soon as I sat down the waitress asked me what I wanted to drink and took my order as soon as I put down the menu. I\'m not sure if anyone asked but she also took the liberty of separating all our checks to simplify the paying process (although I know it made it much more difficult for her).  \n\nThe food took quite a while to come out which is pretty standard for any large table (about 25 min from order to table), but the manager came out and apologized for the long wait and brought us some warm bread to tide us over until the food came out. The food was pretty solid. I got a burger and thank God this is one of the few places that will actually serve you a burger rare. The meat was perfectly cooked or not cooked depending how you look at it. The fries were acceptable.  \n\nWhile I was sitting there feeling like death I kept thinking that the place looked like a more spacious Cheesecake Factory. Little did I know that the restaurant is actually from the same people who made the Cheesecake Factory. I guess alcohol makes you more perceptive.'

S"Stayed at the Venetian for my vegas trip so it was convenient to pop down here for breakfast with a suite buddy.\n\nWe were not aware the we'd be charged like $5 bucks each for wine glass full of grapefruit juice and orange juice. I'll wave that off since we know prices get hefty in Vegas. \n\nI got the  Best Eggs Benedict with Ham & Hollandaise. The egg was cooked perfectly and the sourdough on the bottom was toasted well too but I guess i just didn't like the Hollandaise sauce. It was a bit too rich for me. Scraping it all to the side, the dish was made a bit more edible. Perhaps the style of egg preparation is just not for me. \n\nWe also got the Red Velvet Pancakes. Those were better tasting when smothered with the cream cheese frosting otherwise they were a bit dry. I probably shouldn't have mixed the sweet and savory together as stomach felt queasy afterwards. \n\nI probably wouldn't come here again for breakfast but perhaps give it another shot for lunch or dinner.  \n\nI give it 3 stars still for I like the decor of the cafe and the service was nice still :)."

S"Like the two star description says. Meh. I've experienced better. You think you are in Cheesecake Factory, minus the cheesecake. Same huge ass menu, comparable prices, but the only difference is that the Cheesecake Factory has better food. I have been three times to this one in The Venetian and each time the food was just eh. Granted the last time I went I was bombed and don't even remember what or how I ordered. I got some sort of burger with Thousand Island on some sort of bread that resembled 10 grit sandpaper. I have scars in my mouth to prove it. \n\nThere are two redeeming qualities for this location only: 1) It is in Vegas, so at least that means I am there and that always puts a smile on my face & B) One trip we were fortunate enough to observe a drunken woman get into an argument with another table from outside the restaurant. Said woman proceeded to grab plates from an empty table and hurl them toward the other party involved in the argument. She was subsequently carried off by security."

They also always seem to be open and busy regardless what time of the day it is. THat's always a good sign. And the service is quick which makes waiting for a table a quick process!\n\nYes, it's similar to the Cheesecake Factory with their menu diverse and offers almost everything. But not to worry, despite their vast menu, the quality of food has NEVER suffered! The portions are huge but I never take it with me simply because my hotel room lacks a fridge and microwave for reheating purposed. The salads are always on point, fresh & crisp and not doused in heavy dressings. The pastas are always rich and creamy, and the sandwiches and appetizers are delicious. They also have great lunch combos for a great price and the breakfast meals are dynamite. Again, the portions are huge, even if it's only lunch for for the great menu pricing and quality, its worth it!"

S'Came here for a late breakfast/early lunch and was thoroughly impressed. This place is HUGE! So many cavernous twists and turns once you actually enter, so don\'t let any line outside discourage you.\n\nThey have a ~16 dollar breakfast buffet, filled with standards such as omelets, bagels, jams, breakfast meats, etc.., but I had the lunch offerings. The Modern Cuban sandwich looked appetizing, so I ordered it and GOOD LORD it was huge, just like everything else in Vegas, except me if you get my drift : ( . AND THAT WAS THE LUNCH PORTION!\nThe flavor was out of this world, too. Prosciutto, roast pork, Swiss cheese, and a sort of jalapeno mayo sauce made this sandwich delicious. My only complaint is that it was way too greasy, but luckily the flavor more than compensated. The fries served alongside it were pleasant as well - crispy and not too salty.\n\nMy girlfriend had the lunch portion of some sort of Asian-inspired salad, topped with crunchy noodles and peanuts. I must say, I am afraid to know how big the "dinner" portion is... The salad was fresh-tasting, probably owing to the cilantro, and had good textural contrasts between the soft leaves and the crunchy noodles and peanuts.\n\nAnother complaint besides overly-greasy sandwich is a general complaint I\'ve noticed of Vegas eateries: overpriced juice drinks. You can get a sandwich that will feed a multi-generational south Vietnamese family for a fortnight for less than a nice T-shirt, but a small glass of fresh-squeezed juice will run you almost $6. Oh well. \nFOOD\'S STILL GOOD GIT\'R DONE.'

S'Stopped by this place for a late dinner with my brother. They must do great business seeing as they\'re open almost 24 hours. The cafe is a lot bigger than it looks from the front, with some seating in the front (with view of the casino floor) and a huge space in the back. The service was good overall, and the waiter didn\'t stop by so many times that he became annoying (props), but on to the food.\n\nWhat people say is true, the Asian Nachos are pretty good. Sweet, tangy, savory, and salty with crispy wonton chips and meaty chopped chicken. A plate of these is pretty much a meal in itself.\n\nThe avocado-chipotle burger and the delux drive-in burger were both decent, but super greasy.The portion sizes are good though, and they give you a choice to swap sides. I had the salad w/ vinaigrette and it was good (left me feeling a little less fat). But I\'ve been spoiled by Austin so my standards for burgers is a bit skewed...\n\nPrice-wise, it\'s a bit expensive, but I guess "regular/cheap" for Vegas. It\'s a good place to stop by if your hungry and it\'s late.'

I would only eat here from now on only if its during late night, preferably after a night of clubbing. My friend ordered the Portobello burger. it was so good and juicy. I cant remember too much of it because I was drunk. I'm sure it wasn't my drunk tastebuds but everyone else took a bite of it and thought it was pretty good. but then again all my friends were drunk when we had it. I don't know if that even counts. =/ \nI had their Omelet too. actually it was a leftover but I had it when i was sober and it was pretty good. but yeah, as I mentioned earlier, I would only come here for  super late night since it is 24 hour. other than that, No."

S"I have been to the Grand Lux for dinner 4 times - twice here and twice at the Palazzo.  All 4 times, I've had the crispy caramel chicken.  It's an excellent dish with good tasting, deep fried battered chicken with a caramel glaze.  The glaze is a bit on the sweet side, but I like it.\n\nLast night, I stayed true to form and ordered that.  I had a choice of brown or white rice and I went with the brown.  DInner was very good.  My wife had the Madeira chicken.  It was served with very creamy, good tasting mashed potatoes.  We shared a piece of chocolate cake for dessert.  It was huge.\n\nService was a bit slow last night, but we got here at the height of the busy time with people wanting to have dinner before going to see Phantom as was the case with us.  We had plenty of time and I didn't obsess with the time factor because I knew we were good.\n\nOur server boxed our leftovers--dinner tonight--and brought it back quickly.  I had time to walk it to the car in the garage and put it in the cooler I brought anticipating a take out box or boxes.  I wish they had more large small plates on their menu.  Or if they would just downsize any of their meals for a downsized price.\n\nMy only complaint with Grand Lux is the level of the music.  It was not on when we first arrived. 10 minutes later, someone must have realized and they fired up the sound system.  At one point, it was so loud, I had to almost yell for my wife to hear me.  It got so bad, I downloaded an app for my iPhone and the decibel level averaged about 85 all the time we were there.  At times it spiked in the 90s and near 100.  That's just too loud!!

For night number 2, I had developed a strange craving for soup. Had a generous bowl of the vegetable and loved it from the first bite to the last. Probably some of the best veggie soup I've had...ever. Might have been the alcohol talking, but I stand by my judgement.

I Got the banana brioche french toast and my mind was blown.  Not only was practically just a loaf of bread cut in half and turned into french toast, but it was really freaking good.

S'Most people know that the one chain restaurant  I am typical fan of is the Cheesecake Factory. Little did we know that this restaurant (and it\'s sister at the Palazzo, is in the same family as CF). We ended up here several time during our stay due to various reasons.\nOur first night here, we ended up having dinner due to the lateness of our check-in and simply being starving. We had a great waiter, and though the restaurant may be a sister to the CF, the menu is mostly different. The bread here is delicious and very crusty and basically a vehicle for butter. Great crust-and great butter. I ordred the four cheese pizza and added mushrooms and asked for the pizza to be cooked "well done".The husband ordered the chicken pot pie. When our meals arrived, the pot pie was in a GIANT bowl, covered with crust and my pizza was served Roman style (oblong not round) and was more chewy then I like. A few bites in, Kevin and I switched dishes. He loved the pizza as it was very flavorful, but texturally more to his liking. The pot pie had one of the most delicious crusts I have ever had, but the innards were kind of bland and boring. I had a crust and chicken dinner. We were too full for dessert.\n\nThe second time we came here was for dessert after the Jersey Boys where we learned that the dessert menu differs from the same restaurant in the Palazzo and our group was disappointed because we dined at the Grand Lux for dinner(at the P)and had our hearts set on certain desserts that weren\'t offered here. We did manage to order the strawberry shortcake (yummy) the key lime pie (good but afterwards a bit too tongue tart and the banana pudding with home made vanilla wafers. The wafers were the best part of this dessert, but the pudding itself was cloyingly sweet and our waitress wasn\'t too excited for our table of 6 only ordering dessert and water.\n\nOur third and last time at this location was for lunch with 2 of my girlfriends from high school who flew in on my birthday day. They were starving and chose to come here since they were also staying at the Venetian. We came down a bit after they had been there and had already ordered.  I had the miso salmon (a staple order for me at the regular CF) and it was much better here than what I have had at any CF with more vegetables, no butter sauce and a little kick. Kevin had the lunch  size pepperoni pizza and salad and the pizza was actually small enough to fit on the same plate as the salad. I had a bit, it was too greasy for me, but that is because of the pepperoni. My friends\' had a Cuban and a Carnitas sandwich both served with fries and they both loved what they ordered. \n\nOf course the meal was served with the good vehicle for butter and yes, I had my fill.\n\nThis place is open 24 hours, with a late night menu, a breakfast menu a lunch time menu and the regular menu. If this was a place close to me, I would be a regular and not have shame since it was good.'

S'Inside the Venetian hotel, this is where you go to eat if:\n\n1. You don\'t want to pay an arm and a leg at the higher end, celebrity chef restaurants\n2. You\'re losing but you don\'t want your S. O. or family to know it\n3. You are broke, but you don\'t want to eat Mall food in either of the 2 food courts\n4. The dinner show was sold out\n5. Cheesecake Factory is your favorite restaurant\n6. You want to stay close to the "Wizard of Oz" slot machines in hopes of getting one when it opens up\n7. You are tired of walking from the Sands Convention center all the way to your room, so you stop here to rest and eat\n\nThe Grand Lux Cafe is a moderately priced, large and usually noisy restaurant at the hub of activity in the Venetian. It is between the room elevators, the escalators to the self-park parking garage, some shops, an information and ticket buying booth for shows, and the casino floor, and near the grand walkway to the lobby.\n\nIt has a large menu with something for everyone, with most entrees around $15 - $25.  Very much like the Cheesecake Factory, since this restaurant was designed by the creators of the Cheesecake Factory, that ubiquitous faux fine dining restaurant so popular with the suburban mall rat crowd.\n\nActually, I had a pretty good salmon entree here, well presented and not too expensive. The two Gin and Tonics helped my enjoyment. \n\nService is slower, though, but you should be able to find something reasonably tasty to satisfy your poor, tired soul here in the town that wasn\'t built on winners.\n\nI forgot to see what Cheesecakes they offer here.'

S"These are my favorite coffee shops in Las Vegas.  The restaurants are clean, spacious and have an ambiance you can't beat.  The menu is extensive and the food is prepared like you're at a gourmet restaurant.  The pasta dishes are amazing, the meat dishes delightful and your appetizers, soups and salads are way above average.  Service is great, but sometimes spotty, but the portions make up for this slight defect.  Go hungry and expect a better meal than at the Cheesecake Factory."

S'We came here for a quick dinner before heading out for the night. Since we were staying at the Venetian, we decided to just keep it simple and eat close by. Luckily, there was not a long wait for a party of 6.\n\nLet me just put it out now. RUDE SERVICE!\nI don\'t care if it\'s Vegas or not vegas, if you\'re a server, you should have a good attitude no matter what restaurant or location you\'re at. Our server, I shall leave his name out of this review, was rude the moment he came to our table and asked for drinks. We had already been drinking all day at the pool and all we wanted were waters. He gave us this look of disgust and made a comment along the lines of just waters?... And just kind of walked away to let us look over the menus. It would have been nice too to introduce yourself too, sir.\n\nFinally when he came back to take our orders, I asked him if they put the ranch on the side or on the Buffalo Wings appetizer dish and he looked at me as if I were asking a stupid question. His reply was "So you want it on the side...? Or just extra on the side...?" I then had to explain to him to leave the ranch on the side because I was allergic to dairy and eggs. He then straight up said "Well then you can\'t have them!! It has all of those in it" in a tone of voice assuming I\'m supposed to know this?! Forget it then. We ended up ordering the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for an appetizer and when it came to entrees, I ordered the Clams with Pasta dish. I asked him what kind of noodles they used and he said, "Egg noodles. You can\'t have that either!" I asked if they could substitute the noodles for non-egg noodles and he started listing off random noodles I barely recognized by name. I guess I had a confused look on my face because he just sighed and asked if I just wanted rice noodles instead. Done. Oh, and by the way, throughout this whole conversation over food allergies, this guy has the nerve to laugh and joke about it....\n\nFood comes out, he doesn\'t even come back to check on us until after we\'re almost done and it\'s only to ask if we wanted boxes. Honestly, this place is open 24/7 and I know for sure I would come back here after a night of drinking, but if all the servers here had this guys attitude, I would rather go to Denny\'s. Looking at the other reviews, it seemed like our table just got bad luck and got this horrible server. Overall, the food is pretty good with big portions. I would probably compare this place to a Cheesecake Factory with a Maggiano\'s ambiance.'

S'So it\'s after midnight, you\'re staying in the Venetian and realise that since you slept in and thus had lunch at 3pm, and then had tickets to a show at 9pm so didn\'t eat beforehand, you\'re now starving and there\'s not a lot of options.  You could walk down the strip to one of those $5 steak-and-eggs places, or the $1 hot dogs, or you could stay in the hotel and go to the only restaurant that\'s still open.\n\nSo you make the obvious mistake.  It\'s not really a restaurant, it\'s actually a slightly-modified version of the Cheesecake Factory.  Any place that has the word "factory" in the name isn\'t a restaurant.  They\'re serving you something that might once have had something in common with food but was sent to a factory, fried and then frozen, and then shipped out all over the US to be heated up in microwaves.  They\'re serving you food that is actually worse than Hot Pockets.\n\nMy waiter was totally stoned.  I don\'t just mean a little stoned, I mean falling over himself and barely able to walk upright.  Everyone seated in his section kept on looking at each other and rolling their eyes at him.  He thought he was suave and pulling it off, and was so stoned that he never noticed the giggling from everyone who had to deal with him.  Even the busboy was making fun of him.\n\nThe food is just what you\'d expect from a Cheesecake Factory: fried food in massive portions and completely lacking in flavor.  It\'s totally quantity over quality.  It has exactly two redeeming qualities: it\'s available at 2am, and it doesn\'t require you to leave the hotel.  But next time, do yourself a favor and walk down to get the $5 steak-and-eggs.  You won\'t hate yourself so much afterwards.'

S"Stayed at Venetian for Labor Day weekend and for 2 nights, we had dinner here.  The portions are huge and the prices are fair, if not bordering on affordable.  A big juicy burger (chop house or mushroom) weighs in at about 1/3 lb with a huge serving of fries on the side for only about $13!!!!  The grilled chicken avocado salad is fresh and delicious, the portion serves 2 people (one if you're ravenous and will fill you to the brim!) for $14.  The Manhattan salad with the option of vegetables and cheese (other options include, chicken, shrimp, and price varies accordingly) rang in about $14.  They don't skimp on the cheese or beans or dressing either!  I eat a lot and the salads were filling!  Complimentary sourdough and butter came with the salads.  I think I got about 3 to 4 large slices of sourdough per salad.  How generous is that for a $14 meal?  Dinner for 2 cost under $35!  Much cheaper and fresher than other expensive places in Vegas.  After spending lots of money at a mediocre buffet (Bacchanal to be exact) with below par quality, this place was a delight!  Fresh quality with large portions at affordable prices is like a dream!  Presentation is worthy of any fine dining (maybe I exaggerate here, haha).  This place is open 24 hours too!"

Luckily there was no wait so we got in right away.  I ordered a sun dried tomato pasta and my friend got the Madeira Chicken .  My pasta was bland and was nothing special at all...but my friend's chicken was really good and luckily it was huge so he shared it with me.  \n\nThe service was O.K., again nothing special.  It's a nicely designed restaurant and you do get HUGE portions for the price.  I would probably split a meal here next time since taking food to go if you are staying in a hotel is not really option...and who wants to cart around a box of leftovers while gambling?  I liked the one in the Beverly Center more than this one.  I'd be back again if I was looking for some good food at a decent price."

So we ventured to the one in the Venetian that is 24/7.\n\nValerie G. and I were craving some carbs, so we decided to share the "Pasta With Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella". I\'m sooo glad we shared because the portion size is gigantic. We don\'t remember much (in fact it took about 10 minutes for us to correctly remember what we ordered) but what we do remember is that the pasta was amazing and totally hit the spot. Also the waitress was super nice and non-judging. Definitely a great (and possibly only) place to get some late night food especially after a night of BUR and pineapples...;)'

Finally got to try it during my last trip out there. \nThe wait was ridiculous for inside seating (2 hours +) so we decided to grab some food inside of the Ceasar's food court then later go back to their outside window to order some frozen hot chocolates. \nThe line was pretty long still for the outside and we figured out why when we got up to the window FINALLY.. the guy who was working was all by himself struggling to juggle everything all at once, poor guy.\nWe had 7 girls so we shared two large frozen hot chocolates which are made for two people but it was just enough, just get extra straws if you're going to do so. It was really good but truthfully tasted like a typical chocolate milkshake but more chocolate flavorings which was good, I also actually liked the grittiness from the mixture.\nIt was good to try but not worth the $8.00"

It took him a very long time to bring drinks. \n\nThe food was good, not phenomenal, but not at all bad. I had the house made veggie burger. It was made of mostly grains (rather than beans). The sweet potato fries were good, not greasy, but could have been warmer. The steak fries were awesome.\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared a frozen hot chocolate. It was good, but I am not sure it really warranted the $11 price tag (no alcohol) for a regular size. \n\nI would go back here intentionally for a sundae.'

S'Ugh. I was made to go here because I have family in town and they really don\'t understand my values are a big deal to me. If I boycott a place I don\'t care if I\'m starving I won\'t do it. But the louder of opinions in the group won and I have no say since it isn\'t my vacation. So the BF and I kept them company while they ate their over priced and over rated items. \n\nThere wasn\'t anything that was gonna get us to order something or even taste what people are ordering so I have nothing much to say on food and will just quote what people said at the table. \n\nMy one brother who\'s definitely a foodie wasn\'t happy with his frozen chocolate what he said was "a melted milkshake" and he would have been better off "with a In N Out milkshake". Then I found out he wanted to come with me instead to Max Brenner. *sigh* (And we did go the next day while family shopped). Another brother got coffee and it was nothing special. The kids liked their desserts, but they\'re KIDS. I can put sugar on roaches and they\'d think it\'s a crunchy goodtime. My sister had a sundae and it was fairly standard. My cousin had a cake that was super in size and had a lot of leftovers but he said it was good. \n\nService wasn\'t rude this time, but it wasn\'t really hitting service standards. It was more like- take the order, bring it, and if you need the check go find them. Desserts took about 35 minutes to come. One person came late and ordered after everyone else. They got a slice of cake and that didn\'t come around until way later when most people had their desserts done....Cake doesn\'t even need to be prepared so it shouldnt take 50 minutes to receive it! Just put it on a fucking plate and add whip cream and a strawberry.\n\nWell, just confirms to me- I wasn\'t just "hating" in my first review, this place isn\'t that great with service nor expediting orders.  Dessert shouldn\'t take almost 2 hours specially since we\'re one of the last reservations of the night. \n\nStop buying into brand names. Serendipity lost the charm that made it sucessful in the first location decades ago. Serendipity doesn\'t live to its name and is just bad misfortune with each visit. \n\nAVOID.'

I understand that it's hot, but it's shaded & actually nice to see out there. Oh well, all I cared about was that we got seated right away. \n\nSince we were definitely going out that night, my friend & I wanted something filling. We went with the cheeseburger. We asked to get it cut it in half, & there's a fee! So not worth it. We were able to cut it ourselves with a plastic knife. The cheeseburger was a cheeseburger. It was good, but not like wow. Also, it had a HUGE bottom bun. It was too big that we both took it off & finished the remainder of our meal.\n\nService was good. Nothing outstanding, but it was fine.

On a hot day outside, it certainly hit the spot. It wasn't too sweet and it was frosty enough but not too much to be the same as ice cream. And this was just the starter. \n\nMy Central Park Omelet came with egg whites, spinach, and avocado with a side of potatoes. You'd think it's the same potatoes you get with other breakfast entrees...you know, the kind that you slather on tons of ketchup because it'd be bland otherwise. But nooo, not these potatoes. These were crisp like chicken nuggets and had seasoning, so it was yummy by itself. Pair that with a bite of the omelet and I was on my way to food coma. \n\nBut wait! You can't leave Serendipity without an order of their ice cream sundae. They all looked good, but I settled on the deep fried Oreo and cream sundae. Five deep fried Oreos sitting on a mountain of cookies and cream ice cream, whipped cream, marshmallow fluff, more bits of normal Oreos, with a cherry on top. OMG, so much sugar. The deep fried Oreos are enough to do you in. By this point, water refills were a life saver. Sadly, I couldn't finish the sundae after having two deep fried Oreos and a lot of spoonful of the ice cream, but I would not hesitate to return to try some of the other less decadent sundaes.

That cost $15.\n\nOverall, the food was just whatevers. Don\'t get me wrong, it was delicious...but for that amount of money...WASN\'T WORTH IT. Its hard to mess up on potato skins and the pizza, eh...it was good.\n\nWe can\'t come here without trying to frrrozen hot chocolate. \nWe ordered a mint frrrozen hot chocolate and a peanut butter cup milkshake $10 and $11 respectively. In MY opinion, it was nothing special. It SOUNDS neat but really, my mint frrrozen hot chocolate tasted like a mint milkshake. If you put a serendipity3 frozen hot chocolate and a jack in the box milkshake next to me, blindfold my eyes and ask me which is which, i wouldn\'t be able to tell. What\'s even more disappointing is THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $10 FOR AN EFFIN MILKSHAKE is just not worth it.

Sure it looks pretty, but it's a small portion just over mounded with whipped cream.  Dine in, you can probably split with a friend or two, but when you get it to go, you can see how little you get for that $11.  Overpriced.  You are better off geting real food here, which is mediocre at best.\n\nSkip."

S"First of all, this place should be in New York, New York (the original hails from NYC) and its decor is def. too pink compared to the original resto (more romantic, and more aligned with the movie it was named after).\n\nAnyway, came here just for the frozen hot chocolate (I had one from the original ages ago and wanted to compare) - NYC's Serendipity's in my memory was def. better. Nonetheless, there wasn't much of a line when I went, which is a plus (I remember when I went to NYC's Serendipity, I waited maybe three hours??).\n\nAnyway, come here to try their famous frozen hot chocolate, but I would say skip the food for sure. Much better food on the strip."

S"I went here because of John Cusack!\n\nNo idea there was a Serendipty in Vegas, but I'm super glad there is. \n\nAnd even though tall, dark, and handsome wasn't there, the famous frozen hot chocolate was. I'm so happy it wasn't over-hyped. Tasted like ... creamy, slushy Ovaltine. With real whip cream. If I had enough room, I would've wanted another one. \n\nIt's way expensive ($16.50 for a burger!), but it's Vegas. At least the portions are HUGE. The boy ordered the steak sandwich and it was as long as his arm (it was really good, too). I had the uber juicy burger with avocado, brie (my favorite cheese on a burger - you don't see it often as an option), and caramelized onions. The onion rings were crispy and the batter was tasty, but I didn't think it went with the parmesan that was dusted on top. Big con was that the french fries were OVERLY salted. AND because it was sea salt there were huge chunks of salt everywhere. \n\nThe outdoor area is nice, the indoors is fun and flirty, and the fried oreos are ... sin. Try one. And one is pretty much enough."

S"I had bookmarked the place and then decided not to go based on the reviews, but my friends wanted to celebrate a birthday there. In order to cut costs (we are all poor students!), we decided to split everything. It worked out perfectly! We had appetizer, entree, and two desserts! I paid about $18, which included tax and gratuity. I was full, but not overstuffed and I thought it was well worth it. We didn't try their famous frozen hot chocolate, but did have the banana split and got a red velvet chocolate sundae on the house. Both were delicious and totally satisfied my chocolate craving! Yummy yum yum.\n\nThe onion rings weren't bad either. They were nice and crunchy. A friend and I shared the pesto italian pizza. It's a flatbread style pizza that's a decent size. If I were really hungry, I would've wanted it all to myself. The wait was about 30 mins. for a party of 8. Not bad."

S"Well. This was disappointing.\n\nI guess it's a good thing this restaurant is in Las Vegas, because I was already expecting to spend exorbitant amounts of money on really stupid things that I would grow to regret, and that's exactly what I did.\n\nI was looking forward to trying a frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity 3. I love dessert, and it was about 6,000 degrees outside. The restaurant was conveniently located just outside of our hotel, so we trudged our way over and placed our orders at the take-out window in the back (for those customers who are not in the mood for a sit-down meal). We then forked over $11 each, received our drinks (the basic Frrrozen Hot Chocolate) and trudged over to the seating area closest to the water misters.\n\nMaybe it would have been better to sit down and order inside the restaurant. Who knows? All I know is that I was very saddened by my frozen hot chocolate. Because that sounds really fancy! That sounds like it should be exotic and delicious! But after a sip or two, it dawned on me that we'd totally just spent $11 on a glorified chocolate milkshake that was probably worth $2-3 at most.\n\nThere is nothing interesting, exciting or innovative about the frozen hot chocolate at all. It's not even that tasty. I had been taken for a ride. I will be happy to never return to Serendipity 3.\n\nBut I do like the font they use on their menu."

S"So many visits to Vegas and never had a chance to try Serendipity 3 until my last vacation there. You walk in to this awesome colorful room filled with a ton of people trying all of Serendipity's creations. After about a 10 minute wait we were escorted to the patio overlooking the strip. Although it was freezing they have fire heaters which helped.\n\nThey handed us this huge menu and gave us the challenge of picking just a few items (when really I wanted to try it all!) I ordered the obvious frozen hot chocolate, thanks to some show on the Food Network or Travel Channel. My husband got a chocolate cake sundae, which could have fed at least two people. We also ordered crab spinach dip which was alright. Just when I thought I had enough the waiter brought out cotton candy martini's for another table. After starring down the martini hoping it would levitate to my table, I ordered one as well. I think the fun of seeing the puffy sugar turn into liquid was more entertaining then drinking it, but maybe mine was made a little strong. \n\nOverall we had an awesome experience. Thanks to Deon, our waiter. He did a great job! I almost didn't want to leave! That was until we saw the check. The place is not cheap! Cant wait for our next trip!"

S"Decent place if you want to gorge down on some rather hefty portions, but for the price you pay, there's much better places to spend your money at in Vegas.\n\nSo it doesn't even compare to the original Serendipity in NYC, but on a scorching day walking around the strip, cooling down with a bowl of frozen hot chocolate is a genius idea...so you'd think. It's a shame that they can even manage to mess THAT up. How hard is it to use a blender? I'd like to not sip on cubes of ice in my slushy, thanks. Granted, they do have more flavors of the frozen hot chocolate here (Oreo, peanut butter, mint, etc.). If you want to keep it strictly Vegas-style, the bartender will even throw in a shot of rum for that extra umph. Of course, for an extra $10, I'd rather gamble away at the tables and order a few cocktails there instead...\n\nI can't say I'm able to compare the actual food to the NYC location since I've only tried desserts, but the mac n' cheese here was pretty legit. However, for $14?? I can buy 14 boxes of Kraft for that and be just as satisfied."

S'This popular facsimile of the iconic New York outpost is a tourist trap, no doubt about it. But it\'s a trap that is still fun to take the kids. Desserts are the main draw here, with plenty of frozen hot chocolate and sundae options available. Portion sizes for desserts and all other food are huge, so sharing is the best option.\n\nDessert was the main reason my son and I stopped by, but we knew we had to eat some real food for dinner before indulging in sweets. The crab cake sandwich ($19) was massive.  A jumbo lump crab cake with a tolerable amount of filler was topped with beefsteak tomatoes, avocado, and an orange aioli. Those savory items with hints of sweetness sat in between an unusually large bun. The only ways to eat it are to smash it down to fit in your mouth or grab a knife and fork and eat it one small piece at a time. An order of the kid\'s chicken strips ($8.95) come 3 per order with a honey mustard sauce and ranch, along with carrot and celery sticks that my son avoided like the plague. He wasn\'t crazy about the chicken either. Suffering from a hard breading covering dry meat, he barely finished half his meal. \n\nMoving on to what we both viewed as the "main course" we quickly agreed on the red velvet sundae ($14). Substituting chocolate for the vanilla ice cream listed on the menu, the massive dessert served in a goblet had a large chunk of moist and dense cake stuck to one side with hot fudge, whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles topping it all. It was plenty satisfying, but far from refined. The quality doesn\'t warrant the hefty price tag as it\'s a dessert that one can replicate at home for far less.\n\n2.5 Stars'

We arrived at 1 and was asked to come back at 930. Forget that! \nSerendipity is located outside of Caesar and it\'s definitely such a cute place a girl will totally noticed it first hand! Anyways, the line was pretty long so we decided that we were gonna go get the frozen hot chocolate at their "to go" section. Along with this we order their massive chili cheese dog and some fries.

S"I came here twice this month and the first time, my friends and I dined in the restaurant and the second time, we ordered at the to-go window and dined outside.\n\nThe dine-in experience I would give a 4 star while the to-go menu was disappointing and deserved a 3 star.\n\nAs for the dine-in, we waited about 40 minutes and they gave us a hand held alarm to notify us when we were ready to go up.  We had a party of 8 the first time and the interior is brightly decorated with a lot of pink.\n\nWe were seated and then proceeded to order drinks.  We came around noon so they still had the breakfast menu.  It goes until 2pm.  Anyhow, some of the people in my party ordered a few alcoholic drinks which they seemed to enjoy.  The real winner was the food.  The orders I remember were the steak sandwich and the waffles topped with all sorts of berries.  \n\nThe steak sandwich wasn't of the greatest quality but none the less, the size and presentation was impressive.  The bread was a little hard and hard to bite and hurt the roof of my mouth a little.  It also came with egg, bacon and of course, the steak.  All in all, it was an enjoyable and tasty dish which was big enough to feed at least two people.  That's not even including the french fries that came with it. \n\nI also ordered waffles with berries on top along with caramel and whipped cream i believe.   As for that, they were decent waffles.  Not the best I've had, but similar to the steak sandwich, they were of large quantity.\n\nService was great.  Our waitress was very polite, had a great sense of humor, and very prompt.  I think her name was Candace.\n\nAs for my second experience, it was pretty lousy in comparison.  3 of my friends and I went to the to-go window and ordered a few frozen drinks, hot dogs, and nachos.  We ordered the chili cheese hot dog, hot dog with sour kraut, frozen hot chocolate, and a berry smoothie.  The hot dogs were very disappointing because both the quality and the presentation were not to the level of what we'd expect.  I'd rather go to Pink's Hot Dog stand which had a more delicious hot dog at a lower price.  The smoothie I had tasted fine but didn't justify the $10 price that came with it.  \n\nAnyhow, if you go here, don't expect the best quality food.  Expect decent food with a large quantity.  Avoid the to-go window at all costs.  Its not worth the price in my opinion."

Since this place was close to the Linq, a friend and I decided to eat here.\n\nThere was a helpful banner that said that the restaurant was open which was nice since it looked like part of the outside was under construction. We entered from the side and the hostess greeted us warmly before directing us to a table. The decor was a little goofy looking, but I liked it.\n\nThe menu was huge and it took a bit for me to figure out what to order. It finally came down to ordering a portobello mushroom burger with fries because I love mushrooms. My friend ordered a salad with a crab cake.\n\nThe food arrived and the first bite of my burger was amazing.

I didnt get to taste it, but the friend who ordered it said its soooooo gooood.  good enough for me!\n\nIf you\'ve been to Hash House a Go Go on the west side, this place to me is like the dessert/super casual version of it.  The portions are big, and seriously should be shared for anyone watching what they\'re eating (i.e. me).  \n\nSuch a fun place, I highly recommanded especially when the weather is nice outdoor, you get to sit right on the Strip!

And I fell in love with the sundae-shaped topiary covered in lights that was outside. And the curvy, womanly torso-shaped hostess stand.\n\nDefinitely try the frozen hot chocolate. I would recommend splitting it with someone, unless you are serious about your frozen drinks. I ordered the Raspberry Truffle, which was a frozen hot chocolate the size of my head, with alcohol, and piled high with whipped cream. Add in the chocolate shavings and raspberries, and I did not need dessert.\n\nFor dinner, I picked the foot-long chili cheese dog. Looking at the menu, there were quite a few things I would have picked. But I had a burger that morning at 5 (long night) and had pizza for lunch, so I went with the hot dog. Bad choice. It was huge (I'm talking circumference). There was no way I was picking that thing up to take a bite. Which is probably why they serve it with a big knife. The hot dog was also really salty. I couldn't eat more than 3 or 4 bites. The waffle fries are a must, though. The sweet potato fries are also good, but the waffle fries win in my book. One friend ordered a cheeseburger and enjoyed it. Another friend had the grilled cheese with tomato soup and also liked her food. So, I'd just stay away from the foot-longs.\n\nThe food and drinks were a little pricey, but not when you consider you're eating in Vegas, right on the strip. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely go back for dessert.

The cafe is located just outside of Caesar's Palace and we took the tram to Excalibur, hopped over a few bridges, and arrived to discover there's a 30 minute wait.  Boo!\n\nIt was cold so we stayed inside and took in the decor.  It's a candy striped wall, plenty of pinks and girly stuff.  The girl inside of you will squeal in delight or be annoyed by all the pink stuff.  I didn't mind it too much.  \n\nWe got the pasta dish and the bacon cheeseburger. Our food wasn't bad but the pasta was overwhelming.  Having pasta the night before and having it again probably wasn't such a good idea.  It tastes good at first when it's nice and hot but as it starts to cool and the cheese starts to congeal, it gets boring and overwhelming.  I don't think I'll eat pasta again until another race.  \n\nWe didn't have room for dessert but we did order the hot chocolate.

S"$11 for what is essentially a chocolate shake? You're basically paying for the right to say that you had a Double Frozen Hot Chocolate. I, like most people, tried it because I was curious to find out what a Double Frozen Hot Chocolate was. It sounded like a delicious oxymoron. Basically, they take over 16 powders to make hot chocolate. Then, they freeze it. Then, they throw it in a blender with two scoops of Ben and Jerry's chocolate ice cream. Pour it into a glass and add whipped cream/chocolate shavings. Done. \n\nIt's actually very tasty and the portions are generous. My sister and I shared a small, and we could barely finish it. Beware that it is very messy to eat/drink. \n\nIt's the perfect frozen treat after a long, hot walk on the Strip!"

S'Serendipity is just a walking contradiction.  I mean honestly, who the hell can imagine a "Frozen" hot chocolate?\n\nAnd then you remember there are things such as fried ice cream in this world, as well as the insane level of heat in the Vegas dessert that makes all of these preconceived notions go away.\n\nAlas, Serendipity has helped me combat my drunken state with some very tasty desserts.  The actual restaurant inside looks far too expensive for what you get, but the express booth outside will do just fine.  Clearly the most popular item here are these frozen hot chocolates, which is mostly an iced chocolate smoothie to soothe your dehydrated self.\n\nIt\'ll set you back about $10, but I\'d say it\'s worth it!  The chocolate goodness of the drink definitely cools you down, at least long enough for you to head into one of the air conditioned casinos.  Don\'t forget to also order a side of fries.  Ice cream goes SO well with frozen desserts such as this, and you can\'t hate it til you\'ve tried it.\n\nThe only gripe I have about Serendipity\'s express-lane is that it\'s also another contradiction... the wait is LONG!  You\'re looking at a 30 minute wait as it is before getting your order in, even when the line seems short.  Then you\'re expected to wait another 10-15 minutes before the actual drink comes out.  A bit ridiculous if you ask me.\n\nBut despite it all, I\'m sure I\'ll be sipping on another one of these again soon.  Note for next time- grab some kahlua or bailey\'s and mix it into the drink.  Get twice the fun!'

I ordered the Bloody Mary, which was biting and peppery just how I like it. But if you like it like soup, you would need to mention non-spicy. \n\nI got the Orchard Salad. It's tossed with vinaigrette, cubes of chicken breast, spinach, pecans, dried cherries, apples, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, feta crumbles and apple slices. \nHubby got an omelette, forgot which one, but it was huge, beautifully fluffy and not greasy at all and it came with their crispy yummy seasoned fries.  It was the perfect lunch after a late night of gambling and drinking.  A bit pricey tab at $46, but not at all out of the ordinary in Vegas and at Caesar's.  \n\nOh! and the bartender was so nice! We were so stuffed from our meal and said we didn't have room to order the FHC but he poured us each half a glassful just so my hubby can try it anyway.  Loved that!  \n\nWe are definately coming back."

S"Second visit to Serendipity this past weekend for lunch this time.  Food was great.  I thought there'd be a wait for a Sunday afternoon but there wasn't.  We had a lovely table on the patio overlooking the strip.  It was enjoyable.  I ordered the Chicken & Waffles.  The chicken was mediocre.  Maybe I just prefer greasy KFC much better.  However, the waffles were good.  Big, thick, crunchy on the outside pieces.  My husband had the Chicken Strips.  Nothing spectacular.  Tasted the same as something you could get at a place like TGIFs but the dipping sauces were good.  I was a little disappointed that the lunch menu isn't as good as the dinner menu.  I'd much rather go here for dinner.  Especially since I love the chicken pot pie and chicken alfredo so much.  Again, too full to even think about trying dessert.  Even though I wasn't blown away by the food, I still love Serendipity."

S'Serendipity 3 is an experience for any and everyone.  A great place in Las Vegas to bring your date, child or husband/wife.  Its subtly romantic while maintaining a very interesting Vegas vibe.  There must be some sort of secret no Douchebag\'s allowed rule because you wont find it here.  No old guys still wearing Ed Hardy (or even worse trying to be cool with a blazer and jeans.... come on guys that is so 2002, put on some slacks.).  But know, Serendipity 3 is a Vegas attraction so be prepared to pay accordingly.\n\nTHE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE - is amazing.  Absolutely amazing actually, it is no fluke that so many people enjoy it.  It is everything you imagine and more.  I compare it to an experience of eating a Jelly Bean and saying to yourself "OMG this popcorn jelly bean does taste like popcorn".  I\'m not sure why I didn\'t expect the frozen hot chocolate to taste like well, frozen hot chocolate.... but it did.  This is a must try, repeatedly.\n\n2 FOR 1 MARGARITAS - OK, I\'m not exactly sure what creative genius decided to pair dessert and margaritas but they did... and boy am I thankful.  For one the Margaritas are LARGE and in charge.  AND, yes there is more... they actually have liquor.  Most of the time there is so much of that limey mix and no tequila... not here, they give you your monies worth.\n\nBURGER - While I was last there I had the burger on the brioche bun,  Mmmmmm that bun was so buttery and delicious.  Although I want to try the hot dog next time.\n\n\nBefore the check comes take a deep breath and another swig of Margaritas.... like I said don\'t forget you are in Vegas.'

I guess it was finally time to try it (as there was no line when I walked by). \n\nThe first sip is like 'woah this is....frozen...hot chocolate' but the next few sips you get sick of the drink. It's just way too sweet and very hard to swallow after the inital sip. A little too pricey and so I don't think I'll be getting this again, or recommending it to any friends."

It's like honey mustard. \n\nFried Egg Benedict - Ham and biscuit topped with literally a fried poached egg.\nThe idea of a battered fried egg is good but it was not well executed. The egg white was a bit hardened and the outside of the egg was kinda soggy.\n\nChocolate French Toast - Not a big fan of chocolate, but I'm a fan of french toast. Sweeeeeeeeetttttt. Prob recommended for chocolate lovers.\n\nFrrrrooozen Hot Chocolate - Yum! If you've never had it, it's something to try since you're here.\n\nTip: They take reservations, and you can always call ahead to ask how long the wait is."

S'I\'ve been to both the New York and Las Vegas restaurants this past month. Let me just say, the original in NY has more charm and appeal. The food at both however is expensive and uneventful. \n\nThe $14 hamburger was remarkably bland. The quiche was dry however the salad on top was finely seasoned. The sweet potato fries were passable. \n\nEveryone always raves about the Frozen Hot Chocolate. This one had more of a mocha taste then the New York version.\n\nIf truth be told... this is a glorified chocolate shake without the ice cream.... chocolate powder, whole milk and ice blended together with whipped cream and chocolate shavings on top... for $14 dollars.  Give something a creative name and people will pay extra for the privilege\n\nThe Las Vegas location, just outside of Caesars, is sparsely decorated compared to the other location. Okay... and a "Shell oil" sign is supposed to fit in how??  There is no lines outside this one unlike the one in New York. I can guess why.\n\nPeople.. the emperor has no clothes on this one.'

S'The reason why I came here was because of a friend who has never been to Las Vegas. He said he saw this on one of the food network and wanted to try it. His thinking was, "it\'s on the food network so it must be good."He said they were known for their frozen hot chocolate, and that had my group of friends sold. The wait wasn\'t too long, it was about 25 minutes.  This is what we ordered...\nMac & Cheese- Just like any other mac & cheese from any other place such as Hard Rock Cafe. It wasn\'t too cheesy which was good and it had a hint of truffle on it. I wish it had a bit more truffle. On the other hand the bacon was a bit too oily and fatty for my liking.\n\nDont Be Afraid Of My Alfredo-  Be very afraid if you can\'t eat a lot. This pasta dish is very filling and cheesy. It wasn\'t the worse Alfredo I had, but definitely far from the best. To put this in perspective, I believe Cheesecake Factory\'s Alfredo is superior.\n\nThe Chili Cheese Dog- The chili cheese dog was a foot long... Too bad it tasted like any other chili cheese dog and not to mention 18 bucks \n\nCrab Cake Sandwich- Probably the only thing that stood out. My friend had this, and said it was delicious but yet not worth the money.\n\nWe also had their frozen hot chocolates. I don\'t why they are famous for it, but it just tasted like any other shake.. If you do get the frozen hot chocolate I recommend the original or the strawberry one. DO not get the Oreo one as it was way too sweet.\n\nIn the end, the food isn\'t bad, but the pricing was just horrible. It\'s way too expensive, and you can get the same quality food at Cheesecake Factory with bigger portions.'

S'This place was a complete waist of time for us. I yelped lunch here in Vegas and found they have a Serendipity. We have never been and of course we have seen the movie so we went. We velet parked the car and went in and thats when the wheels came off. Very small selection and the prices were WAY to high for what the items are. $15 for a burger and frys and a $4 dollar up charge to split you gotta be kidding?!?! A steak sandwich is $28 bucks!!!! Get the "F" out of here with that B.S. We thought about splitting a hot dog until we saw the price. It would have been $20 for a dog and frys with the split charge. Sorry but this is deserved... FUCK THAT SHIT!!!!! We got the hell out of there and went to the Paris buffet where the food was incredible and it was all you could pile in your face and boy did I. I understand this is the Vegas strip but give me a break. No burger or hotdog is worth those prices.\n       The interesting thing we noticed was, most of the tables around us had several people at them but only one person was eating. Sounds like it was to rich for there blood as well.'

S'TAKE AWAY:  The food and service here is mediocre; I heard the one in New York is better though.  There\'s usually a minimum of a 25 minute wait for a table (longer if it\'s busy).  People come here for the name and for their "Frrrozen Hot Chocolate," which costs $15 (large).  If you\'re looking for a novelty restaurant or place where all the hype is at, this place is it.  But expect nothing more.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS / TIPS:  It\'s best to go during off-peak hours (i.e., afternoon).  Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is great to try (it does taste great), but it\'s difficult to justify the $15 price tag.  ALSO, they (supposedly) charge a $4 sharing fee.  We were able to avoid it because we purchased 3 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate (practically entr\xc3\xa9e prices in and of itself).  Their sweet potato fries are good!\n\nDETAILS - DETAILS - DETAILS:\n-----------------------------------------------\nAtmosphere:\nIt\'s just one dining room and no waiting area; so if you\'re sitting next by the entrance, expect to feel the weather outside and perhaps someone standing over your shoulders as you eat.  The best way to describe the d\xc3\xa9cor is: wacky, eccentric, random, and maybe even a little bit nostalgic as they try to bring in some of that old-fashioned diner feel.\n\nService:\nThe wait here can be long at times.  Even during off-peak hours (e.g., 3:00pm) the wait can be 15 minutes for a party of 2-4 and 30 minutes for 5-8.  Service began slow (waited 10 minutes for our order to be taken), but picked up after our order was submitted.  On an irritated note, our waitress tried to nickel and dime us with three $4 sharing fees (we ordered 5 entr\xc3\xa9es for 8 people), then claimed that she was being nice because she was supposed to charge the $4 sharing fee for all 8 of us (yes, making that $32; is she out of her mind??).  After we exuded our frustration with the matter and indicated that we had ordered 3 of their $15 Frrrozen Hot Chocolates, she decided to be nice and "take care it."  C\'mon lady... we weren\'t born yesterday.\n\nFood Quality / Selection:\nThe food here is mediocre.  Their burger is big, but nothing spectacular.  We also had a sirloin steak sandwich on a large baguette.  Overall, the portions are on the bigger side and you\'re sure to get filled because most of the food they serve are heavy.  Presentation is average as well.  Take a look at their menu here: http://www.serendipity3.com/food.htm. \n\nPricing/Value/Convenience:\nOverall, I would say that this restaurant has poor value given the price they charge for the quality of the food, the type of food they serve, their overall service, and the crowded (almost cafeteria/fast food-like) atmosphere.  It\'s okay if you\'re here just to check it out, but I could recommend many better restaurants to go to.  It\'s centrally located right on the Strip, so just valet your car at Caesar\'s Palace and walk on over!'

Honestly, Starbucks java chip frap is much better and cheaper!  A few people here said it tasted like Ovaltine and I agree with that.  It's seriously nothing special and apparently a lot of people yesterday felt the same way b/c I saw several of them who left half their drink unfinished.  However, I figured I just spent 10 bucks on it, so damn straight  we finished ours, but again, not impressed.  I will say that their nachos were really good, though."

S"Worse wait I've experienced.\n\nMost people who spend money on the strip are people on vacation.  I don't know about you, but I don't like wasting my vacation standing around.\n\nThere was a coupon for a free frozen hot chocolate with the purchase of an entree, so I went to check it out.  I've seen pictures, and it looked so large and delicious.\n\nTurns out, there was an hour wait to be seated.  I opted to forgo the coupon, and stand at the walk-thru window instead.  Horrible decision.\n\nThere were two parties ahead of me, but there were only two workers, so they took the order, made the order, then served the next customer.  The wait took over a HOUR.  I've never had such a horrible wait.  \n\nWhen I got the frozen hot chocolate, I ordered the one for 2.  It didn't look as large in a dinky plastic cup.  In fact, they only put about 2/3s of what they put in the blender in my cup.\n\nThe hot chocolate was good, but it wasn't worth the price.  It tasted cheap, like powdered hot chocolate, and blended ice.  I've tasted better frozen hot chocolates, and they are generally made with syrup, for a creamier more integrated flavor.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with my experience.  It doesn't taste bad, and the decor was interesting, so I give it a 2/5"

S"Not all that it is hyped up to be.\n\nWe came here just for dessert after hearing and ready so much great things about it. Really wanted the Frozen Hot Chocolate, but settled for a dessert to share with my BF. We had the one with the peanut butter pie with coffee ice cream and bananas and chocolate sauce and a little piece of sugar heaven.\n\nAfter about 5 bites, it was just toooo much though. I am a sugar addict, but between the two of us, we only ate 2/3 of the $14 share dessert. And that was pushing our limits!\n\nPortion sizes for the desserts are great, but the food portions are normal, and maybe even on the smaller side. And overpriced for the average tasting food. I think eating here is more about the environment and the name rather than the food. Not really worth the money. But they make the food look pretty! Service was not the best, and there was a wait, even 1/2 hour before closing, it was busy. Probably won't go back, maybe try the one in NY, but not here."

The bill does make your eyes pop out a little but the meal leaves you pretty satisfied.\n\nTrue story: Made my own frozen hot chocolate by melting Ghirardelli chocolate in milk and put it in the freezer. Tastes a lot better and smoother and I spent less than $5 to make it.\n\nIt\'s been more than 2 weeks since I\'ve been here and I still wish I got a different dessert. *sips frozen hot chocolate*'

My rules! Serendipity was my first stop! \n\nThe wait wasnt as bad as everyone says, I waited about 15 minutes. The place was PACKED! We ordered the Hangover Omelet. It wasnt anything special. But the fries....! The fries were delicious! I couldnt get enough of them! Next we had the Frrozen Hot Chocolate. Finally! It was delicious. I really liked it. It reminded me of Taz Shakes (I dont know if anyone else had those in elementary school but those were my FAVORITE). So good.

My huband and I split the nachos appetizer and the frozen Oreo dessert.  My friend and her date\'s desserts came out first...they each took and drink and had a funny look on their faces...we asked what was wrong and they both said "hmmm not at all what we were expecting".  They drank a little bit more.  Her date commented on how it was really dark chocolatey...He wasn\'t happy and wanted to send it back.  However, our waiter was nowhere to be found.  My friend was very disappointed considering all the build-up she had heard.  \nThe nachos were good.  Not the best ever.  My husband, who is one of the biggest sweet tooths I have ever met, had a drink of our dessert and also had a funny look on his face.  He said the same thing...it wasn\'t what he expected.  I tried 1 sip...it had a strange, almost slushy like texture.  We didn\'t even finish the desert.  I doubt we\'ll go back there.  Our bill (spliting an appetizer, spliting a desert, and drinking tap water) was over $30.\nSince it is on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Flamingo, plan on walking!  We parked in the Caesars garage.  My friend\'s date parked in the Flamingo parking garge.  Not sure which is closer.  If you\'re not looking to walk, I\'d suggest valet at Caesars.\nOn the way home, we stopped at baskin and robins to have some real ice cream!

S"A group of us came here on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner. We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated inside (30 mins or longer for outside seating), but it wasn't too bad of a wait. The decorations inside were really pretty and very colorful (a little different from the one in NYC). We all shared plates because they were too big for us: chicken pasta alfredo with foccacia bread, thai beef salad, chicken fingers, and a huge omelet with sweet potato fries. \n\nThe pasta was a little heavy but delicious! It was a perfect meal for after clubbing. I enjoyed the thai beef salad because there were a variety of different flavors that blended perfectly. There were also different textures (bits of crispy noodles, coconut shaving, and tender beef) that were a great mix together. \n\nTo top off the night, we shared the frrrozen hot chocolate. It hit our chocolate craving spot so we loved it. Since it was our friend's birthday, we told our wonderful waitress and she and her other coworkers sang to our friend and brought out another frozen hot chocolate. \n\nThe service was pretty good, especially since there were a lot of people there.

S'Average. Their selling point is their "Frozen Hot Chocolate", which looked way too big and a waste of calories drinking down what essentially seems like a chocolate milkshake to me.  So while it looked appealing, it was 8:30 pm at night and my friends & I were just looking for dinner at that point.  \n\nThere was absolutely no space that night (Sunday night) and so they suggested we ordered in their outside stand.  We therefore proceeded to do that and by the time we got there, they sold NOTHING.  There were no hotdogs, no sandwiches, no salads, no anything.  Anything we asked for on the menu, they said, "we don\'t have it".  Finally, frustrated, we ordered a bbq chicken pizza and some nachos.  Everything was just average.  The pizza actually had way too much bbq sauce it was a bit overbearing and the crust was way too doughy.  The nachos were just drizzled in cheese whiz and something I could have totally made myself.  \n\nI\'m now looking at their real restaurant menu and it appears as though they may have more variety inside the shop.  Maybe I\'d give it another try the next time I go to Vegas, but likely not as there are lots of other good things to eat in Vegas.  \n\nThe restaurant itself looked pretty cute...lots of Hello Kitty.'

S"On my extra day in vegas last week, i decided to stop by Serendipity due to its popularity in new york.  I have attempted to go to the one in New York before but since the wait was so long, I failed to try it out!  So the next best thing was to go to the one right across from Caesar's Palace!  At first, I was a bit disappointed by its decor since the one in New York looked way better.. It wasn't the 30 min wait for me since the inside venue was just average to me.  So I went to the take-out window where there was also a line!  The line wasn't as bad but what was bad was the slow service... it was extremely slow.. the worker apologized everyone for the wait since he was the only one working there with a cook in the back.. It just bugged me since the only thing I ordered was the Frozen Hot Chocolate dessert and I had to wait a good time for it...... Also, it looked to me like he was literally taking his time even though there was a line outside... oyeee that bugs me!!\n\nIronic .. Frozen hot chocolate.. I am usually not a big fan of chocolatey things since I am scared they overdo it on the sweetness and chocolate thickness.. But I may say it was pretty good!  Good mixture of ice and chocolate which made it extremely refreshing in the hot humid vegas weather!  My friend and I enjoyed it in the many tables and seats they had in the outdoor patio, which was nice!  But of course, the alternative was to run inside Caesar's for some nice air conditioning!\n\nI honestly wasn't wowed by this place.. It definitely did not live up to the hype that the New York Serendipity has!  But if you want desserts and somewhere to stop by along your long walks down the strip, do check this place out!"

S"The Las Vegas version of Serendipity 3 is like a movie sequel, one that disappoints rather than continues your love for the original.\n\nOnce upon a time, John Cusack fell in love with Kate Beckinsdale in movie make-believe at a little whimsical chocolate shop in uptown Manhattan and sent Serendipity 3 into a dizzying spiral of Hollywood fame and public craze.  \n\nWhen I lived in Manhattan 4 years ago, along with hundreds of tourists on a Saturday morning, I waited to experience the fantasy of movie magic and the famed Frozen Hot Chocolate in this fairytale of a chocolate shop/eatery.  It was fun for the experience.  The chocolate was outstanding and the food was all right.\n\nIt is four years later in Vegas, nine years since the movie and long past the 15 minutes given to Serendipity 3.  A location of this charming original opens up right in front of Caesars Palace to cater to undiscriminating tourists in their hung-over states.  The overblown decor becomes cheesy, not whimsical.  The glamorous fair food comes with mediocre quality.\n\nAt best, you can say you've been to Serendipity 3.  I suggest getting the desserts at the take-out stand rather than waiting for a seat at the restaurant.  You'll have a better time seeing the movie again."

S'Not sure if this place really lives up to all the hype.  There was about an hour and a half wait on a Sunday afternoon.  Once we got in, the waiter was super attentive and helpful.  We got the frozen hot chocolate, some coffees, and onion rings.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was pretty, but nothing really out of this world.  Just like a frozen hot chocolate, literally.  A little steep at $14 (for a "large," $11 for a "single").  My mochaccino was quite yummy.  My brother\'s Tiffany espresso was tiny, with sprinkles.  Interesting and cute, but an extra $1 for a few sprinkles?  I dunno...  The onion rings came in this impressive stack, about 8 total.  Nice and thick.  The salty was welcome after so much sweet.\n\nThe waiter also suggested the nachos, sliders, and hot dogs.  We didn\'t get them, but we did see neighboring tables with them.  Had we not had dinner plans in a few hours, we might have tried them too.\n\nAll in all, an OK experience.  Not sure if it\'s worth all the hype, price, and wait, but perhaps worth at least one visit if you\'ve never been, just cuz the ambiance is pretty cute.  Perhaps a stop by the "To Go" window outside in the future...'

You would think that, being in the middle of the desert, there would be more space where you wait but there were three chairs and everyone was super cramped.\n\nWe ordered three different Frozen Hot Chocolates; The Original, White Chocolate, and the one with coffee. All three were way too sweet. It was like drinking chocolate syrup. The White Chocolate was the richest, it tastes like nougat. We all agreed that the best tasting one was the coffee one.\n\nThere are also Frozen Hot Chocolate mixes for sale. The pouches are $7 and cans are $19.'

Our food came sweet potato fries and honey japaleno chips.\n\nOf course we also had the famous frozen hot chocolate!  YUM!   Tons of whip cream on top, chocolate shavings, and just nice and cold for the 86 degree weather.\n\nThe food tasted great, mostly probably because we were starving, but we were not disappointed.  \n\nThe service, however, was S-L-O-W!! After we got our food, we had to flag down our server for a refill on drinks and it took forever to get our check.  Not only that, but it also took forever to have them pick up our check.\n\nWe also saw the manager there walking around and not helping.

It's not cheap at $15, but when I'm in Vegas losing my ass off, $15 doesn't seem so bad.\n\nThis isn't the place to go if you're super hungry, unless you get the Las Vegas Strip Sandwich. It's huge! They packed steak, bacon 3 fried eggs and other ingredients in a footlong toasted baguette. The sandwich is thick, making it hard to eat especially with the relative hardness of the toasted baguette. It's definitely a feat that all big eaters must overcome!\n\nI also tried the Dinosaur Beef Ribs. Must have a really small dinosaur because the serving portion of this dish is a joke. For $20, you would expect more than 3 ribs. However, the sauce was delicious and the sweet potato fries that accompanied the ribs were also good.\n\nSerendipity 3 also has a great variety of desserts and sundaes that are absolutely mouth-watering. The ultimate dessert is the Golden Opulence Sundae ($1000), which features edible gold flakes! If I ever win big, I'm getting it!"

S'Yelp definitely steered us in the right direction on this one--headed straight for the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate....mm-mm good!!  Yes, its overpriced, but so worth it.  We got the "double" which means double chocolate (not so obvious on the menu).  It\'s also got a cute, kinda retro look to the place.  Try to go off season/midweek/off times or better yet, all of the above, as they don\'t take reservations and lines can be long. Easy to find, as it\'s right in front of Caesar\'s--you will see it if you are walking or driving down the strip. Picked up a canister of the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate mix to take home, which includes prep. instructions.  Staff member ( can\'t remember his name) told us to make it into "double hot chocolate": combine 2 scoops of choc. ice cream,  2+ Tablespoons (preferrably dark-- Ghiradelli, etc.) chocolate syrup and 1 to 1 1/2 cups ice in blender...good luck!'

To be honest, they were both overly salty. Good thing I had the frozen mint chocolate to balance that out! The portions are huge! However, the price is also steep!

S'Decent food, terrible service. That pretty much sums up everything. The first hostess told me that it would be a 5 minute wait until I could get a table. That\'s reasonable considering that they weren\'t packed or anything. In reality, I waited about 15 minutes for a 1 top. When the second hostess called me up, she se sad "Nina, table for 1." I learned from one of my friends that this is not an acceptable way to call up a single person since this may be "embarrassing" for the individual dining alone. I didn\'t care but I thought it sounded odd. After I went over to her, she didn\'t say another word to me. Sooo awkward. The server came over to me and seemed angry at me. I hadn\'t even said a word yet. Maybe since I was only one person, she thought she wasn\'t going to get much of a tip since it was just me. Actually, I work in a restaurant and I would have totally tipped her nicely if she wasn\'t so rude. It probably pissed her off a little more that I ordered coke instead of one of their 15 dollar coffee drinks. I ordered the Eastside Western omelette without proscuitto. When the food runner gave me my dish, he announced the dish, dropped it and left. Another awkward moment. The eggs were fluffy and there was tons of Jack cheese (which I love). However, the sweet potato fries on the side were cold when I got them. I also ordered a carrot cake which was awesome and huge. I\'m still really bitter about the service I received though.  The server pretty much seemed angry at me the entire time and I barely saw her (which may have been a good thing). They really need to hire some new people or re-train these people in hospitality.'

S'There we were during Restaurant Week, exploring the finer things in life. We decided on a more of a dessert kind of feel dinner, and so we decided on a place called Serendipity 3. Located right off the strip in front of Caesars, it definitely wasn\'t an easy restaurant to access. As soon as we were seated our waiter just dropped off menus without saying one word and let us be. After what seemed like an eternity, the waiter finally came back and asked us if we were ready to order. I then immediately asked if I can get the restaurant week menu. The waiter then replied saying that there were no specials that he was aware of. I literally busted out my phone and showed him that Serendipity 3 was a part of restaurant week and showed him the specials. He then left and asked one of his fellow colleagues that acknowledged that they did have a restaurant week menu. So the waiter comes by and finally acknowledges that there was a special menu, without any sort of an apology. He took our order and then left. I\'m a very patient person when it comes to bad service. What I mean is I have taken a lot of crap without complaining, but this guy was just the worst. First of all he was very soft spoken, and had a very bad attitude problem. What\'s the first rule of working in the service industry? Leave your problems at the door, and put a smile on your face. This guy definitely needed a lesson in service. Anyways, after all the rude remarks and attitude he gave us while ordering, our food finally came out. Before our food even came out, I noticed the waiter just went around and asked everyone else how they were doing, and completely ignored us. I was without a drink for 15 plus minutes, and did I mention the food came out very slow. I can tell it wasn\'t the cooks fault, it was our waiter. My chicken dish I\'ve ordered was cold to the core; not even a little feel of warmth. I just let it slide and finished my dinner. The most anticipated part of the meal finally came out, dessert. I\'ve noticed that he has gotten our order wrong, and then informed him of his mistake. Once again without any apology he just takes the plate without a word. I can see his facial expression of disgust as he walked away. The nerves of this guy were incredible! To make the story short, we enjoyed our dessert very much.  Needless to say our waiter never came back after correcting his mistake. My friends and I sat there socializing for a long period of time.  All I can hear is the slurps from the straw, since the drinks were empty. Honestly I just wanted the check so we can leave, but our waiter was nowhere to be found.  When I finally saw our waiter, I politely tried to gain his attention. He totally just ignored me and walked on by. Finally I went up to the front and asked if I could get my check, and the hostess instructed us to ask our waiter. At this point I was furious and asked for a manager. The manager was very nice and offered us a complimentary lunch on them. One thing I believe the manager made a mistake was when he said, "Yeah, we get complaints on him all the time." When I heard that, in my head I was like, "Then why is he still working here!?" Thanks to that rude waiter, I will never go back to Serendipity again. I even have a complimentary meal, but no thanks!'

S'Over priced and Over rated!!\n\nFrrrozen hot chocolate was okay. I would recommend it only because its not a common dessert, but just don\'t have high hopes. I love how Caesar\'s called it "the legendary favorite." Barney Stinson would not agree.  Its a bowl of chilled hot chocolate with a TON of whip cream on top and sprinkled with flakes of chocolate. That honestly describes it. Nothing special about it except for its height and price tag. Its $11 for a small and $15 for a large "for two to share". And FYI the large is perfect for three people, especially if your eating a meal here.\n\nPesto Italian Pizza has a wonderful crispy crust, but it really lacked flavor. I\'m assuming if pesto is part of the title then it would at least taste like pesto, but oh was I wrong.\n\nIn and out does better burgers. Sorry, but I had to say it. Although you get a thick cut of beef patty, someone needs to tell them that quantity does not beat quality. The bread tasted old and it was soggy. My friend ended up eating it as an open face sandwich. The fries, on the other hand, was delicious. It was crispy and had a perfect golden yellow hue.\n\nThe hot dog was just....a hot dog.\n\nWarning!! The bathroom is quite a distance away. You have to walk outside to get to it. And I have no idea why the floor on the patio was so slippery!\n\nOverall, the food didn\'t blow my mind and the service was good.'

But that's pretty much all the negative I have about the place.  \n\nThe food here comes in large portions that even someone like me will have a hard time finishing.  I ordered the strawberry milkshake and the spicy penne pasta with huge uncut prosciutto and mozzarella laid over the top, and my gf ordered the wood grilled salmon item (I think it's the only salmon featured item in the menu). \n\nSo now it's been three days and I can't stop thinking about the milkshake. The pasta on the other hand was so much that I couldn't even try to finish half of it after sharing a caesar salad with my gf.  I didn't think much of the salmon but my gf ended up finishing her meal completely.\n\nThe biggest thing to take note of this place is that food comes in larger than expected portions. It's a good thing, but dangerous when eat your entire meal and you realized you have to talk two Vegas blocks back to your hotel."

I like that they can text you that your table is ready, so I really don't have to hang out in front of the restaurant in the heat if I don't want to. We decided to sit inside since it was so hot out.\nOur waitress was Tina, she could've been friendlier, but she did an adequate job waiting on us.\nI hate the huge menu's, it was difficult to peruse their offerings at our small table of 4. The plates were also too big for our table. The music inside the restaurant was way too loud for the tiny space, people would like to talk...not lose their hearing!\nThe prices were a bit high but it helps if you have a Total Rewards card, the prices are slightly cheaper if you present this to your waitress upon ordering.\nI got the Chicken Strip appetizer so I could save room for dessert. They were good, nice and crispy on the outside, moist warm white meat chicken on the inside. The dipping sauces were good too, I liked the Honey Mustard best, my husband liked the BBQ sauce. My husband got the Cheeseburger with Brie Cheese and Fries, it was an okay burger, not a lot of flavor, but it was cooked correctly. The fries were not fresh or hot, we had to others at our table who got fries and only one of us got fresh fries. We had a view of the kitchen from our table and noticed that they make tons of fry orders and let them sit there til someone orders them.\nFor dessert we decided to split the Black and White Sundae, it was delicious. The ice cream and topping were quality and all went well together. Nice bonus of a chocolate covered strawberry on top.\nI would totally go back again for dessert, but I would skip the average food."

S'Look, I come from the Bay Area... more specifically San Jose, which has a large population of Vietnamese and of course Pho restaurants, so I think I\'ve tasted what\'s close to the real deal. However, of course the morning after some heavy drinking out in Vegas, the first thing that comes to a Bay Area native\'s mind is "My God... some pho would be the perfect cure right now." Hence, my cousins and I went on a hunt to find some pho. Funny thing is there is also a "Pho Kim Long" where we are from, so we thought we\'d give this place a chance. Hopped into a cab and asked the cab driver himself if he had a favorite Pho place. And right off the bat he named this place! \n\nThe restaurant itself is bigger than most pho restaurants I\'ve been to, and definitely the NICEST looking. I\'m used to cheap restaurants that look a bit dirty inside. This place actually has ambiance. Service wasn\'t too shabby as well, and honestly don\'t know if it was because I was super hungry (and slightly hungover) but I could say this was the best pho I\'ve ever eaten... surprised it was in Vegas! Even my sister\'s vermicelli salad looked bomb and perfectly proportioned. Be warned as they only have one size and no "larges" for you hungry hippos. Or maybe they do, but it\'s not listed on the menu.\n\nDefinitely should open a location on the strip and they\'d make so much money. I wiill definitely consider coming back to this place for my hangover cures if I am to return to Sin City.\n\nSide tip: Taxi ride from Cosmopolitan hotel to Chinatown where this place is located is about ~$13.00 (one trip)'

S'this is prob the best looking pho place ive ever been to. so driving up to the asian side of vegas you notice the HUGE banner for being rated the best pho ever, or whatever it said. TO BE HONEST. that hyped me way too much and it just didnt live up to the behemoth banner.\n\nwhen i walk into a place and notice, you have a waiting list, that right there tells me youre good enough but it doesnt hype me like a giant banner. lol\n\nthe pho was okay, the broth didnt taste bad, it just wasnt the best ive had. there wasnt that much noodle, like it was proportioned wrong. meat to broth to noodle ratio was off and i was left dissatisfied. the bill was cheap for 7 people so i guess thats okay \n\nthis place is really clean and the staff are like any other place, no service at all so expect that.'

S'The pho here was ALRIGHT. We came here after clubbing at Marque and I was content with it for Vegas. Although after sitting down no one came to our table for a really long time until we clearly made hand signals for someone to come and take our order. The soup was good I suppose, but not amazing. I figured it was Vegas and you get what you get in a tourist city. The one thing that bugged me was that they charge you $1 if you want your rare steak on the side...NOT EXTRA just on the side which didn\'t make sense to me. I ordered the beef balls pho and the menu said it was $1 for an additional topping so I asked for rare steak on the side (not knowing there was an additional charge for having the meat on the side in the first place) It was a regular bowl and when the bill came it was $10 dollars. In the world of Pho that\'s pretty pricey for a small bowl. I mean this place looks a little more "nice" then regular pho joints, but it definitely wasn\'t upscale. It just looked like a fast pace late night pho restaurant.'

S"I am a fan. and this is why. The Pho may not be the best you've ever tasted, but Its pretty damn good. I mean really how many ways is there to make Pho? Had the Beef tendon pho, it hit the spot. Aside from the pho, they're ong choy (water spinach) was sauteed well, great sauce. Fried Calamari, was probably the best i have had, I couldnt stop eating it. and the roast duck had a lot of flavor, and you could tell it was made fresh, not re-heated. I can't seem to get a grasp on what type of sauce it was. the salted fish fried rice was also flavor, and you could actually taste the salted fish unlike other places (sam woo). these items are some of the same dishes I get at several asian restaurants just to compare, and the version here are right up there to one of the best i have had. \n\nJust to comment on people talking about service and such, I don't mean to be harsh, or offend the asian culture, because I consider myself asian myself. But the bad service? first these types of places is not a pf changs or a pei wei. they're not here to ask you how your day is going. they're just not, some of them don't even speak english. yes when they bring out the food to you, sometimes they rush, or kind of pack all the dishes on the table, looking like they slam the plates on it., theyre a little rough and maybe your oolong tea spills a little from your cup. you know what thats a sign of? that it's authentic. Some of the best places I have eaten at in California were like this. actually my favorite place back home, was like this, won't exactly strike you as fine dining and not the most polite servers but best food hands down. I once went to a place in San Francisco, where you had to go down they're basement to go to the bathroom, a little scary, but what shocked me more was how good they're food was"

The spring rolls seemed as if they had been sitting around because they were all different colors and some of the innards of the roll were mushy. The peanut sauce was also a little off.\n\nOur pho came out a few minutes later. (The food came out so quickly) My pho was okay, but not great. Definitely disappointed. \n\nAlthough it satiated my Pho-fix. It wasn't that good. I wasn't impressed. I don't get what the hype is about...

We had our fried rice brought out to us like 10 min before the rest of our dishes.  What good is that?  Good thing it was yummy.  We then had to get white rice which they now charge for, to have with our entrees.  We had the honey walnut shrimp, salt and pepper pork chops, and crispy noodles with beef and brocolli.  Everything was great!  I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for something comforting to eat off the strip.

S'I have been coming to Pho Kim Long for about 7 years now and I\'m glad to see it gain popularity over the years.  I recently came here for a quick lunch on what I thought would be a quiet Tuesday afternoon.  I arrived at 2pm and it was jam packed!  They have won some "best of" awards and that has really helped their business.  But with popularity comes the price increases!! Hey, it\'s a business and they want to make money so I get it.  \n\nThey updated their menu with pricing and graphics, but the dining room is still the same.  \n\nWhat I like about this place is that they don\'t mess around.  You definitely don\'t come here for the customer service, because at Pho Kim Long customer service is non-existent. You come here for the delicious Pho.  I always get the plain noodle Pho.  For $6, you can\'t beat the price.  Sodas are $3 though.... Kinda high.  \n\nThey are very fast and efficient and always refill your water without you having to hunt down a waitress.  Food comes out when it comes out, so don\'t expect them to course it out for you.\n\nSIDEBAR.....Their egg rolls are also one of my favorite things to get.\n\nIf you\'re in the mood for some Pho and want a cheap place to go to with friends, come to Pho Kim Long.'

I guess for Pho it doesn't take long, but they must have a batch of egg rolls ready to go every second.  They immediately brought the egg rolls out and they were piping hot.  I thought they were good but nothing too special.  \n\nThey also speak Mandarin here.  The server was listening on our conversation I guess and started to talk to us.  It took me a while to decide what to order.  My family all got a bowl of Pho.  The soup was okay.  Same thing, nothing special but not bad.  The portions here are smaller than what we get in Los Angeles or Orange County.\n\nEventually I decided to order the French Style Steak.  It was flavorful, but nothing that I would write home about.  Apparently I would write on Yelp about though.  =9 It was alright.  A little bit on the expensive side.\n\nOverall the meal was decent.  They had HUGE signs of Live Crawfish posted everywhere and when we asked they said they didn't have it.  They really should have taken the banner and signs down.  Would I come back here?  Nahhhh... Was it bad?  Not really.  If you just want to satisfy your Vietnamese craving, then I guess this place wouldn't be too bad."

It's been over a year since my last PKL review.\n\nPopped in here last night with some friends after a big night out on the strip. \n\nLast time, I made mention of the broth because I didn't think it was as flavorful as Pho joints in LA. I can say that based on my most recent experience, it was everything I was hoping for...Perfection!\n\nThe staff made sure our water glasses stayed full (fail from last time)....but the biggest difference is the remodel.\n\nThis place looks like a brand new restaurant! Before, it seemed like your typical ethnic restaurant, but they've really cleaned this place up, and added plenty of seating. My guess is they took out whatever business was next door.\n\nSince this place IS open 24/7, it's the perfect spot when you are craving Pho after a big night out.\n\nFunny side note....at 3:30am, the guy that seats you, is a cop.

As with all food in the US it felt a little heavy on the sodium but it wasn't bad like the places that put tons of MSG in their soups for flavour meanwhile inducing days of thirst after consumption.\nOn the night that we went after the club I had the chicken fried rice and it was really good.

Add to that the hilarity of the restaurant name itself, and you'll know how I ended up there with a snickering group of dudes with a late night appetite.\n\nOur table shared the Vietnamese spring rolls as an appetizer, along with a bowl of pho, the pan fried noodle, and the chicken wraps, all of which were really good. The panfried noodle was a good amount, but I would personally have preferred more veggies and the inclusion of something other than the baby bok choy, such as mushrooms and broccoli. The chicken lettuce wraps were good- more chicken than lettuce, but tasty enough that we didn't mind and much better than the other way around.\n\nService was a little slow but was efficient. Menu is large, and it took a while to make up our minds- unfortunately my first choice order was the crepe, and I was told they were out. I'm not sure how they'd be out of eggs or how that works, but I guess it just means I'll have to come back another time to have it."

S'This being Vegas, and if you\'ve had too much to drink, you might think this place is equivalent to one of those post cards they hand out on the strip with a sexy girl on it wearing a skimpy outfit, with her phone number (696-9696) ready for you to call her for a "date". \n\nAfter all, with a name like Pho Kim Long, you might think this is the Las Vegas Chinatown equivalent to the Chicken Ranch. \n\nYou might also forget that you have already slurped on the savory dishes here. \n\nPho Kim Long is a popular Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. It is very large, and at lunch there are at least 10 people working here, doing a brisk business. The food is solid but not spectacular. The menu is very extensive, the ambiance clean, upscale and modern, and the service is very good. Prices are a little more than you are used to in California\'s Viet hot spots. \n\nThey do have a lounge adjacent to it now, which I haven\'t tried yet. Maybe it is a Viet Cafe or classic Viet men\'s lounge? It might be closer to the sound of the name sake, Pho Kim Long, at least in some parton\'s minds.'

S'Yay VEGAS!!!!!  Late night pho = the best munchies you can get while drunk from drinking in your hotel room, lol.\n\nBut seriously, I really love exploring the local side of Vegas.  This was definitely one of them, although I felt most of the people inside were all tipsy from the night earlier.  I was very excited to see that this was 24 hours because pho is my late night choice for food.\n\nEverytime I try a pho place I usually get their combo pho.  In this case, for about $7.99 I got a medium sized bowl of pho with some meat in it.  I wish the bowl was larger, and that the broth would have more flavor to that.  In my opinion, it was a bit plain.  However, the servers here were very nice, and got us our food right away after ordering.\n\nI would come back to try some of the non pho items on the menu, which looked plentiful.  Four stars for being opened 24 hours and catering to the needs of drunk tourists and friendly locals.\n\nParking is located outside in the plaza, but is limited.  However, street parking is everywhere.'

S"Wanted to branch out & try something different, so one dinner was at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I recommend getting reservations, because this place was packed!  And don't flake on your reservation, either.  These guys mean it when you make a reservation because if you no-show, they charge you $50 per head!  Opps did you oversleep?  That's a pretty expensive nap you just took.\n\nIt's right by the sportsbook at Caesar's Palace.  We arrived right on time and were promptly seated.  The menu isn't quite as big as I was expecting, so we were able to narrow it down to 3 things, with pictures attached.  Ranked in order, they were:\n-scallop salad.  Micro greens, 3 scallops with a slightly spicy dry rub, and balsamic vinegar-like dressing.  Scallops were perfectly cooked and definitely the highlight of the dinner.\n-lobster.  It's cooked and taken out of the shell, so it's easy to eat and therefore you're not creating a mess in a fancy Las Vegas restaurant.  Mrs. C states that the sauce tastes like reduced bisque, and quite delicious.\n-pork tenderloin + twice baked potato.  The 3 pieces of pork tenderloin had a spicy dry rub, and then are nicely plated with 2 more sauces.  I have a pretty good tolerance for spicy food, but this was a tad too spicy for me.  The twice baked potato was good, but I should have gotten it without the horseradish.  Our server, to her credit, told us that the horseradish is mixed in, but not spicy.  She was right and it wasn't spicy, but knowing what I know now, I would have skipped the horseradish part of it.\n\nThis is a good meal, and there's no question that there is a lot of attention to detail to the food and our service was quite good.  I just think that for the money spent, this is an average value, and that's why I marked down 1 star.  Our dinner the day before at Sedona Lounge was only half the cost per person, and I was much happier.  But sometimes it's about the experience and crossing items off your bucket list, and if you can't do that in Vegas, then you might want to check if you still have a pulse.  =)"

S'Mesa Grill, is Bobby Flay\'s restaurant. Like it name-sake, it sucks. I\'m sorry but just because he\'s on the food network doesn\'t mean anything. Maybe, I\'m the only person that feels this way but I only came here to see if maybe that although he\'s such a tool on TV, "He has to be a good chef/ restauranteer, right?" No. The answer is a resounding, "No." There are so many good eats in Vegas... especially at this price range, so I suggest you end up there instead.'

S"Well it took a while, but I finally made time to stop by Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I'm not that big a Flay fan, but I was really interested in trying his food based on the pics I've seen on yelp which look pretty damn creative.\n\nI stopped over for lunch and based on early recommendations from my friends and my own curiosity, I didn't waste any time with ordering.  I started with the Blue Corn Pancake for my appetizer and their Chile Relleno for my entree.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake with Barbecued Duck - with habanero chili and star anise sauce. \nhttp://bit.ly/Y2YRp1\nThis was pretty much like a duck taco.  The duck was very tasty and had a nice smokey flavor with a little kick to it.  It was really good and I'd order this again.  The only hiccup I had with this was the fact that I ended up chewing on a bone near the end.  That was a red flag and I told my waiter about it.  He was shocked!  The real sucky part about it was that I didn't get any compensation for it.\n\nCornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno -  with Roasted Eggplant,  Manchego Cheese \nSweet Red Pepper Sauce, and Balsamic Vinegar\nhttp://bit.ly/VmHanC\nI've had my fair share of Chile Rellenos, but this has got to be the most fanciest Chile Relleno I've ever seen.  And it was good as expected!  The Chile crust had a nice crunch to it while the cheese was nicely melted down.  And to exhibit a little bit of food porn, check out the gooey cheese oozing out from inside.  (http://bit.ly/WYhacm)  Ooooooh yes!!!  \n\nFor the most part, other than that hiccup with the bone in the duck pancake, service was still good.  My waiter was very courteous and always checked on me over the course of my meal.  It would've been nice to have a little compensation or bill removal for the bone which I probably should've requested, but I'm not that aggressive.\n\nI'd probably consider going back again to Mesa Grill to try their other menu items, but it probably won't be for a while.  The food is good, but I'd really have to be in mood for it to go back.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4!"

Mario Batali's B&B Restuarante, Wolfgang Puck's Spago, and of course Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.\n\nI have to say, Mesa Grill was such a let down. You made me so sad Bobby Flay! What happened to Boy Meets Grill? Because, let me tell you, your burger was whack!\n\nI got the Prix Fix Lunch ($29), which included 3 entrees (blue corn pancakes w/ duck, buffalo burger, and ice cream/cream puff). Gah! That burger was straight up dry and bland! The patty was massive, and I mean thick, it had to have been an inch thick! The thing is, I love my meat, but seriously, there's only so much dry hamburger meat a girl can eat.\n\nSo the burger was whack, but the chile relleno ($16) was off the hook! However, paying almost $20 for a chile relleno is ridunkulous! Our bill came out to about $60 with tax/tip for lunch, which I have to say is really steap!\n\nSo overally, Mesa Grill was a major let down."

S"***Review is for BRUNCH only\n\nTo get it out of the way...I'm not the biggest Bobby Flay fan.  On TV, he can come off as obnoxious, arrogant, and cocky.  However, the guy shows up on a bunch of different shows, which makes me wonder...is it just a persona he puts up?  I mean, he must be a decent guy to get himself on so many spots on the Food Network, right?  If it is just an act though, it works; his brash personality actually made me want to try his cooking even more, just so I could see if he's as good as his reputation suggests.  And being that the MESA in NY was his first restaurant, my friends and I figured this would the perfect chance to check out his cooking.  \n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't squeeze MESA in for dinner, so we had to settle for fitting it in for brunch instead.  When our party of ten checked in with the hostess, we were seated promptly, where the wait staff was quick to start serving our table.  Our waiter was helpful with menu suggestions, and was pretty good at describing and explaining the different components of each plate.  In fact, when it was all said and done, I ended up going with one of his suggestions - the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles along with the Rough Cut Tuna Nachos that a few of my friends wanted to split.\n\n- The Rough Cut Tuna Nachos - served with a mango & habanero hot sauce and avocado crema...terrific.  The tuna is similar to Hawaiian poke, but with Southwestern flavors instead.  In a way, with the crema, it's reminiscent of a guacamole salsa, but better.  Much better.  Too bad there aren't any places around here that serve it the same way.\n\n- Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles - served with a roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche.  Presentation wise, all of the colors on the plate really made it stand out (blue corn tortilla, orange sauce, white cheddar, green seasoning), but the execution is what really made the dish.  With three layers of crispy tortilla, it had a nice crunch, which worked well with the richness.  The combination of flavors were fantastic.  If anything, I wish there was more of a kick with the sauce, but it tasted great as is.\n\nIn addition, I also got a chance to try my friend's Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash, but I thought my entree was better.  Although I did like the spiciness and flavor, I would have like a little contrast in the texture.  Along with our meal, they also served a basket of bread, all with some Southwestern twists.  They were all decent, but my favorite of the bunch was the jalapeno bread.  \n\nIn the end, I'll give Flay his due...the guy can offer up a pretty good brunch menu.  The ones that I tried were great, though I know a few of my friends were not as enthralled with their orders (hence the four stars).  None of them said the dishes were bad though, so maybe it was just a case of hopeful expectations not being met.  Reviews on here are pretty high for dinner as well, so I'd be interested in checking that out next time.  At least now, I have another reason to go back to Vegas...not that I really needed another one anyways."

S"With food so delicious and inventive you know it could have only come from the mind of an Iron Chief.  \n\nI had heard rave reviews about Iron Chief Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. I asked quite a few people what style of food is served at Mesa and I got a wide variety of answers. Some said American, some said Mexican, but quite a few said Tex-Mex. Since I was kind of confused of what Tex-Mex food was I decided to take a trip down to Caesar's Palace with my girlfriend and give this place a try.\n\nThe restaurant has an amazing atmosphere. I love the d\xc3\xa9cor of this place. Mr. Flay sure has great taste. Once seated we decided to try some appetizers. I ordered the Blue Corn Pancake (barbecued duck with habanero chile-star anise sauce) and my GF got the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido with chips. The Blue Corn Pancake was phenomenal. The sauce on the pancake was great and the bbq duck was nice and tender. The dip my GF got was also very good.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the 22 oz bone in chipotle glazed rib-eye with red and green chile sauce and a chorizo goat cheese tamale with thyme butter. This dinner was absolutely perfect. The steak was cooked to perfection and the sauces that accompanied the meat really made this meal an unforgettable one. The chorizo tamale was incredible. My girlfriend got the sixteen spice crusted chicken with mango garlic sauce and mango salsa. The chicken had an exotic taste to it, which my GF enjoyed. For Dessert we shared the cornflake crunch vanilla ice cream with the Mexican chocolate sauce. This dessert was tasty and really hit the spot after such a great meal.\n\nThe service was 5 stars all the way. Our waitress was funny and very informative. \nMesa Grill is a bit on the expensive side but the food and services you receive make it well worth the money. I loved my dining experience at Mesa Grill. I have been back to Mesa a few times since this first trip and each visit has been as wonderful as this first one. Do your self a favor and check out Mesa Grill, you will defiantly not regret it."

I don't particularly like this. The pork tenderloin was almost room temperature. It's very flavorful and the sauce is great but had a gross pork aftertaste. The tamales are hit or miss as sometimes it will be moist and other times will be dry.  Newbies should try it. Blue corn pancake was okay. His breads aren't that great. Margaritas are average."

We sat in a corner booth, which allowed for privacy. \n\nThe waitress brought out a breadbasket, which had a variety of bread. We also got two free appetizers, because they sent it to the wrong table. Luck was on our side.\n\nI went with the signature dish for my entree- New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. I never had pork that tasted so good! It was melt in your mouth tender. I also loved the little bit of kick it had to it and the sauces. The dish also came with sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. Both spicy and sweet represented on the plate. I liked the tamale but it wasn't on the same level as the pork. \n\nI left with a full stomach and a great impression of Bobby Flay. In the future, I'll seek out his other restaurants."

Well, some vows are made to be broken. \n\nEverything we ordered this time around was mighty tasty. \n- The blue corn muffins were the stars of the bread basket, although they were a little crumbly. \n- The goat cheese queso fundido had a subtle tartness that went well with the green and red peppers of the dish.\n- Cheese quesadilla. It was just a quesadilla, but it was one of the best I've had.\n- Rough cut tuna nachos. Fresh, delicious, and a touch of spiciness.\n- Crispy squash blossoms. Deep fried (think tempura) with a tangy, yummy sauce. Loved it.\n- New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin. It was indeed tender. And hot. I just wished it had more of that bourbon ancho chile sauce. But it was so delicious that it just re-affirmed my love for all-things-pig related (maybe I need to get a tattoo of a pig like that one Top Chef contestant).\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is casual.

We started with a margarita, which was absolutely delicious (much more flavorful than anything you get sitting in a casino, of course).  For food, we got the cremini mushroom quesadilla (omg, amazing), the ancho chili salmon (yummy, great sear on the fish, but not spicy enough for us) and the shrimp tacos (tasty shrimp, but see below for my thoughts on the 'salsas')\n\nThe things that stuck out were the following:\nThe plating was beeeeaaaauuutiful. Everything looked a lot better than it tasted...\nThe mango habanero 'salsa' that accompanied the tacos was awful. It looked and tasted like baby food. Not nearly enough habanero...or really anything other than mango. I really should have tasted it before putting it in my taco because it really ruined it. Ick. \nWe asked our waiter for something spicy to eat with the fish and he brought us a delicious chipotle sauce. I wanted to take home a bottle of it.\n\nAll in all, we had a pleasant meal here.

S"We kicked off Restaurant Week 2010 at Mesa Grill. When we arrived at 5 o'clock there were very few diners, I'm pretty sure it was just us and two other couples. But as our meal went on the dining room quickly filled. We noshed on the bread basket while we waited for our appetizers, the blue corn muffin wasn't too appealing the bottom looked moldy. The fruit bread was the favorite, and I expected to like it least.\n\nThen, we got started on our first course: Roasted Corn Soup Smoked Tomato Salsa and Blue Corn Pancake Barbecued Duck + Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce. The soup was decent it had an unusual hint of flavor, I thought squash maybe, but my husband thought it tasted more like seafood. Obviously, we weren't on the same page. The blue corn pancake and duck were very tasty. Again, the blue corn does nothing for its appearance.\n\nFor the main course we had Blue Corn Crusted Halibut with Salsa Cruda, Sweet 100 tomatoes, capers, jalapeno, Fresh Oregano, Basil and New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon -Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale Crushed Pecan Butter. The fish was nicely prepared, the presentation was different - thanks to the blue corn it looked liked it had asphalt glistening off the filet. The pork was flavorful as long as you had the crust in every bite. The tamale was unlike your traditional tamale, still tasty, however.\n\nLastly we finished with Coconut Layer Cake and Banana Cream Pie. Both were good, but nothing particularly memorable.\n\nService was very good throughout the meal. All in all, it was a fine meal, it's just that nothing was particularly notable. I can't say I'd return, but I'm happy we took the opportunity to finally give it a try."

I had been here in the past and wanted to come again as I had thoroughly enjoyed it every time.\n\nWhenever I was seated I was disappointed to get the brunch menu instead of the normal lunch menu.  That meant no chile relleno that I had picked out earlier.  Instead I decided upon the 16 spice chicken salad with a side of chorizo. The salad was plated beautifully and the first bite of chicken provided my palate with the many spices.  Sadly I soon lost those spices in the rest of the salad.  It had a green onion  vinaigrette dressing on top with goat cheese and fancy lettuce.  Overall, I really enjoyed the salad.  The chorizo was also good but a bit overcooked.  It started out with a slightly sweet taste before finishing off spicy.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future the next time that I am in Vegas.  All of my previous meals here I would have given 5 stars but this time it was only worthy of 4.'

S'"This is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth" A common sentence used when Nickole and I dined here last Monday. Christine the bartender is AWESOME and made the best recommendations for us. Started our meal off with a house Margarita on the rocks with salt. Made up of Hurradurra Tequila, fresh squeezed lime, and agave syrup it was so good. Nickole had a White Peach Margarita and that was amazing as well. \nFor an appetizer we had the Tiger Shrimp Tamale, wow. Honestly the best thing I have ever eaten. With garlic corn, and a cilantro sauce that makes you want to cry... this Tamale was sculpted by gods, i swear. I could eat this dish every day.\nDrink #2 Pear Margarita. YUM Not too sweet but with a slight hint of pear. Very good... and strong!\nFor the entrees we both split the Smoked Shrimp Tacos and Ancho Chili Honey Glazed Salmon. wow x2. The Tacos were perfection. With grilled corn tortillas and a cabbage slaw the shrimp being so juicy and perfectly marinated this dish was to die for. The Salmon was perfect too. Cooked at a medium temp and on a bed of a house made black bean sauce and a cilantro oil the honey glaze complemented the salmon perfectly. Both amazing choices. \nDrink #3 Pomegranate Martini a little on the strong side but pretty good\nDesert- Sticky Toffee cake. Being gluten free I only had a small bite to try it and If my allergy was mild and wouldn\'t cause me severe pain i would have eaten the whole thing. wow was it good! and with a side of house made ice cream it was truly the cherry on top to our meal. \nI highly recommend this place to everyone. It will not disappoint! I cant wait to come back'

S"I know I might catch flack for this review but here goes.\n\nService is excellent but I don't spend $100 on dinner just for the service.\n\nI started out with the bread sticks.  They were spicy and stale.  The reason I bring up spicy there is a trend starting.\n\nI ordered the grilled asparagus salad.  I love everything in the salad.   The grilled asparagus, the baby lettuce, the small yellow tomatoes.  Then the dressing burned my lips off.  The dressing was so hot I couldn't taste any of the ingredients.  I am Korean my mom has made soup so hot it could remove rust.  That soup is nothing compared to this.\n\nNext I ordered the fillet.  The filet was cooked absolutely a perfect medium rare.  The only problem I had to cut off the entire outside of my steak because the rub was too spicy.\n\nI am an invited guest at Caesars so I could eat at any restaurant.  I was extremely disappointed in my meal."

S'I admit it. I\'m a foodie and I have high standards. I eat out a lot in New York. I\'d heard good things about the NYC Mesa Grill, so I figured this place would at least have some edible food. Error on my part.\n\nThe food bumps this review down to one star. The waitstaff could not have been nicer, which I why I\'m bumping it back up to two. But honestly, don\'t you usually go to a place like this for the food?\n\nThere are three sauces: an off-white one, an orange one and a dark brown one. Add some combination of these three to a meat or veggie substance and you\'ve got your entire menu. Creative, it ain\'t. Our party of eight tried just about everything.\n\nNot much flavor to the sauces or the dishes in general. Boring is the word that comes to mind. What kills me is that our waiter spent about half his time telling us "don\'t worry, nothing on the menu is spicy!" He might as well have said "don\'t worry, nothing on the menu is flavorful!" I have no problem with mild food, but it\'s a little weird at a southwestern themed restaurant.\n\nI can recommend the cactus pear cocktail though. That was tasty, and maybe after a few of them you won\'t notice the lack of flavor in the food.'

Chicken came with the skin on, but it was very tender and flavorful.

The corn sidedish is remarkable and a must for every order in my opinion, but the proteins didn't seem to be prime grade meats and seafood."

S'Stumbled upon this place while in Vegas, wandering aimlessly through the casino.  We thought "hmmm...Bobby Flay?  OK I guess we will check it out."  \n\nAt the time, we did consider the fact that neither my companion nor myself particularly cared for Bobby Flay, but we ignored that fact because, hey, he must be famous for a reason...his charm can get him only so far.  Perhaps the man can cook.  Plus, we were in the mood for mexican-like food.\n\nLesson learned: go with your first instinct.\n\nWe were there for brunch, and my date got a Mesa burger which was small but presented very nicely.  The flavor was just OK and the burger itself was mediocre, but the grilled onion and horseradish mustard on the burger were very tasty.  Southwestern fries were a bit firey and a little on the greasy side, but were an OK complement to an OK burger.\n\nI ordered Sophie\'s chopped salad and asked the waiter to give me a quick run-down of the veggies in it.  However, when it came, i found out that it had olives, which he failed to mention.  Because the olive-flavor was so overpowering (and i dislike olives), i had to send it back.  My date dug into his sandwich, and my replacement salad did not come until he was nearly done the meal.  Check minus on service.  \n\nI wouldn\'t be upset about the delay-time in getting my meal had this been my fault...however when you put something like olives (same goes for mushrooms or onions) in a chopped salad and the diner inquires , you should be sure to remember to list the components that have strong or polarizing flavors.  He may have just forgotten but it was not busy at that hour, so I was a bit ticked (and hungry).\n\nSide note - the bread basket had some decent items.  The blue corn cornbread muffins were really dry, the jalapeno bites were hit-or-miss on the "heat" factor depending on which you ate (perhaps some were mild and others spicy?), and the mini breakfast pastries were very good on sweetness and consistency.  Stick to those for your pre-brunch-calorie-consumption.  \n\nThe only redeeming part of the meal were the cocktails.  I had a tequila/Fresca cocktail that was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. it was delicious.  My date had a margarita which he claimed to be one of the best he\'s had...don\'t know how helpful that is, though, as he\'s generally not a margarita-guy.\n\nOverall, food was mediocre at the high points and awful at the low points, service was spotty, drinks were great.  I would say I expected more from Bobby Flay, but as I said above, he was just never really my style, so what I really expected was mediocre - and it delivered just that.  Expectations met.'

S"Wow, to get a 5th star from me on a 2nd visit means it's pretty good! I can be on the picky side.  What I am trying to understand is how the casino cafes can get away with charging more than Bobby Flay for a burger that doesn't even come close to what you get at Mesa Grill.  If you look at the guides, Mesa Grill is listed as semi pricey - well in comparison to the mediocre food at many of the casino restaurants, this should be listed as inexpensive!  A burger costs $16 and it's worth every penny for the way the cheese is perfectly melted into the meat and the onions are caramelized to perfection.  Fries are seasoned really well too.  \n\nThe barbecued lamb salad was delicious and not gamey.  They know how to make a pretty good Bloody Mary - but not as good as Old Ebbitt Grill in DC - Bobby ... go check it out and you'll see what I mean! \n\nService is always great.  Thanks for another delicious meal."

The location is also great for the boys when theres a big game -- grab a good seat in the middle of the main glass dining area and they can view and cheer along to all the TV's in the surrounding Caesars Sports Book.\n\nMenu is a bit small/limited and mimosas add up at a pricey $12 a flute, but their tiger shrimp tamale and spicy chicken sweet potato hash has me looking forward to coming back to give their full dinner menu a try. Bobby Flay's flavors are spot-on and worth a visit/return; plus the complimentary varietal bread basket is also a lovely touch."

S"I had brunch here on a weekend (they only serve the lunch menu M-F). \n\nMaybe my experience wasn't so great because my options were limited- but overall- this place was a huge disappointment. \n\nI ordered the cactus iced tea- nothing too special about it. \n\nWe had the goat cheese appetizer that everyone is always raving about and it was nothing more than melted goat cheese with some peppers in it which tasted average. It was so rich we only ate about 25% of it. \n\nMy husband ordered a breakfast enchilada and I ordered the bacon and hash brown quesadilla (off the appetizer side of the menu). In both items, the tortilla was too hard, undercooked, and heavy tasting. My husband's food tasted no different than normal breakfast food (just eggs and chorizo inside). Mine was disgusting- too much goat cheese grilled on the top, not enough bacon inside (hardly any) and the hash brown with the tortillas didn't taste right at all (bad combination but I thought it might taste ok). \n\nMy experience has been that all of the newer places in Vegas have tasted great- because they are still establishing themselves. The other places that have been around for a while no longer care to maintain themselves and have been mediocre to disappointing. The only exception to that has been Nobu.\n\nI wish we would have gone to Mon Ami Gabi or one of the high end buffets at Bellagio or the Wynn instead- it would have cost the same and no doubt tasted better!"

S'I was referred to Mesa Grill by the Concierge and surprisingly enough, had never heard of Bobby Flay before this, even though I watch the Food Network (how is that possible??).  \n\nMeat was highly recommended by our waiter so I ordered the N.Y. Strip Steak with Mesa Grill House sauce for $48.  Definitely one of the most tender steaks I\'ve eaten in my short life.  The steak was marinated and aged and once I took the first mouth-watering bite, I was glad I ordered the it.  Although it was ala carte, the steak was a good portion, around 20 oz. or so.  I would recommend this piece of meat to any steak lovers out there, but at $50 a pop, I would probably try other things first before repeating.\n\nSides were $8 a piece.  The spinach was okay, I could\'ve passed on that but I needed some greens.  The garlic mashed potatoes however, were excellent.  I\'ve had better before, but they definitely complimented my steak.\n\nTried the Tiger Prawns as my appy and although it was good, it was nothing to write home about.  \n\nOther favorites at the table were the Coffee Filet Mignon and the Tuna Steak.  \n\nTo sum up, the food and service were excellent.  Just figure to pay a little extra for the "Bobby Flay" name.'

This was our first meal of the day and we were starving.  We had a short wait of about 15 minutes but had a drink while we waited.  Our server greeted right away and his assistant brought us water and assortment of bread.  First of all the bread was really good.  There was a combination of mini bite size jalapeno cheese biscuit, blue corn and yellow corn bread (the best corn bread I've ever had) and two fruit type of pastry bars.  \n\nFor the appetizers we had the tiger shrimp tamales and a crispy bacon hash quesadilla topped with a over easy egg.

The man knows how to use a blender to create some bold and wonderful flavors.  Like myself - he likes a little heat but not so much that it just overpowers everything.\n\nBut something is missing from Mesa Grill.  I think I know what it is.  VALUE.  Look - I know it's not Little Caesar's pizza.  We're not getting 2 large pizzas for $9 or whatever.  But when you order a $12 appetizer and you get like 2 duck tacos to share amongst your table of white collar professionals who are aghast at the appetizer pricing you know something is wrong.  Love the flavor of said duck tacos.  Love the flavor of his tamales.  The masa is just so flavorful!  Unlike any tamale I've had.\n\nBut still....even with a nice steak.  The meal just is too expensive for what you get.  This is coming from someone  who has spent $400 for a meal and been happy to do so.\n\nSomething is missing but can't express it as well as I'd like.

S'I came here after several nights of over extending myself with typical Vegas debauchery -  literally having had only two hours of sleep and maintaining a consistent level of alcohol in my system over the previous 48 hours. In other words, exhausted and ready to pass out (exactly how you should feel on the final morning before you fly out of Las Vegas). \n\nI ordered the Sweet Potato hash, which resembles an egg benedict with a side of the mango glazed bacon and the creamy grits. The bacon was thick and cooked perfectly, but in the end bacon is bacon and there wasn\'t much reason for this bacon to cost what it does. But the grits were subtler in their spice level (I loved it). The spicy chicken eggs hash was the star of the show - spicy, sweet, and savory depending on the bite. I ate it as slowly as I could - heaven. \n\nLovely upscale decor with almost every table having a view of the "kitchen show" is a nice touch. But the tables are positioned too densely and strangely despite the restaurant being nearly empty another group was sat directly beside us. \n\nIt goes without saying that you are going to be paying quite a bit for the experience, but that\'s Vegas!'

Almost all the dishes I had here were drawn with sauces, I think the sauce should enhance the dish not over powering it. The only dish I would recommend is the Spicy Chicken+ Sweet Potato Hash on their brunch menu@ $16.50(with Avocado, Tomato, Maytag Blue Cheese + Buttermilk Serrano Dressing), the dish was very nicely presented and was also hearty and filling. The other good thing here is their complimentary mini blue corn breads.\n\nI sincerely feel that the chefs at this location should step up to the plate, and really refine their dishes and cooking skills, inorder to meet the standard of the one in NYC."

Too many flavors combining and its not concentrating on one flavor. When Bobby cooks on Food Network, your mouth waters, but at Mesa Grill...I didn't.  I tried Emerils before Mesa Grill, and loved Emerils. But to mention we could order off the BRUNCH menu only.  I looked at the pics from the dinner menu, and they look very good.

S"Several years ago I went to the Mesa Grill for Lunch. It was OK, but nothing special. I went again the other day for Dinner and was blown away. We were shown to our table by the very courteous staff. Then our server came over and answered all the questions we had about the menu. We asked a lot of questions, and she had answers for all of them and never seemed in a hurry to move away from us.\n\nAs an appetizer I had the roasted corn soup. It was so wonderfully creamy and tasty that I would have been happy with two more bowls as my entree and desert. It was that good. For my main course I ordered the New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This had a nice spice rub that had a bit of heat to it. If you don't care for spicy foods you need to stay away from this one. But, if you enjoy a bit of heat then this dish will give you a taste sensation you have probably never had before. The meet was tender and cooked to perfection. The Bourbon and Ancho Chile Sauce complemented it very well and gave it more depth. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes with a Green Chile Queso sauce. This was tasty as well and complemented the pork very nicely. My wife had the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chop and loved it.\n\nFor desert my wife and I shared the Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. This was a little slice of heaven. The coconut was a nice brown and not heavily caked on the outside. It was just lightly applied. The cake to frosting ratio was nice. There were four layers of cake and the total frosting was about the same as one of the layers. It was nice and thin.\n\nWe both enjoyed ourselves very much. I know we will be going back again."

S"Mesa Grill is a Bobby Flay restaurant so there are lots of chiles in everything. Not that this necessarily makes everything spicy, but you should know in case you have a pepper or spice aversion. I arrived late one evening to Vegas and after checking in to my room at Caesar's Palace I decided 1, I needed dinner and 2, I didn't want to go far so Mesa Grill answered my needs.\n\nI've said it before but I'll say it again so no one thinks I ate all this food by myself - I'm a sharer so when I go anywhere I like to order lots of stuff and share it with my dining partners. With this in mind we started with a Caesar type salad that came with chorizo as the meat and it was definitely an interesting take on this basic starter. One that I definitely enjoyed. We then ordered the black bean soup, grits with poached egg, and the pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale as our main course to sample.\n\nThe black bean soup had just the right amount of spice to it and so I slurped most of it up. The pork tenderloin was indeed tender and the sweet potato tamale that accompanied it was amazingly good. But, the real highlight of the meal was the grits topped with a poached egg. Coming from the South I've had my fair share of grits, sometimes they are made sweet with butter and sugar, sometimes they are made savory with spices and bacon, but I'm going to start suggesting they always come this way from now on. It was an item of food that would be just as comfortable at breakfast as it was at dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.\n\nOur service was also marvelous, the man who served us told us he'd been with the restaurant since they opened and his expertise in suggesting certainly made it seem so."

However, I have to say our dinner was pretty awesome.\n\nWe ordered the famous Tiger Shrimp + Corn Tamale, Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Fire Roasted Veal Chop, and Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. \n\nAll of them live up to its name. :)"

S'I know that some people are annoyed by Bobby Flay being all over the airwaves, but now I firmly believe he can back it up with real cooking talent. (or at least menu making talent)\n\nWe ate here twice, both times during lunch and both times very different. \nThe first time we ate here a long while back, it was a Monday right at opening so there were only a few tables of people. And we had, by far, the BEST service I have ever experienced at a restaurant in my life. \nThis last time it was a Friday around 1pm and every table in the place was full, everyone and their brother wanted to be there. And our service was still very good although impossible for them to be as attentive. I think the key is that there is a waiter and an assistant, so someone is always filling your glass and available for anything you could possibly need. \n\nEverything we have eaten here has been awesome and I recommend any of them. Blue corn pancake w/ duck and habanero, goat cheese queso fundido, spicy chicken and sweet potato hash, steak sandwich, pressed Cuban burger. \n\nThe seating is comfortable and accessible. The decor is really lovely in Southwest colors. \n\nLunch time is really casual and easy to get a table. Even if its busy, you are seated quickly. No need for reservations. \nAlthough if you do wish to call ahead, please note that you will be talking to Caesars and not the restaurant itself - and Caesars requires a credit card to hold any reservations. \n\nWe like coming here so much, we have decided it is our LV ritual now. And I look forward to venturing to the NE region to try some other Bobby Flay establishments in the future.'

S"Bobby Flay, you let me down.  Actually, I've never been a fan of his anyway so I wasn't too disappointed in the man himself, but I was sad that we didn't have an enjoyable meal.\n\nWe went for lunch on our last day and I tried the 3 course $29 pre-fixe menu.  The appetizer was Blue Corn Pancake with Duck. Wow, this was fabulous!  The spices were right on and the texture was perfect.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the meal wasn't as great. My entree was the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  The waiter mentioned that it came cold and I was fine with that.  But I wasn't fine with how tough the meet was.  I could barely chew it.\n\nThe dessert of the day was panna cotta.  I liked the flavor but it wasn't the best dessert I've ever had.\n\nSome of the other people in my party ordered burgers that looked juicy and delicious.  Other than the burgers, all of the other entrees were failures."

S"Oh Mesa Grill!  How you have swept me off my feet.  \n\nMy coworker and I came here based on a cab's recommendation and boy was I glad I listened.  Luckily, it was the beginning of restaurant week, so I got to try a variety of things for $50.\n\nThe Strawberry Fields cocktail drink was quite lovely with fresh strawberries, mint, and cucumber vodka.  Pink, sweet, and refreshing after walking around all day in the heat! :)  \n\nI must say the breads were WONDERFUL.  They were not your average breads.  We were given an assortment of three...I can't remember exactly what they were...but one was almost like a soft corn meal muffin with bits of herbs inside, another was more of a chewy bread with jalapeno bits, the last had raisin bits.  All different and unique.  I had to stop myself from eating the entire basket.\n\nThe roasted corn soup was SOOO good.  It was slightly spicy, creamy as can be, and incredibly sweet. The fried okra bits and green chile sauce (?) drizzled on top just made it even better.  I know I should not have ordered an appetizer, but I had the grilled shrimp with tamale and corn. It was a symphony of textures and flavors: juicy shrimp, grainy yet smooth tamales, pop of sweetness from the corn, creaminess of the sauce. \n\nThe New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with chile sauce and sweet potato tamale...ohies..I cannot even finish this sentence as my mouth is watering.  The three miniature columns of tenderloin were juicy and flavorful.  It was interesting to see how the tamale from the shrimp appetizer was savory, but this sweet potato tamale was sweet, almost like dessert with the slight crunch of the pecans.  I was just sad that I was not able to eat much of it as I was already full from the appetizer and soup.  \n\nFor dessert I had the roasted strawberry-gooseberry shortcake with vanilla whipped cream.  The shortcake is not like your traditional soft spongy shortcake.  Rather, it has a firm cornmeal texture.  It was pretty good, but I can't say it was my favorite part of the meal.\n\nOne thing I would have hoped for was for the dishes to be SPICER, but I would highly recommend this place.  It has a wonderful, warm, inviting decor that is not too hip or stuffy so you can choose to dress up or down.  The food is exciting and fun and I cannot wait to go back again and/or visit the New York location. \n\nI never cared much for Bobby Flay before (I like Paula and Giada...lol), but after that night I was completely sold.  Mad props."

S"Sorry Mr. Flay.  You're now a no-go celebrity chef in my book.  \n\nThis was *the* place we had to go to this time we went to Vegas.  Last trip we ran out of time.  This trip it was planned into the itinerary.  His cooking style seems so close to what we like, how could it go wrong?\n\nIt could sadly enough and it all began with a margarita.  We know our ritas.  And we know what a Partida margarita should taste like.  I think this was almost straight lime juice for almost $15 a cocktail.  Such a disappointment.  \n\nThe sandwiches weren't bad - but they weren't fantastic.  Well I thought so.  The new wife hated her roast beef sandwich which was served ice cold.  Mine was just okay- nothing wonderful.\n\nFor something we waited almost 3 years craving - talk about a sad lunch.  Oh well! Now we know and I'll avoid Mr Flay's restaurants from here on out!"

S"Our group was really disappointed by Mesa Grill.  While planning our Vegas trip, visiting Bobby Flay's restaurant was at the top of the list.  I am a fan of Bobby Flay and his food on Food Network looks amazing, but I would never recommend this restaurant to someone visiting Vegas.\n\nThe hostess was rude when I informed her that our original group of 8 was now 10, which should have been a sign to go somewhere else to eat, but we soldiered on.  They split us up into a table for 4 and a table for 6.  The server had a thick accent and was difficult to understand.  The service was poor and the food took too long to come out.  \n\nHighlights:  bread basket- all of it was really good, especially the jalapeno bread, quesadilla was perfection ... the bacon, cheese, onions and bacon were amazing.  Everyone at the table enjoyed it.  The ribeye steak, which was off menu, was excellent.  The home fries were also good.\n\nLow lights:  All of the egg dishes were really bland. The tiger shrimp tamale was bland and the sauce was too thin.  The mimosa was weak.  Everyone hated the hominy grits ... our table was full of Southerners, so grits have a high bar to meet and it failed miserably.\n\nVery disappointing and truly the culinary low light of our Vegas trip."

I also enjoyed that they had all the condiments already on the table, including the fresh ginger.

You'll be hungry forever! \n\nBaseline offerings are affordable, but in a way its like an American airline- you get nickeled and dimed for every additional item, including an egg. By the time you've built the bowl of your dreams, you're probably pushing a few bucks extra than what you thought you'd be! \n\nThe meat here is melt-in-your-mouth and fall apart tender. Really good. The egg is quite tasty as well.  I can tell that the food here is cooked meticulously and with pride when watching the guys cooking your noodles. That being said, I don't think it was really that exciting or remarkable. I got the shoyu ramen with less sodium in it, and the noodles and flavor weren't as good as Ramen Sora's.\n\nIf you had to pick one of the two to try, I would try Ramen Sora. The atmosphere at Monta reminds me more of a cold winter day in Japan in a packed ramen house, but I like my American elbow room! Also, the flavors are brighter and portions are bigger at Ramen Sora. ;)"

S'Came to Vegas for vacation and my friend kept telling me that I must try this place out.  I am from out of town so I cant really tell you where this place is at since I took a taxi but it seems like the Chinatown of Vegas.  It seems to be sorta hidden in the back of the shopping center but just look for the white sign.\n\nGot here around 12pm and there was a slight wait (nothing compared the wait when we were leaving).  Sat down and the friendly waitress took my order: Shoyu Ramen with corn and also the small fried rice (my friend said i had to get it no matter what) and yes I know thats a lot of carbs.\n\nShoyu Ramen:  my ramen came out with extra chasu and with no corn.  the waitress quickly realized this and immediatly gave me some corn on the side and didnt charge me for the extra chasu (kudos to her to rectify the situation).  The broth was very good and not overly salty.  I consider this one of the better ramens that I have eaten.  But the thing that stood out the most to me are the noodles.  Wow! This has got to be one of the best noodles ive eaten at any ramen joint and I have been to many in NY, CA and Hawaii.  Many places forsake the noodles and focus too much on the broth and chasu but very very good noodles.\n\nFried Rice: this was the dish my friend kept raving about and keep telling me to order.  I am not a huge fried rice person but it was pretty darn good! I devoured it within minutes of it coming out and didnt even leave a spec for my friend.\n\nVery good place I will definitely come again when I go to Vegas.'

S'Now that I\'ve come here enough to practically remember the whole menu, I think it\'s ready for a review. \n\nWhen I found this place (through Yelp of course) I thought to myself, "Could it be? A true authentic ramen place that the city I originally resided in devastatingly lacked of? My own little NYC Momofuku only a 15 minute drive away?" OH, SWEET BABY JESUS IT COULD! \n\nBefore making the trip to your next lunch or dinner date here, you should probably consider what day you\'re going and at what time. This place is SMALL, like 5 tables (2 4-tops, 3 2-tops) small with a couple seats at the bar, and it gets crazy packed! The first time I came here I literally drove by and was like, "awh hailll noo," and drove away. HOWEVER I will say that if there\'s just a couple of people before you, just be patient and wait. The tables turn over rather quickly.\n\nWhich leads me to the menu. It\'s very simple and quick to prepare. If you\'re going with ramen, they have 4 different broth options: Shoyu (chicken), Tonkotsu (pork), Tonkotsu-shoyu (chicken & pork) and Miso. All are priced around 6.95 a bowl. Just forget the rest and go with the Tonkotsu-Shoyu. All ramens are prepared with two slices of pork, bamboo, and chopped green onion. Don\'t forget to add extra ingredients like an egg and mustard leaf! If you\'ve never tried mustard leaf, it really compliments the broth and makes it extra delicious...order it on the side and try it out! Adding in the ingredients is what really gets the meal to be pricier than expected. Just 1 egg is an extra $1.75, but it\'s okay to indulge a little every now  and then, so just go all out with you bad ramen self! \n\nThey have other items as well such as fried rice, small plates, and cold ramen! I still have yet to try them.. will do an update after my next visit! \n\nThe only negative thing I\'d have to say about the ramen is it can get pretty salty, of course you can mention to them less sodium, but I\'m pretty sure all they\'re going to do is dilute it with hot water. To leave it on a positive note, aside from the saltiness the broth is PERFECTION. Extremely murky, so you know its packed with flavor and takes overnight cooking to prepare.'

I can't explain this ,but the broth is a bowl of salty goodness.\n\nCons:\n *  A bit on the crowded side.  It's a small place packed with tables and seating.\n *  It's a hit or miss with the wait for this place... it's always busy so be prepared.\n * Parking sucks...period!\n\nOverall:\n  One of my favs in Vegas.  I'm giving it a four stars in comparison to other Ramen places I've been (not necessarily in Vegas).  \n\nTips:\n*  A good place to come with a group of friends.. Very casual atmosphere\n*  Be eco-friendly and save yourself the hassle by trying to carpool if possible."

S'Did you ever think there would be such a restaurant here in an "all-nighter city" that cooks and serves Ramen noodles? Yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along Spring Mountain Road or otherwise known as "Chinatown" in Vegas.\n\nAs you may or may not know it\', "Ramen" noodles is one of Japanese noodles invented in 1958 by Japan\'s Nissin Foods. These are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your Asian or Oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend\'s pantry). It\'s one of those quick cook-it-up soups.\n\nIt\'s rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my Mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in Vegas. Soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! Ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!\n\nWith a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, "Moshi, moshi!" in Japanese, which translates to "Hello" or rather "Welcome!" (I have learned a few Japanese greetings in high school and  having been to Tokyo before, the greeting didn\'t sound "foreign"). It brought a smile to my lips, I knew I would have a good dining experience. \n\nThe restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist Japanese style decor including the bathroom\'s interior design was contemporary Japanese. There are table seatings and bar-like seating available. Menu is simple. Three choices of Ramen noodle soups in "Tonkotsu Ramen" (pork bone), "Shoyu Ramen" (soy paste), and "Miso Ramen" (bean paste). Nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. A list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 "Other Dishes", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.\n\nI ordered the house specialty soup which is the "Tonkatsu Ramen" Soup. It\'s very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. Topped with green onions, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), I drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. Oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. Surely, the pork melts! Another dish I ordered was the "Mimi Mentaiko" which consists of Fish Cod Roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and green onions topped on a bowl of steamed Japanese rice. Very appetizing, a sure favorite! The "Pork Belly Bowl" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. As usual green tea on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.\n\nFunny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! I caught a glimpse of the cook\'s smile.\n\nYes, I left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup!\nIt must have been that I really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that I needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. For a price that\'s easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! "Arigato gozaimas!" (English translation is "Thank you!"), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!'

Mine (tonkotsu shoyo) was great at first, but the more I ate, the saltier it tasted.  Being on a limited sodium plan, it was a little much for me, but it was still delicious.  The kuro was good, but it was better with the thicker noodles. \n\nService was quick and polite. \n\nI really enjoyed my first ramen bar, and look forward to going back again."

S'Outstanding food ! The fried rice was particularly amazing -- better than any typical "Chinese restaurant" fried rice. Outstanding flavor. I loved my shoyu ramen - very flavorful and not as salty as I feared. I spiced it up a bit with the spices on the table. Dining companions tried the gyoza (dumplings) and enjoyed them. Reasonable prices and excellent, speedy service. Small place with very few tables and counter service so arrive early or late,as you will probably have to wait otherwise.  I dined with two big eaters and they were full at the end of the meal, sharing a fried rice a gyoza and each having their own ramen. (Note that the regular-sized fried rice was not as big as expected, but not to be missed)  WARNING: Not many , if any, healthy options on the menu that I saw - so save some calorie real estate for a great dining experience at the casual Monta - well worth it!  I skipped the gyoza, had just a bite of the rice and gave one of my dining companions some of my noodles and still -- I was content!'

S"Monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in Las Vegas. Its in the same strip mall as Raku on Decatur/ Spring Mtn. \n\nMonta reminds us of Japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. It's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. The restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nThe menu is simple. Miso, Tonkatsu, or Shoyu ramen. My favorite is...all of them. Huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  I seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. They give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, green onions, half boiled egg, and kikurage. Its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nAnother favorite is their pork belly bowl. Its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. You get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. Its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. We always get a small bowl and share it.\n\nTheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee fried rice. We need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that Monta is known for.\n\nIts easy to over order food at Monta. Because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. \n\nMonta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! \n\nArooha!!!!!"

S"This place has over 1k reviews so I was pretty stoked to try it out.  I have to say it's OK.  \n\nWe pretty much ordered each type of ramen they have here.  The broth is fairly tasty and the noodles are pretty good but it was SALTY.  I drank 3 glasses of water while eating my food.  I don't know if they make fresh noodles here but I know I've had better noodles.\n\nHowever that soft cooked tea egg, PERFECTION.  That really made my ramen so much better.\n\nIf you come here be prepared to wait since it's a tiny restaurant.  Luckily it moves pretty quickly but I would not come here with more than a party of 2.\n\n*For Vegas standards, maybe this is the best out in the area."

S'I read a review down below that kinda summed up this experience for me: Southern California Ramen restaraunts have spoiled me and jaded my taste buds.  The pork they put in their soup is a little on the fatty side and the broth seems to have to not been skimmed enough since it is also oily and fatty.  Interesting atmosphere though.  However I would say that if you want better Ramen go down the street to Ichiza.  Monta has a limited menu of just oily soup while Ichiza is an explosion of variety AND they have better Ramen soup.'

S'What can I say about Monta. I used to like it. Unfortunately, "used to," is the key word. Today, I keep coming back expecting their classic ramen, best broth, and perfected simplicity. But I now must admit all I have come to expect is disappointment. I have been coming here for about 2-3 years. But now I can\'t help but second guess my decisions. \n\nThe service here has seemed to have gone down the drain. They give so much attitude and don\'t really care about the customers. You are rushed to order and if you have any problems or questions you are met with eye rolls and sighs. I\'m not a picky eater, not at all, but service is key. \n\nNow to the food. I remember the food they used to have was great. Unfortunately that didn\'t seem to translate over time. Like watching the slow death of a once great king, the food quality has seemed to die too.  Over salty broth, oily broth, boiled gyoza, and an appalling meat to rice ratio on their side dishes. What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? \n\nTo this I\'m sorry Monta... You have lost me. I used to defend you feverishly against other ramen places but now... You have betrayed me. So to all you newbies that rave and praise this "new" monta. You can have it. I will leave this place in the past.'

S'Ramen flows in my bloodstream. I\'m selective with ramen and I know when it\'s good. This un-nutritious sodium filled bowl of broth and noodles can make or break my day.\n\nNothing will beat great ramen houses in LA or NY, but being in Vegas, finding a good ramen joint is satisfaction. Monta ramen is located in Chinatown off Spring Mountain.\n\nI opted for the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen  6.95\nTonkotsu-Shoyu ("pork bone and special shoyu base") Ramen has a cloudy white colored broth. The broth is like a mix of the Tokyo and Kyushu style blend.\n\nI added green onions and hard boiled eggs.\n\nI prefer the thicker broth and it delivered. It was creamy but not overly fatty. The eggs were cooked to perfection with a moist yolk. The noodles weren\'t undercooked. I had extra noodles afterwards for $1.50. \n\nIn the end, I was filled with pleasure and satisfaction. It wasn\'t the perfect bowl of ramen but I left satisfied.'

Always a good sign!\n\n+Monta has 4 soup broth to choose from: Tonkotsu, tonkotsu-shoyu, shoyu, and miso. Always nice to have varieties since I'm sick of just eating tonkotsu at every single ramen shop. My boyfriend and I both ordered Tonkotsu-Shoyu but I opted for chijire men (thick, wavy noodles) and it was awesome! The noodles had great consistency and the soup was spot on.\n\n+Their 6 piece gyoza tasted like legit ramen shop gyozas. Yum!\n\n\n-Limited seatings. There are four desks that seats four people, one desk that seats two people, and 9 seats available at the counter.\n\n-Line forms even before opening! My boyfriend and I got to Monta a little too early around 11AM. We were waiting in the car and people started trickling in around 11:15AM and there was mini line formed already before opening! Since it's limited seating, the people in line will fill up the restaurant and there will be constant flow of customers/wait time during lunch peak hours.\n\n-I read someone's review that they had great fried rice so I ordered it but it was a-okay. I've had better ramen shop fried rice before so I will not order it again if I visit Monta.\n\nMonta needs to definitely open a shop in LA. Cannot wait to eat Monta until my next visit to Vegas!"

Thanks to the fellow Yelpers I got another go to spot for some great hot soup (other than Pho) for those cold/chilly nights..\n\nI went here a couple days ago and decided to go for the suggested:\n\nTonkatsu - Broth was Tasty and Creamy, resembled a Miso type soup. Noodles were great. The Pork was awesome, it was extremely tender!\n\nShoyu - Broth was much darker than the Tonkatsu and had a slight soy sauce type flavor but a bit salty for my taste. Noodles great as well. The Pork definitely the highlight!\n\nPork Belly Bowl (Regular Size) - First of, I'm so glad I ordered the full size than the small. I love Yoshinoya Beef Bowls and this was a Glorified version of it! This is a 100% Must Try\n\nGyoza - Great Starter, just dip it in a bit of soy sauce and enjoy.."

S"Now to start, the reason I gave four stars it because the customer service can be terrible. I once brought 6 friends (all who had never been there before) to try it. There tables are only made to seat 4 at most, and even though there was an empty table and the one next to it had just paid and was ready to leave, instead of waiting 5 minutes and seating us THEY SAT THE EMPTY TABLE. After we had already been WAITING FOR 45 MINUTES, they again wanted us to wait for two tables to clear out at the same time. Not gonna lie, I lost my s***.  Then, to try and make it up to us they tried to offer us bar seats (after I made it perfectly clear in the beginning that we wanted a table) and we just picked up and left. Apparently bringing more than 4 people and asking for a table is too complicated for the waitresses to handle and caused their brains to melt.\n\nOther than that, I have never had a problem with their service there and their ramen is the best I have ever had. Even my half Japanese cousin (who is from Tokyo) said that it's the closest to Japanese ramen you can get in the states. It's always crowded now (a testament to how good it is) so be prepared to wait. But the wait is usually not too long since they get people in and out as fast as they can.\n\nIn conclution: Never arrive in a group of more than 4 people (or you will overload the poor waitresses' brains, heaven forbid) and you will have a fabulous dinner. :)"

S'Besides gallivanting on the Las Vegas strip for some great eats, my cousin and I decide to venture out. We wanted to get some curry, but the place we wanted to go to was closed during lunch hours. So with my trusty Yelp app, we decided to search what was popular around the vicinity. Monta Ramen was the first thing that popped up in our search, so we headed there.\n\nAs we arrived, there was a small line formed outside the building. Typical for a well known ramen spot. We added our name to the wait list and had about a fifteen minute wait. Once we were called, we sat around the prep area. Our server handed us our menus and gave my cousin some recommendations on their popular dishes. As for myself, I already knew what I was going to get.\n\nI decided to the the miso based ramen, which includes some basic ingredients:\n\n- Green onions \n- Two slices of chashu\n- Bamboo shoots\n- Kikurage\n\nThere are extras you can add to your ramen, pricing varies. I got the following extras:  \n\n- Butter\n- Corn\n- Extra side of noodles\n- Nori\n- Soft boiled egg\n\nOur ramens came out fairly quickly after placing our orders. As quickly as they were served, they remained piping hot! The presentation was nicely put together. I mixed all the ingredients in the bowl and took my first sip of the broth. The broth was very tasty. The addition of the butter gave the broth a creamy taste. The noodles were soft and easy to chew. The hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked to my liking with the runny yolk. The chashu seemed a little dry, but still tasted great.\n\nOverall, a great experience and comparable to some of my favorite ramen spots in the Bay Area.'

S"Eating Ramen while it's 106 degree heat? Yup, it definitely was the first experience of that. For some weird reason I was craving for some ramen in the middle of night, so decided to give it a shot before leaving Vegas.\n\nOrdered:\n\n1 Shoyu Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=S6GjWA8YTXDsJVdXtLUM6A&userid=xRbBt5MVKZ5-_8HhhfI26g) - for those who don't eat pork, this bowl is the way to go!  Chicken based soup that's not too salty and not greasy. The noodles were cooked perfectly, which is always a +.  The only tiny thing they could probably improve on is to have the egg yolk more runny. \n\n2. Fried Rice (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EQy8G0ot2T5Vj1nQyFUtAA&userid=xRbBt5MVKZ5-_8HhhfI26g) - very good fried rice, yummy tasting, delicious, fatty, but not sure if it's one of the best I've ever had like other review said. \n\nWould definitely return again on a non-summer day!\n\n\nTip: Be prepare to wait cause the long can be long!"

As with many ramen shops, it is very small and seating is limited to tables and the counter.  Our group of four were seated within 20 minutes and I ordered the standard Tonkotsu bowl.  I thought the noodles and pork slices were nicely cooked, but the pork broth was a touch saltier than what I prefer.  My husband's miso broth was smooth and savory, without the overwhelming saltiness.  There are also options for you to add in extra ingredients to customize your bowl, such as an egg, pork, corn, and extra noodles.  A great find that's different from the usual Vegas eateries."

I didn't even finish it and was wired out of my mind!\nIronically, the who schtick, at HH is the portion size and BF ordered something like bacon and eggs... looked like a IHOP plate.\n\nSecond visit was ladies dinner group.  It was fun seeing the ridiculously sized portions arrive at the table and of course the selfies and mugging for the camera  with mountains of food.  I had fried green tomato sandwich with got cheese,  Blech.  Sounded good but execution failed.

Roscoe's serves WAAAAAY better chicken and waffles. The chicken was dry and the waffles were too doughy. Where's the sage? The maple reduction was the best part about the plate but it stuck like hot glue so I couldn't get much from it. You absolutely need to ask for more syrup. The fried leeks were bitter.\n\nFried chicken eggs benedict... 4 stars. Sooo heavy but sinfully good. Very filling. The chipotle cream sauce really makes it. Good thing for the tomato bc it really cuts through the heaviness a bit.\n\nMeatloaf hash... 5 stars! The meatloaf was sooo moist and tender. The biscuit is delicious with the homemade strawberry jam. Even though this place is known for their fried chicken benedict... I HIGHLY recommend the meatloaf hash.\n\nThe best thing about our meal?

They are 4 huge slices on this dish and it comes with fried Plantin bananas.  They already add the syrup for you and they actually put a good amount.  Of course they offer extra syrup and butter for your taste.  My cousins ordered the Chicken Eggs Benedict, and the BBBLT (bacon bacon bacon Lettuce Tomato sandwhich).  Again, portions huge!  \n\nWe were actually able to order all different things and share family style.  I think that's cool.  All the food was yummy!

S'Rewriting this, since someone asked me why I didn\'t like it. We went for my friend\'s birthday because he claims he\'s enjoyed this place before.\n\nFirst off, I can\'t understand how this place has high ratings at all. The food is shitty, and the service is horrendous. When we walked in, the first place we were seated was right near the entrance where people can walk past you on two sides. I politely told the hostess that the table was unacceptable, and that we wanted to sit in a booth. She tries moving us two tables over so that we\'re right next to the busing station, and all the servers would be walking past us and guests on their way to the toilet. Apparently "please seat us in a booth, we don\'t want people walking behind us while we\'re eating" is something that\'s not understandable. \n\nWe had to then wait 10 minutes for them to clean an empty booth.\n\nWe sat down and hadn\'t even had a chance to look at the menus, when our obnoxious waiter came up and asked if we were ready to order. We told him we\'d like some time to look at the menu, and would let him know when we were ready. Less than two minutes passed, and he returned and asked again for our order. We had to repeat this three times.\n\nWe were served cold biscuits with honey and butter. The biscuits were not light and fluffy, nor were they very tasty. We also had an ant in our bowl, which we found after we had been eating. When we told a passing server about it, she responded with "Did you find it before or after you ate the biscuits?" ... What? We found a LIVE INSECT IN OUR FOOD. What does it matter if it was "before or after"? \n\nEveryone\'s plates came on obnoxiously sized serving dishes. My husband and I had ordered a kokomo sandwich, which came on dry assed texas toast, despite being called "milk bread". There were no sauces or anything to add flavor to it. The meatloaf, while tasty, is nothing I couldn\'t make better at home, and the sandwich was definitely NOT worth $13. My mashed potatoes came with, what looked like a sheet of cheese colored plastic on top of them. I couldn\'t even puncture it with a fork... The bacon was kinda glued to the cheese as well. My sandwich also came with a steak knife jammed into the middle of it, and a tree of rosemary. Not good presentation at all.\n\nI ordered an arnold palmer to drink. I told a passing waitress (the ant woman) that it tasted off and was watered down. I honestly think the fresh brewed tea they had, was just a cup of water that had sat next to a teabag at some point. Very poor quality.\n\nOur original server had gone from being hovering to neglectful. We didn\'t see him until after it was time to drop the check. We had told him at least four times that it was our friend\'s birthday, without any acknowledgment at all. Finally I said "What kind of restaurant is this? Even fancy restaurants in vegas offer to do something for a guest\'s birthday.". He told me that HHAGG doesn\'t, and offered to "bring us a dessert" but assured us that it would not be complimentary. We decided to just cut our losses and leave. \n\nI will not ever return to this horrible restaurant. Seriously. Train your damned chefs. Teach them how to make proper food, and not just slop whatever they think is edible on a plate. Train your waitstaff and teach them to walk the fine line between being a hovering nuisance and neglectful... And do something for your damned guest\'s birthdays.\n\nOh, and hire some damned pest control, please.'

S"So apparently when I'm in vegas, my diet goes out the window. Rather than doing our usual brunch buffet at the Wynn or other casinos, we opted to get Hash House. I wanted to go to this location off the strip because the wait isn't as long (I get very angry when I'm hungry. The snickers bar commercials where ppl turn into crazy angry hungry monsters definitely applies to me haha). ALSO after we left, we met BJ PENN & GOT A PHOTO W/ HIM!!! :D Being a girl that's into MMA, I was so happy.\n\nThere's patio seating outside for those that want to get your tan on in the nevada sun, but we opted for indoor seating. The service was very friendly, no complaints there\n\nFOOD:\n\nMushroom, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke scrambled egg white hash & ordered extra side of ham steak - What can I say? I'm a petite girl w/ a big appetite. I devoured this whole cast iron plated meal except for a few pieces of potatoes. You seriously get enough potato wedges to last for days here. Everything was cooked perfectly. Eggs weren't overcooked. There were plenty of mushroom, spinach, etc. The biscuit was warm and flaky, I doused it in butter and honey. I was in heaven! The ham steak was huge, but good and not super salty\n\nChicken Pot Pie - my bf ordered this and I helped him out a little 'cause I was still hungry after eating my dish LOL. I loved how this wasn't just ordinary chicken pot pie. It's served in a cute giant hat w/ gravy oozing everywhere. Dish came out piping hot and fresh! There were plenty of chicken breast pieces throughout each bite and yes...loads of potato wedges. I really like the gravy here, everything tasted so home made. I'd recommend this dish over the fried chicken biscuit benedict\n\nAndy's Fried Chicken Biscuit Benedict - 2 of our friends ordered this and it was just ok to me. I know it's a popular item, but it really did just taste like fried chicken w/ biscuits...nothing too special. At least the fried chicken wasn't too greasy\n\nWatermelon lemonade - IT LOOKED SO AWESOME!! check out my pic http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0Eh9jlsKXJIN8N9CuLnIsQ/ms.jpg\nTasted really refreshing and not super sweet. The watermelon wasn't overpowering either.\n\nCaramel Coffee w/ scoop of vanilla ice cream - So my friend ordered this cause we had serendipity the night before. This basically tasted like any other frappe, but great palate cleanser for all that food!\n\nI love the big portions at hash house and the pricing is just right for what you get!! I know they have one back home in CA,but it's all the way in SD :( They're expanding like crazy in vegas, how about building one in Orange County?!"

I highly recommend the Chicken and Waffles! The chicken was so moist and infused with rosemary, best fry chicken I\'ve ever had. And the waffles are heavenly with a thick cut of bacon right inside! The waffles were substantial but yet fluffy, perfect texture. Everything comes together with a scallion glaze that\'s both savory and a little sweet, it goes perfectly with the waffle, bacon and fried chicken. No wonder it\'s the NYTimes favorite.'

S"Took my family here for my brother's birthday. I had somewhat high expectations, but I know from experience that I should always temper them. Fortunately, the place was as good as I hoped. I couldn't resist ordering the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. I've never had chicken and waffles before, so I wanted to know what the big deal is. Well, the chicken was absolutely amazing - juicy and tender. The waffles part of the equation was also good. It was an interesting dynamic to have bacon inside the waffles. I just wish I had more maple sauce (I suppose I should have asked).\n\nOther people at the table had different variations of a hash dish. From what I tried, those were also good. For me though, it's all about the chicken and waffles."

S"Just got back from Vegas and something's changed at Hash House from a couple of years ago when I visited last.\n\nThe Bloody Mary was watered down and very drab.  It has a big hunk of brick-hard, dry toast hanging on the side.  It was nothing like I remembered.\n\nI then jumped into my Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it too had changed...for the worse.  It was really bland and just a pile of mashed potatoes with a dry biscuit split on top and a fried chicken breast on top of that.  Piled on top of it all was a pile of bland scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and a spicy cream sauce.  The sauce was nice and the chicken breast was flavored well but that was it.\n\nI wished I had gone with my tried and true favorite: the banana and brown sugar flapjack."

S"OMG... Saw this place featured on Man V. Food on the Travel channel and had to check it out. The portions are HUGE...and the food is pretty awesome. I had the chicken and waffles and yowza it was a tower of food. I have to say the waffles were good but you can tell that it was a bit on the heavy side making the waffles thick and slightly dry instead of light and airy. The chicken was delicious and crispy and not at all dry. Combined with the hot syrup it was yummy! \nThe bf had the fried chicken benedict which was also huge. The chipotle sauce drizzled on top gave it a nice little kick. \nWe thought we were going to some hole in the wall breakfast joint but turned out to be pretty nice. They had a whole menu specifically for their unique drinks in addition to their regular menu and a separate menu for specials of the day. My chicken and waffles were $18.95 but it's great bang for your buck if you wanna try it on a Friday when it's a special price of $12.95. Good price for lots of food."

S"We couldn't leave Vegas without another trip to Hash House A Go Go, but we wanted to avoid The Strip location because I was afraid we'd miss our flight. We ate here right before dropping off our rental car and our friendly server was really good about making sure we were out of there in good time.\n\nSince it was Tuesday afternoon, there was no wait (and plenty of parking right out front), but we already knew we wanted to have Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The portion was enormous, bigger than your head (at least my head...). We shared an order with extra chipotle cream on the side. When our mountain of food arrived, we happily dug into a delicious combination of fried chicken, fresh spinach, bacon, tomato, mozzarella, spicy chipotle cream, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes and a yummy fluffy biscuit until we could not eat another bite. I was stuffed for days!\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, we watched other people tackle towering plates of pancakes, waffles, fried chicken, Benedicts... Incredible if anyone could actually finish! \n\nGreat location and the prices are about a buck less than the location on The Strip.\n\nAndy's Sage Fried Chicken Farm Benedict. Get it! It's good! Man v. Food. Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict likely will win 99% of the time. It beat us, and we shared! Are you up to the challenge???!?!"

S'I reserve my 5 star reviews for the most revered establishments, at which i have never had a care, worry or problem. That said, if i could, i would give Hash House a solid 4.5. \n\nLike a lot of folks, i saw Hash House on Man V Food. I had the place logged in the back of my head so when i was at a conference in Vegas for a week and the boss says "where we eatin\'?" i was ready with a home run.\n\nIve eaten once at the original off strip location and once at the new location inside the IP. For the original, we were seated quickly on a weeknight and service was prompt, but that\'s not wat you want to hear about, is it?\n\nThe food is fucking MASSIVE. That night we had 2 appetizers, the fried green tomatoes and something else that escapes me. Both were good but i was focused on getting what i had been waiting weeks to try; the sage fried chicken and waffles.\n\nAlright, so, 2 MASSIVE fried chicken breasts stacked on top of 4 bacon waffles roughly the dimensions of 2 hotel room Gidions bibles cut in half and stacked, all held in place with a huge steak knife. The chicken was crisp and delicious with sage running throughout. The bacon in the waffles was amazing and was topped off with a maple reduction. By the time i was done forcing as much into my body as humanly possible, i still had a meal left over for the next day.\n\nYou would have thought we were in a photo studio with the ammout of flashes going off. Everyone in here takes pictures of the food, don\'t be shy, show everyone back home what theyre missing. HHAGG goes on your Vegas bucket list.'

I had the salmon bendict. Scarfed that thing down.

Not familiar with Vegas, we ended up at the M Hotel specifically to eat at the Hash House...of course it had closed 2 days prior...you'd think they'd update their website. So, we drive back 20 minutes to arrive at the one on the strip. Greeted (if you can call it that) by a young man, a host, who looked miserable to be there. Slumped over in a stool at the host stand. Not very welcoming and took our name. \n\nWe were seated after a 30 minute wait. Service was rather slow. My husband ordered the sage chicken Benedict which he said was ok. The potatoes on it were amazing. I ordered a bacon waffle which was a sad sad waffle indeed. Not very flavorful...compare to something you'd get at Denny's or norms. :-/ \n\nPortions are enormous.

S"The food itself was great. It was a late minute decision to come here due to the fact that my favorite restaurant was close on Sunday's. \n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles and ate 2/3 of it. The chicken was very moist to my surprise! And the waffles with bacon went well with the chicken. My friend ordered the Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict. She was nowhere close to finishing! \n\nReasons for the two star deduction is basically customer service:\nA) When we entered the young female in the front took a long time to figure out that there were customers waiting on her. And when we asked for an outside seating she said it will take 10 minutes. But her co-worker behind her says a table was ready for us. She seemed confused as we followed the guy to our outdoor seating. So communication on their part needs to be fixed. \n\nB) Our food came out in an orderly time (around 10 minutes) which wasn't bad for the humongous portions we were given. HOWEVER, the servers were sloppy when they handed us our plates. The First Lady brought in my friends plate first and clumsily lays it in front of her. As the plate dropped and the server turned, an orange slice slipped off the plate and landed on my friends lap. I've never seen anyone so careless in putting a plate down a table. \n\nAnother different lady came in with my plate minutes after that and the presentation was just not pretty. The fried sage was literally hanging off the plate when I saw it coming. That's my biggest pet peeve because either they don't care about the way it looks (I doubt it since all of their food looks spectacular) or they are just overall clumsy. \n\nC) Lastly, the lack of customer interaction was just not there. I guess that's it's perks of being outside? After I got my check it took them a good 10 minutes to finally come back and check up on us. \n\nEven though my first experience here was rocky, I know I'll be back soon to hopefully redeem this great restaurant. Till next time."

It comes out of the kitchen looking like a Michael Phelps breakfast (complete with joint). The gravy is mixed with a roasted pepper cream sauce and it makes the whole thing taste like tomato soup. The hardest part is getting started (it's literally a tower of food) and knowing when to stop.\n\nOne thing I didn't expect, the coffee is real good. Dark and bold, like a Folgers commercial.\n\nI was there on a Tuesday at 12:30p and it was packed. Lucky for me, I dine alone and was able to belly-up to the bar."

The portions are ridiculously large so come hungry. The food is original (waffles with bacon baked in? yum!) and cooked up perfectly. Service was fast and attentive, nothing to complain about there. It's the kind of breakfast that makes the world seem right again. If you're in Vegas you need to try this place.\n\nThe only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it's SO hard to find. It might have been partly our fault since we decided to park in the Caesar's Palace parking lot...which is a completely different story...but the restaurant is inside the Imperial Palace casino so you have to find your way through the maze that is a Vegas casino in order to get there."

It was tender on the inside and it goes great with the whole meal. Definitely a sweet & savory meal for sure!\n\nThey don't take reservations during the weekends so there is typically a 10-20 min wait around breakfast time which is not bad at all. It's definitely worth the short wait. The servers get pretty busy so you might not get your drink refill instantaneously. Parking is also a pain sometimes. I suggest one person to get out of the car and put your name on the list while somebody finds parking ;)\n\nOh their watermelon lemonade is pretty good but I don't think it's worth the $5 honestly.

My second visit was a simple breakfast with The Better Half (TBH).\n\nI ordered the Chorizo Hash (Chorizo, Jalapeno, Cheddar Cheese, Potatoes, Eggs, Biscuit, Peppers & Onions).  TBH ordered the Salmon Benedict.  To wash it down, I had the Mango/Peach Iced Tea.\n\nAfter a short wait, the food came out.  Since we have been here before, we knew what was in store for us....a massive plate of food.  Adam Richman from Man vs Food picked a great spot to host his show.....portions are LARGE!  You have to bring your A-Game to finish your plate.\n\nMy strategy was simple....I will save the Biscuit for the end.  Biscuits are stomach busters.  I added some Tabasco and dove into the Chorizo Hash & Eggs.  It was very good!  The combination of ingredients had a good flavor to it.  The saltiness of the Chorizo combined with the gooey Cheddar Cheese and hot Potatoes made for a huge plate of Awesome!  I wish there were more Jalapenos on it though....it didn't seem to have enough of them.....kind of light.  The Eggs were prepared Over Easy just the way I like it....with the runny Egg Yolk covering the Hash when I broke the seal.  As I said, the Biscuit was last and I ate most of it with the final third of my dish....it was puffy & buttery....delicious and filling.\n\nTBH enjoyed her Salmon Benedict, but could only manage to finish 1/2 the plate.  I packed up the other half for later.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience, just like the first time.\n\nWill I return?  Soon....very soon!"

Everything here looks so good it is tough to decide on what to eat and drink, as you want to try everything.  The spiked Limeade is a perfect morning-after cocktail; tart enough to mask out the taste of vodka and served with a massive oversize straw for big gulping.  The Gin Mary is really good too, and I am not really into Bloody Marys that much.  Portions are huge.  Had the Favorite Scramble with the salmon, pesto, and brie and tomato.

All you can do is stare, take it in, then devise a plan of attack...as I did this day.  I was determined to leave with nothing in my had but my car keys.\n\nThe steak knife holding the dish together is needed.  I cut that thing up methodically and devoured it.

For that reason, I\'m convinced they have steel reinforced tables.\n\nYesterday was the five year anniversary of this branch.  5 cent beers and free appetizers for their happy hour.  Not thinking, I failed to carry cash with me, and upon realizing this, there was no way I could have purchased a dollar\'s worth of beer via credit card.  My liver would have exploded.\n\nSo in going back to my car, I managed to scrounge about 30 cents out, which either makes me resourceful or a desperate drinker.  Between the five cent beers and tasty appetizers (their fried green tomatoes are wonderful), I was "good" for the my visit.\n\nNormal, non-anniversary dining has always been excellent.  The food is good, the portions are stupidly huge, and the atmosphere is fun.  This is more than a "you get what you pay for" sort of place.  Their burgers are the size of small throw pillows, and their breakfast fare is tasty (and again, stupidly huge).\n\nGet here early, as the place fills up fast, and they\'re only open for a few hours at a pop.  Who knows what will happen in "Year 10", but I imaging I\'ll have five years of various dining experiences throughout to figure out what they\'ll do by then.'

S"O.M.G. the portions in this place are huge!! And if they run out of room on the sides they go upward. I've heard so much about this place from T.V. and family. And it really lives up to it's name. Even the drinks are amazing. The watermelon kiwi lemonade (just the name alone makes my mouth water) was so good I had to have two of them. The food is not only huge it's actually good. I had the sage fried chicken and waffles and could only eat half. The table where we sat I could see all the dishes that came from the kitchen and they all looked and smelled so good. My next trip to Vegas I will definately be headin back and bringin the whole clan with me."

S"O.M.G. portions were huge!!! Felt like I was eating in a buffet since the size of my plates were doubled. It was definitely a great experience and well worth your money. I ordered a sandwich with some seasoned potatoes and veggies. That thing was so big that I had to cut it into fourths. My friend also ordered a burger that she couldn't even scarf it down because it was that big. Overall, a great place to visit if you're hungry for some good appetite. Just remember that there will be leftovers on your way out."

S"One of the rare spots I've experienced here in Vegas that totally reminded me of Hollywood/Los Angeles. Came here ona Sunday afternoon/Brunch and this place was Stuffed to the Rim! There was no line out the door but once I opened it, it was like New Year's Eve on the Vegas Strip! Well, it was nothing new to me as this is a common occurence in my  home town. \n\nThe hostess tells us that the wait was gonna be around 45min - 1hr. So, I squeezed my  way to the bar and ordered the infamous brunch beverage - Mimosa. About 10 minutes later, I was still thirsty, so I ordered a Tangerine Mimosa. I never tried this combination before and I must say it was Awesome! Finally, get seated, about 40 minutes later, and by  this time I practically  memorized half the menu. \n\nAndy's Sage Fried Chicken..: Served on a Big plate, Stacked architecturally sound and I couldn't wait to have a bite! The chicken, bacon mashed potaotes, eggs, biscuit.. Everything just worked and was more than filling!\n\nFrench Toast: Another Enormous dish! Extra Thick bread with galloping amounts of pecan maple syrup and pieces of banana. It wasn't Great but not Bad either.\n\n\nKiwi Watermelon Lemonade: Awesome combination and  came with a Fat slice of Watermelon as its garnish.\n\n\nConsidering the long wait, the Alright tasting food, the Claim Jumper sized portions and the Great drinks.. I can't say I'd be back for a second round. I can only vouch for the generosity of food and the beverages at most.."

S"Ok, I understand all the hype on this place - their portions are for fatties, the food is kind of tasty, and it's hip. Cool dude.\n\nHowever, this is not a place I ever seem to crave. It's super busy most of the time and I hate waiting to eat at a restaurant that I'm not crazy about. Perhaps I haven't ordered the right item to make me feel this way yet, and that's why I'm not on the same page as everyone else. \n\nThe few times I had eaten here, the food was not horrible, just nothing really memorable (other than the size of the colossal dishes) to make me crave it. If portion over taste was what I was into, this place would be top of my list. But it's not. \n\nThe last time we ate here, I ordered the chicken and waffles which was very unimpressive. It was completely dry. I should've tried something else because I don't think anywhere in town beats DW Bistro's Jerk Chicken and Waffles, so maybe that was my mistake. The portion was of course too large, and it seemed like everything was just thrown on the plate. I didn't feel like the flavors complimented each other well at all. My Bloody Mary with the Bacon strip was ok. I don't know. This place just didn't do it for me during my last visit.\n\nMaybe next time (if there is a next time) will be better."

Night after night of going out and what not really drains you and when you wake up, your famished!!! so here i was, FAMISHED. and i think we waited for an hour? hour and a half? but for a party of 8 :\\ so that could have also been a factor... anyways, if your hungry come early is what i learned.\n\non to the food. there are soooooo many choices to choose from! i love breakfast food and everything sounded so delish! i figured i should split because i heard the portions here were SKDJFSLDKJDLFJ OUTTA THIS WORLD... and they were... but hey - that means i have food to eat when i get drunkchies. I ordered the  Andy's Sage Fried Chicken which came with mash potatoes eggs? a giant biscuit oh it has BACON lol every fat kid's dream. i dont know how to describe this to you but it was just simply amazing. it was even more amazing eating it at 4 am. Each time a plate of food came out my eyes were LITEREALLY like O.O DAYUUMMMMMMM. seriously, the portions here are huge. HUGE. even people who were splitting had a hard time finishing... but yeah place is definitely worth it. it is pricey but for the portion you get, its  pretty cheap."

First of all the combination of flavors put into the dish is crazy, different, and scary at the same time but definitely good!! I had the champagne super nova which is an alcoholic beverage and you could keep the glass it came in for 12.95. It was so good! I ordered the kids bacon waffle for only 5.95 and I the portion fed 2 kids. I had the chicken fried Benedict... Huge portion so filling, different,and amazing. They call it twisted farm food which fits perfectly! Service was great and prices I thought were crazy good for the amount of food! \n\nWent back for a second time ordered the chicken and waffles and that was awesome too.

I happened to join my hubby on a work trip and told him that we needed to eat here and we had to get The chicken and Waffles. \n\nWe go up the escalator and walknin. It was crowded but the wait wasn't long. It gave us enough time to look at the menu and see what we wanted to devour. \n\nI went with the signature chicken and Waffles and my boo the steak eggs Benedict. The presentation of the food is a work of art. The flavors were bursting in my mouth. The just of right crispness of the waffle and juicy bonesses chicken breast with rosemary seasoning. Ugh I want one now please!\n\nThe steak and eggs Benedict was also yummy. Not everyone makes a great hollandaise sauce but they nailed it. \n\nCheck out foodiecutie for my pics of what I ate."

S"This Hash House A Go Go has become a must stop by, place to eat when in Vegas!  There are so many great places to dine when in Vegas.  This place is not close to the strip, so it doesn't hit a lot of people radars when they search Yelp for a great place to eat.  But if you're willing to take a little drive or cab ride off the strip and want a super meal, breakfast-lunch or dinner, this Hash House A Go Go is a fantastic place to go!!\n\nLocation~ just a couple of miles off the strip in the Asian Market area.  The restaurant is very clean and inviting and easy to find.  It has a great ambiance that is family friendly. \n\nFood~ it's hard to choose from one of their many hash skillets if you're dining for breakfast or just feel like eating breakfast for dinner.  Their veggie and corn beef hash skillets are two of my faves.  Both are DELISH, served with eggs of your choice, on top of potatoes and with a biscuit (or what ever you would like to eat)!  They also have super burgers and pretty extensive menu with loads of things to choose from.  Yes, their portions are huge, so you may want to share with a friend if you're not hungry :-)\n\nService~ it's always top notch.  They are very accommodating even for the pickiest of eaters.   They are very friendly and eager to help you.  \n\nThis is one of the best places to dine in Vegas off the strip.  They offer flavorful food and super service.  I hope to see you there some day soon."

Even with the two of us sharing the plate, we couldn't finish it.  It was just waay to much but it was very good.\n\nThe reason for the 2 stars was our server, he straight ignored us 3 times so for every time he ignored us I took off a star.  I was the first one who tried to call him over after we ordered 10 minutes ago and I was still waiting for my ice tea, I looked him dead in the eyes and waved him over and he turned around and walked into the back.

She was attentive, down to earth, and gave us great suggestions. \n\nFood: HUGE portions. I ordered the HH meatloaf House Hash. I was a great mix of meatloaf, potatoes, eggs, spinach, cheese, etc. I really enjoyed this dish. The meatloaf was well prepared and seasoned perfectly. The biscuits were creamy and fluffy. I couldn't finish the damn thing, so i spent the rest of the day and parts of the next morning eating it. The GF got the sage chicken, which was awesome as well. Juicy and moist. We also tried to share a blue berry walnut pancake, but failed miserably. We finished about 1/3 and gave up. It was very good though. \n\nOverall, it was a great dining experience.

Good thing we decided to go elsewhere because if I waited 1.5 hours to eat Hash House, I would have been even more upset.\n\nThe second time I came back, we were seated within 15 minutes.  Outside, you see pictures of celebrities that have eaten at Hash House.  The main reason I decided to visit Hash House was because of the raving reviews Adam Richman gave on Man vs. Food.  Adam, your credibility is seriously on thin ice with me after my experience here.\n\nHash House is located inside the Imperial Palace hotel along the strip.  Is it just me or does this place feel cold and unclean?  \n\nService here was also iffy.  It took our waitress a while for her to come over and take our drink orders and the restaurant wasn't even full.  She also disappeared at the end of our meal after she dropped off our check.  Then, she charged us an extra $2.50 for a split plate!  Ridiculous.  If I could give a negative star on service, I would.\n\nHash House is all presentation.  Their dishes come out looking massive!  Andrew D. and I ordered the chicken eggs benedict and I was SERIOUSLY disappointed.  Eggs benedict is my FAVORITE breakfast meal, but the dish SERIOUSLY lacked flavor and kick.  I was waiting for my taste buds to be stimulated, but alas, it was bland.  I ended up having to season the thing to the best of my ability with the tabasco sauce, ketchup and black peppers we had at the table.\n\nOur whole group left feeling unsatisfied and a little bitter for having to waste our money on this place.  IIII felt bad also for making the group come back not ONCE, but TWICE to give it a try.\n\nDo yourself a favor and find another place to have breakfast at.  Hash House is all talk and no flavor."

There was no "WOW" factor to any entrees I sampled!\n4.  This is voted "Best Buffet in Las Vegas" by many publications so I had very high hopes for the place.  Suffice it to say, my expectations were not even remotely met!!\n\nOverall, the buffet is pretty good.  I just expected so much more!!  Especially after hearing so many positive comments about the place from friends and family.  \n\nThe one section that I did like (besides the beer and wine) was the dessert section!

Even though the M Resort is off the strip, the line up for the buffet especially for the seafood buffet on weekend can be verrrrry long.  The food quality is top notch, except for the sushi.  I don't care for it since the sushi rice tends to be too cold.  The mac 'n cheese is one of my favorite dishes here though they tend not to serve it when they have the seafood buffet.  The prime rib is good too since if you are patient, you can get a medium rare piece but they disappear fast.  My last trip out I had the seafood buffet comp'd so I really indulged in the fresh oysters and the crab legs (which I am glad were not salty).\n\nThey have a really good assortment of desserts but my favorite is the ice cream counter. \n\nService is generally really good to excellent most times we have been.

Your last grand buffet before going back to regular boring life style.. Stop off for your last grand buffet at Studio B! You'll thank me later! (Or hate me)\n\nGot to admit it, pretty good buffet! What blew my mind away was not the food, but yet the dessert bar! How could there be such delicious all you can eat dessert bar??\n\n I am devastated they ended the senior deal so my folks didn't get their discount. We paid  about $35 per person. One of the best part to not give up on this was there was a line for their VIPs and Handicap and another line for everyone else. Well, keep in mind if anyone in your party is in a wheel chair or an elderly, you can get into the handicap line and get in without much waiting! \n\nMy family is really not a big fan about buffets only because are eyes are way bigger then our stomach and we feel like crap afterward! BUT... who can resist missing one of the best Buffet in Las Vegas. I kind of forced everyone for a final stop and forced to have lunch at Studio B before heading to LA.\n\nThe food was impeccable. Prime rib and King crab legs, I just stuffed my face with these two items! haha. Fresh and delicious.cusines, from Chinese cuisine to Mexican, American, French! The list keeps going!\n\nOh my Gawd! The dessert section is like heaven. And usually at buffets the desserts doesn't taste so good, their either too sweet or not sweet enough, but this place is amazing! All different kind of cupcakes, from Red velvet, chocolate to peanut butter.Creme Brule, to all kind of cakes, macaroons, the best a full gelato bar!I had a pistachio nut gelato and a cappuccino (Yes even a cappuccino bar) to end my meal!!\n\nUNLIMITED EVERYTHING!!.. including Wine, Beer, Cappuccino, Express, and Gelato!!  :-)))"

S'So I asked my Facebook friends for a good buffet in Vegas -- and I got tons of response for this buffet, so my some of my friends and I decided to pay a visit.\n\nWe arrived at 3:50PM, and dinner started at 4PM; Luckily, we were able to get away paying for the price of lunch, which was $17. Can you say "WINNER?!"\n\nThe wait wasn\'t too bad -- just because we came at an awkward hour; however, the wait for crab legs and oysters were a little ridiculous. The line was long, and I think it didn\'t really help with all the seniors there taking their time-- not to hate on our beloved senior citizens or anything. Other than that, there were a ton of great selections-- from crab legs (not king crab legs), oysters, CRAWFISH, to basic tuna/salmon sushi, etc. My favorite were the KBBQ ribs and fresh oysters. Oh, and the dessert selection wasn\'t too bad-- CREME BRULEE! GELATO! ... And the rest were mediocre, just because they were a tad cold.\n\nOn top of that, UNLIMITED DRINKS! Well, sorta. One of my favorites was the M Cider-- which was like apple cider, with a bit of alcohol. Being the one shot wonder that I am, I was only able to have one drink... and I was still unable to finish it.\n\nOverall, M Buffet was great. One star off, just because of that line for crab legs and fresh oysters. Other than that, I wouldn\'t mind coming back -- it\'s like the PERFECT stop before Vegas, if you\'re coming from California!\n\nTurn Ons:\n-A large variety of food!\n-M Cider!\n\nTurn Offs:\n-Long lines.'

I hate people who complain overly much about waiting at a buffet line. DUH, if there\'re people waiting there\'s a reason for it.\n\nOverwhelming is the first word I would use. This place is HUGE and with so many offerings, I wish I had multiple stomachs. Whatever your heart desires, they\'ll have it here. I love the oysters, they were fresh and succulent. I usually get my money\'s worth with the prime rib and today was no exception. \n\nThe dessert section is where I usually gauge the "awesomeness" of a buffet and Studio B delivers. Dozens of choices and they also have a gelato case with many flavor choices but also...get this...a barrista! You can get your deluxe cappuccino and lattes included in the price of your buffet. \n\nI had overindulged this past weekend with alcoholic spirts so I had safe Coke and an after-meal coffee. Wine and beer IS included in your admission which makes the $33.99 a terrific value. I\'m considering just spending a weekend at the M Resort just to indulge in their buffet.'

But of course, that was our choice to wait...\n\nAnyway... this place was pretty large and was designed in an open format.  We could actually see the strip from where we were seated... but the buildings were smaller than the salt shaker on the table. \n\nThe food.... not bad... they actually served raw oyster (really fresh and no sand) which I wouldn't see a lot in a buffet.  that was pretty good.  I remember having a lot of options on a lot of different types of food... but I don't really remember anything in particular that strikes me...\n\nBut I do remember having fresh made cappuccino/latte by the dessert area which I thought was a nice bonus to this place.\n\nOh... did I mention unlimited beer and house wine."

S'best priced, best tasting buffet in las vegas. there\'s a reason why the wait is over an hour long. \n\nprime rib is cooked to PERFECTION. even the well-done section is tasty and not tough or gamey or chewy. the buffet is REASONABLY priced and it has a REASONABLE selection. they dont take every food name they can think of, and put it in the buffet. you get a little bit of each type of food without being overwhelmed.\n\nthe desserts are delicious and theres gelato and fresh coffee drink options. service is GREAT in that sense. service was NOT great trying to get in. after you get through the line, you wait in another line. and i asked the lady how much longer we have to wait. she doesn\'t  tell me a time. she just tells me "a few more minutes". woman... 20 minutes is not "a few more minutes". this is my only complaint about this place. but i can\'t complain that the line was long and i was hungry. just comes to show how many people will go out of their way for good food. \n\nthe price is reasonable. and theres free beer and wine. i absolutely enjoyed their seafood/sushi that i expected to be gross after my experience at bellagio. meat. meatmeatmeatmeatmeat. gosh im hungry. prime rib. prime freaking rib. \n\nok. im just going to keep repeating myself so.... goodbye.'

Asian, American, Italian, and more.\nDesserts: They have their own baristas making you coffee, gelato with awesome M&M toppings, and more. Absolute best dessert selection.\nAlcohol: UNLIMITED Beer + Wine. How the hell can you beat that? Most other places don't give you anything.\n\nOverall, the food was insanely good. The crab legs were plump and juicy. The service was great, and the food selection was very large.\n\nA++++.\n\nI am going to the M Casino every time I crave buffet!"

S"A great buffet but pretty far off the strip. Its a good thing that the M resort itself is a fun place to be. \nSo we stood in line for about 1 hour 30 min when it was estimated a 2 hour wait which is good. Oysters and crab legs are always excellent, but what sets the crab legs apart are the fact that they are served whole. Some places like the Wynn buffet will split in 1/2 for you, really killing some of the taste. \nBeer and Wine being served make it awesome, but you should try the root beer that they have on tap too. \nOther than that, most Vegas buffet items are available, although I didn't see if they had anything made with Kobe Beef. \n\nThe Best Buffet in Vegas? Probably, but not by much. For the $30 you can find other great meals in Vegas."

S'i was really looking forward to the wynn buffet during my stay in vegas. one of my friends actually suggested this place and kept talking about how amazing the buffet here is. I still dont see anything amazing about this place. it is very overpriced for average food. 40 dollars per person i think is a little ridiculous for this buffet. the only good think about it was the unlimited BEER&WINE. nice.'

S'My one complaint about the Studio B Buffet is that their plates are not big enough.\n\nSeriously, their buffet is like a mile long winding snake and everything looks so good, that my plate inevitably gets filled up and then I see more stuff that I want to try. Yes, there are mountains of crab legs, but there is also sushi, prime rib, pad thai and curry, hummus, pizza, pasta, Chinese food, fried chicken... and that\'s only about 10% of the stuff they offer. A HUGE and delicious selection. I had 3 platefuls, and this is not including soup, or dessert, or drinks.\n\nYes, drinks. Beer and wine is included. I saw some complaints about the small cups and how you can only get 1 tiny drink at a time, but this was not the case for us. The pours were all decent sized, maybe about a half pint glass for beer? And they let you get 2 drinks at a time. In fact, they would ask if you wanted beer with your wine lol. I had the cider which I think was a raspberry cider and it was really good! In addition they have an M beer (a German-style lager, I was told), Coors light, PBR and root beer. And of course your wines.\n\nIf booze isn\'t your thing, they also make espresso drinks at the dessert station! I think they might even be able to booze those up for you because I saw bottles of amaretto next to the vanilla syrup. Speaking of desserts, I think I ate 4. I meant to only take a bite of each, but I couldn\'t stop myself. Oof, no wonder I had to roll myself out of there.\n\nWe arrived around 4:45 and people were already in line. We only had to wait about 20 minutes, but still my heart sank a teeny bit when I saw a line. I also made sure to get a player\'s club card, but was told there is no discount. Maybe because it was Labor Day? I also read a few reviews which mentioned getting a "Fast Pass" or sorts to come back at a later time, but I don\'t believe this is the case any longer and you just need to get in line.  \n\nWith that said, it\'s totally worth the drive off the strip to come here. Totally worth the $30. I\'m sitting by my phone now waiting for the M to call me and tell me I won the free buffet for life.'

S"Mmmmm all you can eat gelato & ginger crab legs? I'm in :-).\n\nThis place is a little out of the way but I kinda appreciated the peacefulness of it while still having that modern NYC feeling at the same time (minus the crowds of people of coarse. \n\nThis place definitely had a lot variety ranging from Asian( Thai, Korean Chinese, & Japanese) Italian, BBQ, seafood dishes, etc. It honestly depends on the type of cuisine you like because some genres were done a lot better than the others. For example the rice on the Nigiri Sushi was hard! But my Asian mother would have told me just to say the fish n leave the rice on the plate since its more of a filler. So I advice you to eat the Nigiri as if it were sashimi lol. I think I was expecting the sushi to be above other buffets that serve sushi such as Todai unfortunately it kinda fell below....\n\nMy favorite entree was the ginger crab! It was sooo juicy, moist, & flavorful to the point where my mouth is watering just writing about it. My only concern was this beautiful buffet didn't have the shell crackers for me to crack open a crab leg....this was a first...so I had to manhandle my crab by cracking it open with my bare hands (remember these crabs are slathered in a ginger sauce so u can only imagine how lovely and greasy my hands were looking...barbarian status).  So please bring in your own...had I had some I would have eaten 2x the amount! \n\nThe all you can drink wine was an added bonus :-).\n\nPlease be sure to sit around or save room for the gelato bar...that shit gets pricey on the strip so I definitely made sure to get my fair share. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed this buffet and would definitely come back!"

I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere here, the decor is really fancy. I went here for the lunch buffet with my family, 5 people & it was under 100$ (i think it was 80$?), and they had unlimited beer & wine. what a steal! I made more than 6 trips back & forth. They had all different kinds of foods there to Mexican food (salsa, taquita, tamales), Japanese (edamame, sushi, salad), American (ribs, beef steak, different potatoes/fried/mash), Soups (clam chowder, hot&sour), Desserts galoreeee (creme brulee, gelatin, cookies, cheesecake) Seafood.

It's better than say, the buffet at Luxor, but it's not exactly the most high-end either.  The biggest win is the beer and wine included in your buffet price.  PBR on tap?!  Why yes, thank you!  And a made to order latte to end my meal with some strawberry sorbetto?  Sure, why not!  But if you're looking for the freshest halved king crab legs and shucked kumomoto oysters--this isn't your place."

S'So here\'s another "parallel universe" review... where the place where we ate, had the same address as the place other yelpers ate at... but our door must\'ve been marked, "not so good stuff inside for you!" (?)\n\nYou may have heard from a friend about this buffet, or read the billboards coming into Vegas. That\'s what "wetted my appetite." As I was speeding into town for a trade show, I saw the word "Best" stood out on the billboard... alongside the word "buffet." And that\' stuck with me from until Wednesday evening when  we drove over to the M for dinner.\n\nFor someone who\'s visited Vegas from the late 60\'s until today, I know that Vegas buffets fight for that "Best Buffet" position in this town. What caught me off center was that when I saw the billboard, I missed the whole phrase, which is, "Best Buffet VALUE"... not the more direct "best buffet"... which this certainly is not. However, I do have some positives, and points of redemption, although minimal.\n\nOverall, the entree items were just OK to sub-par. The chicken enchilada and chicken tamale, sushi, Chinese food items, were not much better than fast food level. Their small offering of MIddle Eastern tabuli, hummus and stuffed grape leaves all had this weird taste. (?) The one item that saved it for me was the prime rib. And the best area of this buffet has to be the dessert bar. They have a gelato area with over 20 flavors. But other than that, this was sooo bad. It honestly reminded me of food you\'d find at a Homestyle Buffet, which also reminds me of food in a chow hall. (and my references go back to things like "Midnight Chow" on the flight-line on Guam, circa \'67... where chip beef on toast was the highlight of the day.)\n\nJust to make sure it wasn\'t just me, I asked the opinion of a friend who lives in LV, and owns a delicatessen operation in town. She said they\'d tried it, and it was, in her opinion too, horrible. We concured it was like eating buik packed frozen entree items you\'d get from Costco. The saving grace was the staff. We found everyone to be very friendly. And I did give our server a healthy tip. But would I return? Only if I wanted to pay a little under $25 for unlimited wine, beer, gelato, cakes, pies and cookies. So if you\'ve been doing some weed... and really have the munchies for sweets, beer and wine... this could be your place. \n\nAnd a footnote about "best value." The Barona Casino in San Diego County has a buffet that\'s about $24 list, with discounts on the buffet for joining their players club; you get about $8 off. But the difference there, is that the food is actually pretty decent. When I\'m in Vegas, I\'m not looking for a great value as much as great food. So yes, I would\'a paid more for "better."'

S"Went for the Thanksgiving Feast.\nArrived at around 6pm. Didn't get seated until 9:45...yeah...it was THAT packed...\n\nOverall the buffet is well balanced between things that work and things that didnt. I cant throw my arms up in the air and just cry out that every was delicious and how i wish to go back every chance i could but realistically i can't. Instead i'm just going to list things i've had and comment on them in my usual review fashion. (Hint Click the 'Useful' button)\n\n- Hard Cider -\nWanted the Root Beer but they were all out, darn kids... so went for the hard cider. Was carded upon request but stopped taking offense after i noticed the woman working the drinks was carding everyone. Wow this stuff is good, very light in taste, doesn't have an aftertaste or linger, very refreshing.\n\n- Ginger Snow/King (yeah i don't know which) Crabs - \nEveryone was assaulting the cold/warm legs and i didnt feel like waiting to pick off what ever's left. My buddy found these in the Chinese section. They were pure WIN. Perfectly seasoned, still warm, juicy and fresh tasting.\n\n- Prime Rib -\nWhen i got to the prime rib station the hunk of meat was nearing the end and the handler was struggling to get cuts of the meat correctly. i requested the hunk of dark meat with the fat. He was glad to get rid of that part for it was much larger then the rest due to his 'excellent' slicing skills. Wow...the end piece was perfectly seasoned and almost melted in my mouth. Totally made that 3.5hr wait worth it.\n\n- Chicken Florentine -\nDry, tasteless, dry...more dry...more tasteless...epic fail\n\n- Steak Grilled something something... - \nWow just WOW these were good. Forgot what it was called because it had an unusual name but looked like grilled steak covered in gravy. The steaks were well done but wasnt tough or stringy. They had a VERY nice grilled taste and the gravy wasnt overpowering at all.\n\n- Bamboo Mahi Mahi - \nHad an unusual flavor, i can only describe it as 'woody with a citrus background' but the flesh was just so dry\n\n- Shrimp Cocktail - \nHit and miss. Some shrimp had firm tails, some hard, some nearly dissolved. Cocktail sauce was heavy on the horseradish.\n\n- Here i go again - \nis anyone even reading any of this?\n\n- Red Seafood Curry - \nWish they offered Indian curries. Anyway the curry had more of a seafood flavor then a curry flavor. Spicy but with no flavor so it was just a spicy seafood taste.\n\n- Chicken Teriyaki - \nTasted like steamed chicken with sauce poured all over it. Would have claimed this to be fail but the chicken went along great with the beef red curry sauce.\n\n- Hummus -\nThe first time i went to this buffet i remembered the hummus to be the most disgusting dip i've ever seen but ended up the best hummus i've ever had. This trip was the complete opposite. The hummus looked average and tasted...blah. Tasted like gritty cream with no flavor.\n\n- Pizza Bread - \nDont know why i got this but so glad i'm did. Pretty much topping and sauce-less pizza dough in pizza slices with cheese on top. Tasted awesome.\n\n- Roasted Lamb -\nOvercooked and tasteless. Tough and a bit stringy. Salt couldnt fix the lack of flavor.\n\n- Mushroom Salad - \noooh these little marinated mushrooms were bomb \n\n- Pistachio Shooters - \nWhoa these were good, Pistachio pudding with raspberry puree at the bottom. Very nice\n\n- Tiramisu Shooters - \nEh not quite the epic tiramisu i've had at CPK (of all places to have tiramisu...) but they were...alright\n\n- Oreo Cookie Shooters - \nEh...Why? with the Pistachio and the Tiramisu why even have this? It's like putting a musket behind a machine gun. obviously one is vastly superior then the other.\n\nLast bit was the experience. I know it's thanksgiving and i know the entire buffet shuts down and starts booting people by 10:30. But COME ON. It's Thanksgiving and we've waited in line for 3 and a half hours. I know the staff wanna go home to their families but COME ON I WAS IN LINE FOR THREE AND A HALF HOURS!!"

S"OMG is all I can say.  I was truly blown away by this buffet. Let me count the ways....\n\nFirst - it's already at least 10 bucks cheaper than my other favorite Vegas Buffet - the Wynn - so that's already a ++\n\nSecond - I don't drink - BUT for those that do - free unlimited wine and beer (from the tap).  it's not of your chosing - I believe it's the house selections - but there was a variety and it's unlimited.\n\nThird - you seafood lovers out there - this might not be the Rio's seafood buffet - but on the weekends starting at 2:30 - it's a seafood buffet as well.  There were plenty of crab legs, shrimp, oysters on the half shell, mussels, etc.  My friend was raving that the shrimp was really really fresh.\n\nFourth - Pastas, Fish and Chips, roasted meats, Asian selection, pizzas, etc etc...there were so many stations.  There were 5 soup selections alone.  SO MUCH FOOD.\n\nFifth - DESSERTS!!!  nevermind the selection - they also have a selection of gelato.  AND you can get some espresso drinks WITH alcohol in it at the same station.  You want some Kalhua or Amaretto with your espresso drink - you can ask for it here.\n\nI'm not going to lie - I waited in line for a long time - maybe an hour and 1/2? - and I went at about 1ish.  When we left, the line was still the same length.\n\nAlso - want a few bucks off the price?  sign up for the players card before heading over to the buffet - it's free."

S"I have been to this buffet many times and it is our normal stop as we drive into Vegas. I can say that I enjoyed it alot better before it became popular (especially with the locals) because the line can be well over 2 hours long.\n\nOur most recent trip to the buffet was on Christmas eve. We waited in line for over an hour and it was a total clusterf#$k. The line was unbelievably disorganized. The people who had already paid and were waiting to be seated were blocking the path of the people waiting to pay. Because of this the cashiers were not calling people up to the counter to pay and the line seemingly didn't move for an hour. I was scolded by the cashier when I dared to walk up to the counter without being summoned. Our total wait time was 1 1/2 hours, but when we were led into the dining room there were many empty tables. The line could move more efficiently if they would put some sort of system in place and possibly remodel the entrance to the buffet where people queue and pay.\n\nAside from the logistics, the buffet itself is good but not great. For the price it is a good value considering it includes all you can drink beer and wine. My favorite items at the buffet are the Tomato Basil soup and the sweet potatoes. I sat next to a man and watched him down 4 bowls of the tomato soup...it really is that good.\n\nOther than that the prime rib is good, and everything else is hit and miss. Like any other buffet some items are better than others. The desserts are good. There is a nice selection of cookies, pastries, and many different flavors of gelato. There is also an espresso bar where you can get drinks with Baileys, amaretto, Kahlua, etc.\n\nPersonally I think lunch is the best value at $14.95."

I come here, I pay half the price, I get great food, great service, huge selection, AND a wine/beer/coffee bar?! "Wait? is there an A health grade?" I secretly asked myself and sure enough, YES THERE ARE MANY!! i\'d probably be here way more if I lived closer. The only thing I did not enjoy was the butternut squash soup which was like warm baby food. That is my only complaint of about 5 plates. The dessert included gelato, and creme brulee, as well as Bailey\'s to go in my espresso. Loved it! Can\'t wait to come back on a night with some crab legs!'

But I think the point is that they want you drunk so you can't drive away and have to stay and gamble for a few hours.  That's exactly what I do every time I go there!  But if you gamble with enough points, you get the meal for free!  It's easy enough to get the points within about 2 hrs of heavy play."

The only thing I wished was that it wasn't 10 miles off the strip :( \n\nLike all other reviewers have stated..there's practically eveything you could wish for here. From fresh crab legs to probably one of the best prime rib I've ever had to the best tasting/assortment of desserts and unlimited alcohol..seriously, what more could you really ask for?? \n\nThe wait time can range from 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how busy the weekend is. I've waited 2 hours for this buffet in the past and although my legs and back were aching from standing in line, I can definitely say it was well worth the wait. \n\nPrice seems a bit steep but considering they offer fresh seasfood, a vast assortment of good quality meats, and impeccable service, the price is right in my opinion.\n\nWith tax, the best $36.74 I have ever spent/will spend on my past and future Vegas trips to come :) You will not be disappointed!"

They also serve bottomless beer and wine. What more can you ask for? Quality food and drinks. Crab legs and prime rib for the win! I can't wait to go back there!"

S'This is the second time I\'ve been to this buffet at the M Resort.  The first time was right after they opened and I was blown away with the amazing selection and high quality of the food. My first visit to this restaurant would have given them 5 stars.  On my most recent visit yesterday, I was not nearly as impressed,  At $16.95, the price is great....this includes unlimited beer, wine, and coffee bar with Irish Creme, Kahlua, etc.  The wine and beer selection is limited and does not include any premium beers or wines.  The one beer I had was a M Resort beer (brewed just for them) and the bartender said it was similar to Heineken.  It did taste similar to Heineken but was served room temperature in a warm glass.   The wine was "house wine" but not too bad.  The coffee bar is great with a barista serving up Irish Creme cappucino...very tasty.  The soups were good and so were some of the entrees.  My main disappointment was in the freshness of some of the entrees.  The Pad Thai seemed old and the noodles were hard, all the meat at the carving stations, including leg of lamb, and pork roast were extremely dry.  Many of the other meat entrees were also dry.  Not many of the entrees stood out as delicious to me.  My favorites were the sushi, Shepherd\'s Pie and Paella.  You\'ll definitely find something you like here and the $16.95 price is great (more on the weekends during their seafood buffet), but I believe the quality of this buffet has gone down significantly since the M Resort opened.'

S"$24.99 per person for an all-you-can-eat buffet with endless choices of any type of food you could want and a great selection of desserts AND unlimited beer AND wine!?? Winner winner buffet dinner. \n\nWe went on a weekday and there was absolutely no wait. We simply walked up to the cashier, paid our way in, had the nice young lady allow us access into the buffet and we found our table. The wait staff was courteous and attentive. They have all different cuisines: Italian, Mexican, Asian, American, lots of different meat options, pastas, salads, breads and rolls, and other foods I've never even heard of. \n\nThen you walk over to the dessert section and they probably had about 30 different types of desserts and an assortment of 15 different flavors of gelato. \n\nPositives: cheap price on weekdays for an unlimited supply of good food, tasty desserts and beer and wine. Attentive wait staff. Quick seating. No lines."

S"FINALLY got  chance to try Studio B.  I've been to M so many times but I was never able to try it because of a few things: long ridiculous lines and they aren't open at midnight :[\n\nWent on a Saturday around 5:30p since we didn't want to wait, and yes, we did drive out of Vegas for about 20 minutes just for the buffet.  Studio B is located inside the modern M resort, and is probably the biggest draw of the hotel.\n\nOnce we paid and were seated, I immediately went for the carving stations.  Prime rib, BBQ ribs, lamb, turkey, roasted chicken... everything was there.  Of course, I started out with the prime rib because for me, the quality of the prime rib can sometimes make/break a buffet.  Surprisingly, M Resort had one of the best prime rib I've had a buffet, anywhere!  The seasonings on the crust, the medium-rare doneness, and the au jus all came together for a delicious tasting prime rib.  The braised short rib was my 2nd favorite.  Didn't expect the buffet to have tender short ribs.  \n\nA lot of people liked the BBQ ribs, including me, but I do have to say, it is a bit fatty so that may turn some people away.  The poultry were all good, but for some reason they didn't have chicken breast, only the dark meat.  Not that I was really complaining since I always prefer the more juicy part of the bird.\n\nAs for the seafood, that's what all others went for first.  The highlight is definitely the crab leg!  Mounds and mounds of crab legs.  It's not split in half for you like some of the buffets at the high end hotels (Wynn, Bellagio), but it is cracked open at strategic spots so it is quite easy to crack the legs.  However, one thing I do have to say that it was extremely salty and that some just looked sorta odd with brown and green spots.\n\nThere's also unlimited raw oysters!  A few of my friends totally went berserk but I sorta held back since I've had bad experience with raw oysters and will only eat the ones that has a pure clear liquid, but that's just me.  The fact that they offer raw oysters is amazing to me though.\n\nThere's also an Asian section, which is the same as everywhere else.  Hot foods such as mashed potatoes and fried fish is there as well.  My favorite was definitely the fried calamari with marinara sauce.  It's like free and unlimited appetizer that you would have to pay 10-12 bucks for at any restaurant!\n\nAs for the desserts... I didn't care much for the cakes but they do have creme brulee (I'm a sucker for it) and gelato ice cream!  Creme brulee is creamy and tasty.  For the gelato, lemon was definitely my favorite.  Sweet but just enough tang for you to pucker.  \n\nAnother huge draw for the buffet is the unlimited beer & wine.  3 types of beers on draft and a red/white wine option.  It's sorta hidden in the corner and a lot of people thought you had to pay but it's just people giving tip.\n\nSeriously, I have a craving to go back.  It may not be the best quality and it is a little out of the way, the price, selection, and unlimited alcohol definitely pushed this buffet into the 5 star realm!"

S"I don't like buffets.  There... I said it.  Long lines. Mediocre food. IKEA tables.  So why review Studio B?  Because I can do what I want.  This is America, pal.  I also visited several buffets while on a recent trip, so... I'll give you my worthless feedback.\n\nI tried the lunch buffet at Caesars, Cosmo, Aria, and M Resort.  I've been to Studio B before and, like the last visit... it's average.  The line to get in, however, is ridiculous. We waited well over an hour.  They had one woman working the cash register.  You had a line to get to a line to get to another line and people bumping into each other. Oh, while I'm at it... parents of little kids... do NOT bring your baby to a damn casino. Are you out of your mind?  Get a sitter or stay your ass at home.  Don't subject your baby to all that smoke.  Also... it's Vegas.  Take them to Disney World, instead. Ugh.\n\nOk... done with rant.  The food here is so-so.  They do, however, offer a lot of things. They also offer free beer and wine.  It's awesome.  It allowed me to tune out the kids who were running all over the place (nearly knocking people over in the process). Back to my rant.  If you DO bring your child to a casino, try to be parents.  You know... don't let them run around.  Tell them to quiet down.  Good lord.   Also... get a leash.\n\nWould I go back?  No."

S"If this buffet wasn't so far off the strip, I'd love to come here everytime. But then again, it's probably good because it's off the strip! \n\nCame here for their seafood buffet for a second time and it was just as good as I remembered. Cheap too! In comparision to the buffets on the strip, this seafood one is $33.99. Not too shabby at all.\n\nLove the fact that they have STEAMED crab legs. They are just so much tastier than the cold cocktail ones. Oysters, clams, shrimp cocktails, the works! I stuck with the oysters and crab legs and got my money's worth for sure. The other stuff I didn't really try because I was so focused on crab legs. The tidbits I did try were really good as well. The mac and cheese was deliciously cheesy, the sashimi salad was delicious. \n\nUnlimited beer and wine! Just remember to tip! AND they have root beer on draft! Hit up their dessert bar and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it's a great end to a fabulous dinner. \n\nI'll be back! So worth the wait. Go earlier to avoid the ridiculous lines... but even with the line, it's pretty much worth it!"

S'Over the holidays, all the buffets on the strip were charging up the a$$ for their "holiday buffets." In addition to the super expensive meals, the lines were all insanely long. As much as I love Bacchanal, there was no way i was going to spend 3+ hrs of my vacation time waiting in line to eat.\n\nMy family and I stopped by Studio B at the M hotel at the recommendation of some of our friends who live in the area. HOLY CRAP. THE FOOD WAS GREAT.  I\'m so glad that we did. For just $40 per person we were able to enjoy their amazing seafood buffet. They offer so many types of seafood: crab legs, oysters, shrimp, etc. I really loved their prime rib. It was seriously some of the best I\'ve had in Vegas. It  is perfectly roasted to a medium rare and super tender. I think I had 3 slabs of the stuff!\n\nBooze is also included at Studio B. It\'s not the best beer and wine, but it is free :) \n\nThe best part: I only waited about 15 min before I was seated :) \n\nIt\'s unfortunate that the M Hotel is so far from the strip, but it does make Studio B the perfect stop for Californians coming in and out of Las Vegas!'

S"As some of my fellow Yelpers have mentioned, this is one snazzy buffet.  When it came to this review however, I had a long, intense internal debate.  In the scheme of food I have eaten in my life, this buffet certainly is not going to come in win, place or show.  That being said, I felt it only fair to compare it to other buffets and thus my five star ranking.  In many ways if your looking for the best buffet in Vegas when factors like price, setting and options are considered, I might suggest this is #1 in Vegas.\n\nI have eaten at Studio B multiple times at all times of the day and have found the food consistent. delicious and with care put into the preparation and presentation.  On weekends, the bounty of seafood that is provided is top notch.  It includes Crab legs (both warm and cold), shrimp and a number of fish options like baked salmon and mahi-mahi.  There are also sushi rolls if you should choose to weigh down your gut with rice.  \n\nMeats are rep'd as well and the carving station boasts tri-tip, prime rib, chicken & turkey.  Salad, fruit and other vegetarian options looked and tasted appealing for a carnivore like me....no small feat.  \n\nWhile not a huge desert guy, the pastries and gelato here are fantastic.  Yes you heard me right....gelato!  And not just two flavors either but a full assortment ranging from pistachio to coffee.\n\nAnd then it brings me to my favorite part of the experience............free booze!!!!  For the price of all buffets, draught beer and wine is included.  I know, I know its not fancy beer (Coors Light) or wine but you can drink as much of it as you like.  And believe me when I say after your third glass of beer it really doesn't matter what type of beer is being consumed.\n\nFinally, one of the true underrated features of Studio B buffet is the setting.  Arranged in a circular room with the food beginning on the edges and working its way all the way into the middle, this buffet space feels inviting and fun.  Also at the very back is a large panoramic window that overlooks the entire Las Vegas Valley giving great views and a healthy dose of natural light...a rarity in the world of incandescent casinos.\n\nOverall Studio B buffet might not knock your socks off but simply by virtue of deciding to patronize a buffet, its clear that culinary excellence is not the most important thing.  In that vein, Studio B is your best choice...much like the 2008 presidential election."

I'm impressed alright. 1 hour wait tho unless you are a VIP, thank God we are =) It's located in a new hotel M. I liked it but I heard they went bankrupt, poor them.

Even until now this is our all-time favorite buffet place, ever!! They offer unlimited free beer and wine, although I'm always too full to really take advantage. On certain nights they offer crab legs. Their prime rib is THE BOMB, as well as everything else! The sushi is decent even though there isn't too big of a selection. The workers are usually good about refilling the food right away so you're never standing around waiting. It is a bit pricey but SO WORTH it! You won't get a nasty stomachache like you might get from other places... You'll just be extremely full! Oh, and the desserts are sooooo good too! \n\nI recommend this buffet to anyone and everyone out there!"

S"Granted buffets are not the gourmet experience, and quality and freshness range from frozen TV dinner to a good cafeteria / wedding buffet food.  It is with this gauge / rate buffet offerings\n\nStudio buffet is new and is excellent in comparison to all those buffets who have gone down hill from year past.\n\nWhat I love about this (sushi exception) is all their food has good quality.  Shrimp are not shriveled up and flavorful, salmon was cooked with flavor and supple qualities.\nPaellae is not saffron based and on par with fast food paellae found in cheap Spain sidewalk restaurants.\n\nEverything here is good EXCEPT for sushi...\nwhich is hard as a rock, and equivalent to Costco sushi (or worse).\nTempura sushi roll should have a crunch in a soft rice wrapped roll.  Nope, its hard as a rock and clearly made in bulk days ago.\n\nBest thing here indeed is the FREE beer on tap, root beer on tap, cappucino (liquored enhanced) or wine for lunch.\nThat coupled with good gelato (equivalent to low end Italian gelator I've had) for free.made this place stand out from the rest"

S"Now I know why those lines are so damn long--the interior has amazing decor and, more importantly, the food selection is not only tasty, it's ENORMOUS! After waiting about 1-2 hours, I stepped into the place and I felt like I was in food heaven!\n\nI know the wait was long, but there was a good deal going on---if you gamble for a certain amount of points, you can eat there for free, or something similar to that. My parents got a buy one, get one free deal. Thus, it's only natural that a lot of people would visit. Just make sure you bring some good friends that you can stand talking to for 2 hours in line.\n\nBut, back to the food: a large selection, for sure--Asian, Italian, American, Chinese--you name it! I definitely liked their veggie selection, too--lots of salad choices. They have dense bread rolls, too, which I love. I can't explain everything I ate, but all of it was pretty decent, especially for a buffet. This is, of course, one of the best buffets I've been to in Vegas!\n\nThey offered great desserts as well--gingerbread man cookies, crepes, fruit tarts, macaroons, and a lot more pastries. The ice cream was great, too--more like gelato texture, nice and moist, not super icy like at most buffets.\n\nI'd definitely agree to come here again!"

There was so much variety ranging from Italian, to Japanese, to Mexican, to American, to beer, to wine, to gelato, to cup cakes, to cookies, to macaroons.  There was just so much food, I couldn't eat it all.  I would say the best is the meat, but that's because I'm a guy and I like my protein.  There was so much desert, by the time I was half way done, my plate was full and I couldn't add anymore.  I got to the end (best part) where there was a ton of ice cream and gelato.  Great! Amazing! Delicious!  \n\nThe price for lunch was $15.99 which isn't bad for an all you can eat and all you can drink buffet.  I couldn't even drink that much because I didn't want to get full off the beer.  They had a bunch of wine choices, beer, and others.  Give it a try, especially if your there for lunch."

The weekday lunch is a great time to go ($15), but if you're not able to come until the weekend, I would recommend coming to the seafood dinner too. It used to be about $25 for the weekend buffet but now it's about $30+. It's one of my favorite buffets to eat because it has a large selection of good food. They have tri-tip, baked mussels, kbbq ribs, sushi, king crab legs (only on seafood dinner), lots of salads, etc. Almost everything is really good, including their desserts (their creme brulee is delicious).

S"Went to Studio B for Seafood Dinner Buffet a month ago (Friday, March 28, 2014) based on the 4-star rating here on Yelp.... which we thought must justify the lengthy drive away from the strip and the $40/person cost.\n\nOur party of 4 waited about an hour even though we were quoted a 20 minute wait.  The lines moved very slowly, yet when we finally got in... there were tons of open tables. Not sure what that was all about.  The buffet food was totally unimpressive... it seemed like all low-end selections..... I only enjoyed the snow crab legs.\nThe table service would only serve the standard soft drinks, juice, coffee and tea. If you wanted the wine or cappuccinos that are included with the meal, you have to go get in line yourself for those drinks.  After getting our soft drinks, our server seemed to disappear.  \n\nDon't drive far, pay lots of money for this sub par food and service!"

S"As much as I want to love buffets, my stomach tends to disagree. Mass produced food sitting under heating lamps doesn't hold much appeal for me. Fortunately, Studio B is one of the few buffets where quality trumps quantity and is worth the trip.\n\nDinner runs about $25 Monday - Thursday, weekend seafood ups the price by about $10. Considering that an entree and a beer at restaurants like Cheesecake Factory runs about the same price, its really not a bad deal. What makes the price worth is the unlimited beer and wine available at buffet. I was surprised to see craft draft beer along with ciders, and a couple wines to pick from.\n\nIn terms of food there is something for everyone. Sushi, multiple carving stations along with plenty of vegetarian and healthier options. The desert station features enough to satisfy even the most discerning sweet tooth and gets extra points for having gelato and milkshakes. The buffet itself looks great. Modern design, comfortable seating, unobstructed views of the Vegas strip and a open kitchen ensures cleanliness. \n\nThe lines can get long on busier days so come prepared. Also check out the M Players Club as they offer free buffets for players."

The prime rib was one of the best prime ribs I've had in awhile and everyone in my party agreed, this was my favorite item.  Their osso bucco was also good; it was falling off the bone. Enjoyed the raw oysters but had to limit myself since I was trying to sample EVERYTHING. I was struggling to get to dessert. They had this tasty dark chocolate rice crispies and if I was ghetto fab I would bring Tupperware to sneak some out (BTW I'm not but tempted perhaps a Ziploc bag in the future ;p). They have good portions to their dessert so you don't feel like you're wasting food. The panna cotta came in shooters and I had 2. Wine and beer is part of the package but since I'm lightweight, I didn't sample. Definitely coming back."

It is not as good as what it used to be when it first opened, but it is still worth the drive. \n\nThe weekday breakfast is only $10.99, and if you get there before 10AM, normally you don't really need to wait in line at all. Lunch is $15.99 and dinner is $23.99. Weekend prices are a few dollars off from the strip with comparable buffets, normally around $40. \n\nIt is not spectacular, but there is a large food selection, everyone will find something they like. Food is always fresh, tasty and presented well. This is definitely my top 5 buffets in Vegas."

Steaks aren't sitting under warming lamps for hours until they get dry and rubbery. Sushi runs out fast so they whip up a new batch every 5 minutes. The variety is pleasantly overwhelming - you'll almost feel encouraged to try every single thing you see (which I've done) even food you won't normally eat.\n\nThe line gets extremely long so you have to get here at an odd time.

S"The bf and I had no plans one Sunday we were returning home from Vegas. I have a group of friends who stop by Studio B each time they leave Vegas without fail, and I decided it was time to make a stop at the M Resort.\n\nFor a hotel so far away from the Strip, this is a very popular buffet. We waited 45 minutes for the Weekend Seafood Brunch. But then again, that is standard wait time for the better buffets on the Strip. \n\nOnce we got into the buffet, we understood why people, namely Asians, went out of their way to wait in a long line to fork out $34/tummy. The food selection is GINORMOUS, the seafood is fresh (with 2 king crab stations - one on each side of the cutting stations, mussels (or oyster?) bar, a heaping pile of gutted cocktail shrimp), and probably the main reason why young adults visit this buffet: the complimentary ALL YOU CAN DRINK bar. Bring a few $1s to tip the bartender. \n\nSadly, we didn't hit the bar too often, partially because there was always a long line. But we didn't mind, we were too preoccupied with all the food. Unlike most buffets, the food displays actually look appetizing. I was also busy watching the fruits dancing on the 50 projectors every 3 minutes :)\n\nAfter a good 2 hours here, Studio B Buffet won us over. However, unlike my friends, I cannot see us eating here every time we're in Vegas.

Several dishes that looked like they'd been sitting out for a while, but that might be signs of a slow moment; it was fairly quiet when we arrived and pretty busy by the time we left. \n\nAlthough I wasn't exactly thrilled with the food, it was a nice variety of choices. Factor in the relative ease of getting there (as opposed to buffets on the strip), the clean environment, attentive service and the booze station,  I'll go there again in the future."

S'Overrated. The portions maybe generous, but that doesn\'t give an excuse for having bland food. The food here is lost in all the layers of meat, veggies, sauces, and decorations. I think if the dishes were made more simple then I think it would have been fine. \n\nTo be honest, classic and simple dishes like eggs Benedict or fried chicken & waffles were lost in the clutter of food put onto this one plate. Now, don\'t get me wrong, the food here is decent but in terms of flavor, it was lacking.\n\nI tried the Andy Sage\'s Fried Chicken Benedict which is like a unconventional version of biscuit and gravy mixed with eggs Benedict. The portion is huge and reads to be a delicious dish on the menu, but in actuality, there\'s nothing spectacular about it. Like previously mentioned, a lot going on. The chicken was a little bland but at least it was moist, the hollandaise sauce was too thick and bland, the biscuits were fine, and the mashed potatoes were average. I\'d rate this dish 3/5. \n\nThe take on chicken & waffles here was close, but no cigar. I thought the waffle was good (although a bit heavy) and I especially enjoyed the thick bacon that was cooked into the waffle -- a great combination of sweet and savory. As for the fried chicken, it was appetizing, but not lacking in bold flavors that a fried chicken should have. I\'d rate this one 3.5/5. \n\nLocated inside Imperial Palace on the Strip, it\'s a place you got to try for yourself if you\'re in Vegas. Although it\'s not the best food you\'ll find, it\'s worth the try. Like they all say, "Go big or go home".'

I asked our server which was the best dish in his opinion and he said the Sage Fried Chicken Breast & Waffles, so I ordered it. Not disappointed AT ALL. I love my friend chicken crispy not too oily, and this was perfect, the waffles were fluffy. I couldnt finish my dish, the portions were huge.\n\nService was friendly and sweet.

S"We arrived at 8:00am and got a table right away.  The term 'hash' is somewhat misleading here (at least in my book).  The meats are chopped or shredded up and then served over a bed of crispy potatoes and topped with eggs.  It's not your typical hash that most of us are familiar with.  Prices a bit higher than most breakfast joints, but the portions are very generous.  Hubby went with the corned beef hash and I ordered the egg whites scrambled with smoked salmon and onions (plus 'tons of fruit').  The corned beef hash was tasty and lots of it.  Hubby managed to plow through about half before tossing in the towel.  I only got through a third of my scrambled egg whites before getting full.\n\nNow, the really excellent item was the single, house-made biscuit that came with Hubby's breakfast.  It was flaky, buttery, and just darn delicious - especially with house made jam.  \n\nWe just couldn't finish, so had them box it all up with every intent of taking it back to our time-share and heating it up for breakfast the next day (forgetting, of course, that we already had reservations for brunch).  Ended up giving it to a homeless gentleman that was rummaging through the trash pulling out partially eaten McDonald fries.  Hopefully, he enjoyed it as much as we did."

But there was plenty to keep us entertained until it was our turn to eat.\nI had the chicken and waffles, which was amazing.  The chicken is cooked perfectly - I loved the sweetness that the maple reduction added to the chicken.  And the biscuit that comes on the side was also delicious.  The only downside (which might just be me) is how big it is.  I wish I had known before ordering so that I could've shared.  I couldn't even eat a third of it, and it's not one of those dishes that make for good leftovers.  So if you decide to get this, share with a friend!\nThe other winner at our table was the quesadilla.  I didn't get to try it, but my friend loved it.\nFor any coffee drinkers, I'd recommend sticking with hot coffee.

I was with a group of seven, though that really only counted in terms of bodies. There were about three functioning brains in total. Then a few girls came and joined us. One of them knew my brother. Somehow that made the functioning brain count go down one. Boom! Take that, girls that I don't know at all!\n\nI ordered some eggs and they actually weren't that bad. They weren't that good, either. But again, 2am. So whatever.\n\nEvery single plate that came to the table had a piece of watermelon, a strawberry, and a giant sprig of rosemary. Every plate. Not sure why. The guy who orders things must have a connection with the guy who distributes those things.\n\nStrawberries and watermelon are not in season (actually, does Las Vegas have a fruit season at all? can produce grow amidst despair?)\n\nRosemary...well that would have been fine, except that every indication on the menu suggested that it would be sage. Sage waffles. Sage chicken. Sage this, sage that.\n\nBut then it turns out it was all rosemaried instead.\n\nComputers went down at 2:45. Computers came back up at 3:00. There is no bathroom in the whole restaurant. I think that is illegal in California. But we were not in California. We were in a hash house in Nevada."

S'Hash House A Go Go is restaurant serving up a mix of Southern and down home farmland cooking or "Twisted farm food" as they say. They have 4 locations in Nevada and one in California serving breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nI\'d heard all the fuss about Man vs Food and knew I better check this place out. We were a group of 10 and since reservations weren\'t allowed, we expected a long wait. We arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday surprised to see no line and lots of empty tables.  It\'s never a good sign for a place to be that empty on a Friday, but maybe it\'s because it\'s so hidden within the Imperial Palace Casino. \n\nI grew up eating food like this, but never have I seen such large portions and presentation. We were served complementary biscuits before dinner. These things were impressively huge, but a bit too dense. I prefer a light and fluffy biscuit, but easily ate a half of one drizzled with honey.  For the main course, I ordered the sage fried chicken benedict. This thing could have fed a family of four, with two boneless pieces of fried chicken served over a biscuit, mashed potatoes, tomatoes, spinach and covered with scrambled eggs, bacon, mozzarella and chipotle cream sauce for $15.95.  Overall the dish looked impressive, but didn\'t wow me on taste. It was good, but I expected bold flavors and didn\'t get it. Of course I was happy to sample several other people\'s food at the table like the meatloaf pasta, the BBQ ribs and the chicken pot pie.  I found the pot pie to be the best out of everything I tried. The meatloaf pasta was good, but the St. Louis style ribs were disappointing, but of course I am spoiled being from St. Louis. Probably the most entertaining part of the experience was watching a drunk guy at a table nearby devour his platter of chicken benedict without passing out in it.\n\nOverall, I\'d give this place 5 stars for friendly service and amazingly large and creative portions, but only 3 stars on taste that doesn\'t match presentation.  Definitely worth a visit though just for the experience!'

S'My first impression was, "Featured on Man vs Food...you can see why when you see the huge portions!"\n\nBreakfast of champions. If you can go to Hash House A Go Go and finish a plate by yourself, consider yourself a champion. The portions are ridiculous! Their menu entrees list the typical American breakfast foods with a little twist. Their featured item on the menu is the chicken and waffles. I had the fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash and it was plenty to share with the boyfriend. The ingredients were very fresh, and it came with a side of a biscuit, an egg, and fruit. It was good, but I still feel like I should have tried their waffle or french toast items because those looked delicious. We opted for the "healthier" choice that day because we weren\'t feeling well, so I\'ll definitely have to go back and try their token menu items. There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn\'t horrible, and our waiter did a good job trying to mediate the traffic.\n\nIf you want breakfast right away, this isn\'t the place to go. But if you\'re down for the wait and willing to try this famous breakfast house then I say go for it.\n\nThe lasting impression? "Going back for some waffles!"'

The booths were so spacy and comfortable. \nFood: Amazing, aaamazing. Let\'s first talk about the portions. SOLID portion! I was sooo full from lunch, then I had enough for dinner as well. The Andy\'s Sage Fried You must, must try the Chicken with maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuits (15.95). The chicken was good, maybe a little dry. The scrambled eggs were sooo fluffy. One of the best eggs i\'ve had. The bacon mashed potatoes is just delicious and solid. The bacon did just the trick. The biscuits were sooo yummy. My friends get some butter and the peach jam to put on the biscuits. SOOO GREAT! Such a good price and great portion! My friend\'s food portions were very generous too.\n\nA great brunch place.

S'If you can, get here before 11 am to avoid the long wait.  We got here late 9\'ish and when we left, the whole entire upstairs was packed with people waiting to be seated.  Having arrived before the lunch crowd, we were immediately seated.  Service was prompt and we had drinks ordered and brought out pretty quick.  \n\nBeing it was morning time, we were given the breakfast menu I presume since I didn\'t see any of the lunch or dinner plates listed on their website.  The menu is pretty extensive and our server was keen enough to suggest that she\'d give us an extra couple of minutes to look it over.  I did ask when she returned what she recommended or what was the most commonly ordered plate.  With a little snooty-ness and, I guess, pride, she commented everything was good on the menu and all their plates were made in their own unique way.  The statement was something to the effect of, "we may have dishes that\'s commonplace such as chicken pot pie, but when you have our chicken pot pie, it\'s nothing like any chicken pot pie that you\'ve ever had."  Okay... I wasn\'t expecting that, but I\'ll take her word for it.  She did finish saying the Andy\'s Sage Fried Chicken and the griddled french toast were popular.  \n\nUltimately, after going back and forth up and down the menu, we ordered the Andy\'s Sage Fried Chicken http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=GLQSZ-UG8v_K61ony2y45Q the Smoked Salmon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=_EB015nkHl9bQ57549bSFQ the Tractor Driver http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=K2eFMfxtq6QP5E-fawN3nA cause it sounded cool and the Farmer\'s Daughter http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I0j--YuQ8lg-ttvGuloyng since it sounded cute.\n\nOkay, I\'ll give our server her pride in the food that Hash House makes since it was all well presented, very plentiful and quite delicious!  Everything from the salmon, to the crispy potatos, to the fried chicken, to the griddled french toast in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup (my absolute favorite!) was made exceptionally well.  It was all quite impressive and I guess you can "church it up" by sticking a strand of rosemary into a biscuit.  Btw, that biscuit was good, but it was heavy and dense enough to be a paper weight.  Coffee was pretty good tasting for an average cup of joe as well.\n\nPortions were large and if your appetite and stomach can munster finishing everything on your plate, then you can forego your next meal.  We skipped out on lunch after have a late breakfast (saved some money that way) and we walked it off by strolling the strip and seeing the sights afterwards.  Just remember, get there early before lunch or earlier for dinner and hopefully you won\'t have to put up with the long wait.'

It was a little confusing to get to, but after a bit of directions from the concierge, we figured it out. Most of the complaints about this place stemmed from the wait, but I guess you just have to know when to go.\n\nAnyways, we had heard of the huge portions at Hash House a Go Go, but you really don't understand how big it is until you see it in person. I got the sage fried chicken with the bacon waffle stack, and it was enormous. A kid at the neighboring table go the same thing, and it was as big as his head. I eat a lot, and I was not able to finish it. Thankfully, our hotel room had a full kitchen, so we could store and re-heat everything we didn't eat. \n\nThe fried chicken was on point, and the waffles, albeit a little soggy after awhile, were delicious. There are a lot of other fried chicken dishes, like the benedict, so you can't really go wrong.  I was also able to try the chorizo hash, which packed a good punch, and the pork tenderloin sandwich, which also was humongous. Biscuits were buttery and not overly dry and the gravy was pretty peppery and flavorful. \n\nPrices were decent and the service seemed a bit on the slow side, but not terrible.

This place is located in the Quad and you had to take an escalator there.  I waited in this line right outside the door for a good 2 minutes before somebody told me that this was the line for the bar.  The people in front of me and behind me thought they were waiting to put their name down too!  The hostess stand is actually further and right in front of the restaurant, not at the doors entering the restaurant.  Lame.\n\nSo it was super fast putting my name down, but I told them once a seat opened up at the bar I'd probably sit there.  He told me it'd be a 40 minute wait on a Saturday at10AM.I looked around and people seemed to be ordering the chicken and waffles but that seemed like too big of a meal for me.  It took me around 30ish minutes for a seat to open up at the bar.  Then like 4 freaking seats opened up after me and nobody sat down (ugh).  I wanted waffles though so I ordered the combo which came with pancakes but you could upgrade to a waffle for a buck.  I also ordered a bloody mary.  So after I order they come out with chicken and waffles!  They messed up on my one order so that super sucked.  The bartender admitted it and asked if I wanted another bloody mary and it'd be on her since they messed up but I declined since I'd be too blasted walking back to my hotel.  The bloody mary was really good but the food was just like.... not good.  The waffle looked nice and big and fluffy but it was lukewarm and soggy.  The eggs were eggs and the bacon was a little chewy.  I think restaurants like this should at least have basics down!  For the wait and the food I wouldn't come back here again."

HH is known for its bloody marys, minimum size is 20 oz. \n\nWhile I didn't love my scrambled eggs with sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and basil with mashed potatoes and a biscuit, others were raving about their biscuits and gravy and friend chicken. Other disappointments are the soggy toast, not crispy potatoes (even though they are famous for the crispy potatoes), over medium eggs being really runny. The homemade peach jam was delicious. Needless to say no one cleaned their plate. The Bloody Maria was typically 20 oz., very spicy, had a green bean, two olives, and a pickle. Good but not great. \n\nService was very slow on bringing drinks, the food, refills, anything.

The focal point of said man crushes can be athletes, actors, comedians, office jerk, gynecologists.... \n\nTo bring me closer to one of my man crushes (yes I'm not scared to say I have several....it's liberating), I decided to visit one of the places I've seen on a show I loosely base my life on. Man vs. Food (Adam Richaman). When I found out that I didn't have to drive off the Vegas strip in order to visit it's sister location, my heart skipped a beat and I'm pretty sure I behaved like a teenage girl about to come into close quarters with Justin Timberlake (wet). \n\nI went with the sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was void of any sage flavor. I don't even know what sage is supposed to taste like, but I'm sure this chicken was void of it. It was bland, but, I will admit, it was the best cooked fried chicken I've ever had. Crunchy batter and all moist and sh^t inside. Nothing that a little bit of salt and hot sauce didn't help. The waffles were dense. They'd give Rush Limbaugh a run for his money. And much like Rush, there was bacon inside of the waffles. There's enough food on the plate to feed everyone on the blackjack table. \n\nIt's inside the Imperial Palace casino on the second floor. So if you're a cocksucker that likes to pretend to have more money than your Anchor Blue jeans is letting on to me and only like to be seen in Aria or Bellagio, stay out dickhead. Us regular people have more fun anyways.\n\nBefore I call it a week, here's a small sample list of men you can gush over and man crush on.  Also a list of men you need to hate.\n\nYes:\nChuck Norris\nSteven Segal\nJason Statham\nRyan Reynalds\nJo Koy\nBJ Penn\n\nNo:\nDr. Phil\nBill O'Reilly\nMichael Moore\nJa Rule\nKany West\nOprah"

S'This place is a little piece of heaven to me. Breakfast is my favorite meal, so much that so that just "a little" breakfast doesn\'t do it for me. I\'m used to bacon/eggs/toast/grits with a side of bacon, maybe it\'s my grandma\'s southern blood in me. When the waitress explained the menu here to us, she pointed out a particular section and said something along the lines of "be careful, this is a lot of food." I had already selected something else not from said section, so natuarlly my thought became, "Uh oh... I must not have ordered enough..." Boy was I wrong. What Hash House must categroize as "not a lot of food" is enough to feed a small country.  \n\nIt\'s like getting two meals at once. I can be a pretty big eater and this breakfast had me satisified until dinner time. \n\nNot only are the portions substantial, but the food is good too. This is not slop - it\'s well put together dishes with tasty sides and a lot of flavor. The fried chicken and waffles is their signature dish, but i decided to go "lighter" with the fried chicken and mashed potatoes and i was not dissappointed.\n\nThis is a great spot and i definitely recommend. Try going early (pre 8 AM) if you want to avoid the breakfast crowd on the weekends.'

S"An extra star for the novelty value. This place has an awesome menu that gives American comfort food a sophisticated twist. The food here is good, not great but the appeal is the insanely HUGE portions. This is definitely a place to try at least once, just to see the unreal tower of food.\n\nTourist tip...these portions are so big there is no way you will come close to finishing it. Unless you don't wind throwing away uneaten food, I would share entrees. This is not the kind of food that you can take back to your hotel. Don't be that guy that stinks up the entire floor of your hotel with the nasty smell of your leftovers, which you probably wont even eat."

S'Came here for breakfast one morning during a recent business trip.  Located in the Quad, it is a perfect location if you are staying at any of the center Strip resorts.  Seated at the bar with my friend, the bartender was attentive and very nice.  I ordered the Basic breakfast, which included scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, fruit, and a biscuit.  My friend ordered the bacon waffles.  We were both very pleased with our selections.  Hash House is traditionally known for their abundant portions, but in my case the Basic breakfast was just right.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon was no too crisp, and the potatoes were crunchy on the outside and flaky on the inside.  Best of all was the biscuit and fresh mashed strawberries.  Delicious!'

S"Heard the hype, wanted to try.\n\nPros:\nHuge portions\nGreat Service\n\nCons:\nMore food, less taste\nOverpriced for the quality\n\nI weigh my reviews heavily on the quality and taste of the food. The food at this place was okay at best. The portions are bigger than Claim Jumpers, but the flavors were sub par. I split the sage chicken and waffles with a friend (there is a two or three dollar charge to split the plate.)  \n\nWhen we got it, it was so nicely presented and huge. I was shocked. I didn't know where to start. When I tried the waffle, it tasted plain. I really needed the syrup with it, but there was bacon baked inside of it and I did not like to mix sweet and savory. The chicken was cooked well, nice and tender, but again it was plain. There was no real spices to it. I had to dunk it in my friend's sauce to finish off one piece. After a while, the flavors mixed together and everything became sickening to eat and look at. \n\nMy friend ordered sage chicken with the eggs benedict. His plate was huge as well. He had chicken, eggs benedict, a biscuit, and mash potatoes all covered with hollandaise sauce. Literally everything was covered in a blanket of sauce. After a while, he too gave up. He is a pretty big guy and if he gave up, I'm sure the food was too much and too overwhelming after a while. \n\nMy favorite part of the meal was the watermelon-kiwi lemonade. You have to order it. Comes with a piece of watermelon on the side. Very yummy. I tasted more watermelon than lemonade, but that's okay since I don't really find watermelon drinks anywhere. \n\nDon't believe the hype. The food will overpower your taste buds, and not in a good way."

S"Hungover much?\nHungry much?\nWill eat anything as long as its edible?\n\nIf you answered 'YES' to any of the above, this place is the place for you. Its A WHOLE LOTTA food per person and has the hometown favorites - fried chicken, corned beef, scramblers - pretty much all the comfort foods you could think of. Although if you were to eat all of it, you would definitely not be so comfortable! \n\nThe food is, to cut right to the chase, not very good. So if you're looking to just eat because you're hungry and would eat anything so long as its food - then go here. \n\nIts a good experience overall too - just go to see how much food a restaurant could possibly give you on one plate. In terms of portions, Hash House A Go Go has surely made quite a feat!"

S'You know when all your friends and their friends\' friends have been to a cool joint and you\'re the only one that\'s never been? Well such as the case with Hash House A Go Go. My ears were burning for days when my friends were mouthing off about this place....the ginormous portions, the food coma afterwards and how their leftovers would last them for days back home....blah blah blah. \n\nThen they said Adam Richman from Man V Food went there. Say no more. We are going to Hash House A Go Go.\n\nMy friends warned me that service was non-existent at this place. Well luck was on our side because our waiter was pretty attentive during our entire stay. \n\nThe menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. I never made it past the House Hashes. I was really tempted to try the Sage Fried Chicken (cause it was Adam\'s favorite). My friend ordered it and honestly it didn\'t look as appetizing.....as my Corned Beef House Hash (came with crispy potatoes). The verdict for the corned beef order after the initial taste test was just okay. I personally like my corned beef minced (not hand shredded). Then I had a bite of my other friend\'s Chorizo House Hash. Let me tell you that is the winner. I would probably order that again my next visit. \n\nThe portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the House Hashes were "normal" size. The biggest portion I saw was the Sage Fried Chicken. Even that dish I expected to be even more behemouth in size based on what my friends were raving about. Sometimes it\'s better not to hear the hype and you can make your own conclusions. \n\n*I was really angry that they don\'t have any restrooms in the restaurant. I had to run downstairs back into the casino.'

One of my friends had biscuits and gravy and the whole plate was smothered in gravy, even on top of his eggs. It was kind of strange.\nIt was a great place for breakfast and it was pretty empty on a Sunday at 7:30am :)"

S"This place is real, red-white-and-blue American gluttony at its finest. Portions are enough to feed a small family, and at decent prices. We were staying at IP, looking for something convenient, and were glad we came here! Interesting, creative, quality comfort food at great prices. \n\nIt was a 20-minute wait, but the food looked so interesting that we waited. 20 minutes was perfect to go downstairs, get some Fat Tuesday and some shots, and come back. Hey, it's vacation!\n\nAs we admired other people's sage fried chicken and waffles (which looked like a gargantuan tower), the waitress took our drink orders. Despite having yard drinks in front of us, we decided to try the BLT Mary out of the sheer oddity of it. It was a spicy bloody mary served with a tomato round, lettuce, and bacon slice inside, a bacon salt rim, and a piece of toast. Not the most flavorful bloody mary I've had, but still good and very original. \n\nI went with the Smoked Salmon Hash (house-smoked salmon, scallions, scrambled eggs, potatoes, cream cheese, fruit and a huge biscuit on the side) while my date went with the quesadilla (chicken, jalapenos, potatoes, some other things, topped with chili cream and served over mashed potatoes). Both plates were shockingly huge, and we each got through about 1/3 of them. \n\nI really enjoyed my dish and the combination of ingredients, and the salmon portion was very generous. My date, who usually makes fun of me for being white and not being able to handle spicy things, had to take some of the chopped jalapeno out because there was so much of it. It was a terrific omelet though, very unique, and the chili cream is what made the dish amazing. \n\nService was fast and attentive. We'll be back!"

What upset me was the food. Yes, the portions are still monstrous. But the food is not fresh. Part of the appeal with the Hash House for me and my beau is the freshness of the food. \n\nIn Vegas we sat down, ordered, and I kid you not, 5 minutes later we had our food. Ick... The bread tasted stale, the potatoes were luke warm, the chicken had seen better days... I could go on. We ate our food and went along our merry way. \n\nFor what it is it\'s "OK," for the quality I\'ve experienced from their SD location, this place was a huge disappointment.'

S'May 28, 2011 Saturday - dinner 6:15 PM\n2 adults & kid\n\nAtmosphere - 4 stars\nFood - 5 stars\nService - 3 stars\n\nBackground - Picked this based on the reviews I read about the one in Reno.  I assumed it was in Harrah\'s in Vegas too.  But I was wrong.  I got redirected after asking security at Harrah\'s.  Then I walked past the escalator without realizing the restaurant was on the second floor in a special section.  None of their "floor - traffic" boards even mention Hash House.\n\nAtmosphere - Trendy place but the tables are too tall or the chairs are too short.  Too trendy for my taste, I just found it difficult for me at 5\' 11", my daughter had at least a pillow to help her out.  \n\nFood\nAppetizer - We had the dinner menu but did not see anything listed that looked like an app.\n\nMain Course - We ordered the Duck to split between the two of us.  The waiter warned us the sizes were very large.  He was not kidding.  The duck was very good.  But the mashed yams/potatoes stole the meal.  Oh my they were so good.  I can not even describe it.  I do not know if it was the wrapped meat around it or just the mixing of yams with it, but it made the meal!  They also finished the plate with whole carrots and green beans on the sides.\n\nDessert - This thing was large enough for one person as a meal.  We ordered the bread pudding made with snickers.  It took 20 minutes after we placed the order so you know they just made it for us, awesome!  The amount of vanilla ice cream on top of the black gooey mess was more than I would put in a bowl for myself.  $8 for this gooey heaven was well worth the wait.  If they have this in Reno I could see going their just for that alone.  It is worth every calorie.  By the way the three of us probably only ate a third of it after the huge dinner.\n\nService - I have to say I was very disappointed here.  Best way to put the host station was seriously lacking.  Sure a large party was in front of us.  But after the one and only hosted figured out how many people there was he disappeared for a while with no word to us.  And what was strange was the restaurant was not overly full, maybe 50% occupancy.   Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  He promptly told us about the $2.50 split plate charge for our dinner.  But before dinner was served he brought me my extra plate.  The plate was not clean, but you could tell it went thru the dishwasher.  His response to the dirty plate is "I just grab and go" which makes sense since the pile plates should be perfect for service.  With dessert the food was delivered by a food runner.  He realized we did not have silverware and he went to grab some.  I could see him searching and picking out clean ones from the tray of spoons.  So that make question how clean the ones we did not get.  I think they have a dishwasher issue.'

S"Not as good as their flagship out on Sahara, but this one's right on the strip, although with the renovation you have to wade thru some dust and scaffolding to get here. The portions were just as monstrously large though, and this time we split 2 dishes among the three of us lightweights, and we left full having not even finished either of them. I'd have picked the chicken and waffles for sure but democracy won out. Here we tried the chorizo skillet and the Tractor Driver Combo. The chorizo skillet was good, although the one tortilla it comes with is inadequate for the amount of filling it comes with. The tractor driver combo we upgraded to a banana pancake which was well worth the extra dollar. Service was excellent. \n\nThe experience at their standalone restaurant on Sahara was better in terms of the atmosphere, the food, and the overall experience, but this was still fine."

S"Wove through the maze of the hotel to find this location, which wasn't particularly easy. It was totally freezing inside, which i'm sure during the worst part of the day is great, but at 8am, it was a little much. \n\nWe were seated and had coffee quickly. Food came out superfast, was fresh and, obviously, plentiful. I ate about a quarter of the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, fed some to my fellow diners, and took even more back to our hotel for others. The chicken and biscuit were moist and flavorful, the bacon was crispy and plentiful, and the potatoes were great. I pushed aside most of the sauce on top and just went for the chicken -- sauce on the side would've probably helped control the balance better.\n\n I cannot imagine anyone eating this whole crazy thing. I wish there was a tasting portion so that you could just have three perfect bites, as I think that that would be more satisfying and in line with how I like to eat, but I totally get that that's not the idea here.\n\nSo, bring your friends (or let them sleep in and bring them leftovers), and come early, and it seems like the worries about sogginess, slowness, etc., aren't an issue.

Keep in mind tht the table who got our food had another order for the lady and she had to watch her man eat for the 20 minutes before her food came out.\n\nI will give them this...the food was orgasmic.

After 30 minutes we came back up to check and they'd called us 5 minutes earlier (pager didn't work cuz I guess we went too far). But they quickly seated us anyway, so that was great.\n\nService was good.  Only thing that would have been better is if they'd checked on us a bit more and refilled drinks more often.

The waitress gave me a disclaimer that the smoked salmon wasn't lox and that it was hot-smoked salmon, which I was fine with, but it was completely dry and lacked any sort of smokiness.  It just tasted like crumbled, overcooked salmon.  The cream cheese helped add some depth to the flavor, but it was just lumped in there.  The potatoes were also flavorless.  This dish really needed some seasoning or some kind of sauce to pour over the whole thing.

S"Sure, it will clog your arteries and increase the diabetic population, but you only live once, right?!?!\n\nWe ended up at this place because we were trying to get to the other location near Main Street, but the GPS took us for a twist.\n\nAs soon as we got there, we were hooked.  In the entryway, they had Bloody Mary's that you could purchase and drink while you waited for your table.  The place was packed, but a VERY GOOD bloody mary while you wait makes the line a heck of a lot shorter!\n\nOnce we got in, I ordered the Pistachio Mocha and she ordered the Smores Latte--both delicious and exactly what we were looking for.  The mocha was iced and very sweet--just the way I like it.  The flavor was good and the chocolate didn't drown out the pistachio--I don't think I could have asked for anything better!  The latte was hot and slightly less sweet--just the way she likes it.\n\nFor the meal we ordered the veggie skillet thing (mushrooms, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, potatoes, spinach).  I can't remember what it was called, but it was by far the healthiest thing on the menu.  The portion size was large and it was great to see them load up the veggies and not just inundate the skillet with potatoes like other places tend to do to cut on costs.\n\nAs a second dish, we ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  I have had chicken and waffles, but this was by far the best I have had.  First off, the chicken was deboned--which means you just cut into it and eat--no need to chomp through cartilage or cut around bones to get to the meat.  Second, the batter wasn't too thick or excessive and complemented the chicken perfectly.  Third, the chicken was cooked PERFECTLY--probably brine-soaked before they deep fried it because it was plump, juicy, and pretty much just a perfect piece of chicken.  Lastly, the waffle was cooked well, and right in the middle of each piece of waffle was a few slices of bacon, which was an awesome surprise to an already great meal.\n\nIn the end, there was no room for dessert, but by that time, I was sold on this place and can't wait to get back here to eat again!\n\nHappy Eating!"

S"Chicken and waffles!  I was so excited to try this place out after seeing it on tv. It is inside the Quad ( formerly the imperial palace).  Go all the way to the back, away from the strip entrance.  There is a escalator with signage.  No wait at 8 am on Wednesday.  Plenty is seating booths and tables.   They are open 24/7 with a full service bar. The portions are ridiculous.  Definitely enough for two meals.  It was so good.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful.  The waffles had a hint of vanilla with bacon cooked right in.  Is it better than Roscoe's in L.A. ? No.  But , it is legit. My only criticizim is not enough syrup.  Definitely ask for extra right off the bat.  Our server was great and attentive.  He even offered to give us to go cups for our coffee. I look forward to coming back next trip.  P. S.  I brought the leftovers with me on the plane.  Too good to waste."

S"Previous reviewers are all correct on the portions, they are GIANT, too big.  Most people in Vegas are at a hotel and not taking home leftovers so alot of food is going to waste.  They could serve half portion sizes and charge slightly less and probably make more money without all the waste.\n\nThat to say, the food, although excessive, was AWESOME!!!  I will definitely be going back to this joint.  I got the Farmhouse Scramble with bacon and avocado with the potato smashers and a side of gravy to eat with my biscuit.  Absolutely delicious.  Eggs were the right texture, not too soft but not overcooked, gravy was thick and good flavor, biscuit was perfect, potatoes were pretty much mashed potatoes so if you don't want those for breakfast, don't get them, but I loved them just fine.  Went great with my bowl of gravy :)\n\nBoyfriend got the french toast and he was equally pleased with his meal.\n\nOnly small complaint is there was an hour wait, not a big deal, we expected a wait, so we went down and played at a $5 blackjack table right next to the restaurant.  They told us to come check back in 30 minutes just in case and when we did were told to come back in 20 minutes.  We went back in 20 minutes and they said our table had been ready for 15 minutes.  They could invest in the buzzers to let people know when their table is ready so you can enjoy the casino while waiting without having to go back repeatedly and missing being called.  We were starving and would have been happy to eat 15 minutes earlier and would have lost less money waiting... \n\nRegardless, highly recommend!!!!"

S'I\'m thinking about breaking up with Gordon over this debacle of a restaurant. And that says a lot because I love this man\'s restaurants. \n\nYou almost get the idea when you walk in that you\'re going to be disappointed. From the cheap looking outfits the girls wear, to the crowded, pushed together tables with everyone sitting on top of each other, you feel mediocrity permeating this place from the onset. \n\nIt seems such a weird thing to be eating here as I\'m vegetarian, but they do have ONE option for me so I wasn\'t staring into space while my friends noshed on their burgrs. That\'s how you spell it, right? No? Okay, sorry.\n\nFirst the service. If you were thinking this restaurant was on the mediocre side then the service would have you falling over into it. Completely unable to wait on more than one table at a time (both times I visited). My water glass the first time didn\'t even recognize its use as a water glass. The second time was a little better, but the waiter buzzed around like a robot barely talking. Apparently he was working on his multitasking. Also, how unsexy are jeans with the intials "GR" on the pocket? A little overboard on the vanity methinks.\n\nI had the Earth Burgr (ha, I just love doing that) consisting of grilled portobello mushroom, fontina cheese, arugula and roasted tomato. The combo sounds good and it\'s fine, but not for $15. I mean, it\'s not even meat, it\'s a mushroom disguised as meat. That lessens the chance of me raving about it considerably. I like to get what I pay for or I lose the ability to rave about anything. The taste is fine, the bun is soft, the arugula is a nice touch, but it seriously is just OKAY. \n\nLet\'s just get to the fries. I have never in my life tasted fries like this. I hated them. They are too big, they are too SOMETHING and it\'s not something that\'s positive. I had both the regular and the parmesan. Just no. The flavor is just wrong. I can\'t even really put my finger on why. I regret ever tasting these at all. \n\nNow to dessert. Sigh. I was hoping that after just spending $80 on a meal prior to dessert that I would somehow be redeemed for that colossal wasting of money. HA! I\'d be wrong! Ordered the sticky toffee pudding ice cream on a stick thing and wondered who in the hell I\'d pissed off at this place. What a joke of a dessert. First, it\'s so obviously made ahead of time (it\'s frozen, so of course), but it tastes it. I\'m not a fan. I can\'t even go on about it, it was just such a disappointment. \n\nI\'ve been to GR Steak and the GR at the London (NYC) and have come from both feeling like I would never taste better. I think GR is much better at gourmet then low brow burgers (yeah, I even got tired of it).'

S"As much as we come to Vegas (about once a month), I have never had the opportunity to try Burgr (the hubby isn't a burger fan and would not wait an hour to eat a burger - can't say I blame him though), even though I've been dying to try it (oh, the hype). \n\nSo finally, I get my opportunity! We were staying at Planet Hollywood, so after sending my hubby out to win us some money, I decided to get a Burgr burger to go. It is still a 25 minute wait when you get it to go. That was a bit surprising, considering that is was 12:30am, there was no line and the restaurant was only halfway full. \n\nThere were 3 young girls at the front counter host stand. When I approached them, they were too busy nudging each other and pointing to different girls outfits who were walking by, and then whispering in each other's ears and laughing, to notice I was standing right in front of them. They came to a couple seconds later and one of them greeted me while the other two kept up their charade, oblivious to me watching them. So I just shook my head, placed my order and waited. \n\nI finally got my treasured Euro Burger to my room, 30 minutes later and my pockets 17 dollars lighter. It was really good. Cooked perfectly - medium rare, with the perfect amount of all ingredients listed on the menu. However, I have had better burgers. I expected there to be a punch in the taste, or for the flavors to stand out in some way that I have never had before, but sadly that wasn't the case. \n\nI don't believe the burger was worth that much money, but it was definitely a great burger. I wouldn't wait in line either for an hour for it, but if you feel fit to do so, enjoy!"

S"Oh Chef Ramsay, must you be so awesome?...\n\nI kid of course...well, in a sense I do.  To be honest, I am the last person you would find buying into the hype of a celebrity chef.  An on screen persona is not enough to judge  one's culinary prowess or personality in the kitchen, since of course everything is likely played up for show.  And on top of that, going to a restaurant that tauts the name of a chef without having them present to prepare the food also lessens any impact their name would have.  I imagine Chef Ramsay was involved in the restaurant to an extent, however, and to be fair to all parties BurGR did nothing to discredit any claims of greatness on his part.\n\nTo set the stage for our trip here, you should keep in mind that we drove in from Southern California the day after Thanksgiving, and due to the festivities of the prior day had not eaten all day.  By the time we had checked in, found the place, and got in line it was already past 10 PM, a full 24 hours since the last time we had eaten.  I will try not to let my delusional state from that ordeal affect my overall impression, but I feel it's necessary to add it as a footnote (a footnote smack dab in the middle of the review, mind you).\n\nAnyway, on to the experience itself.  The wait wasn't as bad as I had feared, but it was still a decent wait (I think when all was said and done it came out to around 30 minutes).  The hostesses were friendly and regularly checked up on the line to give updates, which I felt was a nice touch.  My fiancee and I had already gotten a chance to review the menu by the time we were seated, in an effort to expedite the process as much as possible.\n\nOur waiter was...I struggle for a word...fantastic?  That sounds a bit excessive, but he was very good.  He was welcoming and attentive, refilling glasses without needing to be asked, and was more than willing to provide answers to any of our questions.\n\nBut I'm sure you want to know about the food.  We ordered the onion rings, Parmesan truffle fries, and then the 'chili' dog and farm burger.  The onion rings surprised me a great deal.  It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but they were definitely some of the best I have ever had.  The fries, on the other had, had a good flavor but also had a weird consistency to them, almost soft and thick (but not like normal steak fries). The chili dog is almost false advertising (despite the menu listing all of the ingredients) as it didn't really have anything resembling chili on it...really more of a chili inspired dog.  My fiancee didn't enjoy it as much as I did, but then I am a fan of red peppers.\n\nThe farm burger (might as well highlight the food item that gives the restaurant its name) was probably one of the most decadent burgers I have ever had.  Burger with duck and a fried egg on it...I can feel my circulatory system clogging up just thinking about it.  It was a good burger for sure, but I hesitate to say it's the 'best burger ever' or some ridiculous claim like that.  It did not disappoint, however.\n\nPrice wise...what can I say?  It's a celebrity chef's restaurant in Vegas, of course it's going to be a little pricey.  But I didn't feel like we were getting ripped off, just that we were splurging a bit.\n\nI recommend, though I do not feel it warrants repeat visits."

S"We watch Kitchen Nightmares so we were curious and anxious to eat here since Chef Ramsey has such uncompromising standards. At least on TV.\n\nI must say that the experience was inconsistent at best and disappointing at worst.  \n\nWe went early New Year's Eve and waited only 25 minutes or so for a table, which I guess is pretty good. \n\nI got the blue cheese burger, and it was not good at all. The beef was overcooked to the point of being dry and difficult to swallow. I had asked for pink in the middle to keep it juicy, but there was not a drop of juice in that burger and there was no pink. Come on, it's a burger, they should know how to cook it right. If Chef Ramsey had tasted my burger he would have made a face and pushed it away, claiming that it was so dry as to be inedible. And he would be right.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's Farm Burger was excellent and cooked correctly. The flavors came together and the wife loved it. \n\nThe onion rings were the best I have ever had, light and not greasy.\n\nLike almost every restaurant on the strip, this place is over-priced with some mediocre food. To his credit, the burgers are not as over-priced as at some restaurants on the strip (just walk through various hotels and look at the outrageous prices). Still, with two burgers, onion rings, and a couple of beers plus tax and tip the bill was over $70, and only one of the burgers was any good. \n\nThe wife would return, but she would have to go alone because I would not return."

S'First off, the address for Gordon Ramsay\'s BurGR is incorrect on this page. It is not in Caesars Palace, it is in Planet Hollywood!\n\nAnyway, BurGR is always very packed in high clientele so it is obviously a popular place to eat. During my visit with my boyfriend, we ordered the honey pig bao bun and we both ordered the farm burger and the "just fries". \n\nThe hone pig bao bun was okay, the bun\'s texture wasn\'t the best I have tried, it would get stuck in my teeth, which is irritating. Overall, they were okay.\nWe were both very excited to try the farm burger because all of the pictures we saw made it look amazing, plus when they finally had it served to us, it looked delicious. Well, as we ate it, we both thought that there was something missing... Overall the burger was okay, we both have had better..\nThe "just fries" were only okay as well.. The texture was so weird, it was like a rubbery texture, which didn\'t feel right as we ate them.\n\nOverall, BurGR is okay. I apologize Gordon Ramsay, but it\'s a great concept you have going on at this restaurant, the food just isn\'t at the tip of the tea amazing. It was a good experience, but I don\'t think I will be coming back.'

S'I had heard many great things about this place before my latest visit to Vegas.  So this was put at the top of my list to visit.\n\nGot here on a Thursday night and our party of 3 was seated immediately.  We waited about 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us.  I took immediate notice to the dress code of the servers.  EVERY SINGLE waitress had to tug down their one piece "dress" for every 10 steps they took.  Unnecessarily tight for servers in a restaurant... but it wasn\'t just the women... the men had on Polo\'s that also appeared to be suffocating them.  The only people who looked to be comfortable in their uniforms were the floor managers.   We did get our beers fairly quickly, once greeted by our waitress.  Everything on the menu is ala-carte, which is like most places in Vegas.  Between the 3 of us, we ordered the Uber Cheese Burger,  Britannia Burger, Chantenele burger and the Parmesan Fries.   We all ordered our burgers medium.  \n\nI\'m still laughing at the irony of being in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and waiting 45 minutes for our burgers to come out.  Mind you, there was no wait, it was 11pm and the restaurant was at less than half capacity.  Even more ironic, all of our burgers came out well done.\n\nNow, we all cut our burgers into 3\'s and split amongst ourselves to sample it all.  Even though our burgers were not cooked the way we wanted, they were all very tasty.  I could only image what they would be like had the meat been a little pink.   The parmesan fries were good and the sauces that came with were a treat.\n\nI only rate 3 stars as being a fan of Gordon\'s shows - I know the slow service we received as well as overcooked food is unacceptable to his standards.'

S"Usually I am a 4 star bore, almost formulamatically handing out four stars no matter how vicious I am in my actually commentary. I've got to give three to this place though partly because of the name associated with it (I simply expected a lot more.\n\nLet's start with what's good about it. It has a cool vibe, although a little chaotic. It occupies a great location in PH. It's nice to see PH has finally figured out what to do with its former poker room/high limit/high roller/ they don't know what the hell to do with it room. And for being in a prime location it was reasonably priced. \n\nNow the bad. The food is mediocre. I had the fish sandwich on the recommendation of my waiter, and my friends had hamburgers. My fish sandwich was beautifully presented, but that was the highlight. The piece of fish itself was very good, but the fried toast bun was way to greasy. My friends hamburgers both cam medium rare, but only one was order that way. I tasted both and found them to be bland and surprisingly dry for being as rare as they were. Most importantly though, there was nothing unique about them. They were just burgers with a lot of flair. My friends both ordered milkshakes which were good, but both were essentially creamy puddings masquerading as a milkshake. Again, good, and somewhat unique, but not $9 a piece good. That is the only thing I thought was really over priced. I had a Johnny Walker Black and it was delicious, but I don't think the restaurant had much to do with that. \n\nAs a local I know of several burger places in town that far out strip this place. I don't want to drop names but there is an Asian Fusion burger place in town that blows this place out of the water for comparable prices. And for better flavor at much better prices there's a place owned by a group of guys, five of them I think, that is a much better meal and value. \n\nSo for the tourist I say this is an OK place to go.It is owned by a famous chef, it is in a great location, and it is an OK meal. Most places on the strip for this price are merely just OK meals. It is worth eating at and getting your picture taken out by the sign. For locals we all know better places which are much easier to get to."

Hot dogs are sauteed, steamed and then grilled over apple wood chips.  The hummus is the best I have ever had accompanied by the most delicious fresh veggies (radishes, scallions and carrots).

S"My dad is obsessed with burgers and demanded that we eat at BurGR instead of Mon Ami Gabi; I'm not still not convinced that this was a good choice. My mother and I split the kale Caesar salad, which was my favorite part of the meal.  The dressing wasn't overly heavy and the apple complimented the bitterness of the kale, making it surprisingly palatable.  Even if you find kale to be the worst vegetable in the universe, which my mom and I do, you will probably enjoy this salad.  My dad and I had the farm burger, which my dad loved; I, however, did not.  The duck bacon that they put on top of the burger had a stringy consistency which made it hard to eat and activated my gag reflex.  The egg yolk had dripped all over my plate even before it made it to the table, making the bottom of an otherwise delightful bun soggy.  The burger itself was well-cooked, juicy, and flavorful.  All this combined made for an average burger.  My mom skipped the burger and ordered fish and chips instead.  I don't understand why it is served in giant sandwich roll which makes it impossible to eat unless you can unhinge your jaw.  She also said that the fish was bland and drenched it in ketchup to give it flavor.\nThe service was good and the waitress was attentive however, she gave us the wrong drinks and then forgot to bring us water with lemon in it. \nOverall, this was a disappointing experience and I won't be coming back anytime soon."

The restaurant is filled with beautiful people and the food coming out looks spectacular but 18.00 for a hamburger (added egg) that tastes ok is just too rich for my blood.

That is  my fault for not inquiring about it when the waiter asked if we had any questions.  In the end, it was good just not for the price.

But maybe because of those high expectations, this place didn't quite deliver for me ):\n\nI split the farm burger & truffle fries with a friend. And the burger was good, yes, but not amazing. Admittedly, everything was well cooked, nicely made, and beautifully presented, but the burger just seemed to be missing something. I think maybe I would've liked some lettuce or tomatoes in my burger? Some kind of veggies to balance out the patty and the egg? The fries were good, but not noteworthy either. Their house ketchup was different, and I probably would've preferred just plain-ol' heinz.\n\nAnywho, overall, the burgers were good, just not as good as I would've expected from GR. Maybe if the bar hadn't been set so high, this place would've gotten 4 stars instead of 3. But solid burgers, decently priced for being on the strip, just don't expect amazing."

S'After watching numerous shows on television about Gordon Ramsay that piqued my desire to try dining at one of his restaurants, I decided to opt for a "lower" (relative term) cost option at the Planet Hollywood. Walking in, I saw a bunch (read 6 or 7) of hostesses in short skirts and iPads making small talk with people around. "This place is decorated fancy," I thought. The tables looked pristine and there were pictures of Ramsay and fire (hinting Hell\'s Kitchen I suppose) all around. I could not miss the huge Keg Cellar in the background. This is what I expected a top chef bar/burger joint would look like - trendy, casual and spacious.\n\nIn spite of it being really late in the night - post midnight, and the place half full, our hostess insisted on feeding our information into her iPad to tell us that our table would be ready in 45 minutes. I must say time flies fast in Vegas because in 5 minutes we were texted that our table was ready. The hostess seemed like it was a daily affair - I guess iPad\'s do not replace brains and common sense. \n\nAnyways, after being seated at our table, we had some time to ponder over our menu (as our server was busy serving two other tables at that time and the menu being short and sweet). She was polite but was not enthusiastic and seemed like she was doing a chore. Thanks to yelp we did not need any suggestions and we ordered shake, 2 burgers, a chicken slider plate and a side of fries. \n\nWatching other dishes coming out of the kitchen, I was tempted - the hot dog was one of them, but alas we already had ordered too much food. To keep up with Celebrity chef standard, the food came out decorated really well, and looking appetizing. \n\nThe shake was the Creme Brulee (which others had praised on yelp). I thought it was good but a little heavy.. (maybe I am not a shake guy). My beer gave me good company while I waited anxiously for our food to arrive. \n\n30 minutes later we received our Five Spice Chicken sliders. I could so pass this dish - fried chicken - meh!\n\nAnother 15 minutes and I received my burger (cut in two pieces which is awesome as I can\'t really fit the whole thing in my mouth anyway). I decided to sample my wife\'s Euro burger too, in addition to devouring my own Hell\'s Kitchen burger. The burger is not too big so you will definitely need your own. The meat was cooked perfectly (a plus for cutting the burger into two so you can see the inside). The Hell\'s Kitchen burger had the kick of the Jalapeno peppers (which I have found to be doused in other places). The Euro burger had some other toppings which were equally delightful. I find it hard to rank the two but as I liked the spice in the Hell\'s Kitchen burger I would probably give it a slight edge. \n\nThe Truffle Parmesan fries were tasty, a different flavor profile than I have tried before and were not too greasy. However the fries starting seeming soggy as I passed the first few. It appeared that they had been prepared a few minutes (10 or more) earlier and were lying under the lamp heat. I would still say these fries are a try at BURGR.\n\nOverall, due to the trendy atmosphere, tasty burgers, nicely decorated plates AND moderately decent service, silly experience with the hostess and soggy fries I give it 3 stars.'

S"On our first trip to Vegas we had to eat at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. We had the Britannia burger, the American burger and shared Just Fries. The service was great, we got there right at opening, seated right away and the servers were great, we never even had to ask for a drink refill. They knew the menu and what to recommend and had great drink pairing suggestions. The burgers were phenomenal. I would say it is quite possibly the best burger I have ever eaten. The bun was fresh and soft, the burger was cooked to perfection. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was because of the fries. They were average, nothing special. They give you 2 different kinds of ketchup to dip and I think they were both a bit too spicy.\n\nOverall I was very pleased with my visit and will be back when I get back to Vegas, can't wait to have another amazing BurGR!"

S"I loved GORDON RAMSAY BurGR! We went on a Wednesday night so the wait was only about five minutes. We sat and were given an iPad full of choices of booze and a little fold out menu for the food.\n\nBurGR has a very decent craft beer selection, which pleased me. I had a Squatters Hop Rising and a Stone Ruination, both on tap. We also ordered the fresh roasted jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers. Man, those poppers were good, but way too frickin hot for me. And I had chapped lips to boot! Ouch!\n\nFor the main course I had the simple Gordon Ramsay Cheeseburger and an order of the Sweet Potato Fries. The burger was excellent! But those fries were served with a shaker of powdered sugar and chipotle mayo. They were easily the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.\n\nBetween great beer choices, bomb sides and hearty burgers... I'm a fan! \n\n4.5 stars!"

S"First Gordon Ramsay restaurant I've been too :D\n\nCan't miss this place with all the flames and the huge line of people waiting to try burGR! I got pretty lucky coming here on a Saturday morning at 11 am. There wasn't a line so your best chance is to go early. My boyfriend and I were seated at the counter right in front of the kitchen so we were able to watch all the food being prepared. I thought it was fascinating watching all the burgers come out fresh from the kitchen making their way to the tables, I'm a visual person so looking at all the different burgers helped me determine which one I wanted.\n\nI got the Farm Burger because it has duck bacon and the fried egg made it an easy choice for me. I did enjoy the burger. One thing I noticed, you could taste the cheese, it didn't fade into the background. I really liked that because I love cheese! I thought the duck bacon was rich in flavor but as good as it was, I think the burger would've been better with a regular bacon because it would still provide that savory saltiness but with an added crunch that I thought the burger was missing. The egg was perfectly fried, one bite and the yolk was running. There was a lot of rich components to this burger, the duck bacon, the egg, and the sharp cheddar..it left me wanting something acidic or citrusy to balance all the richness. I also got fries and that was pretty good. Their fries are a thicker cut so it was pretty dense in potato and it was larger in size. I really liked the chipotle and curry ketchup that came as dipping sauce! I also got the Shake #5 and that was SO GOOD. It was a coffee shake with hazelnut pudding and everything about that shake was decadent. Be careful not too drink all the shake because then you're left just pudding and you can't really drink that, and ask for a spoon so you can eat the pudding! \n\nI thought their service was wonderful, our server was friendly and attentive. The quality of the food here was superb. Overall I enjoyed my experience here and I wouldn't mind coming back again."

S'Onion Rings were fantastic.  Truffle French Fries were all right: the truffle flavor ended up on the serving dish but were not detectable on the fries.  We got Chandrelle Burger: the chandrelle mixture was overly sweet and I am not sure the mushrooms were even chandrelles.  The burger itself was the same as all the other fancy burger places serve.'

The Just Fries were nothing really special, but the chipotle ketchup was very good (the curry ketchup was just a little too strong).\n\nIt is pricy, but you have to expect that, so it didn't bother me...

The atmosphere here is amazing, the food taste awesome and great service. \n\nThe menu is not that selective. My friend got the Hell's Kitchen burger and I got the farm burger. I got to admit the spicy kick in the Hell's Kitchen burger is what made it taste amazing. My farm burger (duck and bacon) was good too. The fries here were outstanding.\n\n1. Hell's Kitchen burger comes with jalape\xc3\xb1os and Avocado. The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The spicy kick made it pop!\n\n2. The fsrm burger is full of flavor, you can taste the bacon and the duck. It's not to fatty nor grease and definitely hits the spot.\n\n3. We got the jalapeno shooters, this was fun because there is one jalapeno stuffed with the spicy seeds. My friends all took and waited to see who was the special person. In the end, it was not me!\n\nI would definitely go back."

The shakes are a combo of pudding, shake and cookie - over the top and delicious! \n\nThe truffle fries were well balanced and unless you love sweet things, perhaps give the sweet potato fries a miss. \n\nThe place also utilises iPads to show (read: sell) you their drinks (cocktails especially!)

S'Let me start by saying I\'m a big fan of Gordon Ramsey so I was very excited to try BurGR. It was about four in the afternoon on a Sunday when my girlfriend and I got to BurGR. There were only a few people in the "line". I say "line" because there was a rope and there were people inside it but mostly outside it which seemed a bit confused. The hostesses ignored the issue for a couple minutes then finally came and sorted everything out. This was a bit annoying since they were just standing there talking to each other and didn\'t seem to be doing any actual work. After the line was sorted out they kept trying to push these tiny tables on everyone in line that were on the very edge of the restaurant practically inside the casino. Nobody was interested in sitting there but they sure kept asking people. These tabletops didn\'t look large enough to even fit food for two. While we stood in line I saw a female trying to buy a BurGR t-shirt. She had to loudly say, "Excuse me!" several times before the hostesses would stop their personal conversation and help her. The nearest hostess actually had her back to the line completely ignoring it. At that point the one hostess took the shirt from her and told her to purchase it at the bar and bring back the receipt then they would give her the shirt. They went immediately back to their conversation. It may not sound like much but the hostesses were VERY MUCH into their personal conversation more than helping customers. It was  rude. If I were to grade the restaurant based solely on the hostesses it would be one star.\n\nWhen we finally got a table the server was fairly quick helping us. We both ordered the signature "Hell\'s Kitchen Burger", hers without the jalapenos. We both ordered soda and it was semi cold like the soda machine was putting out warm soda and the ice wasn\'t cutting it. Maybe the machine was having issues. Seems like a small thing but it still bothered me. \n\nWhen we finally got our burgers and onion rings the quality of the food and presentation was very noticeable. It\'s exactly as I expected it would be. To me, the major downside was my burger seemed bland. I\'m not a fan of tomatoes or avocado but I left them on since that\'s how the burger was meant to be tasted. The avocado (which has never had any flavor for me) completely masked the flavor and heat of the burger. When I finally took the avocado off the burger it finally got some flavor and heat. Even with that I don\'t think there was enough flavor in the burger. The onion rings were decent but the dipping sauces were great! Finally a plus. \n\nSo, two burgers, onion rings to share, and two sodas... just under $50. Too pricey for what I got. In the restaurant\'s defense, my girlfriend loved the food and it was obvious they used high quality ingredients in everything. Maybe I expected too much with Ramsey\'s name attached. I would try it again and get something else. Maybe that particular burger wasn\'t right for me.\n\nI love a good burger and for me, in Vegas, my favorite spot is Stripburger. If anyone reading this is in SoCal try Umami Burger or Slater\'s 50/50. For my money, those places are far better than BurGR.'

S'We barely had to wait which was awesome. Must have came at just the right time. Usually there is a fairly decent sized line to get in. We were seated and given menus with Gordon Ramsay\'s face on it. It was a little funny but it was cool. We decided to split onion rings with cheese and truffle fries. The onion rings were so good. You didn\'t get that one bite and the whole onion comes with it, it was the right texture that an onion ring should be. The sauces that came with it were great, BBQ sauce, cheese sauce. Both were pretty darn good. With the truffle fries they were tasty but a little greasy and soggy after a while. However the sauces were an aioli and ketchup which accompanied the fries well. \n\nNow on to the main course. My girl got the duck bacon burger which comes with a fried egg on top. That burger was bomb, a very tasty burger indeed. However my burger feel a little short. I got the hog burger. It\'s a pork burger and I have to say they should rename it to the "Pho Burger." It tasted like a bowl of pho. I was really disappointed by that because I could have saved half the money by getting pho at a Vietnamese restaurant. My other friend got the same burger and said it did taste like pho. I mean it had good flavor and was tender but tasted like pho. \n\nThe sticky toffee pudding push pops were forgettable. I\'ve had the real thing at his restaurant in LA and it was WAY better. Everything else was worthy of a 4 star review but overall it\'s 3 for me this time around. Good thing my girl filled up on fries and onion rings and gave me like half her burger to save this review. The fries, onion rings and duck bacon burger were on point. Sticky toffee pudding push pops and pork burger you can go without. If you are spending that much money, it\'s not really worth it for those particular items on the menu. Staff was friendly tho.'

S'Let me preface this review by saying that I am not here to rip a gordon ramsay restaurant because he is so critical of people on TV like i think many people are. \n\nOn a recent trip to LV i stopped by burgr. I enjoyed the ambiance and the way that the menu was presented. I ordered the farm burger which came with duck bacon and an egg along with the sweet potato fries. The burger was not overly flavorful but for what it was it was pretty good. The fries on the other hand came dusted with vanilla powdered sugar and had a jalepeno honey aioli on the side. They were WAY too sweet with absolutely no balance of flavor to the point where I found them inedible.'

S"I'm beginning to wonder whether Gordon Ramsay is just a fictitious, overly confident chef. Having tried out several of his restaurants now, I'm really just not that impressed with anything he's put out. His concepts are just too over the top, trying way too hard.\n\nI guess this time it's with an Asian influence e.g. honey-pig bao buns (translation: bun buns?), soba noodle chicken salad, etc. Except... the servers are all wearing this shiny pewter/charcoal grey spandex-type dress and bowling shoes? \n\nThe burgers are mounds high, piled with condiments and requiring knife and fork. The hotdogs were visually appealing. We tried the Pork Belly Dawg and it wasn't bad - but the pork belly and sauce added on top of the hotdog made everything super salty. I like how they used a gourmet sesame bun though instead of the usual cheap-ass stuff. It made a big difference in the texture - no dry and loose crumbs all over the place.\n\nHowever, the truffle parmesan fries were seriously delicious! Another salt-heavy item but the fries were crispy, the cheese was pungent and drool-inducing, and the truffle oil just made you want to keep eating 'em! \n\nI was most impressed with dessert (and to think, I almost passed it up because I was unimpressed with the hotdog). Just try to NOT salivate over this: sticky toffee pudding with salted peanut caramel ice cream PUSH POPS! \n\nRiiiiiight?! I haven't had a push pop in a loooong time (Flintstones anyone?). Dang these were crazy yummy with the toffee pudding at just the right amount of sweetness so that the salted peanut caramel ice cream carried most of the flavor. It was gooey but not  to the point where you had to pick it off your teeth. All the flavors just blended together for this amazing peanut buttery taste. I just want to go back for this!\n\nbottom line: gets a good vote for a hangover meal contender, but expect to pay $$."

S"Exceptional burger place, for a reasonable price, considering you're at a celebrity restaurant on the strip. The wait is long, but worth it.\nThe burger combinations are delicious, my favorite is the one with the fig spread. They are usually perfectly cooked.\nThe thing that sets this place apart is the truffle fries and the desserts. The truffle fries are a concoction of beautifully presented fries with a generous sprinkling of light Parmesan fluffs (for lack of a better word) mixed with freshly chopped herbs, and truffle, of course! Love it! I could probably have an order to myself although it's big enough (and expensive enough) to share.\nThe dessert combinations are also stellar, with delicious milkshakes topped with a wonderful pudding. It sounds weird, but imagine a milkshake topped with a somewhat chocolate mousse-flavored topping. Awesome!!\nThe only flaw we've ever found is once the dip for the fries had a skin on it from being prepared ahead of time. The dishes are starting to looking a bit beaten-up, but considering the high volume of people, understandable. They should swap it out, though, and the placemats are looking a bit raggedy for the image.\nNot as much kid-friendly as Holstein's, no kids menu. I think Holsteins' burgers on a good day can beat BurGR when they aren't on top of their game. They can't touch BurGR's truffle fries or milkshakes, though!"

S"I was expecting to like this place better, given how much I enjoyed the food at Gordon Ramsay Pub in Caesars.  Burgr has the drink menu on the iPad, which is common to all of Ramsay's locations in Vegas.  I didn't partake, but there was a lemonade and vodka drink that was popular with the couple we ate with.\n\nTo start, we had jalapeno poppers.  These are large, and come 6 to an order.  They are served in shot glasses with an excellent ranch sauce at the bottom.  In an interesting twist, they don't tell you which one has the seeds still in it.  Seeds are what gives jalapenos their heat, so that one is noticeably hotter than the rest.  I got it in our order, which is good because I like hot stuff. \n\nI had the cheesy burger with added duck bacon.  Be advised they burgers don't come with veggies or sauces on the side, so you have to ask for them.  The burger was a perfect medium, but lacked flavor.  It cleary is very good quality meat, but was underseasoned.  I had to put the truffle mayo on it, which was served as a side to the truffle parmesan fries.  These were excellent, and I don't usually care for thick-cut fries.  But, the truffle flavor came through, and the mayo was an excellent dipping sauce.  I didn't much care for the housemade ketchup, too sweet for me.\n\nThe wife had the maytag blue cheese burger, which was delicious, but only because it had such a large amount of blue cheese on it.  I think anything with that much maytag would be great.  \n\nAll in all, the appetizer and fries were the most memorable part of our lunch.  And, that's not how it should be at a high end burger joint.  I may return if someone visits and wants to go, but I doubt it.  Would probably direct them across the street and up a block to Gordon Ramsay Pub at Caesars..."

S"I wasn't a burger person but came for the Gordon Ramsay hype. We had truffle Parmesan fries to begin with, the fries is ordinary but with the truffle a\xc3\xafole sauce it was really good. I got the hill's kitchen burger and it was the best burger I've ever had. The burger was not dry nor greasy. The hint of spiciness from the roasted jalape\xc3\xb1o peppers made it so delicious. Brought the whole flavor to another level. I think Gordon is very good with the flavor and the texture of the foods he create. This burger joint was the most surprising meal for me in this trip. \nThe decoration of the restaurant is very modern and fun. The fire display in the transparent wall with their logo is eye catching. The waiter who served us was very friendly and not seemed hurry even it's busy. It showed professionalism. The only thing I  DONT LIKE about is the servers' uniform. It's a spandex nylon texture denim look top that shows every inch of the person's body. IF the person has a good body shape it will look good but most people don't have perfect shapes so it is not a pretty picture. I think the design was originally made for Gordon or people like him who does ironman triathlon. Anyways. I don't want to continue on this insignificant topic. It's just details I noticed. Overall.

Checked in with the hostess and went and checked out some stores in the indoor mall. \nThe hostess was very nice and the server was very nice, and made a couple of suggestions. \nI had read many reviews before coming here and so of course my expectations were high. I had the farm burger, and my wife had the Hell's Kitchen burger. We usually order different things so that we could try each other's. We had a couple different types of fries. My two sons both had adult size burgers as well and I tried both of theirs. Well, it wasn't even slightly impressive. Boring, bland, and a whole lot of so what. \nRegardless of having high expectations this place was just not very good. \nAgain, the service was great, the atmosphere fun, the food was not even close to just about any burger place I have ever been to. I'm not mad...just disappointed and surprised."

The wait on a Monday night was 45 minutes but it was pretty neat that they text you when your table is ready.  The service is fantastic -- the waiters are very well educated on their menu and you never have to ask for a refill.\n\nWe had the Honey Pork Belly Buns and Jalapeno Poppers for appetizers.  I really enjoyed the Pork Belly Buns a lot -- I loved the subtle Asian taste and the flavors balanced really well.  I liked the Jalapeno Poppers too but I thought that the sauce they came with was a little too creamy -- and also I believe there was melted Cheddar Cheese inside the popper as opposed to Cream Cheese which is more traditional.  There could've been Cream Cheese as well -- but I could mostly taste the Cheddar.  For dinner my sister and I both ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which was delicious.  I wish it had been more spicy (given it's name) but it was delicious none-the-less.  My husband and brother-in-law both ordered the Farm Burger which was also delicious -- the fried egg added a nice touch.  I love that you can get your burgers grilled to your liking (although for $15 per burger, that's the least they can do).  We also had the Parmesan Truffle Fries which were DELICIOUS.  I could've made a meal just out of those.\n\nAll in all, while we had a really great experience, I don't think we'd go back the next time we're in Vegas because a) it wasn't out of this world and b) there are just too many places to try in Vegas!"

The exterior already attracted us and the ambiance of the restaurant is definitely upscale. Immediately after we were seated down we noticed the extreme detailing of this place. Everything looked so pretty! Our server was also friendly (even though he took forever to bring our drinks). \n\nWe ordered the Hell\'s Kitchen Burger which was pretty good. The flavors were well-balanced. As Gordon Ramsay would say, "the burger brings a lot of heat, it\'s got a nice kick to it!" However, we wanted medium-well but that wasn\'t what we really got. We also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries and that was delicious. The sauces that we were given were unique-tasting, MUST TRY! \n\nOverall, Gordon Ramsay Burgr met the standards of what a burger should taste like, but nothing stood out or was spectacular. We would like to return again though to try their other burgers or the devil dawgs.'

S"Have been here twice now and both times it was amazing. It is now going to be a tradition to go back on every trip we make to Vegas. There is always a wait but you can put your name in and they will send you a text when your table is almost ready so that you don't have to just stand in line. The first time I tried the burger the pepper on it and it was HOT I ended up having to pick it off halfway through but the flavor was incredible. The sweet potato fries are a must try, they are served with a dip that really makes the fries better than anyone else's. The burgers are the perfect size not too thick but not super thin, they also come on a unique bun that suites the burger well. We tried the parmesan fries the second time and they are good also, they come with a garlic dip that is super potent but goes well with the parmesan on top of the fries. As far as service I would have expected something better from a place of Gordon's, that is the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars. We had to wait forever for refills and our waitress hardly checked back on us... at least the food didn't have any problems that needed addressing."

One con was that the wait time for the food was pretty long, so prepare yourself. \n\nFood:\n\nTruffle Fries:\n\nI really don't like truffle oil and I confirmed it eating this, but the fries were still good. Unique, fancy and well made. The fries weren't too crispy or too soggy, the perfect balance. I'd recommend if you want to try something different.\n\nBrittania Burger (arugula, mango chutney, some kind of cheese and a bunch of awesomeness):\n\nDelicious. It wasn't overly greasy like a lot of burger joints. I've been to so many where you get grease dripping from the fingers, not a pretty experience haha. The bun was so soft and cute. And the bite was a party in my mouth. After eating half of it, I got pretty full, but I also had a toffee pudding shake before it (which was really rich). I really recommend this burger if you like a battle between sugar and salt :)\n\nShake #1 (toffee pudding and.... Other amazing things haha):\n\nEverything in it is homemade so it was pretty epic. I've got to add in that it is very rich. If you like shakes, I'd recommend it, but make sure you don't drink too much or you'll be too full to eat haha. \n\nOverall, if you're looking for a place to eat at check this place out!"

S'I\'m here to write my peace with BurGr in LV ! \n\nMy second job is a bartender server as well and I understand about being slammed so when a bartender can make a connection with a customer it\'s a great thing...service from the lady bartender was excellent albeit quick...customers can feel a servers anxiety and she did well...i was kinda shocked at the gentlemen bar guys telling a customer sitting at the bar (after he waited for his order and requesting where it was ) : \'what do you want bro ?...all our orders are 25 minutes from the grill" Like he was an uninformed goob....come on : the customer was simply asking where his order was...(and it turned out it was ice cream dessert....just pull from the freezer) and don\'t call him \'bro\' cause he ain\'t your bro...\n\nAsked for a certain temp in the burger and was a few notches North...ugh.\nFries...cold and stale...huh ? \nHot Dog...I know there\'s nitrates in them but damn...!\nBeer list is awesome...\n\nToo many great burgers all over Vegas to let us down Gordon....\n\nAll in all we were politely asked how it was and I never complain but the time I chose to say something...Karma hit me that eve with a touch of food poisoning or my stomach just couldnt keep this down....so to the staff at Burgr yes I understand karma is a bitch and I got mine...so Im here to make peace with BurGr and go on my way....'

S'I have a borderline obsession with Gordon Ramsey. Since I don\'t get cable, it\'s not with his Kitchen Nightmares or Hell\'s Kitchens or what have you - no, it\'s his ridiculous talent.\n\nPEOPLE. GORDON RAMSEY IS MORE THAN JUST A YELLING BRITISH MAN IN A KITCHEN.\n\nHe. Is. A. GODCHEF.\n\nThere\'s this series called Ramsey\'s Ultimate Cookery Course; 100 recipes to stake your life on. And I would. Stake my life on it.\n\nSo when Ryan suggested we go to get burgers, I said, "Meh...burgers.."\n\n"Gordon Ramsey\'s restaurant."\n\nBURGERS!\n\nWorth the wait. Worth the price. Get the oreo shake with the creme brulee pudding and don\'t you fucking waste any of it.\n\nTheir whiskey cherry cocktail is too sweet for my taste and gave me a wicked headache.\n\nThe caesar salad was kale and romaine and despite being one of the most typically boring entrees, it was actually quite wonderful, mellow. The fries were great, too, and Ryan really enjoyed his burger (sans bun, because he likes to pretend he eats semi healthy).\n\nGoddammit Gordon Ramsey, you did it again. Of course you did, like I would have doubted you for a moment.'

S"My wife and I went here twice for dessert while we were in Vegas for my conference.  On a previous trip, we came here for lunch, but it was dessert only during this trip.  I guess we were creatures of habit, as we got the same thing for dessert both times we came, mainly because it was flat out fantastic.  I posted a picture of our dessert for anyone that wants to see.  We each got a shake.  They're truly unique shakes in that they're part pudding and part ice cream shake.  I ordered the cr\xc3\xa8me brulee pudding and cookies and cream shake, while my wife got the chocolate pudding and coffee ice cream shake.    They're pretty large shakes, so you'll definitely be full afterwards.  The shakes are $8 a piece, so they're not cheap, but totally worth it.  If you come here, be sure to save room for dessert.  One other thing to note, the seating at and around the bar is first come first serve.  So, you don't have to wait in the long line to get a seat.  We avoided what looked like a long line by doing this both times.  You can even order from the full menu in this area."

Though, that wasn't the case.\n\nWith regards to the food, I ordered a oreo+butterscotch+creme brulee milkshake along with a Farm Burger and some truffle fries.  For a Gordon Ramsay establishment, it was actually reasonably good.  A lot better than I expected, as this was a chain of the other Ramsay restaurants.  I feel compelled to try his other joints now."

S'My husband and I are completely sold on this place. It has become a must-stop spot on our Las Vegas trips, so we\'ve been there a couple of times by now.\n\nFirst of all, this is a gourmet burger place so don\'t expect McDonalds pricing. Having said that, this Gordon Ramsay burger restaurant is very affordable to anyone looking for something extra but don\'t want to go all out and shell out cash for lobster and steak.  I\'d say you\'ll end up spending an average of $25 per person, that\'s usually our tab, plus or minus a beer or two:) )\nCompared to other places around Las Vegas, it really isn\'t bad because lesser burger places charge about as much and don\'t leave you nearly as satisfied as BurGR does.\n\nSpeaking of beers, they have some very good ones that are perfectly suited to their burgers, so ask your server for recommendations. I\'m usually very happy with the beer here.\n\nThe burgers here are wonderful, nice and juicy, very flavorful thick patties, obviously cooked to perfection.  My favorite burger is the Euro Burger. I simply love the goat cheese/arugula combination. I also really love the Uber Cheese burger.  Cheese, cheese and more cheese! Can\'t go wrong!  My husband is a big fan of the Farm burger, it comes with a fried egg on top, it\'s also really good.\n\nAs far as sides are concerned, I think our favorite so far are the sweet potato fries.  It comes with powdered sugar (and they give you the powdered sugar jar so when you start losing the top fries with the sugar on it, you can add more yourself) and this delicious honey/jalapeno/mayo dip.  This has completely made me into a sweet potato fry snob, because I have yet to find any that measure up to these ones anywhere else.\nThe regular french fries .... what I REALLY really really love about those is the CURRY KETCHUP that comes with them!! So good and so addicting!\n\n(So even if you think it\'s boring to order "just fries" ..... don\'t worry.  With this ketchup along, it is far from boring.)\n\nWe usually end our meal with the tasty Sticky toffee pudding push pops.  It\'s a nice portion that fits perfectly in your belly right alongside the meal you just enjoyed.\n\nLast but not least, the staff is wonderful. Always very friendly and helpful and attentive to your needs. \n\nDefinitely a Las Vegas favorite for us. After writing this review and thinking about these burgers for awhile, I\'m kind of hankering for a Vegas trip all of a sudden...............'

Onions rings were ok but will pass on them next time. I agree with people saying they are salty but the ranch is amazing. Now on to the good stuff...burgers. I got the \xc3\xbcber cheese and it was sooo good. Yes a little dry, BUT the goat cheese makes up for it. Husband got the Hell's Kitchen and he say spicy so be forewarned. Will come back again but to share a burger and get the bao puns as the guy next to me had them & they looked so good!"

S'I could honestly write this whole review about how delicious the onion rings were but for the lack of room I will just talk about how amazing my experience was overall.\n\nI have been dying to try this place for years and when I finally got her I was in awe. Only Gordon Ramsay would design a restaurant with a wall made completely out of glass and fire. Coming here I was prepared to go all out when it came to both the drinks and food. I ordered the chili dog, onion rings, original burger and coffee shake...I know thats A LOT but hey you have to take advantage of the situation especially if Gordon Ramsay is involved. \n\nThe onion rings were so crunchy and seasoned to perfection. Just writing this post my mouth begins to water. The shake was crazy too. There was chocolate pudding on the top and coffee shake on the bottom. A serious sugar overload but went great with the whole fancy diner feel of the whole place. The burger and hot dog were also delicious. Both loaded with all sorts of toppings that I would have never expected to be so delectable. \n\nIf there is such a thing as an orgasm in your mouth then this place will be sure to give you one.'

S"This is now our third Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I like to think of his approach as basic but refined. There are few foods more essential (the sense of basic) than a hamburger.\n\nHis poppers come in shot glasses filled with sauce. Very spicy, but the jalape\xc3\xb1o flavor comes through. The farm burger egg was perfectly cooked and decadent from first bite. finely sliced duck ?leg passes for bacon in this really decadent hamburger.\nThe \xc3\x9cberburger's three cheeses make one of the best cheeseburgers I have ever tasted. \n\nTwo asides; I discovered a beer called Linkenkugen that will surely be one of my all-time favorites and They put a Europa League soccer game up for me. That's unusual in the US but just made everything shine just a little more."

S"Place is elegant. There was a one hour wait time when we arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday. But they took my contact down and text'd me when the table was ready. So we were free to roam the casino. The location was obscured in Planet Hollywood and not located on the map. So it was somewhat difficult to find without guidance from a casino employee. \n\nWe got seated and the server lent us an ipad for the drinks menu, which presented a wide variety of fine wines and cocktails.\n\nFor appetizers we decided to try the truffle fries. The most amazing fries I ever had. The way the oil blends with the Parmesan is orgasmic. Paired with the homemade ketchup and black truffle aioli, nothing could compare.\n\nAnd what could possibly beat a gordon Ramsey burger? I ordered the chanterelle burger. It contained chanterelle mushrooms, argula, figgy-onion jam. Had it cooked medium rare, which in my opinion is the best way to cook a beef patty. The onions and the sweetness of the jam was paired nicely with the patty and the mushrooms. I couldn't ask for a better burger. It was gone in 60 seconds. I practically inhaled the burger without chewing.\n\nI recommend the place to anyone visiting Vegas."

S"This was the first place we decided to eat during our Vegas vacation. I think the food was good but not mouth watering, mind blowing amazing. There have been several restaurants I have been to where I can't even believe how good the food tastes. You know, the kind of food where you feel like you're going to melt into your seat with every bite. BurGR wasn't like that for me and I think I was expecting that. It really didn't taste any better than some other decently good burger places I've been to. I think my expectations were huge considering who's restaurant this is and how we're big fans of his.\n\nMy boyfriend absolutely loved his Hell's Kitchen burger. I had the American burger but changed it to swiss (actually they didn't have swiss but gave me a similar cheese instead) and added mushrooms. It was good but nothing amazing.  Also we did have the Maui onion rings; those were delicious!\n\nMy boyfriend may not agree with my 3 star review and demand I should give 4 or even 5 stars but he has a Yelp account and can write his own review, this was my experience. I would go back, yes, but next time I hope my burger is a bit better, maybe instead of getting a classic burger I should have opted for one of the specialty ones."

Absolute perfection! I ordered the hell burger and asked for it to be cooked medium.  To be honest, I've had better.  My burger was a bit dry and really didn't live up to my expectations.  However, my friends who ordered the the duck burger and the bf went with the pulled pork burger all seemed to enjoy it, so much that they ate ever morsel!! If I do return, I would probably try another burger.  \n\nFor dessert the bf and I shared the #5 shake!  Omg!! This was sooooo delicious.  If I didn't fill up on all the other grub during our seating, no doubt, I would've demolished it!  \n\nAll in all, service was great!  Everyone was attentive and on top of things and I'm willing to give this place another shot and like I said before probably will order another burger off the menu since they had others that caught my eye."

S'GORDON RAMSAY TREBLE\n\nJoe\'s Cable Car vs. Gordon Ramsay BurGR\n(like Hawaii vs. Georgia in the Sugar Bowl)\n\nLast month I went to Vegas and ate at two Gordon Ramsay\'s eatery: Pub & Grill (Caesars Palace) and Steak (Paris Las Vegas). I was never able eat at his burger joint. If I ever went back to Vegas this burger joint was one of my destination. Well that day came this Tuesday\n\nIn another matter last week I ate at a San Francisco burger intuition Joe\'s Cable Car that had been opened for over 40 years, but closed it\'s doors for good last Sunday. My eating experience at Joe\'s Cable Car was comical because the burger was a rip off. I\'m a big fan of mom and pop eateries as long as they don\'t charge "big boy" prices. By charging those type of prices suggest their food is world class. If that\'s the case their food should be scrutinized. Is it unfair to compare a burger from a mom and pop versus a Michelin Star? From the outset yes, but if the prices are similar no. If I had to put a sport analogy it would be during the BCS college football era where mid major schools that were undefeated during the regular season would lobby to get into a BCS bowl game. Those teams who do get to play in a BCS bowl games better show up against their opponents otherwise they will get embarrassed and be ridiculed for their BCS birth. A great example is the 2008 Sugar Bowl where Hawaii, a mid major team, was blown out by Georgia. \n\nHowever going to Joe\'s Cable Car provided me a great reference what to order at Gordon Ramsay BurGR. There are a lot of different varieties of burgers at Gordon Ramsay BurGR, but I wanted a burger that was similar in style to Joe\'s Cable Car for comparison. In fact I ordered 3 items as I did at Joe\'s Cable Car: a burger, fries, and soft drink. At Gordon Ramsay BurGR I ordered an American Burger, a side of fries that included chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup, and a Pepsi. The American Burger was the closest thing I can find that was similar to the burger I ordered at Joe\'s Cable Car - a straightforward burger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions topped with American cheese. But that\'s where the similarities end between those two burgers. Even though I requested both burgers to be cooked medium rare the American Burger was moist and juicy while the burger at Joe\'s Cable Car was dry and pasty. I enjoyed every bite of this American Burger. All I got is one question. Joe how can a Brit make an American classic better than you? The dipping sauces of chipolte ketchup and curry ketchup were tangy and delicious for the fries. \n\nBut here\'s the kicker. The price I paid at Joe\'s Cable Car was about $26. The price I paid at Gordon Ramsay BurGR was about $24. While the burger at Joe\'s Cable Car was served in a plastic plate, the American Burger at Gordon Ramsay BurGR was served on an actual plate. \n\nNow you see why if a mom and pop place charges "big boy" prices they should be scrutinized? If you\'re to compare your eating establishment to Michelin Star\'s owned restaurant you better be Boise State and Hawaii. The burger eating experience at Joe\'s Cable Car and Gordon Ramsay BurGR was as if I was watching Hawaii vs Georgia in the Sugar Bowl - a total blowout where one team shouldn\'t have been on the same field.'

S'Let me preface this review by saying that I take eating pretty damn seriously, especially when I travel outside of my local area.  I "train" for the trip like any athlete would for a big game. I do weeks of research (no, seriously), read reviews, examine menus, even ask friends for feedback just to ensure I compile a more than awesome list of MUST EATS during my trip.\n\nAnyway, with the bevy of gastropubs and burger joints Vegas has to offer, Gordon Ramsay\'s BurGR wasn\'t even a speck on my radar.  GRB didn\'t pique my interest until a friend said they made their burgers with deckle-meat. Deckle-meat..the buttery, fatty, extra marbly outskirts of that delicious ribeye.GRB quickly made it to the top 3 on my hitlist. \n\nSo after having somewhat dieted all day -- told you I took these experiences seriously- I was more than prepared to sink my teeth into one of these burgers. \n\nThe restaurant itself isn\'t anything notable. Orange-themed and contemporary, down to the silverware. Service was fine, attentive and friendly. \n\nThe menu isn\'t so lengthy that you would need to spend 20 minutes deciding on an order, BUT all the options appeared so appetizing that it certainly took about 17 minutes to finally come to some decisions. My boo is very steak and potatoes, doesn\'t deviate much from culinary fundamentals.  He ordered the American burger, added bacon I believe.  Since I knew I would be able to steal a few bites, I got the fresh roasted chili dog. And yes, I did order this a bit for the shock value since I had seen yelp photos of this particular item. Our buddy got himself the farm burger which is something I would have ordered if I wasn\'t so interested in that hotdog. We also got regular and truffle parm fries.\n\nWe also got shakes. Man did we get shakes. If I were to pick only one item off this menu and nothing else, I would get a shake from here. i used to walk all the way to cosmo for a Holstein\'s shake but the GRB shakes are exponentially better. Like to the umpteenth power.  I got myself the coffee shake with hazelnut pudding, which I killed in literally 2 minutes. I couldn\'t keep my hands off it. It was a freakish newfound addiction. Our friend got the Oreo and creme brulee shake which was just as sinfully, almost painfully delicious. \n\nOur food came and the burgers were juicy, rich and what you would expect from the deckle claim. Although since it was thrown into ground beef, it didn\'t impart a noticeably different flavor.  Burgers were also on the smaller end of the spectrum especially given the higher price point.  My man enjoyed the hotdog more than I did. Other than the hotdog length far exceeding the bun, it wasn\'t memorable.   The truffle parm fries were piping hot and very generous on the toppings. Wish the fries were cut slightly thinner to lessen their density. \n\nOverall, we were quite satisfied with our meals.  I may even venture to say that I enjoyed it more than Holstein\'s.  Dang those shakes really got me.'

The beef burgers a nice smoky taste to then.\n-Decent selection of beers on tap, 15-20 beers.\n\nCONS:\n-Burgers don't come w/ fries\n-Burgers are kind of small.\n\nTIPS:\n-Long line if you don't come early.   We finished dinner early, sometime around 6:30.  Around this time there was a huge line outside."

S"I'm not giving this restaurant 3 stars for the quality of food because it was truly delicious! But the service was among the worst. I would highly recommend the jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers. They were phenomenal despite the fact that temperature-wise they were not very hot. What really irritated my husband and I was we each had an ice water & I a diet coke. They refilled our water once after aggressively waving down a server that wasn't even our waiter! My husband ordered a beer that he did not receive until after our appetizer and as our burgers were being served. We also were nearly finished with our burgers when the fries came. After we were finished, we wanted to order a shake. We waited nearly 20 minutes to get our servers attention. After all was said and done, it was a $75 meal for two I would have rather spent at Bachi Burger."

But also shows how awesome Four Peaks is. \n\nFirst off, the beer is fantastic. I love several of their brews, specifically the Peach Ale and Hop Knot. If there's a seasonal out at the time, try it. Even if it's not your style, you will appreciate how well crafted it is. \n\nThe food is never bad. Never. I've had pizza, beer bread, burgers, appetizers, and wings and they have never let me down. It's probably some of the best pub food I've ever had. The fries are to die for. If you want a great appetizer for a group, go for the spinach dip. I swear the dish it comes in never goes empty and I'm not really joking. I once ordered one as my dinner, quickly became full and offered some to about 12 friends and we only were able to finish half. \n\nThe place is insanely huge too. Lots of different areas to sit depending on your mood and all of them are great spots. I prefer the little covered patio area off to the side the best. \n\nIt's true the Four Peaks is always busy, but I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes to be seated, even with a group of 7. Their service has never suffered with a crowded house."

Anybody that personally knows me, knows that I'm one indecisive girl when it comes to food cause I wanna eat/sample everything. We were staying at Aria and they have Five/50 pizza bar there which I wanted to try, but I also wanted Secret pizza. Luckily, my bf was sweet enough to run to both places to buy slices and bring it back to the room at Aria for us :)\n\nNormally the line is crazy packed out the door, but luckily my bf didn't have to wait long. We ended up getting the white pizza w/ sausage and mushrooms. I was surprised the pizza was still nice and warm when he got back to the room. I was a bit scared at first because all the reviews kept saying it's super oily, but this definitely was NOT the case for us! Compared to Five/50 pizza in Aria, Secret Pizza was way better!!\n\nI've had really good pizza in NY and the pizza here was a NY style big slice (big, foldable, and not too much sauce). It held up the toppings and everything nicely. The crust had the perfect crunch and texture. They were also generous w/ the toppings here especially the sausage. I mean you can see the whole sausage link on my pizza. I really liked the cheese on here too, it didn't have the stinky cheese smell. The roasted garlic spread smothered on the white pizza was sooo robust and good!! The white pizza consisted of various cheeses as well, the ricotta stood out and tasted fresh.\n\nFYI: We came here once after clubbing and got lost trying to find it. No wonder it's called secret pizza lol.\n\n-It's located at the very top floor of cosmo (3rd) where all the fancy restaurants are.

Staff was really friendly and even suggested we get a pie instead of ordering slices as there was 4 of us (probably would have figured it out on our own but its nice to know they weren\'t trying to pinch us for every penny).\n\nDid I mention that it had that "aroma"? You know, the aroma of a genuine pizza place? If you are from New York, you know about the "aroma". I was sold the second I started walking down that entrance way.\n\nPizza was very good and the ingredients were quality. No joke, but some of the best tasting pepperoni I have ever had. We had a half white, half pepperoni pie.\n\nOnly downfall for me was that the middle of the pie got a bit soggy. Maybe it was the type of pie we ordered, I don\'t know.

You crave it.  You gotta have it.  Once you do, you\'re smiling and loving life.\n\nThat said Secret Pizza is more about the experience than food.  Decent New York style thin crust with a good balance of quality ingredients.  Tasty sausage, good quality cheeses, ripe acidic tomatoes.  Generous toppings but not overloaded.  Never too out there combos (ie,  CPK).  \n\nIs it the best pie in the US?  NO.  Not even the best in Vegas.  \n\nInexpensive for the Strip (less than $5 a slice).  You get to play the cool, adventurer as you seek out it\'s goodness (exactly what the Cosmo is all about).  The best part, you can take your slice and eat it while walking through the casino and watch the envious drool.  One of them might even ask you where you got it.  The answer is obvious, "it\'s a secret".\n\nSometimes, to experience the adventure is more important than the food.\n\nRecommended.'

I went to Vegas for work recently and arrived to the hotel at midnight after many delays and hadn\'t eaten dinner. I was able to run downstairs and get a piece of pizza in 15 minutes. This place is tucked away on the third floor across from Marquee - look for a long hallway with vintage record covers.\n\nI got a piece of the white pizza ($5) - obviously, no tomato sauce, and lots of cheese (almost too much cheese). There was a ton of mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and a garlic oil. There was a bit of a pool of garlicky oil on the top of my pizza, and I had to pick around some of the mozzarella cheese. I loved the NY crust - it was not soggy and was both crisp and chewy. If you\'re at the club and have found "someone special", you may want to avoid this white pizza since you\'ll have garlic breath for the rest of the night. The white pizza was great, and I was sober and hungry, so I\'m sure if you\'re inebriated, it will taste even more delicious. \n\nI came back the next day after going out and drinking a lot and got the Supreme pizza. It was good, but not as good as the White pizza.\n\nGreat for a late night slice of pizza after drinking, or when you need a quick bite to eat. They have a cooler of free water & cups so you can hydrate after a long night out.'

Well, since I read about this place on Yelp, I decided i had to try it.  We went down to the second floor and had to ask around a bit to figure out where it was, third floor, across from the pool table.  The hallway to enter is filled with old pictures, you gotta walk all the way down and be transported to a New York style pizzeria.  You can order the whole pie or by the slice with whatever they have that day.  I had the meat lovers while K had the pepperoni and mushroom.  The pizza is thin, can get a little greasy but oh so good.  Crunchy, salty, with the perfect blend between sauce, cheese and toppings.  This is what New York style thin pizza should be like.\n\nThe prices are ok, about $5-6 per slice, something you expect in Vegas but since it's open practically all day, great place for a snack.

S'This place really is a secret!\n\nApproaching my Vegas trip, a friend told me to check out this place in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  I don\'t know how he found out about it, but apparently this place had really good pizza and was hidden somewhere in the Cosmo.  Oh it was hidden all right.  When I jumped on the Cosmopolitan hotel website to find a list of their restaurants....no listing for this place.  Luckily I stumbled on it here on Yelp, listed as "Secret Pizza".\n\nI followed other reviewers\' directions and hints for finding the place: it\'s down a sorta-hidden hallway next to the pool tables on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.  We could smell pizzas in the oven once we got to the 3rd floor, so we knew we were in the right place.  Even in the hotel there was no mention of this pizza place and no signs pointing towards it.  Even the restaurant is unnamed!\n\nBut my friend was right, the pizza was delicious (although I think its novelty partially adds to the taste, haha)!  Crispy crust, fresh-tasting dough, and a delicious blend of cheese/sauce as topping!  I got the white pizza (feta and mozzerella cheeses instead of tomato sauce) with mushrooms on it.  I guess because mushrooms aren\'t a super popular topping, the chef just put raw mushrooms on a slice of white pizza before sending it through the oven to heat it up.  It\'s okay; still super good!!\n\nWhite pizza with mushrooms - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=RcmzA0Mj4T73Ytmdtj-ByQ#RcmzA0Mj4T73Ytmdtj-ByQ\n\nWe lucked out coming in at 2pm, which I guess isn\'t part of the lunch crowd, so there wasn\'t a line.

S"So, finding this place is really a fun adventure in itself.  I sort of like the mysterious theme, and the long walk down a record-cover filled hallway with the lingering smell of fresh pepperoni and mozzarella cheese wafting the whole way.\n\nWhen you do finally find it, you might notice that the prices are a little absurd for a slice of pizza.  And toppings make it even more.  If you're with a group, and none of you are particularly addicted to meat or veggies, I'd suggest just getting a full cheese pie.  Your wallet will thank you.\n\nApart from the high prices, the pizza itself is really something special.  I'm originally from the Philadelphia area where, next to cheese steaks and soft pretzels, it's the pizza that we pride ourselves on.  Even in Los Angeles where I live now, I have yet to find a truly comparable pizza place.  But Secret Pizza absolutely delivers on that expectation.  Maybe that's the secret afterall.  In any case, totally worth the price of the pie.  The individual slices are a little small, so I can't say with confidence that if you bought by-the-slice, you'd be satisfied.  But it's definitely a tasty, east-coast-style pizza.\n\nMy only other reservation is in regards to the seating area.  There isn't a lot of it.  And if you're not staying in the Cosmo and planning to take the pizza to your room or something, you might be hard-pressed to find a place to rest your bum."

S"Did you just gamble away your life savings on red?  Did  pull out a second mortgage for bottle service?  Did you make it rain on strippers? Have no fear! SECRET PIZZA IS HERE TO SAVE YOUR BUDGET!\n\nAmidst all the fancy-schmancy foods with huge price tags in Las Vegas, there are a couple of saviors and Secret PIzza is one of them.  Great food, great price.  If you're drunk I'm sure you'll enjoy it even more.\n\nIf you don't know where to find it, just look for a hole in the wall, literally, you'll see a wall with a hole leading to the hallway.  Or you can look for people eating pizza somewhere in Cosmo and ask them where they got it."

S"Maybe I stumbled upon a bad day here, but I was thoroughly unimpressed with Secret Pizza. After all the hype from my friends and seeing the huge line, I told myself it was worth it but was quite disappointed in the end.\n\nAfter a long night, a group of us decided to come here around 3 in the morning. We were faced with about an hour long wait among the crowd of drunk and hungry party-goers. The slices are all laid out and there's plenty of employees and ovens for them to fill. I still don't understand why the line is so ridiculously long.\n\nI ended up getting a slice of white pizza with mushrooms and sausage on it. Nothing extraordinary here. Cheap piece of dough, scattered pieces of meat, and barely any substance. Honestly, it tasted like it came out of a frozen pizza box you get at Grocery Outlet. I've had some amazing NY style pizza. I've even had out of this world vegetarian NY style pizza, which is rare for me. Secret Pizza just didn't cut it. \n\nWhat makes it worse is it's $5 a slice. I know Vegas can be expensive, but that's probably the most expensive slice of pizza I've ever had."

The slices are $5 and served ready to go on a paper plate and a checkered greasy wrapper thats going to slide off the plate as soon as you pick up your slice.  \n\nSecret pizza is ideal for stopping in, getting a slice and leaving, but it is also a comfortable place because its decorated with a lot of cool stuff.\n\nToo bad this place is in Vegas because my hometown L.A. has few and far i between spots a brotha can get a good pizza slice.'

Go to 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan hotel and find the free pool table. Look directly across from it and you'll see a long narrow hallway next to another restaurant.  It's at the end. I ordered 2 slices with mushrooms. Expensive but the slices are huge so it's worth it. 4.50 for a bottle of water tho? Anyway, not the best pizza but damn good. Just the right amount of grease and the cheese was not runny but it was gooey. Glad I went. I got there right when they opened at 11am and it wasn't crowded which is good bc it's tiny. Only has about 4 stools and standing room for a few more. Great pizza."

We have tried many different flavors including pepperoni, cheese, combo, pepperoni mushroom. They are all amazing. Combo is my favorite but i will take whatever they have ready.

I had a pepperoni and sausage pizza slice and another slice that had meatballs, sausage, green peppers, and olives.  The latter was recommended by one of the workers there.  The pepperoni and sausage pizza was ok.  The other slice didn't really have much taste.  I had an oily film-like taste on my tongue that I couldn't wash down with Coke, but went away after 45 minutes.  haha.\n\nThis place is designed to be like a small pizza joint with a couple TVs to watch sports.  They just had a few side tables with 5 barstools.  If it gets a little busy, you just have to find space and stand. \n\nThe only cool thing about this place was that it was hidden and had an interesting time finding this place.  Note, it didn't take long after asking the concierge.  =)\n\nAs a local, it wasn't worth going to the Strip just to go to this place.

Trust me, late nights this place is far from a secret as the line will stretch all the way from the counter down a really long hallway that's adorned with record covers. Naturally said line will be filled with drunken loud mouth assholes, ignore them and keep your eye on the prize and you shall me rewarded with greatness. \n\nThe service is kind of rude but I guess I would be bitchy too if I were dealing with stupid drunkards all night long. Anyways, they had Stone IPA on tap for $5, hell yeah! Now I can be a drunkard too with skunky IPA breath! Anyways you can order up huge slices of pizza from whats already on the counter or you can order a whole pie. We usually opt for the whole pie and adorn it with mozzarella, meatballs and fresh garlic, no sauce. It comes in a box, natch, but this box is super portable.. you can take your pizza to the area over by the conference rooms where there are tons of lounge spaces and not a soul around. \n\nMy gawd this pizza is amazing! The crust is perfectly chewy with just the right amount of crispiness along the edges. I love the stringy melted cheese and thick slabs of meatball in every bite.

It took me my 11th time to Vegas since I turned 21 to finally find this place (or at least really make an effort to go) and was so let down!  I'm generally not a fan of pizza but I can enjoy a slice every now and then.  When I got  that slice of the White Pizza (that everyone raves about), I wasn't impressed at all for the $5 that I just spent.  I love garlic and I love white sauce and I don't mind ricotta cheese, but it was just something about it that slice of pizza that was not my thing... the slice didn't even seem fresh and was barely warm.  :c\n\nIt definitely wasn't amazing pizza sober.

Best/worst idea ever was using my friends review for help, even though he gave an important clue, I was sent to the wrong floor, doh! \n\nI ordered the white cheese pizza slice, and my  wife ordered the mushroom slice.  Delicious cheese with feta and garlic that melted in my mouth on every bite.  The mushrooms on my wife's slice were very fresh; she added red pepper and parmesan cheese to complete her pizza bliss.  Pizza is thin and pretty decent size; with the cost of 5 dollars a slice or 25 for a whole pie(16 slices), this eatery is a broke drunkards dream.  We will definitely  be back for a whole pie to take on the road home, or have for dinner if we lost our butt at the tables.  \n\nIf you're in the Cosmopolitan casino leave there and go to the mall area.

My friend wasn't hungry but we both got 2 slices of pepperoni pizza anyway. We got our food pretty quickly. My friend thought the shaker he grabbed had parmesan cheese in it but it was actually garlic powder that he just dusted all over his pizza. I did the same thing but only because I like the taste of garlic. It was soooo gooood. The crust was perfectly crisp and not soggy. They're pretty generous with the toppings. It's about $5/slice but it's worth it.\n\nIt's a tiny place with a few chairs and by a few I mean about 4-5 chairs.

To find it, look for the hallway wrapped in vintage records.There was a small line that was forming when we walked up. This place is super small and had limited seats (bar stools and a long counter). You can order a whole pie of just a couple of slices. Minh D decided to indulge in his pizza craving and get a slice which he ended up sharing with me. All i can say is wow this pizza tasted wonderful and full of cheesy goodness!! Ashley ordered a rootbeer (which has unlimited refilled as long as you are eating there).

It's so secret that it's literally not even listed on their maps or signs at the Hotel.  There's no sign to the entrance.  It is right next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Restaurant and near Cosmo's Marquee Nightclub.  They open until like 4-5am usually.  Lines could be long, but this restaurant is a take-out place.  There's only a handful of bar-like stools where you can eat on a counter by a couple of old school game machines.  It's warm, loud, and crowded so I suggest you find a seat outside.  There's a complimentary pool table just in front of the entrance with seats around it.  Our family just ate our pizza there.\n\nWaited 45 minutes for a whole pie of pizza.  It is overpriced, but it was still satisfying.  We ordered half Pepperoni and Half Sausage and Mushroom and it costed about 30 dollars.  They sell liters of soda or beer too.  The pizza was good. I want to come back to try the white pizza slice for sure.  Nothing too special about this place other than the idea that it's a secret.

S'Great Pizza.  Slices are large and 5$.  The line can get absurd at night when the club (Marquee) starts to let out between 1-4am.  When I mean absurd, I mean like an hour wait to get to the register and order pre-made pizza.\n\nIf you go during off hours (not lunch, dinner or after hours) you can go right up and get a slice.  This is probably the best quick pizza you can grab on the strip.\n\nStay and play a round of pinball. ;)'

S'The pizza tastes much better than it looks (the pictures and even the look of the pizza when you order it does not do it justice).  From the pictures on Yelp and even up to the moment where I was standing in line ordering the pizza, I thought to myself, "meh."  \n\nKristin C. raved about the pizza while we were eating lunch at the Cosmopolitan and my boyfriend and I were a bit skeptical that pizza could be THAT good.  Well, we ate our words later that night.\n\nAfter catching a show at a neighboring casino, my boyfriend and I cabbed it to the Cosmopolitan to meet up with everyone who was at Marquee enjoying Kaskade.  Unfortunately, we never met up - but fortunately, I had a really good slice of pizza! The crust is chewy and the tomato sauce is flavorful. AND, the pizza is relatively cheap for Vegas/Cosmopolitan prices (around $3/slice of cheese).  While we were standing in line for pizza, a FIGHT broke out! That\'s how crazy good the pizza is.  Take my word for it.\n\nThe best part of enjoying the pizza? It\'s too small and cramped to eat inside the actual Pizzeria, so venture outside and people watch.  Not only was Kaskade djing at Marquee that night, but the Strokes had played a show at the Cosmopolitan.  My boyfriend and I played a fun game of "Marquee line reject or Strokes fan?"  Surprisingly not as easy as you think! Platinum blonde, short mini dress, stripper heels and CHEST TATTOO. Marquee line reject or Strokes fan??? YOU TELL ME!'

S"Possibly the best meatball pizza here in Vegas, I would go back just for another slice of it.  Not horrible price wise, but it's not dirt cheap either.  I had a slice of meat lovers pizza and a slice of the mushroom pizza (meh) and a root beer for $11.75, so you can ballpark it from there.  It's awesome quality pizza, with a thin yet crispy crust that actually holds up pretty well.  It's really standing room at counters only, but you can find a few stools to sit on, and it's cool that they have an old school pinball machine and an old video game machine too."

S"Man, oh, man. This is a hidden gem on the Vegas Strip. I found out about this place from a bellhop at a competing hotel - that's how I knew this place was gonna be good and not unreasonably priced! He told me that this place is so popular that the Aria made its own pizza place to compete, but it just can't compare. The place is cleverly hidden (almost like a speakeasy) and much more low key than the other the Vegas venues. I ordered the ricotta with sundried tomatoes and my boyfriend got the sausage and peppercini. The toppings are robust and the dough is amazing - full and crispy! It was just delicious from the tip to the crust. Moreover, the guy behind the counter is super friendly, and served our slices within minutes. He also didn't let me pay when I was trying to pay for our meal - that's how you could tell he's a real gentleman! He also told us that this place is only known through word of mouth, and it really does live up to its reputation!\n\nThere are also a couple of pinball machines, which make a nice touch to being just a pizzeria. Simple, inexpensive, friendly, fast, and delicious - they've ticked all my boxes! Also, beware - we've been told that the line goes out the door during the after-hours bar/club rush."

S'Seriously, some of the best pizza I\'ve ever had... and I had to go all the way to Las Vegas to get it! Sure, I\'m here in NYC where supposedly there\'s lots of good pizza, but so far, nothing comes close to what I had at the Pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Resort. This place is hidden in between a few other restaurants in a shopping & dining area attached to the hotel-- there are no signs, so if you can\'t locate it, ask around. You won\'t be sorry. \n\nSo what made this pizza so awesome? Well, first off, the crust was just right-- not too crunchy and not too soft... the pizza sauce was perfect and seasoned just right... and the cheese and toppings were fresh and tasty. On two different visits last week, I had a couple of difference slices-- I tried both the pepperoni and meatball. The 2nd time I had them add ricotta to my meatball slice... and all I can say is, "Amazing!"'

It opens up a little bit into the shop that has counters along the walls and a pin ball machine. \nPizza: they have NY style or Sicilian. I have always gone for classic NY. Pies are out on display and cost around $4-5 per slice. Once you select, they toss it in the oven to heat and crisp it then serve it on lined paper plates. Beer is on tap as well as sodas and water.

Hidden away on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, completely unmarked, down a long photo covered hallway, Secret Pizza is a heavenly find.  Here, you can buy full pizzas or slices.  Since we were just having lunch, my friend and I both ordered slices and a soda.  Choosing from the options on hand, I got two slices of meatball and ricotta.  They were AMAZING!  Thin, perfectly crispy crust, with ample portions of sliced meatball and ricotta blotches, and just the right amount of sauce in between.  Make your selection and the guy behind the counter cuts your slice and places it in the oven to reheat and crisp up, giving you a beautifully hot, melty slice of pizza goodness!'

There is a long line, but its worth the wait because the pizza is sooo damn good! The pizza reminds me a of a new york pizza. Its big, thing and the crust is super crispy. Its about 3-4 dollars a slice and my oh my it is totally worth EVERY Penny! I got the pepperoni and meatball pizza, and a peppericni, bell pepper, and turkey?? slice. They were all delicious! And on top of that, I was short 50 cents on cash and the guy was nice enough to just give me the two slices for 9 dollars. THat is really good customer service :)'

The crust was thin and was super crunchy, which I enjoyed very much!\n\nThe combo was good although my crust was already soggy. BOO! \n\nThe slices were filling, but you may just wait to share a pie with someone else. There are only a handful of chairs, a couple of video games and a couple of standing tables. You can bring your slices out to the lobby area to eat, as many people did. \n\nDon't forget to check out the pics along the walls! Interesting!!!"

S"To me this place is the best hidden pizza joint on the strip. What do I mean about that?\n\nFirst off, my friend and I walked all of the first floor and second floors and back in the first floor but no sign of this place. We even saw some dude that ran inside the casino with a box of pizza, we wanted to ask but the guy was to fast through the exit doors, we just missed em'  I had to ask a Cosmo casino security directions to this place. This is what to remember take the elevator to the third floor, make a right from the elevator, there you will see a small hall way full of photos, finally the hidden gem. \n\nYou have choices of a full pie or slices: $5 slices? Expensive but your in the Cosmo but hey they back it up with some bomb-ass pizzas. What I saw is that they have some pizzas ready in the kitchen, the choices: white, plain cheese, pepperoni, meat lovers, and supreme you choose a slice then they reheat it for you or you can order by request and customize it made fresh, which there is a pizza guy who makes pies in front of you, and to top it off they offer free re-fills on soda purchases.\n\nThe first visit my choice was the meat lovers, not as dry, but the flavor still holds up. Same thing goes on my second visit still flavorful and all I had was a white cheesed pizza. Their pizza dough ain't old, and stale that leaves it bland like other joints but it's so opposite of that. It's NY style pizzas here that makes you wanting more.\n\nThis is the first place that I've used garlic powder for pizzas which is provided on the counter along with crushed peppers and Parmesan. \nI've learned that the garlic powder adds taste and seasoning to an already awesome pie, it compliments it and thanks to this place Ive learned something new.\n\nThis joint is small, only two chairs inside , you might want to hangout where there is a pool table outside  if its not crowded theres a few sofas to get comfy. I found that if your coming from the second floor just take the escalator to the third floor go straight left were you see a small hallway of portraits. Very hidden I must say, no signs here, but worth finding.\n\nIf your just coming out of a club and your wanting to wash away the drunkeness, I recommend this place this pizzeria will be that anti-hangover."

This place is not very good and not worth the high price for a burger. \n\nI don't mind paying more for a burger just because of a gimmick or because the place is in a nice hotel on the strip.

Usually, I clean my fries up. I left half of them. \n\nAnother person in my party got the sliders. They were pretty bland as well. The buffalo one was interesting. \n\nI feel like they have too many unique offerings and not enough made to order selections. Give the vegetarian, buffalo, Kobe beef, lobster, lamb, and other unique selections their own page or section. When you take all of those out, they really only have three made to order burgers. The classic, peppercorn and one other. \n \nThe Create your own features too many options and could also get expensive. Also, you risk your customer not being satisfied by a bad combination of toppings. I would also recommend they come up with a signature sauce and push it. \n\nThey need more, interesting made to order options. Or more interactive servers that guide you through the menu. Ours was nice but not helpful. \n\nWe got a trio of ice cream/mousse desserts that were not great either.

My bf & I decided to try out burger bar because of the great ratings, but was disappointed\n\nWe got to the restaurant and placed our order there to bring back to the room. I decided to do a custom burger with just kobe beef patty on a ciabatta bun with lettuce tomato and red onions. Also got sweet potato fries \'cause what\'s a burger w/out fries?!\n\nHonestly, the fries were better than the burger. I remember finishing the whole box of sweet potato fries. They weren\'t too oily and were crispy. The burger was such a shame. Patty was overcooked and it\'s "Kobe" Sure didn\'t taste like kobe beef though. It was so dry and lacked the fatty flavor that I normally get from Kobe burgers at most restaurants. In addition, there were no juices coming out from the patty, that\'s how dry it was.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get a real burger at Gordon Ramsay\'s BurGR'

S"Unlike most of the places I review on this blog, Burger Bar is a place I can write a review on based strictly on memory. Still, given the opportunity a few days ago to stop in there for lunch I didn't hesitate. Besides, I didn't have any quality pictures to post until that point.  Because I've been here so many times I was almost nervous that I would give this restaurant preferential treatment, but since I've been taking a way more analytical approach to my burgers lately I found that Burger Bar wasn't quite the perfection I remembered it.  But it was still close.\n\nLocated in the elusive Mandalay Place shopping area connecting Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, Burger Bar is placed amongst overly expensive clothing stores, men's shaving boutiques and some other more touristy shops of late. The restaurant has been there for quite a few years now and is maybe looking slightly dated, but it's still a good atmosphere. It's very open pretty much anywhere you sit, even in the booths, so don't go there if you're looking for a decent amount of privacy. Also if you're going on the weekend, or even potentially during a weekday lunch, expect a wait or try the bar.\n\nOther than a small selection of slightly overpriced burgers, the menu is pretty much do-it-yourself. You have your choice of meats; Angus, country natural, Kobe and buffalo, along with chicken, salmon turkey and veggie if you're into that sort of thing. While the Kobe is totally delicious, I find it to be a bit expensive and have been completely happy ordering the Angus. But more on that shortly. Once you've chosen your meats, you have a very long list of choices for veggies, cheeses, meats, sauces and plenty of other fancy things. I've had quite a few different burgers over the years, and all of the toppings have been great.\n\nFor this particular meal I went with the Angus, Swiss cheese, and mushrooms on a sesame bun. Fairly simple, but that's fine because the meat always stands out as a great flavor on its own. One of the biggest things I can say about this restaurant is that however you order your burger it will always come out that way. Consistency is key, and they never disappoint. I ordered medium-rare, and it's as pink as it could be. And like I said, the meat really has great flavor, so whether you have a ton of toppings or almost none, you're guaranteed a great burger. After eating a lot of others around town lately, I could say that this burger might be lacking a bit of seasoning now, almost as if the burger is outdated like the restaurant. Still it is fantastic and won't disappoint.\n\nThe various buns I have had are always good, no matter which one you get there seems to be a proper meat to bun ratio. The mushrooms were flavorful, and just the right amount. My cheese was melted as always, the lettuce and tomato on the plate were also very fresh. I haven't always been a fan of pickles in the past, but they're growing on me with all these burger meals so now it's a welcome sight on my plate.\n\nThe fries are the one slight weak spot in this meal; my skinny fries were just ok, a bit too generic for such a fancy menu. The sweet potato fries have been really good in the past, especially with some ranch, although it's been a while since I've had them. I'm not always a fan of fat fries, but they're a little better here so you might want to try them when visiting.\n\nMy burger, fries and drink came to almost $19; I would consider that a bit on the high side if it wasn't in a very touristy spot on the strip. I'm not always too happy about spending that much on a burger meal anywhere, but compared to Bradley Ogden or even BLT this is a huge value for the same price. This place is still one of my favorite choices in town based on the burger alone, so do yourself a favor and check it out."

The fries, rings and fried pickles are always tasty.\n\nYou can build you own burger basically, so the bill can added up if you do not watch. For a burger, fries and a soda it is usually around $20, so be prepared when you sit down. \n\nConsidering that everyone else in town for a convention eats at Border Grill or Red, White and Blue it is worth the walk to Burger Bar because you can sit down right away usually."

S'My burger of choice is alway build your own. I usually just get standard angus medium with chipotle aioli and either prosciutto or jalapeno bacon with fat fries with a side chipotle aioli to dip. So good!! I alway want desert but too full when done. They also have a good beer selection with some hard to find hefeweisens \n\nThe burgers are definately 5 stars and the value is very good. You get to truly customize your burgers and it is hard to decide without the usual set options. \nThe service and seating are really bad though at times. Our waitress went on break at some point during our meal and could not get refils or our check without flagging down people. The seating was also bad because if you were a duo you werent allowed to sit in a booth. so, we had to sit at small table in the middle of the narrow aisles in the way of everything.\n\nI have been here a lot now and I feel it is the best burger in town. Still the service is sporadic.'

S"ok, just love the burger bar.  its a fancy/expensive burger joint, but the food and atmosphere are awesome.  see you start with the standard burger and then can add any type of topping you can think of.  fried eggs, avocado, lobster.  anything goes.  they also have preset exotic burgers done.  i had the surf & turf burger, nothing like a huge meat patty topped with lobster tails.   just fantastic.  even their standard burger is good.  they also have a huge selection of draft beers here.  and the best part is the little lcd tv's that are in each both.  gotta love that extra special touch."

Ask for a booth, as they all have TVs in them and so you can eat and watch the game or something while you eat a perfectly crafted burger that you have chosen from start to finish. There are so many choices that its like the Starbucks of burgers. Of course they have their flashy menu items, but also they have great classics done right, order bacon on your burger and you'll understand why!! The service is nothing spectacular however friendly and to the point. I really would recommend this place when your craving a burger!!!"

Went for lunch today so no wait which was nice. \n\nMy brother and i both had the rossini burger which was kobe style wagyu beef from australia, seared foie, fresh pepper & salt, a rich brown sauce, and truffles on an onion bun. My favorite thing to eat is burgers and this is on my top 2 list with the blue cheese burger @ bubba burgers in hawaii.\n\nFoie gras and truffles = an exp\xc3\xa9rience in itself, i could eat both of these things 3 meals a day and die a very happy man\n\nSkinny fries perfectly cooked and seasoned\n\nOnion rings with ranch = say no more\n\nMac & Cheese + fryer = duh, amazing\n\nBeers on their list for days, bottles and draft, had a pitcher of an IPA today, great pick with a burger.\n\nService was good, not great, but i had the burger so didn't need anything else\n\nDef going back soon."

We had it on the onion bun and liked our combo. Also, the veggie burger was only $9 (unlike some of the $22-24 burgers in some reviews here). \n\nWe did try the sweet potato fried and definitely lived up to its hype. We also indulged with a Nutella milkshake but with vanilla icecream (it comes with chocolate icecream otherwise) and liked it lots. \n\nI'd say if in the area, try it out. Not something to make a trip for though."

S"Disappointing.  I have been wanting to try this place since I first moved to Vegas several years ago.  If a burger is truly outstanding, then I would be OK spending $30 for it.  I know it is possible, I have had great burgers before, but this fell quite short.\nService was friendly and attentive, though they seemed to be in a hurry for us to leave, though the tables were half empty and it was midday.\nI opted for the Dry Aged Angus, which was a slightly more expensive option.  I chose cheese, caramelized onions and the red wine reduction with shallots.  I was surprised to find the burger to be quite under-seasoned.  The burger itself was good, but was missing that charred beef flavor your get from a great burger.  Though it wasn't dry, it wasn't juicy, either.  I would have expected a beef mix with enough fat to have flavor and keep it from being dry.\nThe skinny fried were OK."

S"Not going to lie, I was a little tempted to order this $60 Rossini burger that was on the menu just to say that I've had it. Unfortunately, it sounded too heavy before a night out on the town and drinking, so I opted out.\n\nThis is located in the strip mall at Mandalay Bay. I've walked by several times, but had never been in. While you're waiting, they have a free photobooth outside to take some photos. You can either social media tag them or e-mail to yourself. Cool little perk and makes the time go by faster before you're seated. I'm sure there are some great photos as the drunks come rolling through.\n\nA full bar is available and they have a ton of beers to choose from and there are various televisions on different sporting events if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nWhat I tried:\nI created my own burger with the Australian Kobe beef with a ciabatta bun, spinach, swiss, fried egg, tomato, and chipotle aioli. This was served with skinny fries that were thin and crispy, just the way I like 'em. The burger itself wasn't everything that I had hoped for. As you know, I feel like I suck when it comes to building my own masterpieces, so I usually opt out. I should have stuck to my own habits and done so again.\n\nI don't think that the spinach necessarily worked on the burger. It was saut\xc3\xa9ed but really watery making the rest of the burger super moist. I order the meat cooked medium and the combo of spinach and medium meat juices didn't really blend well. To be perfectly honest, I couldn't tell that the beef was that much better than the normal patties that my friends had in their sliders. Next time I will opt for the black angus beef and save myself $8. But at least I can say that I tried it.\n\nI snuck some onion rings off of my friend's plate. They were pretty damn delicious. The onion was sweet inside and the outside was crispy and airy. They stayed crispy throughout the whole meal and I was tempted to order a second round. I was too stuffed, and that weird burger combo kinda gave me a stomach ache. Again, not their fault, I chose the flavors.\n\nService was good and everything came out fast. Our server was patient with some of my drunk table mates- I'm sure they get a lot of the crazy banter all the time.\n\nI wish I would have tried one of their desserts. They have a good variety of shakes (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and something called a chocolate burger.\n\nI would come back and try one of their other burgers and will sub for a side of onion rings. This place is more expensive than a typical restaurant, but it's expected since it's inside a hotel on the strip. Live a little."

Give it a try :P\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#bf50r1MXyZaFeASlyngAiA\n\nAngus on Ciabatta, Foie Gras, Truffle Mayo, Black Perigord Truffle Sauce! My best combination and burger to date!!\n\nI usually spend the money on Angus here, because even their most basic burger trumps the other guys in town.  I've had their Waygu here, but it is NOT necessary, and I'd rather spend that extra $7-8 towards the Foie Gras personally!\n\nThe Foie Gras melts in your mouth, and is like butter on top of your burger!  The truffle mayo is perfection on top of everything and blends perfection in each bite.  The Black Perigord Truffle Sauce was very subtle, but it adds to the moisture in the bread.  You could skip this last element if you need to, but make sure you have the other options!\n\nAnd the ciabatta is the perfect bread to absorb those medium rare juices...staying firm and keeping your hands clean, even with all those juices hitting the plate.\n\nAnd don't forget to finish with a Nutella Shake!  One of the best things you'll eat if you are a nutella fan!"

Add to the fact that he's known for his french and haute cuisine - means he shouldn't know that much about burgers.\n\nNot bad, but not worth the price.

But this place has burger in it's name so I expected way more.  \n\nThe description of their food sound so good when you read it on the menu but when it comes out, displays no appealing presentation whatsoever.  It's literally just the bun with meat in the middle.  They even make the fries sound awesome but they come out looking worse than Mcd's fries.

S'Is it a crime to love a simple "charcoal grilled" smoke-laden burger... served rare to med. rare? I\'ve done many trade shows at the Mandalay, and have eaten at BB more than a few times. The fact that I walked out each time thinking....... "Thank goodness this is a business expense and not an out-of-pocket expense..." pretty much sums it up for me. \n\nWhy can\'t a "no-name" chef just set up a Weber in one of the parking lots, and crank out a great old American Cheese Burger!? Hell, I don\'t need fancy add-ons. Just great beef, great chedder, fresh tomato and head lettuce, fresh or carmelized onions, and I\'ll promise not to critique the menu prices. Chances of that happening soon? Not good I\'m afraid.\n\nI don\'t want to "choose my adds." Fuddrucker\'s intro\'d that years ago. I figure that if a burger restaurant has a great burger, they\'ll know better than I what options work. Give me a few finished-sandwich choices, including a Frisco Burger, and I\'m good to go.'

S"Hubert Keller does it right with his unique burger bar. I always enjoyed watching Hubert's cooking show where he would introduce an eclectic mix of ingredients to spice up the good old America stable of hamburgers. \n\nYou can definitely taste the quality of the meat that is used to prepare the burgers. I had asked for a medium rare burger and it came out perfectly with warm pink center just enough to keep the meat flavorful and juicy. The Ciabatta bread certainly gives the burger a more elegant look from the old sesame buns and offers a much more full-bodied texture to the burger. My girlfriend had the Kobe beef burger and didn't enjoy it as much as she wanted to. I think it had to do with the fact that she asked for a medium well burger. \n\nThe sweet potato fries were also a nice addition to our meal and added a hint of sweetness to every bite of my burger. \n\nConclusion - Although the prices are a bit steep for a burger, I applaud Hubert for his colorful rendition of the classic American burger and will definitely visit again on my next trip to Vegas."

Points for their beer selection, quick seating and their fries- crisp, nicely seasoned with your choice of dipping sauce. You can't go wrong with their aioli."

S'It is an Hubert Keller restaurant in the mall next to Mandalay Bay (you can access from the inside of the hotel).  He has several other restaurants there but this one was more casual and sounded delicious after a night out.  Their Nutella milkshake is AHHH-mazing!  No really.  Their burgers are quite tasty and plentiful and I really recommend the fat (steak) fries and the sweet potato fries.  And the pesto aioli?! MMMMM MMMMMMMM good!'

S"2 stars: Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nNothing is as polarizing as the simple hamburger.\n\nThere's so many different arguments that can be made as to what makes the best burger. \n\nSimple and cheap at some stand that's been around since the turn of the century? Gourmet and requiring a credit application to order at a celebrity chef's latest brainchild? \nAnd every single combination and permutation in between. \n\nHubert Keller is kind of accomplished in the same way one would say Matisse was a good painter, or Larry Bird was a good shot with a basketball. \n\nWith that kind of resume, comes a certain amount of pressure to perform. \n\nAnd that's my fundamental issue with Burger Bar.\n\nIt's been around for a while now, and it's definitely on its way down.\n\nI've been here more than a few times, and after the novelty of the Rossini burger wore off, including texting pictures of the receipt to prove my street cred, and the novelty of making a few custom burgers - ooh, i can choose from different grades of meat, that are all pretty good, and don't really make a substantial difference once ground up and seasoned, to 99.97% of eaters,  this place strikes me as a big buck version of Fuddruckers that happens to have a celebrity chef endorsement. \n\nSeriously. Think about it. \n\nThey both offer hamburgers with different grades of beef. \nThey both offer burgers with different types of meat.\nThey both offer customized toppings.\nThey both offer multiple types of fries.\nThey both have milkshakes and floats.\nThey both serve beer.\nThey both cost more than in & out. \n\nThe last 2-3 times I went to Burger Bar, the service has been mediocre and delivered with absentee-level attention. \n\nThe food has been inconsistent as well, and what kind of irked me the most recent time was that I created a spicy burger, and when I told the waitress that there weren't enough jalapeno's, she brought me a thimble sized cup with more sliced peppers, and I found an extra charge for them on my bill. \n\nSeriously? \n\nYou're charging $14 bucks for a burger and you want to put another $0.85 cents on my tab because I mentioned that the burger didn't have enough jalapenos on it when it came out of the kitchen? \n\nSome nerve. \n\nThere are so many other burger spots and so many other celebrity chefs in Vegas with burger spots that this place is completely irrelevant at this point. \n\nUnless you are here to try the Rossini on an expense account meal, don't bother."

S'The fries were fabulous, but the main attraction, the burger, was just okay. I ordered the black jack burger with black angus beef cooked medium, pepper jack, an olive tapenade, and ciabatta roll. The beef could have used a little more salt as it was lacking flavor. The burger was expertly cooked, however. The Vegas strip tourist pricing coupled with the lackluster burger will probably keep me from coming back.'

Anyway, I got that on a ciabatta bun with avocado, mushrooms, bleu cheese and baby spinach. AMAZING!  The only bummer was that they had a fire in the kitchen the night before so the fryer wasn't working and we couldn't get any fries. But we did get a side salad instead which was good.  I highly recommend this place, just be prepared to wait because it is VERY popular (we had to wait about an hour)."

S'Came here on my quest for foie gras. According to yelp, this is one of the most affordable places to find foie on the strip. \n\nWe walked up at 8pm on a Tuesday and found that it was a 45 minute wait for a table. However their bar seating goes all the way to the back of the restaurant (pretty long) and we were able to find seats at the end of the bar. \n\nWe ordered \n\nFried pepper jack "shots"/ breaded cheese balls that are breaded and fried. They were crisp and the cheese inside was soft but not too oozy. The flavor was solid but towards the end of the dish it became apparent that it was just cheese. I love cheese so for me that was a plus, but be prepared for a lack of flavor development. \n\n"Naturesource" (I think free range) Patty, onion bun, carmelized onions, foie gras/ the foie gras add on was an extra $13, making this burger run around $26. I was splitting with my husband and they split the plates without us asking but then also charged us a $2 split plate fee. \n\nThe foie gras was about a third of a full one, which for $13 isn\'t bad. I actually removed it from my burger so I could taste it on its own. The patty was too thick for the foie.. I would recommend adding the truffle sauce ($5) as this dish was a little on the dry side without. The onions were carmelized beautyfully, and the patty was perfectly cooked.\n\nI would return.'

S"During our entire trip to Las Vegas, we wanted a burger, and we were longing for a nice, cold, tasty beer. \n\nLas Vegas is not only a desert environmentally, but in terms of quality, there is a sore lack of good beers, good wine, good whiskey, and good food at reasonable prices.  In terms if beer, it was quite difficult to find anything other than the usual swill.  In fact, this is the only place we managed to find a nice selection of beers - and they weren't $10 each either.\n\nWe were told at the entrance that we would need to wait 30-45 minutes, so we sat down at the bar and managed to find a few beers we hadn't tried before.  One was a Black IPA from Stone Brewing Co. and my wife had something else, I think it was European and smooth.  We talked about beer with the bartender and a fellow sitting by us and the bartender offered us what's called the Deschutes Black Butte XX, a variation on their Black Butte Porter, but much better.   We thought about the offer and decided we would wait until we got our burgers.  \n\nIn the meantime, we continued to talk about beer and convinced the fellow next to us to try his first IPA - Dogfish Head 90 minute (they were out of the 60 minute).   I'm not sure what he thought about it, but he certainly agreed it was strong and hoppy.\n\nThe wait didn't seem to long, and we eventually sat down at a table and started to wait for our burgers to arrive.  We ordered their buffalo burger and their American Classic (basically a bacon cheeseburger).  I asked if the waitress if they made their own meat, and indeed they did.\n\nThe burgers were among the best we have had.  Juicy, tasty, well cooked, no fillers, quality meat.  During our feast - these burgers were big - the Black Butte XX arrived which made our  meal even more delicious.    \n\nIf the burgers weren't enough, we decided to have dessert, well I decided, because my wife was quite full, but the dessert burgers looked good.  My wife's burger was marginal, but I had a delicious burger that was basically some fruit, whipped cream, and donuts for the buns.  \n\nIn any case, when I return next year, which will be for DEFCON, I will have top my visit off with a trip to Burger Bar.  You can go to some big expensive, overpriced restaurant with a chance that you'll actually get something of quality, and I'll go to Burger Bar."

S"This was my first time to Burger Bar and only knew of this place from Yelp and ironically, friends from out of town. Most of my Yelp buds gave Burger Bar good ratings, so I knew a meat feast was inevitable.   Shawn H. put out a UYE for Burger Bar and I took advantage of this opportunity. Keep in mind that Burger Bar is located inside Mandalay Bay.  Most restaurants tend to cost a little more in a casino on the strip.  But at Burger Bar, prices are fairly cheap considering its location.  Burger Bar has a huge selection and you can also create your own burger.  These are all great call outs for a burger joint. But first things first, I need to point out is that this visit was during Lent in which red meat is currently being sidelined. Second, I don't drink much.  So, my review might not be a fair one at the moment because I am not reviewing Burger Bar for what they are known for, which is a burger and a bar.  \n\nThis visit and rating is for their service and their Salmon Burger. The Salmon Burger is huge at a half pound and prepared medium well. Price is about $10 which is a good start. However, I felt that taste was lacking and the salmon patty was dry. I know salmon isn't flavorful in the first place, but I have had tasty salmon burgers at other restaurants (ie. Halphen Red in San Diego).  Since I was eating 8 oz of this stuff, I at least got about 40 grams of protein and Omega 3's.  In all, I was disappointed with my salmon burger. \n\nThe service is pretty good considering that our party was fairly big.  Burger Bar is very accommodating and the staff is excellent.  You can say that the service almost cancelled out the poor taste of the salmon burger.  I have not given up on Burger Bar. I still have their real burgers to try and based on what other Yelpers have stated already, this is what they are known for. \n\nPS:  This was a Shawn H's UYE.  I had a great time with other Yelp friends.  Thanks again Shawn for putting this together."

S'Continuing my Tour de Burgers, I went to Burger Bar twice in two days.  This, however, was not the record among me and my friends.  Two of my friends, went 4 times in 4 days - one had the chicken sandwich, turkey burger, angus burger and a dessert burger and another had a Kobe burger, two angus burgers and a dessert burger.  All bow down to Uvan and Steve!\n\nWell, as far as my experience goes, I will have to say Burger Bar has really good quality burgers.  I had the Kobe burger, rare, no toppings on the plain bun and the angus burger, med. rare, no toppings on the plain bun.  Each time, the burger was cooked exactly as ordered (cool and red in the middle for rare, pink throughout for med. rare).  The bun was exceptional.  It was slightly crunchy but soft and was perfect to absorb the meat juices (which there were plenty).  The size of the patty was perfect as well - not too small, not too big, abouth an inch tall - I\'d say it was around 7 oz.\n\nAlthough I don\'t notice this at most places, I will say, each burger could have used more salt.  I don\'t think the meat is pre-salted before it\'s ground and very little appears to be put on before it\'s cooked.  But, just a sprinkle of salt really helped the flavor.  \n\nLots of people rave about the Kobe, but I wasn\'t too thrilled.  For one, the texture was too soft.  (I know, I got it rare, it\'s supposed to be soft.  Well, that\'s true.)  But the texture of the meat was soft.  Also, the angus beef had a much more "beefy" flavor than expected.  For the price, I\'m getting the angus burger from now on.  \n\nThe sides?  Well, the zucchini fries are great.  Whether they\'re frozen or not, I don\'t care.  They are good.  The onion rings are thick with a heavy coating and good.  The fries are fine.  The beer list is very good with well over 20 selections.    TVs for each booth - reason to linger and drink.  Oh, and no corkage fee but terrible wine glasses.  Service is spotty, but really dependent on who\'s your waiter/waitress.\n\nOverall - one really great place to grab a great burger and some drinks.  \n\nWine I brought and had with the Kobe beef burger: 2003 Miura Garys\' Vineyard.  Deep purple color, smooth rich texture, firm acidity, bright plum flavor with leather and earth.  Much more rustic than the Pisoni Vineyard bottling I\'ve had from Miura.  Tasted better after 6 hours, likely because of bottle shock on the drive up.  Much more smooth, less leather and earth and more bright, sweeter plum and fruit notes.'

S'My husband and I had dinner here 2 nights ago. I got the buffalo burger and my husband got the nature source beef burger. The meat was good. We got it well done and the meat is still juice. My husband also got the pretzel bun and he liked it. I had the plain bun and it was good in a way that it is not the soggy kind. I asked for no pepper and no seasoning on my buffalo meat and they were able to accommodate that. I like my meat plain, that is just how I prefer. I usually feel that seasoned meat doesn\'t taste good as it masked the real meat taste.\n\nThe only thing we didn\'t like as much was the shake. We shared the salted caramel and it really tasted salty. I know we should have expected that it is salty but didn\'t anticipate that it would be salty enough to make me feel thirsty! It was like after eating msg! The shake does have a secret sauce called " Fleur de sel" in it and I don\'t know if that sauce contain any msg or fermented soy as my throat was terribly dehydrated and very thirsty after the shake. The toffee syrup in the shake for sure contributed to its saltiness too. After we went home, I had to eat an avocado and a plum which were high in potassium to counteract the trauma. I usually eat high potassium food as a remedy if I accidentally eat food with msg or high sodium. So if you can\'t handle sodium well, don\'t order the salted caramel shake, try another flavor instead.\n\nThe burgers were satisfactory but it is not a "wow" yet so we can only give 3 stars here. Especially when we know another burger place serving naturesource beef meat as well, and they can accommodate no seasoning and I think that this other place grills the meat better too. Burger Bar is very pricey too when considering the size of the meat they offer on the burger, so one time try at Burger Bar is enough for us. It is not the place for us to go back again if we have a crave for burger or shake in the future, there are better options in town.'

S"Oh vey the Burger Bar. My dad came to visit me in Vegas, and he really wanted to go to the Burger Bar. We definetly couldn't afford the burger with the kobe and foie gras and truffles. But we both tried a Kobe Beef burger. I was amazed by the variety of toppings you could add to your burger ranging from dairy to culinary delicacies. I had the Kobe Beef burger with Cinnamon Bacon, and Swiss Cheese. It was delicous the Kobe Beef just melted in my mouth as I heard Kobe Beef is supposed to do. I also had a Black and White Milkshake which was fantastic, and they give you the rest of the can. Overall, a most go for any burger lover. The atmosphere was definetly not the fine dining I was expecting at Mandalay Bay, it was more like a wild west saloon.\n\nSide Note: I discovered the reason the Kobe Beef burger is so popular is because the farm treats the cows in a humane way, and feeds them beer to make the meat more tender. The whole feeding beer to a cow makes me wonder if the cows are drunk all the time. But I digress."

Decided on the Kobe with cheddar and all the fix ins. Gf had the black angus beef w/jalapeno bacon, cheese, shared fries and had a beer. Bartender recommended an IPA for me (delicious, creamy not too heavy and potent). I am coming to the realization that I am not a huge Kobe fan but for some reason I keep trying. Fries came first, average steak fries with Good ranch. Burgers came and mine was okay. GF's burger was awesome. Perfectly cooked-med-but it was the jalapeno bacon that made the meal.

S'Two Words: Jalapeno Bacon!\nInspiring and begging to be replicated. \n\nOtherwise, The Burger Bar makes a good standard burger. I was surprised they actually have barely any pre-concocted burgers, but actually base their menu on build-your-own burgers, which I didn\'t like. I want what the "house specialty" is, but wasn\'t impressed by their list of standbys. Also, by making all the toppings ala carte, you can really inflate your check. \n\nI ordered the organic beef burger, which after cooked to my preference of medium well it could have been from a Kroger beef log and I wouldn\'t have known. So, it wasn\'t amazing beef. After my losing streak downtown the night before, no Kobe for me! Like I mentioned, the highlight of the sandwich was the jalapeno bacon where they cure the bacon in pickled jalapeno juice according the the waitress. The fried egg was cooked over medium when it was stated over easy. Bummer. Ala carte Sweet potato fries can be passed on. When one of my table mates ordered cheese fries, they actually just melt 3 slices of cheese onto your fries and then charge you for each slice of cheese. Hilarious!!! Fat Tire on tap made the boys happy. Iced tea was fresh and refreshing!\n\nI liked the rock decor and rock themed wait staff. Our service was good. By Monday at 12:30 There was already a wait so, you know it\'s popular. I\'d definitely be back if I\'m down at the South end of the Strip or staying at Mandalay, but I\'m not making a special trip out. I mean, it\'s just burgers.'

Ate here with Jim C. and my wife and spent over $75 for 3 burgers.  Wacky.  Thank God were on the company expense account...  \n\nFor a $12 burger, I love RESTO in NYC (see: ).

S'A total waste of a cab ride. Thankfully we didn\'t have to wait in the 45 minute+ line that seems to always be here. But it was really pretty average. Better than a Carl\'s Junior $6 burger but far below a decent back yard BBQ. The boyfriend and I shared a buffalo burger and sweet potato fries. It was ok, nothing special. No special seasonings or expert cooking or fine meat. No one at our table of 6 said "wow that is a tasty burger" well one person did but she eats everything and it was her idea to come here. And even she mentioned a back yard burger would have been better. I generally go to restaurants because they cook better than me. So for the cost of our burger I think I will buy some Worcestershire sauce, a package of ground beef and have a little something left over to make up for the cab fare we wasted coming to this place.'

S'Not gonna lie, was a little underwhelmed by Burger Bar.  When a restaurant has the name Hubert Keller attached, you expect a certain level of quality, and so I was a little disappointed when what I got was just another burger joint.  That being said, I didn\'t get one of the signature burgers, so maybe I just didn\'t order the right thing.\n\nOrdered the Country National sustainable beef burger and topped it with avocado, grilled onions, and jalapenos.  While the meat was flavorful and cooked properly, the sesame seed bun was slightly hard on the outside and a little dry.  The jalapenos were the pickled, sliced varietal you\'re given to put on your nachos at movie theaters.\n\nWe also had a trio of sides - french fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings - none of which were any better than what you can get at your local neighborhood diner.\n\nIf I were to return, would probably be a little more adventurous and try one of the "Chefs Burgers."'

S'Sometimes I feel like my food life is a giant episode of the "Twilight Zone."\n\nHow Burger Bar is ranked as high as it is is truly beyond me.  In fact, many Yelpers I respect and normally agree with love this place but man, I haven\'t felt this ripped off since I bought my HDDVD player. \n\nMaybe Im biased against these so-called "gourmet burger" spots.  I mean, what makes a hamburger great is that its approachable by everyone, regardless of economics.  Perhaps thats why it has come to be synonymous with America...that it crosses boundaries.   Not here however, these burgers are decidedly expensive and in reality no better than anything you\'d find at your favorite local burger joint.  \n\nJust because you use the word "kobe" or "danish blue cheese" doesn\'t mean you have the right to charge $20 bucks for a burger...but apparently here it does.  Another thing is one would think a gourmet burger place would have gourmet fries right?  Wrong...here the fries were so mediocre I was yearning for Chili\'s.......yep, thats right I said Chili\'s and now I must shower to wash the shame off my body.  \n\nI had Hubert\'s favorite burger which was composed of Buffalo, Bleu Cheese and sherry shallot reduction sauce.  It tasted ok, but the price...oh that price!  Would you spend 15 bucks for a gourmet hot dog?  You would tell me to jump off a bridge!  My mom had the sliders and reported them as being ok as well, but nothing special.\n\nService was average but not very friendly.  I mean I would have a smile if I was getting a 10 dollar tip for bringing out two hamburgers and a couple soda pops but who am I to judge?\n\nOne positive thing to note was Burger Bar did have a nice beer selection with some unique options at decent prices.

S"This was my first lunch stop on my first trip to Vegas (last year).  In terms of atmosphere, Burger Bar is virtually indistinguishable from any other sports bar or mall restaurant. The schtick is the diner's ability to customize everything from meat to bun to toppings. I opted for the Kobe beef burger (which was $16), cooked rare and topped with swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and oyster mushrooms (these ranged from about sixty cents to two dollars). I also added a side of sweet potato fries (I believe they were just under $3). The burger was absolutely enormous, and it was more or less tartare-style with just a touch of char around the outside. The combination of toppings worked well together and added some dimension, but they didn't mask the flavor of the beef. The sweet potato fries were good and crunchy, but they weren't anything special and actually tasted like standard frozen ones. I also didn't eat much of the whole wheat bun I had chosen--next time, I'll just pass on the carbs. Service was mediocre (I waited almost 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence at the bar), but the draft beer list was surprisingly varied (most domestic drafts hovered around $5).  Next time, I think I'll hail a cab and go to In-N-Out!"

S"Can't beat this place for a great and relatively inexpensive Vegas meal. We make sure to eat here every time we are in town. They have an awesome veggie burger and tons of toppings like picked green tomatoes, fried egg, asparagus, blue cheese and so many more.. to create your own burger experience. The skinny fries are also to die for. Relaxed atmosphere... love sitting at the bar. They also have really good beer on tap!"

S'I have tried almost every buffet on the strip.\n\nDecided to take the hit and paid $50 for dinner.\n\nBacchanal is definitely the best on the strip.  They have everything and their Asian food is actually very good!  Jumbo shrimp, king crab, tiny lobster, sushi that is not full of rice, noodle soup that actually tastes very good, very delicious dessert, etc.\n\nThey even take a picture of you before you enter like it\'s an attraction.\n\nBUT I can\'t recommend it at $50.  The value is just not there.  You will be just as happy at the Wicked Spoon or the Wynn buffet or the Bellagio buffet for 20%+ less.\n\nYou\'ll be busy trying to get your moneys worth.  The people around me were done eating, but it seemed like they were waiting to digest so they can fit in more.  The receipt states to "please limit your stay to 2 hours"\n\nThe restroom is to the right of the exit and yes, you can re-enter after you unload.\n\nYour friends will be excited to go, but won\'t talk about how good it was.  They\'ll just talk about how they went to this $50 experience.  Ask them which food item specifically was better than other buffets?'

S'Presidents Day weekend FAIL on the "come for lunch, stay for dinner" tactic. If we had gotten there 15-20 minutes earlier (1:30-2pm instead of after 2pm), we probably would have just made it. It\'s just that we waited over 1.5 hours in that ridiculous line, and it seemed to get worse (but great for King Caesar!) from there on out through the rest of the afternoon and evening. It sounds like these lines (for most buffets) are only this bad during peak times and especially over holidays/holiday weekends, so plan accordingly. It\'s expensive (dinner is $52 and I think I heard lunch is $42 or around there). You can pay an extra $15 for the express line if you don\'t want to wait like the rest of the lemmings. I noticed, for a good 5-10 minutes, it seemed like the cashiers were standing around and not ringing people up (probably a "counter-tactic" to push it to 3pm and try to get the rest of these people in at the dinner price). Even after paying, we still had to wait 15-20 minutes to get a table. In the end, we probably waited close to 2 hours. Fortunately, we had no plans until at 7:30pm for the Beatles LOVE show...\n\nSo once we finally got into the buffet, I went straight to the seafood line and loaded up on king crab (they had snow crab too I think). There were oysters as well, but they kept on disappearing too fast - apparently the ratio of shuckers to consumers was severely lacking. One of the shucker guys dumped four oysters directly onto my plate after I stood there waiting for a few minutes though. The oysters were super fresh! So much so that my wife, not an oyster-eater, thoroughly enjoyed hers. The king crab legs were OK - some that we got weren\'t completely defrosted in some parts, so I found myself eating small bits of king crab ice at times. That said, Dungeness is still my favorite.... it\'s too bad they didn\'t have any of that cause I would have gone buck wild on it. \n\nMan, I felt like a kid in a candy store... now, the last time we made a quick "pit stop" in Vegas, we checked out Wicked Spoon. I was thoroughly impressed with that. But this is like Wicked Spoon x2, as another reviewer alluded to. It\'s literally almost twice as big. Amazing.\n\nSo I made it over to the meat station and picked up a nice chunk of brisket and a lamb chop. The lamb chop was pretty bomb. The brisket was okay. My wife got some prime rib, which looked good but by the time I stuffed myself with everything else I didn\'t get a good look or taste of it. She also got the spicy sausage and boy was it spicy. IMHO, the meat station at Wicked Spoon has the slight edge here. \n\nOther interesting stuff I picked up: \n\nFried chicken & sweet potato fries - I didn\'t enjoy this as much because I was stuffed from the plates of king crab we destroyed. It was good though, and I thought the fries were pretty awesome (I think they were drizzled or coated in honey!)\n\nSushi - I only had one piece but it was pretty fresh. \n\nShiao long bao - yes, they did have these. And surprisingly they weren\'t bad - soupy and flavorful as expected.\n\nPho and tonkatsu ramen - the broth was slightly lacking but the option to even offer these was pretty impressive.\n\nI was looking forward to "chunks of honeycomb" that someone spoke of in another review. Disappointingly, I only saw a display of it (not sure if it was a fake display or real too) behind glass. I did get some "honeycomb honey" which was pretty good though.\n\nAs far as dessert, we were pretty impressed but so stuffed full that we could hardly enjoy anything. Creme brulee, flan, mochi, gelato, chocolate covered strawberries...... EXPLODE! We seriously couldn\'t eat anymore... but then I just had to get a slice of pizza to cap it all off.\n\nIt all became somewhat overwhelming after a while, but I\'d say the top things to consider: OYSTERS, crab (of course), lamb chops, spicy sausage, sushi, fried chicken.\n\nOne thing I almost fainted over when I saw it was a large hot table (ala Mongolian BBQ). They were utilizing it to grill in the Mexican section, but I thought to myself "wouldn\'t it be crazy if they had Mongolian BBQ?" That would take things to another level, IMHO.\n\nToo much to write about... too much thinking. Still digesting. Until next time, maybe. But only on a non-holiday, off-peak hour, and for lunch going on dinner.'

S'I was one of the lucky Yelpers that got to attend the grand opening dinner at Bacchanal... And after hearing about the brunch offerings at that event, I knew that it would only be a matter of time before my husband and I would be feasting at Bacchanal Buffet in the morning hours...\n\nThis past weekend we had family in town from back east, and what better way to welcome family to Vegas then to pig out at the best buffet in Vegas. (For what it\'s worth, that\'s what USA Today said, not me!). We arrived around 9:30 am and there was only a short line, it took no more then 15 minutes of waiting before we paid and were seated. For those of you that just can NOT wait, there is a line pass you can purchase for $15. \n\nNote: This is not a cheap buffet. It is priced in the same range as the other high end buffets. Brunch was about $45 per person, that includes champagne. There are other, cheaper places to get your grub on but when it comes to buffets you absolutely get what you pay for... \n\nDo not expect everything to be cooked and waiting for you to scoop out a serving, cafeteria style. That\'s just gross. Bacchanal has employees at all of their stations and while a decent amount of the food is premade, in SMALL batches, other items are prepared for you right then and there. Meaning you get the fresh tasting food at the right temperture, provided you can be a bit patient.. \n\nHighlights of our meal:\n\nRED VELVET PANCAKES. I was super excited to try these and they did not dissapoint in the slightest. The size of the palm of my hand, cooked to perfection and topped with both strawberries AND raspberries. Heavenly.\n\nThe crepe stations. That\'s right, plural. The lady that made my crepe informed that that Bacchanal has crepe makers working all hours, but for breakfast they have both a sweet AND a savory crepe station. \n\nThe chorizo and papas were tasty. Melon juice was delish. Freshly made-to-order omelette was perfect. \n\nOne thing I knew about Yelp events is that we don\'t get the same experience as a "normal" customer may get, because the employees know they are serving a bunch of hella critical foodies. I actually feel like the service we got during brunch was as food if not better then the "special" service we recieved at the grand opening. A pot of coffee was left at the table for us but it was almost always poured by our waiter... My mimosa was being topped off constantly. Extra napkins? No problem. Plates cleared efficently, and all was done with a smile.\n\nAny time we have family in town that want to check out a buffet, we will be taking them to Bacchanal.'

S"I've been here so many times before for brunch and I never fully enjoyed it to it's extent but that all changed when when I went for dinner this past Monday night!\nMaybe it's because I've always been drunk or super hungover so I cant ever really stomach buffet food but I was sober this time and it was soooo gooooooood!!\n\nMy boyfriends a Diamond status for Total Rewards so we got to skip the entire line & got seated right away which was definitely a PLUS because the line here is always SUPER long.. like 2+ hours wait long.\n\nIn my opinion, buffets are ALWAYS better for dinner than brunch.  I don't want no scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage when I'm at a buffet... I want the GOOD STUFF. and thats exactly what I got when I went ;)\n\n$108 for 2 people for dinner.\n$80-$90 for 2 people for brunch on a weekend? that includes unlimited mimosas.\nIf you're a Total Rewards member, use those points for a free meal! (;\n\nIn the mood for some Chinese? Sushi? Pho? Prime rib? Mexican? Seafood? This place has it all! \n\nI consumed a lot of seafood here--salmon, tuna, & red snapper nigiri, sushi rolls, fresh oysters, crab legs, clams & mussels.  The quality of seafood is always a hit or a miss at buffets in my opinion, but the quality here was well worth the money.  \nOysters were very fresh with no fishy smell/taste, the crab legs had decent amount of meat to them & the nigiri was fresh as well.  \n\nI also finally got to try the juices that come in cute little bottles.   I tried the Guava, Mango & Horchata. Mango was really good and I also liked the Horchata but I found it a bit too sweet for my taste.\n\nNothing much to complain about here except I would stay away from the hot & sour soup and the prime rib as I found both of them to be extremely salty and unsatisfying.\n\nNOW FOR THE DESSERTS!\nLoved:\n+Chocolate covered strawberries--the chocolate one was sweet & salty.  \n+CREME BRULEE--such perfection.\n+Italian Cookie Gelato is probably the best flavor they offer.\n+Macarons are soft and sweet. Was not a big fan of the flavors they offer but they were still good.  I mean, what other buffet offers macarons at their dessert bar?!\n\nBASICALLY, if you're in Vegas, got time to kill & super starving. COME HERE.\nTruly the best buffet in Vegas, hands down."

S'Easily one of the best buffets in Vegas and one of the newest additions. I was waiting and waiting to go try this place and finally had the opportunity to do so, but of course it was done with a hangover.. so I want to try to give this place the best review I can under the circumstances that I was in. I tried a bit of everything even if it meant a few bites of one thing and a whole bowl of pho. Yes, pho.. and it was good too! Probably the best thing there that day, and it cured the hangover but I still didn\'t eat much of the other stuff. Everything was really high quality though and explains the price of the buffet. I would definitely like to go back and try it when I am "normal" again.'

S"What are you looking for? A beautiful glasshouse filled with gorgeous furniture and  lounge music? Well, that's exactly what you're going to find.\n\nSetting: The setting, atmosphere and service definitely is one of the best I've ever encountered. \n\nSeafood: You can expect to see a glass cube of crab legs cut half open, or an ice mountain of raw oysters. Sounds exciting, right? That quite sums up what is to expect in terms of their seafood. \n\nDesserts: This restaurant offers much more in terms of desserts including but not limited to gelatos, crepes (and creeps) and deliciously, rich chocolate strawberries. \n\nAside from service, Bacchanal buffet offers many, many good things to customers except for anything great. You want lobsters? You're not going to find it here. If you think you have an insatiable appetite, I think this might just turn your world upside down."

S"The best buffet I've been to (i've yet to try Bally's Sterling Brunch). I hate going to buffets and AYCE places. I always end up over eating to justify the cost. However, this buffet is something else. I wanted try this buffet since I had heard so many rave reviews about it. And it lived up to my expectations.\n\nJust like any other buffets on the strip Bacchanal has Asian, American, French and Seafood. The must tries are American (burger sliders are delicious), Seafood (crab legs), French (pastries for dessert) and you have to try their lamb chops. I think managed to eat 10 of those at this buffet. The seasoning on the lab chops is perfect. \n\nThe final stop is the dessert bar. They probably have over 75 different varieties of desserts and fruits. Just try anything from here. \n\nOverall, I'll definitely be back to break my current record of lamb chops. You should't skip this. Best time to get in is on Weekday nights. Use the automated kiosks to save waiting time."

Cleaned out the plates on point.\n\nFood: four stars because the variety is amazing but the SALT level is over board, caution if you are on salt restriction. If they just added less salt and let the natural flavors kick in.\n\nPrice is very fair considering the variety \n\nI think it is most well rounded buffet in Vegas to date.'

S'One of the best buffets I\'ve ever been to!  I hate to admit this (a sin in my family really..) but I am not the biggest fan of buffets.. I admittedly don\'t eat that much, and I always feel like I\'m torturing my tummy to get my money\'s worth ): Also, they\'re a wide selection of food that\'s usually mediocre at best..  Bacchanal (however you pronounce that), however, definitely changed my mind!  Yes, there were MANY MANY choices, but I honestly did not feel pressured to have to eat everything, because the seafood section was amaaazing!  I cannot tell you how many times I went back for more seafood, especially those fresh oysters. And crab legs. So good. Really the highlight of the buffet I thought.  Their carving station was pretty good too, I enjoyed my ribs a lot. But wow. The seafood.\n\nWarning - the wait can be kind of torturous, but they have this electronic system where you sign up on the machine and they text you when you need to come back and get in line, which is kind of nice so you can walk around and do some shopping or gambling while you\'re waiting.  The wait IS about an additional 15 minutes after they text you though.  Also, the "estimated wait time" that they show you after you sign up might not be very accurate.. I\'m assuming it\'s because people drop out. Our estimated wait was 90 minutes, but it only took about 20 for them to text me back. So just be prepared for that!'

S'My bestie and her BF were in town and wanted to head on over here as they\'ve heard nothing but good about it. I never really seek out buffets, but when tourist come I will oblige and indulge.\n\nJust a note that a few of the pictures show a price list when it first opened and it is NOT accurate. The profile picture is a outdated price list. \n\nThis is the cost (currently) as follows:\n\nBreakfast (Mon - Fri, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99\nBrunch (Sat - Sun, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99\nLunch (Mon - Fri, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99\nDinner (3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends\n\nOne thing about this place is that it is sleek and modern and was very well designed and the music selection contemporary downtempo type stuff. Of course we came for the food and the buffet was nicely spread out and nothing was looking old and dried out. We came around 4ish on a monday so it wasn\'t busy and had no line. That sometimes is a cause for concern that they wouldn\'t rotate out the lunch out fast enough, but everything was fresh by that time. I wouldn\'t want to wait hours in a line to eat either and would probably greatly change my opinion of this place. I rarely think anything is worth standing around 1-2 hours so I will go before rush times. \n\nI got a little bit from various savory stations among several rounds and nothing was bad. Even at some other higher end buffets I\'ve had some misses I did not eat which did not occur here. Most ranged from good to very good with only two OK items (fried chicken could be juicier but had good breading, ceviche a little too lime and not enough salt). I was most surprised that the oysters were sweet and not strongly briny, mussels and snow crab were good. The meat station was solid - the veal steamship was juicy and fall apart tender, the lamb chops were perfectly cooked and good quality and the skirt steak was really tender which I\'m normally not a fan of as it can be stringy. The baked salmon was surprisingly not overcooked and was perfect, The handmade dim sum were rather nice as I went back for seconds on their pork and leek dumpling. \n\nDessert wise they were also strong. I really enjoyed the panna cotta with berry, the creme brulee was great texture (though the top could have been torched more), their warm pizookie type cookie was awesome with a scoop of ice cream and fresh whipped cream. They had french macarons, which is my favorite, and theirs was surprisingly decent! I loved the orange with chocolate creme macaron out of the 5 flavors they had and overdid it with inhaling these. \n\nService was great. He was on top of drinks, but was also friendly and engaging conversation. \n\nMy bestie really enjoyed the variety and definitely thought it was worth it and gives it a 4 while she giggles about my funny hobby. Her BF is a bit of a picky eater and doesn\'t eat some of the higher ticket items like the seafood bar to have made it worth the high pricetag of what he got, though he thought it was good. \n\nI can see why this buffet gets rave reviews. It is quantity that is serving up some quality too. I don\'t know if it\'s "good value" enough for me to return on my own, but I\'m sure I\'ll be back at some point with tourist friends.'

Yes I said porridge yum with some thousand year old egg and spices. \nDidn't know they had this but sealed it for the wifey.  Boiled snow crab.  She loves crab but typically too salty at buffets. Well boiled was perfect i think she had 4 heaping plates. \nPotatoe something on the meat station.

I am from San Diego, land of Mexican food and I can say that the made-to-order street tacos are almost on par with those at taco shops in my hometown.

S"Now this is a world class buffet! I'm a big buffet lover so we made a beeline for this after hearing the rave reviews. We went on a Friday afternoon for lunch, around 2PM I think, and we only had to wait in-line for maybe 10 minutes. The restaurant is absolutely gigantic, and they have the biggest selection of food at a Vegas buffet. All of the stations are in a row at one side of the buffet, and you could easly just walk through the entire thing at once, but I personally prefer working station by station. \n\nWe startet at the Asian station, and they had a vast selection, and I have to say that everything I tried was absolutely delicious! Next was the Italian station which was a bit smaller, with a selection of pasta and pizza. Moving on to the Mexican station, where you have a selection of toppings/sides, and a person frying up the meat you want in a burrito wrap. Not to mention, as many as you want! Second to last was the American/BBQ station, which I think was the biggest one. There was a carving station with a selection of warm meats, and the brisket was just beyond yummy! You can also choose any type of potato your heart desires, and then there's the selection of small, random things, like delicious sliders and sweet corn. The last station (or first, depends on where you start) is the seafood station. We didn't get anything there, but the station was very inviting and it looked like they had tons of fresh picks for the seafood and shellfish lover. In the middle of the room you find a big dessert station that you can walk around completly. In all honesty, I was a bit dissapointed. I'm a big chocolate lover, and they only had a few chocolate picks. I actually had a little sugarfree sticky cake type thing, and I would have never known it was sugarfree. They also have tons of ice cream, and they'll make you a cone with the flavours you want.\n\nNow, the staff. I think I would say that this is the least friendly staff we found at a strip establishment on this trip. They weren't rude or anything, but it seemed like most of them hated their jobs and didn't try to hide it. It's probably a pretty crappy place to work with all the guests that come through, but still. \n\nOne thing I would recommend is that if you like a certain station, get smaller portions and then come back later in your meal. They change up the selection all the time, and when they're out of one dish they replace it with something else (atleast in the dessert and grill stations). It may seem obvious if you think of the fact that they serve about 500 dishes every day, but we didn't really think it through and saw lots of exciting dishes that we hadn't tried on the way out. \n\nThe room is very airy and spacious, and there are glass walls out towards the pool and the garden.\n\nAll in all I think this may be my favorite Vegas buffet. I'm not sure it's the best tasting food (I think I'll have to go with the Wynn buffet on that one), but the sheer selection makes it incredible. Will definetly be coming back!\n\nI recommend coming for lunch, and on a weekday. We walked past Saturday night, and the lines were insane. Everything is also cheaper on the weekdays, and I think we paid about 35 USD pp for lunch, and I think it's 10-15 USD more on the weekend."

S"Hands down, the best buffet I've ever been to.\n\nUsually, when I visit a buffet, I run across a pretty vast range of quality. Some items are good, others not as much, and some downright bad. This was far from that formula. The majority of the items I sampled at both breakfast and dinner (and trust me, I sampled quite a few) were from good to great.\n\nSeveral items surprised me with their quality. For example, the mini hot dog. I didn't expect to enjoy this, but they got the details astoundingly correct, down to the wax pepper and the bright green relish. \n\nAs with many buffets, the food run the gambit from classic American fare like your mini burgers, fries and mac & cheese, to Mexican, to Chinese, and again, everything worked quite well. Very few weak spots at all, and if you don't like something, you'll find another half dozen to replace it on your plate.\n\nIs it pricey? Probably the most expensive buffet I found on the strip. But is it worth it? Absolutely. You could spend half as much very close by, as long as you don't mind crappy food. But I, for one, will always spend more to enjoy good, quality food. And that'd exactly what you get here."

S"Bacchanal Buffet has dethroned the Wicked Spoon Buffet as my favorite buffet in Vegas. I'd still go to Wicked Spoon when given the opportunity, but I'd say Bacchanal is superior in essentially every aspect.\n\nMore variety of foods, better selections, and better tasting food. \n\nWith the popularity that Bacchanal has gained, they now have a ticketing system that works very similar to that of the Fast Pass at Disneyland. You get in line to input information into a call-back system. They print out a receipt and text you when your turn is up. This, I'm assuming, helps with their line so that people don't crowd the Bacchanal area. Also, if the wait is 2 hours long, you can go to the Forum shops, go blow some money on the tables, then come back.\n\nAfter you get back, you get in line to pay, then get in line to be seated. With so many lines and checkpoints, I guess this added call-back system is necessary.\n\nOne thing that annoyed me was that we came here for the Champagne Brunch and were forced to pay the higher price, even though my wife and I don't drink. But alas, we fell victim to this.\n\nThey had a raw bar, meat carver, street tacos area, stews and soups, Italian, and an Asian section. Some highlights were the prime rib, the seasoned steamed shrimp [if you didn't want it cold], the wonderful cheese selection, the Kalbi, and the awesome and amazing sweet potato tater tot balls. Oh My Amazeballs - those were awesome.\n\nEverything else was just us pigging out and eating in absolute gluttony and excess. \n\nWhat was very disappointing was the dessert bar. I've read review after review of how great the desserts were and how extensive their selection is. Sure, there is quite a variety and a great selection... but everything was underwhelming and quite a disappointment. The Bacchanal dessert bar is like Floyd Mayweather - rich and flashy, but surprisingly disappointing when you realize he can't even read a book. The flan was dense and thick when it looked beautiful and light. The black sesame gelato had no flavor. The cakes and cookies, while looking exquisite and beautiful, were .. again.. disappointing. \n\nSo yeah.. for the price you pay, you certainly get a great variety and, as with the Wicked Spoon, or any other buffet, there are plenty of hits and misses. Bacchanal sure had its share of hits, but the dessert bar is a complete miss."

S"Hands down the best buffet I've ever eaten at! I pretty much died & went to food heaven.\n\nIt's a bit pricey, $50 per person for dinner, but it's so worth it! (At least for the amount of food I ate, anyway).\n\nYou could taste the freshness of the seafood. I felt that they had a huge selection within each area of food that they had. Their selection of food ranged from American, Mexican, Italian, & Asian. I felt like the ethnic food they offered was pretty much authentic tasting. It didn't taste 'Americanized' if that makes sense. I don't know what else to say about the food except that I pretty much tried every dish that they offered & I loved each & every one of them!\n\nThe desserts were really good too! Loved that they had a gelato bar. & the best part was they had green tea cookies the night I went.

S'BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS!\nWicked Spoon ain\'t got nothing on Bacchanal. What I like is that B doesn\'t play. One of the first stations you see is the seafood. BAM! Piles-a-plenty of crab, shrimp, oysters, salmon, seabass \'n more. Work your way down from there and find all types of cuisines well-represented. I liked that they had a station of fresh juice, including horchata. Refreshing! Desserts had their own central "island" complete with varying fine patisserie-worthy delights and a gelato station. \n\nWe had a late start to the day and caught a late lunch.

Grand in both scope and spectacle with ornate glass, open floorplans, and plush seating complimented by a staff of over twelve-dozen overseeing preparation, service, and customer needs my arrival at Bacchanal shortly preceded its 8am opening and greeted first by a cheerful cashier, then by assistant manager Stephanie, my experience commenced; the subsequent three hours adrift in 70+ of the buffet\'s offerings and a sea of smiles emanating from each employee and nearly every patron.  Divided into several sections with many offering cooked-to-order options including crepes and omelets it was Asian that my meal began and with fresh steamer baskets just opened the dim sum excelled - a small quibble in the thick-skinned har gow more than compensated by bao, duck and pork as good as that at Jasmine plus full-service congee complete with century egg, not to mention Sin City\'s best Egg Custard Tart later discovered at the dessert island.  Moving next to things more "American," one is well advised to monitor for items fresh from the kitchen as both the crunchy waffles and well seasoned chicken proved superlative while later tastes of waffle fries and tots fell flat - a fresh buttermilk biscuit, hot seafood preparations, and sliced meats including smoky beef ribs with caramelized crunch all showing far better.  At times a touch liberal in salt with Kung Pao Chicken and Risotto suffering the most, Bacchanal again shines in selections of shellfish, cheese, and charcuterie but with much eating to do and such things widely available elsewhere it was thoroughly in my sweet tooth that I indulged and although I passed up a few cookies plus a duo of sorbet suffice it to say that I nearly ran the gamut; cakes, doughnuts, pies, tarts, and more all justifying the calories with the aforementioned egg custard, pecan pie, cream puff, carrot cake, and citrus \'tiramisu\' all warranting special mention along with the lovely pastry team who jovially tended to baking, saucing, arranging, and making crepes at a pace seldom to lull.\n\nSlightly more expensive than Wicked Spoon but making up the difference in complimentary champagne there are things to love about both of Las Vegas\' premier all-you-can-eat experiences yet aside from a more expansive gelato case and my predilection to The Cosmopolitan\'s soundtrack I\'d be hard-pressed to ever recommend it over Bacchanal.  Obviously limited by the constraints intrinsic to feeding anywhere from 2500 to 4500 persons in a given day yet defying the odds through a combination of remarkable customer service and striking attention to detail I\'m happy to say that Bacchanal lives up to the liberally applied superlatives and although "Gods" may require something slightly more refined I\'m almost positive they won\'t find it in such a format for less than $50, especially on Las Vegas Boulevard.'

S'So upon conferring with the wifey it appears as though I got my figures turned around as to the cost of the buffet. The buffet, if you DO NOT have a 24 hour wrist band, is $50/person. If you have the 24 hour wristband, which runs a penny shy of $50/person, the Bacchanal buffet is an additional $25 for dinner. So we technically paid $75/person to eat here but part of those funds paid for our breakfast the other two mornings. Still not worth it in my humble opinion.'

Food was just ok but then again that  whole drink experience could have ruined my food experince cause i didnt want to eat to much if i didnt have anything to drink it down with nad what not.

Both times we got seated immediately and on our way out the line was probably an hour long! The variety they offer includes: Seafood, American, Pastas, Cheeses and Cured Meats, Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, and much more. \n\nMy favorite items here are the Brisket and Prime Rib (both are cooked super tender and juicy), and Mussels and Oysters (fresh!), and their drinks (specially the Horchata). However, the star of the buffet is their dessert section! Tons of options for your sweet tooth from Creme Brulee, Gelato, Sorbets, Egg Tarts, Tiramisu, Crepe Station, and much much more!\n\nI even saw Metta World Peace here my last time!

S"I'm quite torn between giving this place 3 or 4 stars, what it boils down to is ultimately the question of quality over quantity.\n\nGranted this is a buffet and in Vegas, the sheer quantity of choices and variety dictates who's buffet reigns supreme. What Bacchanal lacks in variety, it makes up for in quality. I had some of the best tasting ramen, Kobe beef burgers, and pastor tacos. These were cooked to order and masterfully crafted to restaurant standards. Sadly though, given the competitions from places such as the Buffet and the Wicked Spoon, I'm not sure if I'll return for more."

S"I think one of the best if not the best buffets in Las Vegas.  Talk about ginormous selection!  There's a seafood station with crab legs, shrimp, ceviche, oyster shooters, miso sea bass, lobster biscuits, a whole meat station with sausage, prime rib, brisket, ham and chicken, a mexican station, a whole other room that has asian food including dim sum, roast duck, chow mein and fried rice, sushi, and cold meats and cheeses, and an italian station with pizza.  Then you have dessert with a made to order crepe station, gelato, ice cream, and various desserts.  Definitely have to pace yourself so you can try a little bit of everything.  I really think this is one of the buffets in Las Vegas that has the most variety and everything was pretty tasty considering it was a buffet!  July 4th brunch was $53 a person so it's not cheap but definitely worth a visit.  Wait wasn't too long for 3...came at around 10:30.  You check in electronically and they will text you when it's ready."

Only certain items are individual servings.\n\nFirst, standing in the line, we're it and it's 6:55 am, no one is here but us, we are eying the crab legs, piled high, and right next too it a huge pile of shrimp.  Our mouth's are watering before we even get a chance to taste anything.\n\nWe're given a brief walk through, then taken to our table.  I take advantage of the complimentary mimosa and we're up and loading our plates with the most wonderful delights.  Each station, the staff are friendly and acknowledge us when we approach.  The displays are both full of color, smell and arranged to attract.\n\nI made so many trips back and forth, I must have worked off most of the calories, right?  This is one of the best buffets in town. Worth the extra bucks and definitely worth a revisit."

S'I have been to a lot of buffets in Las Vegas, and I wanted to try Bacchanal for the first time since it had a lot of good reviews.  \nWords can not begin to describe how disappointed I was!!  $58/person + tip, ok it better be good.  NO!!  EVERYTHING was cooked with salt and no other flavor.  And it was a LOT of salt.  \nNot as much selection as Bellagio or Studio B.  Especially the desert section.  \nWith the 2-3 hours wait and the price, go to Bellagio or Wicked Spoon.  \nThe only good I found at this place was the host was kind enough to let people at the end of the line know they would not have more than 1/2 hr to eat since they were there so late.  Other than that, nothing else was good about this place.'

S'Delicious but expensive. Fresh squeezed juices if you go for brunch. They also have some of the freshest oysters and crab but many dishes are super salty. The prime rib has salt rubbed all over the outside.  You will not be able to eat the outer portion. Their leg of lambs or "lamb lollipops" as their butcher calls it are delicious and well-seasoned. Even my dog thought so. :)\n\nWhat really sets Bacchanal apart though is the wide selection of asian cuisine. Pho was actually very good. Much better than some restaurants out there. Some of the sushi is fresh but if that\'s all you\'re looking for go to Goyemon which is off the strip.\n\nPistachio macaroons and mochi ice cream are the best deserts. Maybe because I get to eat them very rarely.'

It did not compare to what I had here.  \n\nI thought the crab here was not as good as Wynn\'s but my friend liked it better. They come out warm. My other friend said the oysters were better here. My friends liked the seafood. \n\nOther foods I liked: Lamb, corn, mashed potatoes. Friends liked their seafood and apparently they use really expensive meat in their sliders\n\nDrink: tea drinks were really good. not too sweet\n\nServers- Excellent. Came around frequently taking away our plates and filling our drinks. Was there on a Friday around 530pm\n\nThe reason for minus 1 star- The price. \n\nThey had a wide variety of food.

S"I will start with all the cons for this one first. The line. We got there right at noon and there was a Disneyland like line. I'd say it was about an hour or two wait. I heard the people in front of us talk about an express line so we tried that. Turns about you have to buy the 24 hr buffet pass plus all these other fees to cut everyone else in line. Total came slightly more than 100. We didn't want to wait so we just paid. When we got in, there was still more lines for the more popular items (seafood, steak, etc). Because of the long line, it even blocked access for food that weren't popular. So you didnt really know what people were lining up for, just that there was a line.\n\nNow to the pros. The servers were great. Got our drink orders immediately and even gave me a plate. The lady was super kind. The kind you would tip extra for. \n\nThe place is nicely decorated. Very modern feel.

S"Vegas truly offers some of the most extravagant buffet in the world.\n\nWe came here for Saturday brunch ($44.99 + tax - $1 discount with Total Rewards card). Unlike other Vegas buffets where you stand and wait in line, you first walk up to one of the kiosk machines and input your name, phone number, and party size. Once Bacchanal has an available spot for your party, you will receive a text and ask you to check-in and pay at the cashier within 15 minutes. The estimated waiting was supposedly 70 minutes, but we only waited for 30 minutes. \n\nHonestly, this whole place did feel like a mini food heaven. You can find dim sum in the Chinese section, prime rib in the meat section, pre-cut crab legs in seafood section, a juice bar with freshly made fruit / vegetable juices, and many more. \n\nPlate 1: BBQ pork, roasted duck, sushi, sashimi, dim sum (har gow, shumai), beef chow fun: For a buffet, all Chinese and Japanese food tasted pretty much hit the spot. Just don't expect these food to be five-star quality.\n\nPlate 2: Fried chicken, smoked brisket, bone-in prime rib, sweet potato tots, Wagyu beef sliders: I thought sweet potato tots was pretty unique and Wagyu beef sliders was definitely a highlight. Unfortunately, prime rib and fried chicken were average at best. The prime rib at Wynn Buffet tasted so much better. \n\nPlate 3: mussels, oysters, crab legs, chef special (mushroom polenta), sauteed mushrooms: Pre-sliced FRESH crab legs? Fresh mussels and oysters? This must be a seafood heaven! \n\nPlate 4: creme brulee, egg tart, almond cookie, green tea cookie with azuki beans, pecan sticky buns: Other than pecan sticky buns, everything else tasted amazing. That creme brulee ... I can eat that thing 3 times a day. \n\nGelato (Thai tea + red bean flavors) and horchata: One of the best gelato I've had, but it melt so quickly =(. Oh and horchata is a must try - sooooo good. \n\nMain takeaway: Wynn Buffet has better prime ribs and Bacchanal Buffet has better desserts (and horchata). Not a perfect buffet, but you definitely get what you pay for."

S'I am not a buffet person, thought I\'d get that out of the way. In 2013 I tried the brunch @ Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan and my mind was changed dramatically. My friends said that Bacchanal was the best in Vegas. Since my mind was more open, I figure?...lets do it! First of all...don\'t come here hungry. We rolled up, put our name down and printed out a ticket that said when we should come back and that we\'d receive a text to confirm that as well. With the terrible reception in the casino/shopping area, we received that text a lot later than expected. We were in line forever...waiting and waiting...that we missed the cutoff time for lunch. We were the transition time between lunch and dinner and unfortunately had to pay the DINNER price...and since it was the weekend before Christmas, we paid the HOLIDAY pricing which was about $62 with taxes. AHhhh....i better eat my ass off. But that\'s why I hate buffets, I\'m not prepared to eat more than I actually am capable of.  We complained about the pricing, but they couldn\'t do anything about it.\n\nOnce you get through the paying line, you have to fall in OTHER lines. I\'m over the lines and waiting by this point.\n\nFinally... we\'re in, seated right next to the desserts. I left a note for the waiter that said "4 Waters please"....haha...sorry, I had to go eat something. We pigged out at the American/Carving Station area...picked up french fries, fresh juice, prime rib, ribs, brisket, mac n cheese...it was endless. AHh don\'t forget the pork belly. Most of this was absolutely delicious...ended up being worth the wait, KIND OF. I walked even further down the buffet, they have Chinese Food, Italian, Seafood, whoa. After that first plate, I was dying. \n\nWhen I landed dessert, I had an amazing fresh nutella crepe and some french macarons (people crowded like vultures once it was put out). So I just hate the pricing and the wait, but the food is actually good here. I don\'t suggest coming here in large groups, you\'ll just be waiting even longer, just saying.'

S'supposedly Bacchanal means "Feast for the Gods", but what\'s the most godly (most godly? godliest?) about this place is the definitely the hype. Bacchanal is an amazing buffet, true - but I think I\'ve had a few better. (Bellagio, Wynn, etc).\n\nit\'s a little pricey, and organization/service a tad slow. on a busy day (high season or weekends), you\'d probably have to go at like 4:30 pm to avoid a 1 hr+ wait. \nsomething unique/cool that Bacchanal does is have like a "fast pass" system of waiting in line. you put your name into a virtual line and they give you a time period you can return between so you don\'t have to physically wait in line. in theory, it sounds super impressive. only downside is that once you come back in your allotted time, it takes them impossibly long just to seat you.\n\nFOOD: I think this buffet\'s saving grace is its dessert selection. gelato, mochi, pastries, macarons galore! the desserts were definitely the highlight of my meal. they have an extensive seafood section with crab legs... but the wait for them was really long. some other highlights: meat & cheese section (I live for prosciutto!), dim sum and pho sections, chicken and waffles section\n\noverall... one of my top 5 favorite buffets in vegas, but probably not my first choice. that being said - I\'ll most likely be Bacch!

When I checked out the Asian section food, it\'s so disappointing. It looked like instant frozen dim sim or dish for reheating on the steamer.\n\nI started with some green and pasta salad, got 1 piece Alaska king crab leg.

They have this convoluted system where you queue up in a line that looks legit but is really just a line to receive your wait time - which is anywhere from 1-3 hours. Soooo dumb. The place is enormous and yet they stagger entry. \n\nOnce inside the food offerings are diverse and very good. You will be full ALL DAY. Service is friendly too. Not super fast, but good enough. Price is worth it but go early and leisurely spread out your meal to 2 hours like we did.'

S"First attempt to come here was last Thanksgiving. 3 Hour wait, um no thank you. Finally able to hit up this place in July and I have to say, this place is top two along with the buffet at the M resort. When you have smoked BBQ at a buffet, you had me at hello. Typical new concept Vegas buffet with stations from around the world. The kicker is that the food is actually good and your a not wasting it by taking a bite and throwing away the rest. Granted the 1st time I came here i had the runs 4 hours later (I'm guessing it was the pastrami at greenfield deli NYNY casino). Was hoping it was a fluke so came back a month later and I was a ok. Bacchanal and Studio B buffet, you are the reason I waste my money on food and not gambling."

S'I love buffets but  i think didnt have a big appetite that day! Came here for lunch and there was barely a line! $35 a person. The design of this place looks amazing! Food was literally everywhere! Only disappointment I had about this place when I asked for a plate of salmon sashimi with no rice the chef said something I couldnt understand. I had a ton of shrimp cocktails and a few oysters! I didnt eat any of the pasta but they looked delicious as well the salami and cheese station.\n\nLoved the desserts! Crepes and different flavored ice cream were my favorite!'

S'I came to Bacchanal on a whim for lunch with a few co-workers and I was surprised to see so few vegetable dishes. There were plenty of meat dishes and noodles but not a lot of roasted vegetables for those who aren\'t into meat and carbs. As for desserts, I thought the items offered were very typical with nothing that stood out or made me go "wow, I must consume that!" \n\n\nI left disappointed and wanting for more.'

There was a long line at 8 pm on a Thursday but we were seated after a short wait.  There was enough variety and the seafood station made it worthwhile, but nothing stood out.  And I was disappointed with the dessert.  Only thing I liked was the chocolate creme brulee.\n\nService is outstanding however.  Something you would expect from Caesars."

S"This is the best buffet I've ever been to, and I know buffets when I see them. But first, some quick tips:\n\n1. Parking is plentiful in the Caesar's structure. Try parking on the outside rooftop 5th floor. It has direct access to an elevator that takes you to the back area of Caesar's casino.\n\n2. The buffet is located near the entrance to the pools. It is where the old Caesar's buffet used to be.\n\n3. Arrive early to beat the line. We got in at 4:15 PM on a Wednesday and waited about 30 minutes to get in.\n\n4. Lunch ends at 3 and dinner begins at 3. Technically this means you can do the old get in for lunch and dinner strat for cheaper prices. \n\nI wish I took pictures so my eyes could continue to feast on the offerings that the Bacchanal Buffet. Anyways, I could talk about how amazing the food was, but that wasn't just the best part.\n\nI love the decor of this place. It reminds me of candy glass and it has a very vibrant and colorful look. The Asian/Italian station in the back seems to be a bit more intimate and dark though.\n\nMy favorites in terms of the food was the great dessert offerings that they have. There were different types of gelato with more exotic flavors along with the typical flavors for those less adventurous. There were all you can eat macarons and I gorged myself heavily on them.\n\nIn terms of the regular offerings I was surprised at how tender the prime rib was and the crab was so fresh. They also offered to steam crab for you on the spot so that it doesn't get all rubbery like other places where the crab has been sitting out for a long time. Another pleasant surprise was how authentic the Chinese offerings were. The Chinese style ribs were very good and the dim sum offerings were wonderful.\n\nI enjoyed the sushi, but my girlfriend thought it was a bit dry. Their other American offerings were pretty decent, but nothing to rave about. I didn't like the chicken tenders. They were really weirdly breaded and seemed a little undercooked. Besides that though, the other offerings made me forget about that small oversight. I also really enjoyed the Mexican stuff that they had! Especially the made to order tacos and the large salsa bar.\n\nI would definitely check out Bacchanal Buffet if you got the chance!"

S'For those who are planning to eat Bacchanal Buffet, I have recorded a FULL EXTENSIVE HD Slow and Steady Walk-Through of the entire buffet station at Bacchanal buffet in Caesars Palace. (Probably the best crisp HD footage on YouTube Guarantee).  So if you guys want to see what they serve for dinner before you guys dine there, click on the YouTube link to see the Bacchanal buffet in HD:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGQUhz-ChA\n\nor you can go on Youtube and Type "Epic Buffet Feast - Bacchanal Buffet Full HD tour"\n\nIt was kind of pricey at almost $45 bucks with taxes.  I ate here for brunch at around 2:30pm and got to eat for dinner also because Dinner starts at 3pm. So instead of paying for dinner price I paid at a brunch price. In the video, you will see both the brunch food and the dinner food that they brought out. HINT: If you don\'t want to pay dinner price, dine during the lunch hours and wait a bit before the bring out the dinner food.\n\nI had a great time eating at this truly epic buffet as mentioned by their ads in and around the casino\n\nWe had a great server, who always would come by and clear the plates.\n\nI love their open kitchen design. It\'s so clean and modern. I love how the foods were displayed and presented instead of having them on aluminum tray at the station for us to go and grab it. All the crab legs were already sliced in half, so you don\'t need a claw cracker. The only complained was that I wish the crab legs were steam instead of being cold.\n\nThey even have street taco! and a whole bunch of salsas to choose from as you can see halfway through my video. I love their rotating grill where they cook your tacos. \n\nThey also have the best dessert bar in term of dessert presentation. \n\nOverall, I love this place. It makes me feel like I\'m living the high life.\n\nSo here\'s a smooth steady HD videos of the whole buffet:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGQUhz-ChA\n\nEnjoy!'

S"As a Los Angeles resident and a person who frequents Vegas quite often, this was easily the best buffet I've had.  The usual top choices for people were Bellagio and Wynn, and more recently, Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. So you might be wondering what makes this so good? Everything. \n\nLet me start with the entrance. Instead of waiting for 1-2 hours in line, all you have to do is wait in one short line to put your name and number in a computer and it'll tell you when to come back. Our wait was 82 minutes. It told us to come back at a specific time and it even took our phone number to remind us. This is a win-win, you don't have to waste time in line and the casino will get you back in the casino to spend more money instead. \n\nThen you come back at your time slot where you pay the $41.99 for the champagne brunch. It automatically comes with the champagne fyi. \n\nThen you wait in another short line until your table is ready. After that you are overwhelmed with where to start. We were seated next to the dessert table and it was quickly drawn to the crepe station. Having gone to Europe in May, I was beyond excited. They crank out fresh crepes for the people and then you put on the fixins you like...fruits, caramel, chocolate, Nutella, whipped cream. The best part was the bananas that were already covered in caramel. I recommend taking the folded crepe they give you, unfold it, put in the bananas with caramel sauce and Nutella, close it, and some whipped cream and more Nutella. \n\nThen there is the real food. The Asian food was amazing - from the Thai Yellow Curry to the Pad Thai, to the Kung Pao. All perfect. Then they had this AMAZING taco station, carving station with bomb French fries. \n\nI will say that as someone who doesn't eat seafood really, this place had more than enough to satisfy me. Many of the other buffets make the salad bar, fruit area, and cheeses very prominent but the great thing about this buffet is that they had all of that stuff but it wasn't front and center. They gave more than allotted space to the real food. \n\nWhat really stood out to me was how authentic everything individually tasted. Usually when you go to a buffet, they have a couple really good things, but I could honestly say, everything here exceeded my expectations beyond measure. Each genre individually tasted so perfect. I can't tell you how on point the tacos were. \n\nFrom beginning to end, it was an experience I'll never forget. \n\nThe one thing I will say is pace yourself, I did not feel good from stuffing myself. I got a little overzealous, but in the end, it was so worth it."

S"The buffet totally makes up for the long wait.\n\nMy party and I went Friday night to kick off our Vegas weekend. Initially I was so pissed at how they made us wait in this small corner FOREVER after telling us our table would be ready in 15 minutes. But we got to the buffet and all was forgiven.\n\nThey have different cuisines so naturally, I had to try each one. :P My friends were all about that seafood life. Unlimited oysters and snow crab legs, cooked and cold! I actually fell in love with their duck. They had American, Italian, Asian (including some Dim Sum!!), Mexican, etc. They also had small plates of chef's specialty.\n\nThe dessert bar is HEAVEN. I slipped into a food coma and was sent to buffet dessert bar heaven! They had gelato, cakes, crepes, flan, macarons, cake balls, chocolate covered strawberries (different kinds too!), and anything you could think of.\n\nIf I could have afforded to eat their every night, I would have!"

S'Waited 15 minutes in express line that cost extra $20per adult for thanksgiving brunch, price of brunch $59? on that day, but I liked not having to wait long this time, kids half price. For two adults, four kids, cost $280 plus tip, express. The buffet was amazing, fresh, and far better than the past now that I did not have to wait as long as the dinner and later crowds.  We stayed three hours and tipped extra, but really no one rushed us. Service amazing even though buffet.  The week prior I ate at wicked spoon and it had gone downhill in quality, so for thanks giving this was the only buffet I was willing eat at with the low wait.  Would I wait two hours for this buffet? no. It is not worth two hours, but when you see no line and come at the start of opening, it is the best buffet food, selection, freshness in town.'

I think I paid around $35. They literally have everything in this buffet, anything your heart desires! I was trying to pace myself to try a little bit of everything. They even have fresh juices that come in a cute container! All the workers are very friendly as well. Overall, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the food is pretty good for a buffet!"

S"Oh gosh. Full. Momentarily shocked Easter weekend brunch was ~$50+ but it was worth it, $1 discount with players card. \n\nSeafood: just the right amount of salted crab legs, sweet crab claws you have to break/pull apart, unlimited fat cocktail shrimp, green mussels in the half shell, smoked mussels deshelled (serious smokey flavor mmm), a variety of oyster shots, if I recall correctly, etc.\n\nThey have a cheese and salami area! But where are the crackers? Fresh juice bottles near the breakfast foods! I got watermelon.\n\nI skipped the dim sum, got two pieces of sushi, which actually tasted like they were from a Japanese place, and found it funny I recognized the Krispy Kreme doughnuts next to the waffles, French toast, and mini red velvet pancakes. I'm getting hungry seeing all the food in my mind. \n\nI couldn't resist and went round the tantalizing dessert station while filling up a third plate (without even eating a single thing yet) and grabbed a huge white chocolate dipped strawberry with pink crunchies, a mini chocolate cupcake, and a raspberry/cream layered dessert that I mistook for red velvet. By the time I got back, Massimo (aka Moss), had already delivered twice the amount of juices/waters we actually needed so we never had to ask for refills. He was friendly and accommodating.\n\nYou must try the lobster Benedict on a biscuit. Make sure to grab the mini plate with the rubber utensil they give you at the cashier, or get one from a basket nearby cuz the plate was hot when I got it! \n\nI recommend the prime rib, medium? over the brisket and lamb. The latter were dry. There's also pizza and a flatbread with some smoked salmon and capers. Ooh! Their smoked salmon for the mini bagels are shaped into roses and topped with some thin green herb I forget the name of.\n\nI loved the breakfast tator tots with cheese! The corn beef hash was ok, I bit into one mini waffle fry but it was too salty. I didn't get any breakfast meats to save room. They have chicken and waffles in small frying baskets, similar to Wicked Spoon? I'll let you know if I ever get the chance to eat there. I'm pretty sure you can build your own sandwich because I saw a bunch of sliced bread baskets. \n\nThey truly highlight the seafood aspect of this buffet. When you first enter, they showcase a bunch of seashells and a slight beach theme to prepare the senses for chilled crab legs and claws. \n\nDessert. My forte in food. \nGet the green tea creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e. Absolutely amazing. I liked the pandan tiramisu, slightly more on the exotic side. Stephen, the gelato gentleman, kindly informed us of the many ways to enjoy the gelato: in a cup, between two almond or chocolate cookies, or on a mini cone dipped in Dark Choco with hazelnuts, or one dipped in Vanilla with coconut. I got pistachio gelato with the hazelnut cone and wish I had room for another. So many desserts, so little time! They had three cake pops: chocolate, strawberry, and pineapple tofu cheesecake. Sadly, I wasn't able to try any of them. \nThere's honestly a dessert for everyone's palette, from fruit or chocolate espresso tarts to green tea cookies, passion fruit/mango mousse in a silver painted eggshell, cake, gelato, etc. They all look too pretty to eat! I'll gladly dine here again."

S"This place is by far my favorite place to pig out. It's pretty pricey but I feel it is worth it. Service is great. Food is not the best, but better than majority of the buffets on the strip. There are a lot of options to choose from many different type of regions. I just wished they had some Mediterranean food. Tables and chair are comfortable to sit on. Some are even more plush than others. \nSometimes the seafood line merges with the carvery line which sometimes causes confusion. I see people wanting seafood  waiting in the very back of the line for carvery station. I got called out by someone for going into the seafood line and they wanted me to wait in the back of the carvery line, no one cared that I went into the seafood line, just that one person. After the altercation quite of few people who was at the carvery line just started to line up behind me because they wanted seafood, I guess. \nI love their new system of getting into the buffet. They have a kiosk where you sign in to get a ticket telling you when you can come back to the buffet. It's a pretty smart idea, you can kill time by gambling, drinking, or whatever before your check-in window, instead of waiting in line for hours to get seated. Just don't forget to bring that ticket with you.\n\nI would recommend coming here if you want to pig out and spend a lot of cash."

S'This was a great buffet! I took away 1 star because not everything hit the mark but a majority did. Also we missed the other half of the buffet half the time since it was hidden around the corner in another room. Of course there was a line but  for the length it went by pretty fast. We did go toward the end of the night. We chowed on everything from crab legs to prime rib (still on the rib,dinosaur size) to sushi and made to order ramen.  We will be back and will come more hungry!'

S"I was so excited to try out Bacchanal for the first time...I was a bit disappointed with my experience.  My mouth was watering after reading these amazing reviews, and once I coerced my friends into going, I left painfully full of mediocre food.\n\nWe went at the end of brunch on a Saturday, so paid a little less than $50 for unlimited mimosas.  That was a plus...I definitely got $50 worth of champagne.\n\nThe seating and the buffet stations were set up nicely in different food types.  I made a bee line for the seafood station, which was probably my favorite aside from the desserts.  They had huge jumbo shrimp, crab legs and oysters.  I would recommend getting the crab legs warm and don't forget the butter!  I enjoyed the miso glazed sea bass and the lobster corn chowder.\n\nNext, I had to try the carving station.  I tried the prime rib and pork belly...all super salty and dry.  Very disappointed.  Mac and cheese was ok.\n\nI would stay away from the sushi...sushi rice was not good and it is just filler anyway.  The dim sum station was decent.  Nothing else really stood out to me.\n\nThe dessert station is located in the middle of the restaurant and is filled with delicious gelato, chocolate dipped strawberries (huuugge!), mini-cakes, macarons and other delightful sweets.  \n\nPersonally, I would rather go to Wicked Spoon for brunch since they have bloody marys and an awesome dessert section as well!"

S'You have just been hit by a mack truck while crossing a street and you have unfortunately passed from this world to the next.  The next thing you do is come to in a bountiful buffet with everything your heart could ever desire.  My friend, great news, you aren\'t dead, you\'ve just been hit so hard by that truck that it knocked you all the way into the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace in Vegas.  However if you didn\'t know any better after one look at the offerings of this buffet you might think you were in heaven, and that\'s completely understandable.\n\nThere are buffet options as far as the eye can see, some hidden in the back, and even a huge desert counter in the middle of the place.  You name it and they probably have it at this buffet.  The website says that Bacchanal is like 9 restaurants in one place, and that means I missed 5 of them while I was there.  However, I did stuff my face with quite a bit...\n\nMy first plate had waffles and pancakes.  The next was pizza, some random cheeses, and some pasta primavera.  My last plate was fried chicken, mash potatoes, mac n cheese, and a slider.  When I put my last plate on the table in front of my friends I had no choice but to say out loud "\'MERIKA!!!".   \n\nYou want to talk about white trash dreams? Well I had mine when I was eating fried chicken and washing it down with champagne.  That\'s right, on the weekends there\'s unlimited champagne.  Being the boozers that we are, we even skipped the orange juice and just told them to keep the champagne coming.  They were surprisingly cool with that. \n\nIf you\'re in Vegas and you can\'t win big at the slots or the tables, then go here, because with a spread like this, everyone wins.'

S"After hearing all the hype about Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace 'dethroning' the legendary Bellagio Buffet in terms of food quality and quantity, I was very eager to dine here. I dined at Bacchanal during peak hours/days. I would highly recommend paying the extra $15.00 for the express lane pass rather than wait in line for 1.5 hours +. \n\nAttention seafood lovers: Line up here FIRST!!! The majority of people at the buffet line up in THIS LINE to get their hands on delicious king crab (just ask if you want it served warm and not chilled), yummy ceviche, and unfortunately, mediocre oysters. I started at the other stations and waited in the seafood line for a good 20 minutes before I received my crab, oysters, and ceviche. Much to my dismay, my food from the other stations was cold by the time I sat down. I forgot to grab a second plate and I basically formed an alliance with the other seafood philes to secure some extra plates for all of us so we did not lose our spot in line!\n\nBacchanal definitely has a lot of food options, but I would say the food is comparable to that of the Bellagio Buffet. Besides the fresh king crab, I enjoyed the dim sum/poke/carpaccio dishes the most. I liked the varieties of mochi, macarons, and Jelly Belly beans in the dessert area at Caesar's, but I would say Bellagio's desserts are more decadent and delicious. I have not been to the Bellagio Buffet since the addition of the caviar station, which may make it trump that of Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace. \n\nBottom line: Bacchanal Buffet is an expensive buffet, but if you want to burn some of your winnings here, it's a great bet!"

S'I was really skeptical about this "Best buffet in Vegas," after all ... it\'s in Caesar\'s. I mean it\'s an older casino ... it\'s not shiny and cool and crafty like Wicked Spoon or City Center and it\'s too easy to get in and out of (ha!) so ... how can it be suddenly THE BEST BUFFET in Vegas?\n\nI was extremely impressed by Bacchanal and I only came here during a week day. I don\'t know how they might pull out all the stops on a weekend. That would just be insane. \n\nI love that all buffets in Vegas now portion control, so I could have several plates of very small things and try just about everything I *loved* my tiny tiny breakfast burrito and miniature sized belgian waffle because it allowed me to try out other goodies in their dim sum and hot foods section as well as the insane spread of desserts.\n\nThe other thing I thought was amazing was that some things don\'t scale well. Like it\'s hard to make a tiny breakfast burrito and have it hold together but contain all of the flavors of one, or a delicious moist but perfectly crunchy on the outside belgian waffle in such a small package. They really have thoroughly thought through all of their foods and the variety is astonishing.\n\nAll of the staff are extremely friendly, although I don\'t get the little rubber thing that they give you ... and I forgot to carry it with me at almost all times. I love that they had coffee and tea at the table so you don\'t have to ask for it forty times, and CREPE BAR. MADE TO ORDER.\n\nThe end.\n\nDisclaimer is that I didn\'t pay for this place, I may have felt differently if I paid whatever the obscene cost was to dine here or someone I cared about paid. Totally worth it otherwise lol'

I hate waiting for food.\n\nThe food was okay, the layout was a little weird and the giant mirrors made the place seems huge but it was also misguiding.\n\nI tried the prime rib, clam chowder, tator tots, fried chicken, pasta, risotto, and a bunch of other stuff. My favorite was the fried chicken, it had a flakey, buttery skin and fried perfectly. \n\nThe dessert was okay, I had higher expectations since it looked so beautiful.'

S"Bacchanal = A feast worthy of the gods\n\nDuring my last visit to Vegas last weekend, I made a stop at Bacchanal. I called them at 3:15 PM to check the prices and see how long the wait was. The guy on the phone told me it was $50.99 and told me about their new Fast Pass-like system that they implemented for about a month now. It's just like being at Disneyland! Expensive and has Fast Pass! If you're not familiar with Disneyland's Fast Pass, let me explain. You get a ticket that tells you what time to come back so that you don't have to waste your time waiting in line. Whoa, awesome!\n\nI don't know how and why, but we took a lifetime getting ready and didn't get to Bacchanal until about 6:00. I was happy to find the machines that issued our Fast Pass to return at 7:45 PM. You can even input your phone number so that they can text you 5 minutes before you have to return to the cashier. Very clever, Caesars. I see right through your ploy. Now people have time to gamble while waiting for your buffet! Lucky for me, I actually won three bills from the slot machine while I waited for the buffet. I was also able to squeeze in some shopping time during my wait.\n\nI got a text at 7:40 telling us to return to Bacchanal. A cashier took my payment, which was actually $52.99 per person ($2 more than what was quoted over the phone!!), and told me that the line would take approximately 40 minutes. WTF. Another line??? By this point, my husband and I were starving. The poor guy looked like he was about to faint. Since there were only two of us, we got a seat after 30 minutes of waiting. So, total wait time: 2 hours and 15 minutes. \n\nAs other reviews state, the food is quite good. They have a meat station, seafood station, Mexican station, Asian station, Italian station, salad station, and a dessert station. \n\nSome things to note about the buffet: \n\n-I have to make a statement that their prime rib is superb. It's probably the best prime rib I have had at a buffet, and I've eaten at a lot of buffets! \n-Their seafood station only has snow crab legs, which you can get chilled or steamed. Unfortunately, there are no King crab legs. \n-Their Asian station has porridge and three types of soup: udon, pho, and ramen. Their porridge is quite tasty. I enjoyed their pho, although the broth was a little on the bland side. Two limes fixed that problem. Their ramen was not good. \n-Their dessert station has a made to order crepe station with nutella! Yum! They have mochi at the dessert station as well, but my husband said it tasted like supermarket mochi. \n-Ambiance was very hip with dance music playing. \n-Very comfortable seating\n\nOverall, Bacchanal still has a ridiculous wait time that is slightly improved with their new Fast Pass system. Their prices are ridiculously high for a buffet, but the quality/taste of most of their food lets them get away with it. For now, this is one of the best buffets in Vegas."

S'Let\'s start the year off with Gluttony!!!!\n\nWell, not full gluttony, but a review of Gluttony.  So the Bacchanal Buffet has been touted as being the best buffet on the Las Vegas Strip.  That\'s a pretty tall order considering the amount of competition they have.  I mean, Las Vegas is synonymous to the word Buffet... or was it the other way around?  Either way, that statement is a HUGE statement.  \n\nMy verdict?  Over-hyped!!! Why?  I was told it\'s a mind blowing amazing buffet that has huge amounts of variety and great quality.  When I got in, I was presented with a decent variety with decent quality.  I think people see all the stations sprawled out about the walls and think that it\'s a ton of different variety.  In all reality, I think it\'s the same (okay maybe a little more) as the other major buffets, but just against the wall.  So when people say it\'s a huge variety, this was a disappointment.  \n\nQuality was another thing that was said to be amaze-balls.  Was it great?  No!  The wifey and the in-laws all said it too, "It\'s good for a buffet".  If somewhere is going to be the BEST of the best, you can\'t add that "for a buffet" at the end of the statement, that\'s just cheating!   That\'s just not right!!!  The seafood station was okay, they had oysters, shrimp, crab legs, the usual fare.  Just nothing stood out.  The shrimp were slimy and the crab claws were poorly cut and had very little meatiness.  \n\nIn all reality, based on Quality and Variety, I\'d probably give it a 4 star.  I mean, it is good.  Not amazing, but it is good.  Why 3 stars?  I had to wait 2.5 hours for this.  TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!!!  We went in at 4 o\'clock thinking we\'d beat the rush, nope!  After standing there for that long, after having asshats of people cut in front of us (who gave me dirty looks when i wouldn\'t move out of their way to cut), it was just not worth it!   The only saving grace for the line was that they had some computer kiosks that the wifey and I figured out how to get to the windows prompt.  Because it\'s vegas and everyone\'s watching, i put it almost back to normal.  Everyone behind us thought they were geniouses because they pulled up ms paint and had fun playing with it.  Your welcome. \n\nTo add insult to injury of 2.5 hours of my life wasted in line, the price was insane.  We paid ~$60 pp NOT including tip.  They called it "Holiday pricing".  We called it a rip off since they didn\'t even have alaskan king crab legs (which i actually didn\'t mind.  I prefer snow crab).  \n\nI read a lot of reviews with all the things they had before, and honestly, I think they did what all other buffets did.  Start of with great quality and decent prices. Once you get your name out there, jack up the prices and then let the quality slowly degrade.  That way no one knows the wiser.  Me?  I\'ll stick to Wynn.\n\nTL:DR - Over-hyped.'

S'Overrated, over priced and over hyped.\n\nAfter a three year hiatus from Vegas and studying a variety of reviews, articles, status updates, tweets, and listening to chatter from those who enjoyed this majestic buffet I left unimpressed. Sure it looks cool, but I\'m not paying for an architectural tour. \n\nPrice point wise it\'s the highest. It\'s not top shelf quality and execution. This distinction belongs to Wynn, Wicked Spoon and even Bellagio. It might be worth it if they bring their price down. Additionally, it cost me $26.95 for my four year old.\n\nWhen I think of any buffet I\'m always partial to the carving station. To me, this is fundamental component of every good buffet. It\'s like when I test a great ice cream place I\'m not falling for the gimmicks, bells, and whistles. I want to know how your vanilla tastes like. If it\'s a wedding, I don\'t care about your photo booth, how was your wedding cake. Well, this carving station fell short. Real short. The prime rib was extremely dry. Lacked salt and any kind of savory flavor. I even asked for an edge piece and it still lacked any depth. The brisket was a little better, but also dry too. The ribs were the best, good smoke ring.\n\nMaybe if they didn\'t bother with the meat and cheese spread they could have put more effort in their "American" station. The Mexican station was also disappointing. The carnitas were very dry. The agua frescas were the only redeeming parts of that station.\n\nThe Asian stations, the desserts and the seafood station were probably it\'s best features, but for a bay area native I was not lured by their Asian offerings. If I wanted seafood I would have somewhere else. If they had a dessert buffet option price I would reconsider returning.\n \nQuality, not quantity is what\'s lacking. I won\'t be endorsing it unless you have money to throw away or want to spend most of your time at the dessert station.'

S"Mm.... mixed feelings. Overall, great buffet spread, but if I'm paying $60.00+ for dinner, I expect greatness. So please, excuse me if I sound nit-picky. Verdict: 3.5 stars.\n\nAnd since there are so many reviews about this buffet as is, I'm just going to keep things succinct  by listing out the positives and not-so-positives. \n\nPositives: \n+ Many stations available: seafood spread (King crab legs, green mussels, raw clams, cocktail shrimp, oyster shooters, cooked variations of shellfish), BBQ-esque spread (cutting station with lamb rack, prime rib, brisket, sausage links; assortment of sides), soup station (chicken noodles), Mexican/Latino station (made-to-order tacos, carnitas, appropriate condiments, beverages), Italian (pasta), Asian-influenced spread (sushi, to-order noodles, dimsum, Thai/Indian, Asian soups), and a salad station. \n+ The oxtail soup from the Asian cuisine stand was good. Simplicity really is the best. \n+ Made-to-order tacos were BOMB! Ask them to heat up the tortilla and stuff it with juicy fatty carnitas on your own = foodgasm. \n+ Glazed cornish hen = bomb. Another point as to how simplicity is often best. \n+ Desserts were overall pretty good! Please do get that extra helping of gelato. Please do try them chocolate dipped strawberries and the tasty cupcakes. Yummm! \n\n\nNot-So-Positives:\n- So many foods yet a good portion of them weren't all that great. Aside from the oxtail soup, avoid ALL other items in the Asian section. I kid you not. Such a disappointment.\n- Crab legs were not as good as I anticipated. Partly my own fault because I over-hyped it as I was waiting in line to go into the restaurant... Even if I did go to the Italian stand and ask for hot crab legs, the meat wasn't as fleshy or as tasty as  I would've expected. \n- Aside from the prime rib (which was a bit grisely for my taste), I didn't like any of the other meat cuts. Brisket too oily, lamb was flavorful but too hard to chew... ugh. \n- Don't get the creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e... it had a funky texture to it. Almost custard-like, and not in a pleasant way. \n- Salad bar was lacking beyond belief... \n\nEh... not worth it in my opinion. Good but not great."

Eat me!". hahaha, just saying. \n\nI hate where the plates are and I also thing the glass is too low that it was hard to scoop the things out without spilling them. \n\nI waited in line for an hour and  I just didnt feel impressed.

S"This buffet was supposed to change my mind about how I don't really care for buffets. I was really hoping it would. But, alas, it did not.\n\nEverything they had seemed like standard buffet fare. Quality was good, but it wasn't THAT much better than the other good buffets I've had in Vegas (Encore and Cosmo). I WAS impressed to see they had chinese bbq style roast duck. THAT was unique and different. So was their asian noodle bar (pho, udon, ramen). \n\nOf course I had my fill of their snow crab legs and oysters, both were good quality. I was just expecting Bacchanal to WOW me...damn you people who hyped it wayyyy too much for me. :P"

S'Bacchanal is a place I will continue to visit every time I come to Vegas. We went on a Saturday around 1pm for their brunch.  The $45 per person price included unlimited mimosas, which seemed to be better than average, and they did not skimp on the alcohol.  Wait time from when we first got in line until we were seated was a reasonable 20 mins.  Our waiter Carlos was polite and prompt with our drinks.  The selection was seemingly limitless with their buffet areas broken out in sections, ie a seafood section, breakfast, mexican, italian and asian. Sushi to sashimi to crab legs and claws, it was all there and never in short supply. I started with breakfast, some corn beef hash, bacon, chicken and waffles and red velvet pancakes. All delicious, however the red velvet pancakes were nothing special. The pizza was delicious, as well as some of the ribs they were serving.  If you like desert then you certainly want to save some room, boutique pastries to gummy bears, my favorite was the mango Italian Gelato, I added some to my mimosa and ended up having 3 more. Highly recommend Bacchanal if you are in Las Vegas.'

S"Ok first of all this 5 star system really irks me sometimes, because in all honesty I would give this place a 4.5. It is by far one of the best buffets I have tried in Vegas (next to the Wynn Buffet) but not the best food ever! However, I am leaning more towards the 5.\n\nTheir selection is AMAZING. Things that were really delicious are listed below:\n- Lamp chops. Okay first of all, I am not really into lamb but their lamb chops did not taste game-y at all. AMAZING.\n- Buffalo wings. Ok seriously delicious, in a perfectly portioned 2 pieces in a mini bucket (ADORBS)\n- Pretty much any potato thing you could think of, all were SO GOOD: mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries (came with fried chicken), potato skins, potato wedges.. and probably more\n- Fried chicken. \n- Oysters. I'm not a big oyster fan but these were GOOD and very very fresh!\n- Seaweed salad \n- Korean short ribs\n- DESSERT!!!! Almost every dessert I tried was good, which is embarassing because I tried alot. This deserves its own list below\n\nDesserts:\n- Tiramisu (reminds me of that of Portos in Glendale. So good!!)\n- Cheescake pops (not too overwhelming like many other cake pops I have tried)\n- Creme Brulee (I'm a chocolate person, and these were pretty damn good)\n- Crepe bar (I just about screamed when I saw this. lol Pretty good I was too full to eat the entire thing)\n- Mini chocolate cupcake (very good)\nThe dessert bar was my favorite part n_n\n\nThings I found mediocre:\n- Prime rib. I have come to the conclusion that if you want good prime rib, cook it yourself or go to a prime rib joint. \n- The asian selections (minus that which was mentioned above)\n- Crab legs are better at the Wynn\n\n\nAll in all, I would say Bacchanal and the Wynn are my favorite Vegas buffets. Wicked Spoon is right below. I guess it depends on what you're looking for. \n\nThe line for Bacchanal was insane, on a 4 pm Saturday afternoon... It's nice because you can pay $20 extra for an express pass to skip the line. Don't come at dinner time (6 ish) because when we left the line probably had a few hundred people."

Fancy-ish buffet so it comes with a not so cheap price but they have an extensive plethora of food from different ethnicities so my palate is satisfied. My most recent visit here was back in June and I was actually pretty surprised how authentic their ph\xc3\xb4 was when the hubby to be grabbed a bowl (since somebody was shit faceted the night before).

S'Bacchanal buffet is a relatively new buffet in Las Vegas located in Caesars Palace. It\'s definitely on the pricey side, about $58 per person.  The wait can be long if it\'s a busy day. If you\'re super hungry and want to eat right away, there\'s an extra $20 charge.  I wasn\'t lying when I said pricey!\n\nThis buffet is nicely decorated and they even offer taking your picture while waiting in line\n\nLet\'s first start off with how HUGE this place is. In the back is the Asian foods, then there\'s salads, Mexican food, American food, and sea food. The seafood line gets long as they have crab legs and oysters. They also have steamed crab legs near the salad.  \n\nDessert area is good too!  I had the shaved ice and tried macaroons. The first time I was here, they had bomb pistachio macaroons. Recently, I got green macaroons thinking they were pistachio, but they were green tea!  Disappointing!  I guess they switch it up. Oh, the horchata is good!!\n\nBuffets for me are kinda a waste of money because I can\'t eat a lot in one sitting. Bacchanal buffet is a good place to try out but it\'s a bit pricey for me to eat here often. Give it a try if you can. \n\nPs, if you or someone in your party are a total rewards diamond or platinum member, you can bypass the line!\n\nMinus 1 star for the rude worker!  He was directing people to go in the right line. My husband is a diamond member. We paid and proceeded to the diamond line to get seated. This RUDE worker rushed to us said wait wait go in this line (regular line).  He didn\'t even ask "excuse me, are you diamond."  It was just an assumption we were idiots and can\'t read the signs. He didn\'t even apologize. I tried to look for him later to get his name, but darn I didn\'t.'

S"I'm getting started on my Vegas reviews with Bacchanal.  I chose Bacchanal as my birthday dinner because I have been DYING to eat here since it opened.  Unfortunately, it didn't really give me all I expected.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good buffet and they have a huge selection and most of what I ate was good, but I can get that at any buffet.\n\nFirst, for dinner Sunday  night, it was $50.  We were just getting started on the buffet of buffets (feeling like this was the best way to hit Harrah's Groups buffets) so it was actually a $25 upcharge to the BoB to have dinner at Bacchanal.  Fine.  The line was about 30 minutes to get rung up and then another 15-20 to wait for a table.  Fine.\n\nWe get seated and head for the food parade and that's where I fell flat.  I started with the sushi as I've been wanting cold fresh items on this trip for some reason.  And it was nice that they did have more than just California rolls, including nice tuna ngiri which is what I love.  And, it was good, but I would have liked some soy sauce but there were no containers anywhere to put soy sauce and wasabi in!  In fact, throughout this visit, I found it incredibly hard to use any of the condiments because containers were few and far between.  I found myself using soup bowls for my horseradish, etc.  Crazy.\n\nThey do have a lot of little baskets and containers of things, they just happened to be things that didn't jump out at me, but some were super interesting if you like buckets of mussels, etc. then this is pretty cool.  But, they do the same thing at the Cosmopolitan Wicked Spoon Buffet and I just liked that one better for this type of buffet.\n\nI think that in trying to have SO many dishes, the dishes they have fall flat.  Example is the carving station.  It is seriously LOADED with meats and sausages... pretty much anything you want is there.  I wanted Prime Rib.  For me, that is my buffet staple because they always have it and I rarely order it.  But the Prime Rib was so dry and tough, I was shocked.  That was not acceptable for a buffet of this caliber.\n\nI had the same problem at the dessert bar.  The creme brulee wasn't set and was runny.  It wasn't good.  I was excited about the made to order souffles that they have because that and the crepe station were exactly what I expected them to have, but they only had banana souffles which is the one flavor I do not like, so I had to pass.  But the freshly  made crepes were delish.  Honestly, my favorite part was the dessert and they have a huge selection of mochi!!!  LOVED that.\n\nSo the money to food ratio made this not such a great value to me.  It was a disappointment and I don't expect to eat there again unless I had a complimentary opportunity to try again.  I would be happy at The M and their Studio B Buffet where the food is fantastic AND they have beer and wine included for like $30pp!\n\nIf you are going, I noticed the line went WAY down about 15 minutes before closing.  Might save you some time."

S"8 trips to Vegas, and I finally make it to Bacchanal, and it was just about everything I hoped for. The price is steep, with lunch prices comparable to other well regarded Vegas buffets' dinner prices ($34.99 + tax/tip for lunch), but even so I would come back here every time and not think twice.  As per usual, I came about 15 minutes before the dinner switch over (no line on a weekday afternoon), and got to try the best of both worlds at lunch pricing.  \n\nHighlights:  The brisket, goodness, was the best brisket I have ever had.  I have yet to visit Austin, so I reserve the right to retract this, but it was the perfect combination of tenderness, smoke and seasoning.  Pad thai was also really delicious, and incredibly spicy, which I like.  Other fantastic offerings include wagyu beef sliders, peking duck, sweet potato and truffle tater tots, and rack of lamb.  In fact, a combination of all of the above would probably make my last meal if I face the electric chair.  The desserts were quite varied, from made-to-order ice cream sandwiches, cake pops, green tea creme brulee, crepes, shaved ice and every cake-y dessert imaginable, although I'm not sure anything was super memorable.\n\nAll in all, absolutely the best buffet I've tried in Vegas.  For comparison, I went to Bellagio's weekend dinner the following afternoon and it didn't hold a candle.  I make the cross-country flight to Vegas almost annually, and the chance to relive Bacchanal is one of the few things that entice me to keep the streak going."

S"BEST BUFFET EVER. LITERALLY. WORTH THAT $55! \nBETTER THAN WICKED SPOON. \n\nGosh this place is amazing. I was dying to come here. This place is super spacious and the table spacing itself is huge! Big enough for my numerous plates of food! Bacchanal is like a fancy restaurant serving EVERYTHING and ANYTHING you could imagine. Even their Asian dishes are pretty bomb. I underestimated their pho/ramen/udon (geez tons of noodle bowl choices right?) but wow they were even better than a cheap Asian restaurant! \n\nI went straight to the crab legs! Theres stacks and stacks of crab and it is all FRESH! So happy they cut it open for you, so all you have to do is, EAT! \nWe were there for breakfast continuing onto lunch and their eggs and sausage were so tasty! They keep the food vibrant in color and it honestly tastes as good as it looks. \n\nThere was a cute little chili dog station with fries, and sweet potatoes. The meat station with ribs and prime rib was pretty popular, but I didn't feel like eating that. It was nice to see the Mexican, pizza and soup and salad stations, but I just ate the crabs and went straight to the desserts right after! \n\nTheir gelato wasn't too impressive. But their cakes were! I am a sucker for Pan Cotta and they had amazing pan cotta trio with chocolate and mango! \n\nHonestly you need to experience this place for yourself!

S"I ate 'til I hurt.  It hurt good.\n\nI came to dinner at 4:30pm on opening day (less than 10 minute wait).  With time, they could iron out a few miss cues, but I will definitely return as it is one of the better buffets for 45 bucks on the 24 hour pass.\n\nI wouldn't advise on the all you can drink option, their options of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon tasted watered down and actually took away from the experience.  I wouldn't drink beer as it's a waste of space from all of their buffet offerings.\n\nAsian food was fair - they did have good sesame balls, offered pretty good pho, respectable ramen, with a few misses in their Chinese cuisine.\n\nSalad bar is a salad bar, nothing to complain there.\n\nI did have an issue with their brisket as it was on the dry side, but was well seasoned.  Best served with their bbq sauce, but nothing to write home about.\n\nTheir seafood is one of their strongest points as it was served fresh - crab legs, oysters, shrimp and all\n\nSliders were savory but were cooked medium, not my preference in temperature.\n\nTheir desert island was pretty good for the most part.  By then, I was ready to throw in the towel, but their bread pudding and my addition of their baklava flavored gelato finished me off."

S'Honestly this place is overhyped.  Dinner prices have gone up to about $50 on the weekend.  It was worth about $30.  The wait was about 1.5 hours on a Saturday night at 8:30 PM...  We got in and then on my second trip they started shutting down the stations.  WTF!  No oysters worth eating (they put out leftover mini oysters...)  The crab legs were older and the chef "refreshed" them by dumping them in hot water and then serving them to us with all sorts of leftover pieces of crab meat hanging all over the crab legs.  HOW APPETIZING!  There is a lot of variety here that is for sure, but nothing really tastes amazing.  Wicked spoon is still the king of the Las Vegas strip buffets.    The prime rib was good and so was the mac and cheese.  I honestly don\'t remember much else.  Unless I get comped, I won\'t be coming back here.'

S"My husband and I were in town for the marathon last weekend. We heard that we should try out a buffet while staying in Vegas so our search for the buffets began. The reviews for the Bacchanal Buffet were so good that this was our first buffet destination stop. We went on a Saturday morning which we didn't know that weekends are their champagne brunch. The price shook us a little with being round $47/pp but we decided with so many great reviews and being in Vegas on vacation we might as well splurge. Needless to say the money was well worth the trip! The food was of good quality, so many selections from sushi to various meat stations to seafood to desserts. The serving line for each station was extremely clean, the chefs were friendly, the mimosas were endless! Our server was efficient (always bringing us refills and clearing the table) and super friendly! We definitely recommend this place at least once!"

We had:\n\nFreshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber\nSmoked salmon & cold shrimp\nSteak & egg\nBiscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots\nFried chicken and waffles\nSorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange\n\nThere were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.\n\nThe juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.\n\nOn the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.\n\nThe remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.\n\nI would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line."

S"Amazing buffet. It was my second time eating here yesterday and it did not disappoint. I went with friends in town for dinner so the price on a Sunday was a hefty $55 but it did not disappoint. First time I was here was back in November on a Saturday early noon and the line was about a 20 minute wait. Yesterday, Sunday around 4:30pm there was no wait in line at all, but there was a rush of people whe we concluded our meal. \n\nOn my first trip to this buffet, I had one of the best cooked prime ribs I'd ever had. On my second trip here, I strayed away from that and instead focused more on the seafood.\n\nPresentation was unlike anything I've seen before. They had tiny little cute buckets of wings or fried chicken pieces with fries. The lasagna was served on a tiny skillet with a decent amount of meat and the sauce, was UNBELIEVABLE. The chef's special was also served on a tiny cute little iron pan and it was a lightly breaded calamari.\n\nOn my first trip, I thought the shrimps were bigger and the king crab legs were small portions and were also very salty. But I realized this was only because it was busier back in November when I went as there was a 5min wait to get the king crabs. This second time around, there was alot less of a wait and I just realized the workers there can serve you warmed up king crab that is dipped in hot water. I got my king crab served this way this time around and they were far less salty and on point and of course, dipped it in the melted butter!! \n\nIn the seafood section I also enjoyed the baked salmon, pan seared halibut, mussels, half shell oysters, corn lobster bisque, the large shrimp, and an amazing oyster shooter! \n\nInstead of prime rib, I thought I'd try the pork ribs and the lamb chops. The chops were amazing and very juicy! The pork ribs, on the other hand were not so much. \n\nI was hoping for standing chocolate ice cream but they had one that had cinnamon that I wasn't too big a fan of. \n\nOverall, this place is highly recommended by me if you have friends in town."

S"This is the King of Buffets. Or should I say Emperor.  Caesar's Palace set out to create pure decadence and gluttony and succeeded on so many levels.  Of course the ancient romans had the vomitoriums ( a practice frowned upon in modern day Vegas) and could probably eat much more than we can.  I don't even mind the price or the long lines. Realistically, to get the same quality food for dinner you would pay as much if not more per person and have far less food. Here is the best tip ever.  If you want to pay only 27 dollars per person and have almost no line, do midweek lunch.  You will miss the fresh crab legs and a few carving choices but the rest of the food is amazing from the lobster bisque and clam chowder, shrimp and grits, fresh Italian meat choices, Wagyu Beef sliders that are the best sliders I have ever tasted.  The waitresses are pleasant but the best staff members are those behind the counter making the food and explaining it to the customers.  Don't be afraid to ask.\n\nMy favorites are:\n\nItalian Meats - 7 varieties of salami, proscuitto, etc.  The cheese selection is a little thin and could use a soft cheese choice.\n\nThe oriental duck and pork - right next to the sushi. (BTW yesterday I had some amazing shrimp tempura sushi.)\n\nWagyu Beef Sliders and Sweet Potato Tots.\n\nChicken Wings\n\nLobster Bisque and Clam Chowder\n\nShrimp Gritz\n\nPaella\n\nSpecialty sausage\n\nSlab bacon. (don't ask, just try it. And don't worry about the calories).\n\nThe desert bar is a treat of its own with amazing gelato flavors and a seemingly endless variety of chocolate delights.  They have watermelon mint, sour cherry, spicy chocolate, etc.\n\nFor dinner they have king crab legs made right in front of you, more meat variety including Lamb and Veal, and well, more food.\n\nThis is the finest buffet in Vegas and in my top 10 of Vegas dining must goes."

S"Bacchanal is the biggest, newest buffet in Vegas. All inside Caesar's Palace. Naturally, being one of the newest and hyped as one of the best, lines for this place last almost 3 hours.\n\nLuckily, someone had a VIP card which meant that 3hr wait turned into 15 minutes.\n\nEverything is typical Vegas buffet once you get in, which is to say, nice. But you realize just how massive it is once you get your food. You could get lost just going from station to station.\n\nIt's got everything all the other buffets have and they even have freshly squeezed juice for lunch. The Texas squeezed orange juice being the best which explains why it runs out so quickly.\n\nThe crab legs weren't spectacular. Possibly because it's pre-cut and iced already. The oyster shooters were good though. Everything else was decent. I didn't get to try all the food here but what I did try, it was good enough. Not all it was hyped up to be but I'd still eat it and enjoy it.\n\nDinner lines do get long. Especially for the meats (prime rib, lamb, etc). Standing in that may be a 10 minute wait in and of itself.\n\nAll in all, it's a good experience but other buffets are comparable and the lines for those are going to be shorter.

S"My family and I came in on a Saturday around 11am. I was expecting to wait a while, because it was the weekend, but we didn't wait at all. We walked right up to the front, paid and were quickly seated. For a party of 4, our bill came up to almost $200. Yeah, I got a little weak in the knees but we really wanted to try this place. \n\nAs soon as you start making your rounds, you'll notice that Bacchanal offers food that would normally be served at a nice restaurant. It's hard to describe the experience, but it is definitely worth your money. You could taste the time and effort they put into their food. It's like eating at 10 different high-end restaurants at once. Of course, you should save room for dessert. They have everything from gelato, macarons, fruit cups, pastries, etc. \n\nIn the beginning, you'll feel a little skeptical about how much money you just spent. But it will feel very worth it in the end.\n\nBacchanal is a MUST when in Vegas. Just be prepared for possible long waits!"

I did like the assortment though as the dishes were more thought out (ie: the salad bar isn't just a bowl of leaves, but endive salad with shrimp or something like that). They also had a juice bar..the guava juice was delicious!\n\nPricey - $58 for dinner buffet."

S'Food coma...must stay awake...must write review...\n\nI\'ve been waiting to try Bachannal and tonight, a few friends and I finally went after shopping.  At 5:30pm there was already a long line.  Since I don\'t gamble, I don\'t have a rewards card so we had to stand in line for 30 minutes which allowed us to chat while waiting.  I paid $54.04 per person and I think it was worth the money.\n\nAs soon as you get in, you\'re greeted by seafood: crab legs, oysters, clams, mussels, shrimps, etc.  Since I\'m allergic to that stuff, I didn\'t bother trying it (one allergic reaction per week is my quota). Then you pass through the American station (sliders, ribs, BBQ, rib eye, sausage, onion rings, prime rib, tater tots, corn on the cob, truffle potatoes, sweet potato fries, etc), Mexican station (salsa, tortilla, etc) and dessert station (macarons, gelato, cakes, cupcakes, tarts, fruits, cake pops, creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, bread pudding, crepes, etc) in the middle. The charcuterie (mortadella, coppa, salami, prosciutto, mocecta and air-dried sausages),  and cheese stations plus Italian (pizza, ziti, stromboli, etc) and Asian (sushi, pho, ramen; salty and spicy fish, bao, shumai, hargao, dumplings and other Chinese dishes) stations are in the back.\n\nI was so excited about the pho and ramen.  I ordered a bowl of pho and I asked the two chefs "where\'s the noodles?" and they kept pointing at it and I was like "all I see is broth?" so I gave them back my bowl and shamelessly asked for more - much better.  If I were on a diet, I wouldn\'t be at a buffet.  Also, try the salty and spicy fish.\n\nLet\'s talk about desserts...they have mini vanilla cupcakes, mini chocolate cupcakes and mini red velvet cupcakes (with extra tart cream cheese frosting), chocolate brownie tart (skip the tart and just eat the chocolate brownie on top), cake pops and tiramisu were nothing to write home about.  The chocolate and passion fruit dessert was not good.  I give them A for effort on the macarons.  They\'re not fantastic.  In fact, the pistachio, orange and rose all tasted so artificial and only the vanilla and chocolate macarons were good.  They\'re hard to make though.  The desserts I did enjoy were chocolate creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, fig & balsamic gelato, baklava gelato and Aztec chocolate gelato.\n\nNow the best buffets in Vegas in my opinion include: Wynn, Bellagio, Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan and Studio B at M (my favorite).  For having pho, ramen, unusual gelati, macarons, charcuterie, salty and spicy fish (YUM!!!), crepes and juicy sliders - Bacchanal deserves 5 stars.  The quality of fish they use for their sushi isn\'t as fresh as Studio B\'s.  Just imagine this, if Wicked Spoon (single serving plating) and Studio B (delicious variety) had a buffet baby...Bacchanal would\'ve been it.'

S"HOLY BUFFET, BATMAN!  Bacchanal is were it's at.  We went for the lunch buffet on a Friday afternoon and the line wasn't too long at like 1:00 p.m.  I think we waited about 25 minutes to get in.  Lunch buffet is about $36 with tax and it's worth every penny.\n\nWhen you enter, it's like looking at endless counters of food... they just keep going and going and going.  There's so much food that it's impossible to even sample one of everything.  The counters are organized by region (type of cuisine) and there's everything from Thai, Japanese, Tex-Mex, southern, seafood, salads and desserts.  \n\nMust eats: compote of pureed potatoes with truffle, beet salad, biscuits and gravy, short rib and sushi.  The fresh cutlery counter is fabulous and offers sausage, ribs and other meats for the slicing.  \n\nI advise avoiding the Tex-Mex just because the stuff wasn't very good.  Tortillas were all greasy, chips were greasy and the fajita fixins were mediocre.  \n\nThe desserts were fabulous and there's a fairly large gelato counter that I highly recommend visiting.  The fig and balsamic gelato is excellent.  Cheesecake was good, cake pops good, sorbets good, carrot cake mediocre (sad).  \n\nAll in all, worth a visit and the wait, even if you're not staying in Caesar's."

S"I love this buffet! We've been there twice now on separate occasions and I still love this place. \n\nThe food tastes great, everything is presented so well and delicately, the only this is the wait before you get into the buffet. \n\nThe food is sectioned into different types: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, American, Mexican, Italian, seafood, and etc. Most of the food there tastes delicious, but there is so much selection, it's hard to get a taste of everything.\n\nThe food presentation gets an A+. The way they present the food only makes you want to try it because of the way they present it.\n\nThey even started a fresh juice/water section with hibiscus water, mango juice, and horchata. NOM.\n\nNow.... everyone complains about the wait, but i think it's worth it. Get there a little early, or a little later than normal dinner hours. THat'll help. Unfortunately, there really isn't a way around the wait because it's a rather new buffet and they really do have good food."

S'Wow, I\'ve had my fair share of buffets in Vegas and this one holds my medal as of yet. I certainly never eat my share of buffet prices, but the quality and choices got me. There are a few themed sections such as Japanese (with sushi and soups), Chinese, Mexican, American with carving station and mini burgers & hot dogs and seafood all on it\'s own. Not to mention, a whole dessert bar with mini macaroons & several ice cream choices!\nI enjoyed the snow crab legs as they were meaty and sliced lengthwise for easy peeling. The sushi (salmon) was good to me. I did have the stone crab legs which were quite hard to eat as the meat was stuck to the shell. If I\'m not mistaken, this can be an indication of overcooking. Sweet and sour soup was pretty yummy and I\'ve had plenty in my lifetime. The mini burgers were quite "meaty" and chosen mostly for its appearance.\nDrinks (non-alcoholic) were included within the price (I only mention this because some buffets do not include beverages).\n\nBuffet ended at 10 pm on Thursday. We arrived at 9 pm and was still seated at regular price of $51+tax/person! The food discontinued serving at 10:30 pm and was plenty of time to eat. \n\nService was sufficient and pretty good. \n\nI\'m not quite sure what the other reviews experienced, but I\'m going to attribute that to really high expectations.'

S'People said Bacchanal is the best buffet in Vegas. Compared with the wicked spoon in Cosmopolitan, the buffet at Wynn, I decided to rank Bacchanal as the number ONE on my buffet list in Vegas. Why? The variety is definitely the top reason. No matter western or eastern, people from around the world can find the food they are familiar with. This place wow me by offering their guests abundant fresh seafood such as oyster and mussel. My dad enjoyed the T-bone steak very very much and even had two of them. I especially like their fruit crepe which is made immediately in front of me. I recommend this buffet for people who can not decide which buffet to go in this sin city!'

Hopefully the quality has improved since I've last dined here and maybe I'll give it a second try."

S"The GF had never done a Vegas buffet, so we ended up here after a bit of googling and determining that this is apparently the leading contender for Best Buffet.\n\nWe came on a weekend night, meaning it was just over $50 each, and a 90 minute wait.  \n\nThe choices are almost overwhelming, and they had pretty much everything you could want.  \n\nThe real thing that sets it apart from other buffets I've been to (I live in Reno, so a fair amount of experience with them) was the lack of large chaffing dishes.  Most items were cooked in single services - e.g. individual baskets of chicken fingers for kids, small, single-serve cast iron pans of lasagna, etc.  The stuff that wasn't in single serves was in really small dishes, maybe a dozen items.  Many of the items were things that I felt could be served as a regular menu item at most other restaurants.\n\nOther things that set this place apart were the fresh shucked oysters, a choice of hot or cold crab legs, and probably close to a dozen choices at the carving stations.\n\nThe one miss for me was the sushi - this was an exception to the individually prepared items - large trays of nigiri and rolls, and reminding me of a Todai or something.  Quality of the fish was just meh, the rice was not well seasoned, and the cuts of fish were sometimes not properly aligned with the grain of the flesh.\n\nI don't think we'd go back, but that's because we've had the experience, and for me, once is enough.  \n\nI think if you are looking for that big, grand, Vegas buffet, Bacchanal is probably the epitome of it."

S"I came here on a Monday night at 5:00 PM and there was NO LINE!!!! ZERO!!! WOOHOO!! Paid $45.99 (a little on the pricey end for a Vegas buffet) but it's worth at least one try. However, I definitely would NOT wait over an hour for this buffet. I can't believe some people wait 2 hours! It IS one of the better buffets in Vegas (possibly the best!) but I personally wouldn't want to wait that long for it. \n\nI definitely got my money's worth from all the oysters I ate! YUM! The oysters here are small and slightly sweet (similar to Kumamoto oysters... not sure if they were those exactly though). I loved how they weren't briney! Just add a little bit of lemon and tapatio and voila! perfecccction! I also really liked their cocktail shrimp. They also have crab legs, but if you want WARM crab legs, they're in a separate section towards the back near the Asian food! Just ask the guy for it and he'll grab them out of a hot pot and plate them for you! The crab legs that you see next to the oysters in the seafood section are cold. Those are the ones you just get yourself.  \n\nI liked how this buffet had a lot of their foods already plated so it was easy to just grab and go (similar to Wicked Spoon Buffet at the Cosmo). They also have a very wide variety of foods! Seafood, lots of meats (prime rib, lamb chops, etc. which were pretty good), Asian food (sushi, Chinese, etc), Italian, Mexican, seriously all kinds! One of my fave things I had was the corn on the cob. It sounds so simple and random but the flavor and the juiciness... OMG SO GOOD!! I also had a lobster corn bisque/soup which was amazingggg. I really enjoyed everything I ate here. \n\nI also really liked their dessert bar. They have the usual assortment of cakes, pastries, and cute little desserts like the other buffets. They can also make crepes! And they also have sorbets/ice cream as well as different flavors of mochi ice cream. Super soft and yummy! They also have macarons here!! I tried several different flavors and they were just A-OK. Not very consistent in terms of texture. Not as good as the ones at Bouchon Bakery so don't expect too much for the macarons. \n\nOverall beautiful buffet, definitely one of the best in Vegas! Worth a visit for sure!"

I really liked the consistency.  The sea bass, seafood paella, ramen, truffle scallop potatoes, and king crab were my favorite.  I\'ve never had a craving for any food when I go to Vegas..

S"HMMMM, changes being made here as Ceasars tries to figure out how to make money at this buffet.  First off prices have gone up!  Dinner is $46.95 mon-thur and $54.95 fri-sun.  You can still buy a 24 hour buffet pass but it is no longer worthwhile if you intend to use it on Bacchanal.  The pass is $55 plus $25 extra EVERY time you eat at Bacchanal whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner.  In effect it is cheaper just to pay the regular price if you intend to eat at Bacchanal more than once.\n\nPortion size has also been changed for a few items, the lobster corn chowder is in a smaller ramakin and no longer contains large pieces of lobster.\n\nThe made to order souffles are no longer in a ramakin and are being baked in foil cups, leading to the soufflies being over cooked.\n\nThe changes being made are sort of alarming as it makes you wonder if Caesar's will be able to continue this fabulous buffet or will quality suffer down the road."

S'I used to think the Bellagio buffet of 5-10 years ago was the end all of Vegas buffets, but in the past few years, the quality and impressiveness has seemed to go downhill a bit.  So, I\'m back on the best Vegas buffet search again.  The Bacchanal Buffet was fairly impressive in terms of quantity, presentation, variety, and quality.  The wait to get in may drive you to get the hunger shakes though.  I went on a Saturday around 4:30pm, thinking that the lines would be a little more manageable.  Wrong.  Based on the overheard conversations in line, it sounded like it was at least an hour and a half wait to get in.  But, there is a "back door" way in, as there always is in Vegas.  The only thing is that it\'ll costs you a bit more money.  For an additional $15 per person, you can go to the platinum/players club line (which was empty when I was there) and and get "fast tracked" ahead of everyone in the regular cashier line.  After paying, you have to wait in another fairly long line to get seated.  I think that by paying the extra $15, we were also seated a bit more quickly.  In total, we probably waited a total of 5-10 minutes and that included the cashier switching out the register, and were out about $70+ per person.     \n\nThe buffet itself is bustling with a lot of people in line for food, but the line moves fairly quickly, and they do a pretty good job of crowd control.  The seafood section (on the far left) is always the most crowded section.  However, if you want a plate piled high with warm crab legs, go to the middle of the Italian section (make sure to bring a clean plate with no other food on it) and look for the guy dishing out mounds of crab legs.  The variety and quality of dim sum was decent as was the Peking duck (meaty and succulent).  I\'m not a big meat eater so I wish they offered more vegetable options, but the truffled gratin potatoes were decadently rich and delicious.  My husband thought the prime rib was really flavorful and well cooked.  Other creative or interesting food/drink items were the agua frescas in the Mexican food section, lots of fresh fruit, custom made fresh soft tacos, and a jook (rice porridge) station.  The desserts were also an amazing display of decadence.  The buffet has the best gelato offerings I\'ve see at any buffet.  The flavors are creative and abundant.  And they pretty much have all the desserts you can find at other buffets, plus more (including mochi with ice cream).  \n\nThe Bacchanal Buffet really is and opulent display of food and one of the best in Vegas.  It\'s expensive but worth it if you\'re looking for an extra special buffet experience.'

S'4-4.5 stars. \n\nI\'m writing this revew on behalf of my family. Haha. We go to Vegas pretty much every  Christmas break (excluding last year). This year, we had three straight buffet meals: dinner at Bacchanal Buffet, breakfast/brunch at MGM buffet (we were staying at MGM so we got meal credit), and dinner at The Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan (amazing!!!) \n\nThis buffet, which re-opened in September, copies the original concept from The Wicked Spoon in which there are individual, warmed plates of food that you grab. The location is vast, fitting 600 seats and the decor modern and sleek. \n\nThe seafood here was really good. The oysters were so fresh (from Virginia). My mom and I rarely eat oysters at buffets because of being wary of food-born illness, etc. (or oysters, period, considering how expensive they are) but we thoroughly enjoyed slurping on them here. Yum. There were also snow crabs and king crabs. You could also get them hot or cold, which were nice options, although the line system and organization for them was a bit awkward.\n\nThe other food was forgettable to me, but solid. I had to look back at my photos just now to remember what I had that was notably good. There was nothing in particular, which might be expected at a buffet. But, I do remember more of my Wicked Spoon meal even if it was later.\n\nThe desserts were a feast for the eyes, but by the time I got to them, my stomach felt so heavy -- I had been deprived for too long as a NYC grad student. Hah. I did still try some small bites from several desserts though, and I think I did end up being underwhelmed with the tastes. The mochi ice cream is from Mikawaya, which is good, but I somehow didn\'t imagine their green tea to be so floral and "western tea" tasting...unless the green tea flavor in particular wasn\'t from Mikawaya? There were two creme brulee options -- the standard vanilla creme and a chocolate one! Both were delicious with good texture and consistency in creme and glazed sugar -- not soggy or mushy, etc.\n\nThe price at ~$45 for a weekday dinner (versus $50 for Friday - Sunday) is expensive, but seems to be a common price for Vegas buffets these days. I\'m not sure if it deserves its "#1 Vegas buffet" from USA Today, but I\'m open to going back to the buffet for its setting and various, solid options.'

S'I tried this last week, and I must say that I was severely disappointed. \n\n\nI\'ve read so many good things about this buffet and when they first opened up, I definitely wanted to try it due to the reviews & price. However, the price started to go up and up and when I went, it was already $46 per. It\'s not the price issue -- it really isn\'t. I\'m not afraid to pay for something that\'s worth my while. Heck, the wait wasn\'t even an issue either. I\'ve wanted 4+ hours for other buffets. It\'s just I don\'t think the Bacchanal Buffet left an impression on me.\n\n\nHowever, I do LOVE their rack of lambs. It was perfectly cooked and it was juicy/tender. It wasn\'t dry at all like how some places cook them. Another thing I loved was their personal soup bowl of "Black Chicken w/ Ginseng" at the Chinese corner. The ramen was good as well. The soup base for it was pretty decent and light rather than heavy. Other than those three, there wasn\'t much to celebrate about or brag about. \n\n\nI felt, in my opinion, that there wasn\'t enough variety. There wasn\'t really anything that screamed at me to try it. I didn\'t feel as though my $46+tax+tip was justified. It was a great experience, they had great service, and they were good .. but just not what I\'d imagine it to be. \n\n\nThe dessert section wasn\'t all that great either. \n\n\nI feel as though Wynn\'s buffet or the M Resort (Studio B) would be a better selection. Though their dessert section beats Wynn\'s dessert section. \n\n\nI would say try it for the experience but it\'s nothing "that" great.'

Although it was a bit embarrassing, I guess we stayed so long because we enjoyed it so much. \n\nSo my friends and I decided to buffet it up after three nights of clubbing... so yes, we definitely needed to recover. Wait time was only 15 minutes, so we were seated in no time.\n\nI'll admit - this is my first Vegas buffet, but damn, everything I put into my mouth was amazing. Here's some of my favorites!!! - \n\nMini deep fryers containing fatty goodness - corn dogs, tatertots, onion rings...\nFresh juices in cute little bottles\nRoasted duck + plum sauce\nOysters, mussels, shrimpies \nOyster SHOOTERS!\nPrime rib\nRib eye\nTruffle soup - i still have dreams about this\nKorean short ribs\nSalmon\nCorn on the cob\nSliders - soooo goood. \nPotato gratin - must try!!! I ate 3x of these. \nLobster bisque\nGelato, gelato, gelato! Try pistachio and baklava! Or everything \nCalamari with this coconut rice(?)\nDIY Crepes!!\nCreme brulee\nBroccoli & Cheese\nMac & Cheese\nAll the sushi\n....\n\nI'm probably missing a lot... but as you can see, we enjoyed everything! Every time we took a bite of something, we would sigh in pleasure or encourage each other to try it.  My vegan friend even broke her veganism that fine afternoon because the food was THAT good (sorry I'm not ratting you out!). \n\nService was good as far as I remember. The man cutting the meat was extremely polite and patient, which I liked. The gelato lady was kind, friendly, and didn't mind giving me several samples. Our waitress seemed nice, except for the part when she said there was a two hour time limit. Well, I'm sorry!! What if we all just had really really big appetites?\n\nPrice is reasonable (~$35 for lunch)! That filled me up for the rest of the day, so I thought it was worthwhile. I would come back, but probably wont stay as long. \n\nSo if you're DTB (down to buffet), I highly recommend this place!\n\n4.5 stars!"

S"Hands down one of the best buffets I've had in Vegas thus far! The lines for this place is ridiculous but now they seem to have a more organized system. You come check in and get a receipt with a return time on it. Come back by that time and wait in a slightly smaller line to pay for your meal and be seated.\n\nThey have a large variety of food selections. What particularly stood out for me is the quality in each of them. Every single thing I tasted was quite good or at least tasted what it should be like, unlike other buffets where they would be great in one thing and lack in another department. They have one of the best dim sums I've ever tried and their ramen was surprisingly tasty for a buffet-styled ramen. They have all sorts of different drinks including tamarind and horchata. I love horchata so I was so pleased! Their tacos were also amazing. I've tried almost everything they had there. It's amazing, you have to go experience for yourself!\n\nI believe it's $30 for lunch and $60 for dinner. I can't remember the exact prices. Their dinner time starts at 3pm, so if you come around 2:30pm you can pay for the lunch price yet still be able to get dinner selections! :)"

S'Very beautiful set-up and definitely better than 90% of the buffets in Las Vegas.  But some of the food had been sitting out too long taking away the fresh feel from their food selection... Their food could have been great if it was more fresh... It cluld have been because it was slow when we went so the food had been sitting out a little too long... Other than that I was happy with their selection and overall presentation of their buffet. But still not my favorite buffet... Cosmo beats them in freshness and cook to order feel.'

S'Buffet is really not my thing but I have been to many of them and Bacchanal is definitely a quality buffet with a vast selection.  We went around 10:30 and during the course of our meal they were starting to transition to lunch items.  They have all of the usual buffet items for a Vegas "global" theme - carving station with various meats, seafood (shrimp cocktail, mussels, oysters), Asian food (sushi, variety of stir fry, so-so dim sum), desserts galore, Mexican (tacos), breads, charcuterie and so much more.  Beautiful restaurant, service not as good as expected, roughly $30 per adult, I believe.'

S"So this place opened since my last visit in 2011...and holy damn why wasn't it open earlier??? The Strip needed a place like this!\n\nBacchanal has easily the biggest seafood options out of all the buffet restaurants in The Strip, ranging from oysters to mussels, clams, crab legs, crab claws, lobster bisque, etc. They also have various cuisines ranging from Italian to Indian to Chinese in the far corner, and also have great dessert displays that are only rivaled by the one at Wynn.\n\nThing is, stuffing on seafood alone would already make your $50 charge worth, and quite honestly that was the true highlight of this buffet. Top scores also go to the prime rib, lamb racks, shrimp dumplings, siu mai, and most of the dessert options. What would make this place 5 stars, however, is an increased variety of fruits, and much less salt/oil in their soups as they were way too salty.\n\nBacchanal is one of the busiest buffets on The Strip, so do expect a bit of a wait. There is a way around though: Pay $15 more and you can bypass the line completely. The other option is to be a party of between 4 and 8, as parties of 2 generally have a 30-45 minute wait during peak times."

S"Everything here is good, but not great or memorable. There's not a single dish that I think is spectacular. If its not $55 per person, I might consider 4 stars, but because this place is expensive, my expectation is higher. \nFirst of all, there is a large variety of food. There are 500 items, but I'd rather have 250 really good food than 500 items that are ok.\nSecondly, the tables are arranged very close to each other, which reminds me of eating at a food court. \nFinally, the biggest turn off is the photographers at the restaurant. I had my pictures taken at the line and the restaurant wanted to sell 2 pics to me for $35. You got to be kidding me. I would respect it more if the restaurant just give it to us as a keepsake (like what the House of Prime Rib (SF) does).\nOverall, it's a one time visit and will likely not go back."

It haute without being snobbish. \n\nThere are over 500 selections to choose from!!!\n\nThe food looks good and tastes good.  Pace yourself.  It's easy to gorge yourself at one station.  \n\nThe price of $50 per person for dinner there is actually a great value considering the limitless items you can get such as prime ribs, lamp chops. Alaskan king crab legs (to name a few).  You can easily spend $50 person at a steakhouse or a fancy pretentious burger joint or even at Outback.  \n\nThe servers are very quick to refill drinks and take away empty plates.  The initial wait to get into the buffet is pretty long.  My wife and I were waiting for two hours.  \n\nNotable mentions:  prime ribs, lamb chops, bite-size mini burgers, Alaskan king crab legs, mini creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, macaroons, and mochi ice cream."

S'This has got to be my favorite buffet in Las Vegas. They have over 500 items to choose from several culinary backgrounds such as American, Mexican, Asian, Japanese, Italian, BBQ and my favorite Seafood! The line for this buffet is very long, thanks to our high roller in our party, we got the expedited line. If you time it right, you can pay lunch price and get all the dinner entrees. We came around 230 pm so we still paid $38 for the lunch price, so by the time we were seated we got to try the end of lunch entrees and the new dinner entrees coming out. \n\nThe King crab legs are served over ice and are sweet and tasty. Fresh Oysters on a half shell were delicious especially topped with the vinegar sauce. The cooked shrimp were humongous! Prime rib was excellent, cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The lamb chops had a really great flavor but over cooked for my taste. There are also many different varieties of desserts. My favorites were the green tea cream br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, carrot cake and lava cake. Definitely come hungry so you can try all the different yummy varieties of food.'

S"My family and I got here at 7:45 pm on Thursday.  When we were taken to our seats near the back next to a large wedding table party and a another large party table, we sat and I immediately left the table and went to get some meat and seafood.  The line to get both were unbelievable-10 to 15 minute waits each.  I couldn't believe it!!  You wait in line to get in now you have to wait that long just to get meat & seafood for food that is already prepared.  Maybe it was the customers in line because I saw tons of workers in the preparation area.  Also, the seating in the restaurant was super cramped with very few aisle ways to get around.  Seemed like Caesars does care about the people's experience once the get inside the restaurant.  I paid $50+ for this!!  \n\nPositives:  I will say there was only 1 or 2 people in line when getting the hot crab legs so the wait was minimal if not quite fast.  The crab legs were cut in half making it super easy to eat, but the legs were small though.  there were no lines/minimal people at the salad and Asian food area.  I rarely eat desserts but my wife said the desserts were excellent.  I will say the lady taking care of our table was super.  She did a great job keeping our table clear and was proactive in refilling our drinks and giving us warm towelettes, almost anticipating our every move.\n\nHaving to stand in line for so long definitely impacted how I viewed the food.  I was alright.  Nothing special.  \n\nI guess people want to get their money's worth and skip everything but the seafood and carved meat.  I've seen good review about this place but based on my experience, my family and I will not be back."

I haven't yet started bringing a ziplock bag with me in my giant purse to take home food for later, which I have seen some older ladies do at some local buffets. \n\nI really liked the potato truffle dish, the selection of cheeses and cold meats (prosciutto, salamis, etc.), and the various cake pops they had for dessert. My husband focused on the large selection of seafood and Asian dishes. He especially liked the shrimp risotto. He even ate two bowls of it. He said the flavor and texture were spot on. \n\nThe quality of the food was excellent. You get what you pay for, but the price is about the same as what you would pay for the buffet at M Resort, Studio B. You get a better bang for your buck at Bacchanal."

S"I'm a sucker for buffets, but when you have unlimited mimosas and champagne, that's an automatic 4 stars for me.  To me, the real standouts here would be the eggs benedict and the brie mac and cheese.  \n\nFor a buffet, I was shocked on how perfect the egg was on my benedict, and how crispy the muffin remained.  It was just amaing.  The sauce was decent, nothing earth shattering, but the benedict as a whole was well balanced and good. \n\nThe brie mac and cheese was amazing!  It was creamy, not too salty, and the sides were nice and charred.  The macaroni shells itself had a nice firmness, so it wasn't this mushy pile of mess.  I couldn't help but get seconds and thirds.\n\nOverall, the buffet was decent.  The prime rib was actually good, and if you wanted a more crispier cut after your first serving of medium slice, they can grill your slice for you.\n\nIf you do the buffet of buffets deal for $49.99, make sure you save this place for your champagne brunch.  What a value!"

Hence, my group rushed to get there by 530 to beat the wait. \n\nThere was probably 20-30 people ahead of us for dinner. The line moved quite quickly as they were still trying to seat people when we arrived. The ambiance definitely stands out compared to any other buffet I've been to. They have a little building in the middle just for the dozens of desserts that they offer. \n\nThe prime rib here is pretty good although this time around, a lot of the meat was medium rare. They have a crepe station that serves both savory and sweet. The sweet crepe is very filling so be sure to save that till the very end. \n\nThis buffet has a lot of variety and it's hard not to find something that you would like. \n\nKey: When I was leaving around 700-730, there was a line with at least 75 people in it. The wait is usually up to 90 minutes around then."

You can get a better crepe across the buffet at Le creperie! \n\nThe really bad things were the prime rib and turkey. The slice of prime rib they gave me on my plate was so bloody it filled my plate with blood and got into all my other food servings...so I had to throw the plate out. It was pretty disgusting. That prime rib was way too rare! And the turkey was not cooked all the way! they took it out of the oven too early and was clearly evident when I took a bite of it. I told the chef that the turkey wasnt done, but he just said okay and continued to serve it to people. I wasn't the only one to complain about it, yet they continued to serve it. If they were receiving complaints, they should have removed it immediately.

I'm generally a light eater, so the concept of paying a premium for the opportunity to stuff food in my face by the pound and praise this All-American testament to culinary excess is not anything I aspire to, and yet, I can't separate it from the Vegas experience. Fortunately, Le Village Buffet is an honest cut above, perhaps the only buffet I've had in Vegas that didn't taste like a buffet, with the heat lamps and the rubbery food and pink slime and such. Choices are abundant, food is fresh, and really, it doesn't sit, since everyone is attacking all stations at all times. It's a pain in the ass getting in, and while a lot of recent reviews about declining quality give me pause, I will likely return next time I'm in LV to check for myself. Champagne makes it all go down better."

S"I like this buffet! Went here once and would definitely go again.\n\nWe were staying in Paris back in 2009 so we decided to try out the buffet. When we got down there, the line was so long! It was a Sunday morning after all. To the left of the buffet, they have a special line where youp ay about $10 more and you get to skip right to the front of the line. Totally worth it. You also get some mimosas. The food is unique and full of the flavor. The layout is also adorable. The food is very french inspired. It is split up into the 5 French provinces I think.\nI recommend this buffet! It's different and delicious."

S'I was warned by my friends not to come here :( But I ignored their advice and I woefully regret it... Le Village Buffet is THEE spot that my cousins and I would bust a mission to go to when I was little. I have so many good memories of this place and I really wanted to come back here to revisit those pleasant memories... Well... those are nothing more than illusions of grandeur and definitely the failures of romanticizing about the past. \n\nI came here alone for breakfast when my friends were all sleeping and recovering from our nighttime adventures. I remember it was really cheap, about $20-something for the breakfast buffet. The people were very nice and accommodating... \n\nBUT THE FOOD!!!!! \n\nBleh, the plate I grabbed was so horrible I had to cut up and re-arrange the food on my plate to make it look like I actually touched it so the lady would take it away. \n\nI liked their eggs florentine, the ham the grapefruit, the fruits and the orange juice... but quiche was too oily, the selection of scrambled eggs were disappointing and the steak and potatoes were overcooked. The crepe was "okay" but the bananas were too soggy, I just brushed it aside and ate the outside part with the nutella. I didn\'t even want to eat the breakfast pastries... it was just chocolate croissants, muffins, danish, cinnabuns, etc... nothing special or out of the ordinary... \n\nThis experience does not even come close to how AMAZING I remember Le Village Buffet to be... Definitely not worth stuffing my face for :('

By the time i went somewhere else to have dinner and finished eating, i still would have been waiting at the line at le village buffet :/\n\nSecond time, we made reservations (yes it takes reservations) came around 10am for brunch. Only waited like 5 minutes for a table. Most remarkable was the omelet station and the crepe station, very friendly chefs and very good food. \n\nNext time i will skip this buffet or i mean its enormous annoying line and go straight across to eat a crepe at La Creperie or a baguette at JJ's Boulangerie ;)"

S"Came here for their lunch buffet.\n\nThe lineup moves relatively quickly (plenty of seating), which is always a good thing.\n\nThe inside reminded me of Beauty and the Beast (Disney), as it really does look like a somewhat cartoony French village.  They did a really good job on this one.\n\nThe food is of decent quality.  Plenty of seafood (snow crab but no Alaska king crab).  I really liked the pasta, especially the macaroni and cheese (go figure).  The cheese section is a good way to try the various types out there if you've never had too much exposure in the past.\n\nOne head-scratcher is that there's a sushi section.  Don't get me wrong, it's of decent quality even by Vancouver standards.  I just wonder if Napoleon packed that in his lunch when heading off to battle.\n\nThe desserts are top notch.  Hello chocolate, sugar, and diabetes.\n\nService is good overall.\n\nThe washrooms here are pretty small and cramped, so you may want to use the facilities in the main casino area instead.\n\nWhile this is no Baccanal buffet (which is also costs $25 more), Le Village does hold its own, and is a great place to gorge oneself."

At least I assume it was the party he came in with. I asked an employee what was going on & they told me it was Tori Spelling\'s dog. Like that explained everything. I don\'t care if it was Queen Elizabeth, her dog shouldn\'t have been allowed in. Period.\n\nThat visit probably would\'ve been my last visit to the Paris anyway. The food was flavorless except for the fruit tart I had for dessert. I did end up having two of those, they were excellent. But the rest of the meal wasn\'t worth the price paid or the time spent waiting to get in. There was one line to pay and then there was another line for seating. \n\nStaff who say "bonjour" and "merci" don\'t make up for much. Yuck!'

There was a 30 minute wait, but I didn't mind much as I had remembered to bring a book.  My overall impression of the buffet was that the selection was small to moderate, but the quality tended to be high - for a buffet.  My biggest criticism is that nothing I had was hot - only warm at best.  I had:\n*   Eggs Benedict.  Fair English muffin, good Canadian bacon; eggs properly cooked.\n*   Croissant.  Good for a buffet, but not nearly as good as at Bouchon.\n*   Lyonnaise potatoes.  Disappointing.  Bland; very little onion flavor.\n*   Country sausage.  In many ways, like the link sausage you can get at any pancake house - but done right.  Very good flavor and texture.\n*   Veal sausage and onions.  Smooth texture, mild flavor, executed nicely.\n*   Andouille grilled sausage.  Short, fat sausage in a chewy casing.  Strong grilled flavor, coarse, slightly sweet, slightly spicy.\n*   Smoked fish (unknown type): hard and chewy, with a strong, smoky flavor; not too salty.\n*   Pain au chocolat.  OK bun, but with very little chocolat.  Fair to good.\n*   Cinnamon bun.  Strong cinnamon flavor, not too sweet.\n*   Nondescript cookie.  Fair.\n*   Pastry.  A flat dense, cakey pastry with slivered almonds and white icing.  Inside, a layer of marzipan.\n\nMy overall impression: not bad for a buffet, but not worth the money."

However, we found out if you are willing to pay 10 bucks on top of the original set price, you can get in at a shorter line. \n\nI am amazed at the amount of choices you can get here. Be forewarned, this is my first time to Vegas so this buffet was like a food high for me. It took me about 5 minutes to figure out what I wanted to start with and ended up with french toast, sausage, eggs, and a crepe. While my eggs weren't all that great, everything was pretty good. To top off my amazing breakfast, we were served champagne! After my several glasses of champagne and coffee, I ended up with some dessert.  \n\nEven though they have just about anything you can think of from crab legs to salad, I couldn't bring myself to eat that for breakfast.\n\n Oh, the champagne actually went well with my food. Whenever our glasses became empty they were promptly refilled. Service was friendly and efficient even though it was jam packed in the restaurant.\n\nI see people criticizing the place for not being a real french buffet, nonsense! It's good enough for me!

But after my last visit, I think the only reason to go to one is just because it\'s much cheaper than going to a quality place. \n\nThe Paris buffet was decorated cutely. We went for lunch and it was a total bargain at $17 and change. Our server was efficient and we didn\'t have any sort of wait. That is the good part. \n\nThe bad part, well the food was boring and bland.

From what I saw of the regular breakfast menu selections that were available when we were seated, I'm not sure I would have paid more than $10-15 for it as it was just generic run of the mill breakfast items with a few exceptions...but the champagne brunch?  So much good food to start the day with...the only thing that's a bummer with Vegas buffets, especially the good ones is that with so much to sample from, it's impossible to try everything and that was the case here.  I could have eaten more, but I just had to save room for the desserts and pastries which as would be expected from a French themed place were top notch.

Bellagio's pastas are better, but Paris is a close second.  I dunno if I ran across a Vegas buffet that serves lamb, but Paris does.  I didn't really venture off to the salad bar because I opted for the spinach & artichoke as well as some of the steamed vegetables.\n\nThe desserts are pretty similar to Bellagio & Wynn, but hopefully you had enough of the main selection to not even think of heading in that direction.\n\npointers:  if you have a free Total Rewards card, that reduces the price and you can even reduce the fee even more by clicking into Paris Casino on Foursquare and get a $5.00 off voucher that you have show your phone at the Total Rewards booth in the casino."

Tipping the server in advance is a good idea as you get decent service this way. Dessert station is decent. A reasonable buffet option. I liked some of the grilled items.

In celebration of Mother's Day, Bachi Burger gave out a complimentary slice of guava coconut cake for all the mothers...except my mom?

S"In my opinion, I rate this place the best gourmet burger spot in Vegas.\nThey have great service  and even a server that looks and acts like Jimmy Fallon! YEAH! Seriously! HAHAHAHA!!!\nThey change up their dessert menu every so often but they haven't disappointed me yet.\nTheir kalbi, bachi fish, and wagu burger are my favorites. They also have items you can add on to your burger like fried egg, shishito peppers, avocado, and so on. Their sweet fries and truffle parm fries are delicious as well."

S'OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES.  This clearly is the most popular dish at this place.  Every table around us had this on their table, every.  The service was spotty as we visited during lunch.  After our starters, the food began to settle in and the mile high burgers finally came out.  At this point, I was stuffed, but had to put down this spicy miso burger.  It\'s not the cheapest place for a lunch, but it\'s so worth it.\n\nOxtail chili cheese fries: By far one of the best dishes I\'ve ever consumed.  The shredded oxtail was so tender, the flavor of the chili has a sweetness to it and it goes so well with the salty fries. The sunny side up egg just makes it even better.  Truly amazing, it\'s a must get and you\'ll be disappointed if you don\'t.\n\nPork Belly Buns: Not all that but still good.  I really enjoyed the bao dunked in their hoisin mixture and the touch of cilantro and radish gives it a great fresh touch.\n\nSpicy miso burger: This this had to be at least 6" high, piled with toppings and goodness. What makes their burgers so unique is the Taiwanese sweet bun, soft, fluffy, and chewy, what a burger bun should be. There are so many great flavors in this piece, it was delicious, from garlic to peppers, onions, and a fried egg. The patty was cooked perfectly, medium.\n\nIf you\'re in Vegas, this place is a must.  Make a trip here, it\'s worth the short drive off of the strip.  As we left lunch, the place was packed and had a line outside the door.  I recommend going early.  It\'s a nice place with friendly staff.'

S"Coming from California, we have a lot of great burger places.  Being a fan of burgers, my sister, her friend and I decided to try out this place.  We're glad we decided to eat at Bachi Burger vs. pigging out at one of the buffets.  Why, you ask?  Because I dare to say (and a friend of mine will agree it is a bold statement) that if there is a Bachi Burger put in Los Angeles, this place will easily knock out my Number One burger spot!\n\nWe got the ox tail chili fries and the truffle parmesan sweet potato fries.  Hoo Lee S***!  The truffle sauce and tomato aioli on the sweet potato fries are fantastic, and the chili fries are amazing!  I needed to look for my mama because I needed to slap her; yes it's that good!  And we didn't even get our burgers yet!  The red velvet shake was good, but was not something that stood out (maybe because I was having a food orgasm with the truffle fries!)\n\nThe burgers were just as mind blowing.  I got the Miyagi-San burger that has a Wagyu beef patty, onion rings, fried egg, Furikake infused bacon and chili mayo.  Our friend got the Mr. Ho burger, with Angus beef, green onion, cilantro ginger, Hoisin mayo, Lup Cheng, Mizuna and mushrooms... ON A TARO BUN!!!  My sister got the Ronin that has Angus beef with caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, fried egg, Katsu BBQ, Miso Goma dressing,  and Yuzu citrus aioli.\n\nALL THREE BURGERS WERE FANTASTIC!!!\n\nI almost needed to look for my dad now and slap him too, it's THAT good!!!\n\nI must say we will now be coming to this burger place every time we visit Vegas.  As I finish up writing this review I realize I didnt get to critique the asthetics of the restaurant itself.  WHO CARES!?  If you are reading this and are in the Vegas area, get your rear to Bachi Burger and grab some bomb a** food!!!"

S"Bachi Burger is a great place for hamburgers. The flavors are tasty and distinctive.\nThe term gourmet hamburger is often over-used. I think anyone who aspires to make something better than a Big Mac will call it a gourmet burger. But the term really applies at Bachi Burger. It's first-rate ingredients prepared with great care, most with an Asian influence.\nI got the pickle plate appetizer, the mushroom cheeseburger, the salt-and-pepper fries and a soda they make in-house with cherry and some sort of Japanese fruit.\nAs soon as the pickle plate comes you know the owner is a friend of foodies. There's little bites of six separate things, all quite interesting. My two favorites were the daikon radish and the garlic.\nThe pepper in the salt-and0pepper fries are jalapenos. They're not too spicy. When the fries arrived they reminded me of a pepper-infused crab dish at Yummy Yummy in San Francisco. Interesting smells. And they tasted great. I got the pineapple ketchup o go with the fries but it didn't do much for me. The garlic aoili sauce was pretty good.\nThe burger was great. The black angus beef was first rate and perfectly seasoned and cooked. I loved all the different mushrooms they put on the burger. The gruyere cheese was tasty. And the bun was good, too.\nMaybe the only disappointment was the soda. I was hoping for something with some zingy acidity to match the rich foods, but it was a little flat. I wished I had tried a lime soda instead.\nBachi Burger is quite distinctive and certainly worth the trip south of The Strip., It's about 1.6 miles east of Interstate 15 at the Blue Diamond Road exit."

S"Wow, JUST WOW, who knew heaven was just a few files from the strip of LV...A stop I will always make in Vegas...it's just that good. I just had it 2 days from this post and I wanted it again and tried to hit it up before I left the sweet town of LV, but damned it all they are closed on Sundays, DRAT . \n\nLet's take this as a walkthrough, I'd like to be how very detailed in the whole experience. \n\n1. Walk - in, little worried b/c even with good reviews I've seen from yelp that it wasn't that busy, also the few customers we did see didn't order burgers but sandwiches. \n2. The Sit Down. It was a nice looking decor, just arriving to LV and was starving anything seemed good, but I didn't know what I was about to get into. We order some waters, get them fast because it wasn't that busy considering it was around 3 PM, We order the fries, sweet potato, the truffle oil, and garlic fries. They come out first. \n3. The fries. The Garlic fries were the first I tasted, each basket of fries come out in nice decor and although it's 4 $ each approximately for a little more than a handful you'd expect to get more, but it's really the perfect amount you need. Again well the garlic fries were great, they had good taste, and had a little kick of spice I would think from jalapeno. It was really awesome! Second I tried the Sweet Potato fries, which were cooked to the greatest form...the texture and crispness to the fries was really good. Then I tried the truffle oil fries, by themselves I thought were alright, but when you add them with the sauce / chutney that is arranged with each basket, it definitely does not disappoint.\n4. The Burger, Oh goodness....the burger...it was just amazing...I ordered the Kalbi burger, and was actually reluctant b/c the waitress didn't really acknowledge it as a good choice...or even ask how I liked my burger cooked (I ususally get medium-rare, or medium), but it didn't matter...it just didn't...it was just that good. My burger had a perfect bun, wasn't soggy or anything, it held true form as I devoured my burger from first bite to last. The patty! Man if you've had Korean BBQ / Kalbi, then you know that's already money, but on this marinade on the patty! SOOOO GOOD!!!! It also had a thin layer of Kim-Chee and served with a side of pickled cucumber (ouee kimchi, is what I think it's spelled), I wish I could describe it better, there was more to the burger...but I just totally just hypnotized by it's taste. \n5. Service, I know it wasn't crowded but service was amazing, it seemed everytime I sipped water, someone would fill it to full right after I put it down. The staff was nice, give you a warm greeting and a happy good bye b/c I think they're glad to see satisfied customers, and I was most definitely one of them. \n\nThis was the longest post I've ever written, and even posting this on my FB just to spread the word on this place..."

S"Great place! We had the oxtail chili cheese fries for an appetizer- pretty good but could have used a little more cheese in my opinion. For my main dish I had the pork belly steamed buns. So good! I've tried  pork belly a few times before and it can be on the dry side, but not these! And the steamed bun itself was amazing. My boyfriend had the Kiki burger and it was also very tasty and juicy. The portions are generous here so come hungry!"

S"After going months and months of living vicariously through other yelpers reviews and flipping through countless food porn photos of this place I finally had to venture out of my northwestern corner and make the pilgrimage to Bachi Burger. Too say it was worth every penny spent and every mile driven would be an understatement. We started off the meal with the pork belly steamed buns. The order came with three steamed buns filled with pork belly topped with cilantro, scallions, radish, boiled egg, a Chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin sauce. These hogalicious porktastic belly fat filled concoctions will wreck your life.  Pork fat is God and Bachi Burger clearly understands this concept.\n\nThen came the burgers.  We ordered both the Bahn Mi Burger and the Ronin Burger.  We were both huge fans of the Bahn Mi Burger, however we could have done with out the Ronin.  I give them an A + for effort and creativity however the flavor combinations weren't necessarily working for me. Add a side of truffle parm french fries and choose one of the top notch stone or rouge brews they carry and get ready to start loven life.  I will definitely be paying another visit to Bachi Burger in the near future and suggest you do the same.  You'll easily spend $40 - $50 on a meal for two, however this is definitely one of those cases where you get what you pay for."

S'These Asian fusion flavors will make an indelible impression on any burger fan willing to branch out and try something different. In fact, many food critics say "Bachi Burger" might just be the best gourmet burger spot in Vegas (which is a pretty bold statement considering all the burger joints on the Strip backed by famous chefs). \n\nBurger "connoisseurs" unwilling to experiment any further than some avocado or pepper jack, however, might be scared off by this menu. For instance, the Ronin Burger features Angus beef, carmelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, Miso-Goma dressing, fried egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu citrus aioli. The Banh-Mi Burger includes Angus beef, pork, shrimp, lemongrass pork pate, fresh herbs, curry aioli, pickled vegetables, and Nuoc Mam sauce.\n\nDon\'t be intimidated, though -- there are other options for those with simpler tastes and you can always build your own burger by starting off with an Angus patty or Wagyu patty and adding ingredients from there. Fried onion rings, applewood bacon, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, etc can all be added to any patty for $1.50 each.\n\nThere are also a variety of different sandwiches to choose from and I could honestly fill up on the fries alone. The oxtail chili cheese fries with garlic aioli and fried egg are extremely popular, but the more traditional fries are also a big hit -- mainly because of the savory sauces that accompany them. The garlic chili aioli, Yuzu citrus aioli, sundried tomato aioli and pineapple ketchup are all HIGHLY recommended for dipping or drowning the fries of your choice (the options are regular, garlic, sweet potato, and truffle Parmesan).\n\nIf you\'re not much of an adventurous diner, you\'ll probably stay away from Bachi Burger. Your taste buds will definitely be missing out, though.'

S"This is NOT the place to go if you have anywhere to head to afterwards.  Went in during the work week, it is right around the corner from my office.   Walked in at 12:10, were seated immediately (about 4 empty tables).  We had studied the menu online and ordered immediately, did not even get menus.  At 12:39 we questioned the where abouts of our burgers....  We were told they got slammed but ours were next up did we want our fries first, we said sure....  At 12:47 our burgers arrived, but no fries, we asked for to go boxes, our fries and our bill.   12:51 another laid back server stopped by asking if we needed anything we said yes, boxes, our other food and the bill....   12:53 boxes arrive....   12:56 bill arrives still no fries....  12:58 I walk over with the 33 dollar bill to the manager and ask how long it takes to make fries, he informs me it takes 6 minutes but they only have one fryer..  I suggest maybe then they only have 5 tables instead of the 20+ in the restaurant that their kitchen can't handle.  I inform him I am not paying a bill for food I haven't even received.  He asked what I wanted him to do about it.    I informed him I would not be signing the bill and I didn't want the food and I walked out.   \n\nIf it is a week day lunch hour, you INFORM your customer that you have 60 minute ticket times PRIOR to them ordering.  Give them the opportunity to walk out.  Also don't open a huge restaurant if you do not have the kitchen staff and equipment to serve your dinning room!!!!!!  This place is an absolute train wreck!!!!!  Will never go back, I don't care how great their burgers are."

S'I love the food, don\'t get me wrong.  When I have to wait 30 minutes to sit at the table that has been open the whole time, I have issues.  My friend was waiting 56 minutes for a to-go order that he was told would be 40.  The dining room was 75% full at the time, but most had been served.\nAgain, the food is great, if you can get it.  I listened to the lead cook loose her sh!t on the wait staff because she was busy.  Yelling at them because she couldn\'t get the food out of the kitchen.  "I don\'t need three expiditers, I need 1!".  This might work on Hell\'s kitchen but we were ready to bounce thinking that if she can\'t handle this with 4 people on the line, something is wrong.  How is my food going to come out?\nAgain, the food is great, but not hot coming out of the kitchen.  It took almost 45 minutes to recieve our order of 3 burgers and an order of parmesan truffle fries (which were room temp).  \nThe waitstaff avoided their tables like the plague until the food hit.  I guess they were tired of the complaints.  When the food comes, everyone is back on top of it.  \n\nThe last time I was in, I stood at the door waiting for somebody to acknowledge me.  There were 3 tables down and about 10 people at the door including me.  After 15 minutes of waiting for no apparent reason, we went somewhere else.  They weren\'t even busy.  Somebody needs to take charge and fix it.'

This was our 2nd time and we enjoyed the first. \n\nHusband went with host recommendation of the Kiki burger - lots of toppings including carmelized bacon and gruyere cheese... nuf said. \nI tried the Kalbi burger. kim chee was great, however they were a little heavy handed on the kalbi marinade which truly overpowered the other tastes. It did have a side of bachi pickles which were delicious. \n\nTruffle fries are an explosion of flavor in your mouth... crisp potato fry with parmesan cheese and truffle cream... they're addicitng. \nDon't pass on their sweet potato fries, dusted in just the right amount of sea salt. All fries are served with creative sauces.. however you can eat them plain and be happy.\n \nWanted to enjoy the food, so we stuck with water. A little pricey for a burger, but then again, you're not going to find another one like it in the valley."

S"My husband and I wanted to try this place out to see what all the hype was about.\nWe went there about a week ago and the wait was about 10 minutes, not so bad. It was definitely smaller than I expected.\n\nWe ordered the garlic fries which were okay. They weren't soggy which was good. My husband had a make your own burger with an egg, grilled onions, and cheddar and I had the Miyagi burger. The meat was delicious and I would expect it to be so with how much the burgers costed. My burger was actually the first burger I have had that didn't have any cheese on it, but it was still juicy enough to where it still worked out. \n\nOur server wasn't really that great. We're not the types to want to be checked up on constantly, but not being checked up doesn't go by unnoticed. When my husband got his drink there was a piece of mint or some type of green leaf in it which was big enough to where I don't know how the server didn't see it if he was paying any attention. \n\nThe price for our two burgers, two fries, and a soft drink came out to being about $50 before tip. \n\nAll in all, the place was okay, and not great. It wasn't a place where I knew right away I would be coming back very soon and especially for the price, I didn't feel it was worth it. The meat was good, but I feel like it's only better in your head because you know the beef is grass fed beef. I can definitely eat at different burger joints without missing this place or thinking about it in the back of my head."

They ask you how you want it done, and I got mine medium. The mushrooms were awesome. Those fries were DELICIOUS. My burger and fries both came with a side of sauce. I don't remember what sauce it was, but boy did it compliment that burger and fries.  The burger might not look big, but it sure is filling.\n\nAlong with the burger and fries I ordered an almond milk tea with boba, and I should know better than to order boba from a burger place. The almond did not have much flavor, and the boba was bland as well.\n\nThe waiters were friendly, nice, and patient. If I come back to Vegas I'd definitely eat there again."

S"In all honesty, I was not expecting to love this place so much. I love burgers, but had not heard much before trying the restaurant. On the same trip to Las Vegas, of course this was another one on the list for me to try. And I am so happy I did! I went with two other friends, both foodies as well, both love burgers too! Again, the wait for this place was long, 25 min. but worth the wait. I've found the trend that long lines, means good food :)\n\nThe three of us decided to each get a burger and share. The ones we decided on were the Shogun Burger, Kiki's Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. We started out meal out with two tasty appetizers in the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns. Both were Amazing! Great start to our delicious meal.\n\nThe first burger was the Shogun burger...$25. Yes, pretty pricey...But we went all out as foodies! This burger was so mouthwatering and delicious I could not believe all the flavors coming out in the first bite! The Wagyu Beef & Unagi was so soft and just melted in your mouth as the buttery miso helped smooth it out even more. There was a sweetness that hit me as well, not knowing what it was at first, I quickly recalled it being the peach and pear. Best tasting gourmet burger I have ever had!\n\nKiki's Burger was a delight as well! I have to say all the burgers were soft and tender and mouthwatering. Just the flavors varied depending on the ingredients...which were high quality. The last on was the Spicy Miso Burger. And of course I enjoyed this one as well because of the spice, still not that spicy, but had a kick to it. And of course the fried egg and garlic making a great taste combination.\n\nWould highly recommend for burger lovers. The flavors of the burgers are Asian inspired, and work very well.

I saw this place a few years ago when it was coming soon.....Soooo, we walked in this place, and you couldn't even get to the host to put your name on the list for a table.   Ok so, we finally made it to him put our name on the list.  They told us about 40 min wait!  Wow!  Come to find out, you can't call and make reservations, not good!  We decided to just order to go.  Well that was still a 40 min. wait.  We ordered the fried chicken appetizer, My husband ordered the Ronin Burger uummmm, they kept the egg though!  I ordered the Crusty Crab, Truffle fries and salt and pepper fries.\n\nI loved the Chicken appetizer, it was so good, but with all the dipping sauces, I wasn't sure what was suppose to go with it.  I did try all of the sauces with the chicken.  Again, not sure which one was suppose to go with the chicken\n\nI loved both fries the truffle one was different, but it was still good.  I really liked the salt and pepper one.  It had jalapenos and cilantro on it,  what a nice touch. \n\nThe Ronin, we ordered well done....we didn't get that, it was medium well!  If that were my burger, I couldn't have eaten it!  When a customer ask for well done, we don't want to see any red!  So due to that I didn't even get to taste it.  My husband was ok with it.  He said it was not bad.  Except he would have also left the coleslaw off. \n\nSo on to the Crusty Crab...I'm not use to mushy...If you like your crab crispy....I would pass on this one.  It was mushy....I wasn't expecting this to be mushy.  It was eitable, but I think crispy is better.   I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Try something else, unless you don't mind mushy.\n\nThe employee's seemed like they were stressed out!  It was crazy busy, and this is a Wednesday night.    I would hate to see it on a Friday or Saturday.\n\nI think if I go back, I will call ahead, and only get it to go, the host said it's busy all the time!  Great for them, but I don't like to wait like that."

S'WOW! Would I call this a burger, no because this burger deserves more respect. This is "The Burger" and the best burger you will ever eat. Quality begins with the bun, then each ingredient has been perfectly selected to balance the perfectly charbroiled angus beef, while maintaining the inside moist. The meat is slightly crisp on the outside, well seasoned, and moist on the inside. Incredible! Mine was ordered with mushrooms, blue cheese, and spinach. This burger didn\'t need any ketchup because it\'s perfect the way its served. \n\nThe fountain drinks were made on the spot; we ordered the jasmine lemonade and it was fabulous! As a side dish we ordered the sweet potato fries and regular garlic fries. Both were amazing and not one single crumb was left behind. We were a large party and nothing was left on the plates. Everyone cleaned their plates, and that should tell you something!\n\nWill I return? Absolutely! I will actually do takeout.

S'Where do I begin? Can I just start by saying, "amazing, eclectic, and mouth watering.."   If you want to experience a taste of hamburger heaven this is the place to be.  I would have given this 5 stars however, since the restaurant is fairly new, the service has yet to match up to its popular demand.  Although, it took awhile to get our food, it was totally well worth the wait.  \n\nThe concept of Asian Fusion burgers is such a treat.  What\'s even more interesting was the story behind the restaurant\'s name.  From the owner\'s perspective Bachi is a combo of two things: abbreviated from the term "hibachi" which is Japanese style of grilling and "bachi" also means to treat others how you would like to be treated in return.  \nI had to opportunity to check this place out on my recent visit to Vegas.  This happens to be my brother\'s favorite new hot spot for good eats.  We ordered the following:\n\nRonin Burger   8\nCaramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, Sweet Bread Bun, Yuzu Citrus Aioli on the side\n\n***** This burger gets 5 stars!!!  The combination of the ingredients makes it probably one of the tastiest and eclectic burger I\'ve ever had. This was pure heaven taking a bite out of this fresh succulent burger.      \n\nKalbi Burger   8\nGround Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo  \n\n***3 stars- Personally I thought this was OK.  There was really no wow factor for me other than the fact that it was served with Kim Chee\n\nShort Rib Steamed Buns   9.5\nTwo Tender Braised Wagyu Short Rib Bao Sandwiches, Cilantro, Scallions, Radish Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinaigrette, Horseradish Yuzu Aioli   \n\n*****5 stars-This was a real treat! Short ribs were extremely tender and the combination of all the ingredients were extremely  complimentary and super scrumptious.\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries   3.5 \nFrench Fries, Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle, Chives, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli   \n\n****4 stars-Looses a star for the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli, sauce needs more work and kick down more truffle sauce too! Overall, the fries were awesome!\n\nPortuguese Donuts, Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato     4\n\n***3 stars-I thought this was ok.  The gelato was quite tasty.\n\nOverall this place is definitely a must see!  Ambiance is cool! Staff is quite friendly. Price point perfect...

Anyway, time for an update!\n\nBachi Burger is a fantastic burger place that I always recommend to friends and family, locals and visitors alike. The specialty burgers are obviously what you want to get, but don\'t turn a blind eye to appetizers and fries.\n\nI\'ve enjoyed the kurobuta and aribaki sausage w/ honey mustard, chili fried chicken, oxtail chili cheese fries, and the sweet potato fries before. However, my favorite side is definitely the truffle parmesan fries with parmigiano reggiano, white truffle oil (shut up, I know it\'s not real truffle), porcini cream, and sundried tomato aioli. I don\'t tend to have it while I\'m in the middle of a Bachi burger, so I usually try to get them to bring it out earlier than the burgers.\n\nI will detail all the burgers that I\'ve eaten in reverse power rankings style:\n\n7) "Banh-mi" Burger. Brownie points for the quotation marks. I always enjoy a good banh mi, but I am not a fan of this burger, and it still saddens me that this is the one that they chose to feature on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. The flavors just don\'t work or harmonize together for some reason, and I always steer people away from this.\n\n6) Mr. Ho\'s. The highlight is probably lup cheong, a sweet pinkish red pork sausage. The problem is that the overall flavor profile is too sweet and only has that one flavor. Glad I\'ve tried it, glad I\'ll never have to order it again.\n\n5) Spicy miso. I had this tied with Kiki\'s before, but I\'ve gotta make a choice. Nothing especially wrong here, and really love the fried egg. Heat seekers, do know that the sauce isn\'t that spicy, even for someone with a delicate palate like me. If I had a rotation, this would make my rotation.\n\n4) Kiki\'s. My old second favorite burger. Bacon, lots of mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli. Sweet overall but not too sweet, and a good layering of flavors.\n\n3) Miyagi-san\'s grass-fed wagyu. Relatively simple combination here to accompany the default "wagyu" patty. Chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. It\'s really weird though, since I specifically taking a bite, not enjoying it, then flipping my burger upside down and really loving it. I guess the flavors hit my mouth a lot better that way. Try it both ways and see for yourself.\n\nBy the way, I couldn\'t really distinguish wagyu from the normal angus beef, so you\'re likely better off not "upgrading" any of your other specialty burgers.\n\n2) Manga. My burger from today. This was a special posted on the chalkboard outside. It is a 7 oz patty with sunny side up egg (presented without top bun not layered), sprouts, crab and scallop dynamite, and a side of pickled ginger. Apparently, enoki mushrooms also were in it, but I don\'t recall. Anyway, if you\'re a fan of dynamite, you need to eat this. The egg contributes as usual, the dynamite flavor is all there (most tender baby scallops I\'ve ever had, by the way), the beef flavor is always there, and the pickled ginger can add extra sweetness if you so desire. I couldn\'t decide whether I enjoy it more with or without ginger.\n\n1) Ronin. Still my favorite, although the manga made a really, really strong case. I think the yuzu citrus aioli adds enough acidity that it pushes the Ronin above a very strong field of contenders. Caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, miso goma dressing, and my beloved fried egg complete the flavor combination.\n\nAll burgers really should be enjoyed medium-rare. It\'s cooked, but you still get that nice pinkish center and keep all the juiciness. If you order it well-done, I will personally hunt you down and even haunt your dreams if I must. They have always delivered the right temperature and never gotten me sick, so don\'t under or over-order.\n\nSome don\'t believe that it\'s the best burger in town. I haven\'t eaten everywhere in Vegas yet, but this is still my favorite place, even in spite of the recent menu-wide price hike. I will also note that some guy who writes a blog solely about Vegas burgers has apparently been almost everywhere, and he\'s named Bachi as his favorite. You will have to see for yourself, and I hope you manage to go early or late enough to avoid the ubiquitous crowds.'

S"I've been here a few times now and Bachi has not yet disappointed.  If you wanna come for a premium burger that tastes even more awesome on an egg bun, do come and check out Bachi and try it out.  For me, it's been the Miyagi Wagyu burger for the win each time...but the last time we were there, one of the servers told us that the burger that all the staff has and swears by is the miso wagyu burger...he said to definitely try it the next time we come out there.\n\nAnd as an added bonus, they joined up with the ramen joint a few months ago and now serve both on their menus.  I come here for the burgers, but you know me and my love relationship with ramen; so of course I tried it out too...just the tonkatsu though.  The broth wasn't as tasty as I had expected, but the chasu was prob one of the best I've had...nice and fatty and super tender.  If you can split it amongst your group, I'd definitely go for it.\n\nThe fries: sweet potato, truffle, oxtail, and regular, are all awesome, and DEFINITELY can feed more than one person, as we learned to our doom the first time we came in and each ordered fries.  The oxtail is quite heavy so you might wanna split the burger...but then again, this is vegas, INDULGE!!!!\n\nThis place can get absolutely packed, which is a sign of the good food, the popularity of the burger, and just the fact that Bachi rules!  So I would come at non-peak times, which is hard to determine for Vegas, Thursday night at around 10 the wait was 40 minutes, Saturday around 9:30 the wait was 5...so it really does follow along with the vegas theme of just gettin lucky.  \n\nPS - there's a new bigger spot also about 15 min away from the strip...but with traffic, can actually take much longer to get to, but if this place is too busy, at least you have a second option.  \n\nStaff - Great!  Esp with the recommendations and the good humor.  Thanks Bachi! :)"

S'I love a good burger. Now, throw in an Asian twist to that and you may have just found perfection (two of my favorites in one?!) I felt like I was destined for food like this.\n\nThis place luckily makes up what they lack in service (service was mediocre, if that) with their food. The burger quality is excellent and the Hawaiian bun they serve them on is a nice touch. I had Kiki\'s burger, which is an Angus burger, sauteed shiitake, enoki and eryngi mushrooms, bacon, gruyere cheese and a sweet onion marmalade. I loved everything about this burger. It was juicy, tasty, and the flavors were very well balanced aka MOUTHGASM. I also had the truffle Parmesan fries. Yum yum yum!\n\nI would definitely suggest trying a burger off of their "specialty burger menu", rather than building your own -- because you can do that at any burger joint.\n\nI\'m hoping when I decide to return that the service experience will be a little better, but I\'m not really here to rate service, just food. There were other menu options I saw that would definitely warrant a return visit.'

S"I live in Los Angeles and was visiting some friends who live in Vegas.  They told us to try Bachi Burger since they compared it to Umami Burger in LA.  Of course, I had to try it to see what the difference was.  \n\nBachi Burger by far has the BEST burgers that I've had to date.  All of their burgers have an Asian fusion flair.  Their Ronin burger was truly amazing with the grilled onions and Bachi BBQ sauce.  Their Parmesan Truffle fries are also amazing with a special mushroom sauce that was drizzled on top. \n\nAnd to top that all off, we almost didn't order their dessert which was the malasadas and I am so glad we did because those were amazing! \n\nI also took a sip of their homemade sodas and their Mandarin Tangerine soda is so good.\n\nIf I could, I would've wanted to try all of their burgers.  We also ordered their BBQ Pork Belly Steamed Buns as an appetizer and those were freaking amazing as well!  \n\nPlease open one up in LA!  I would go there everyday if I could.  That was how good it was!"

S"During my recent business trip to Vegas, Bachi Burger was BY FAR the best meal that I enjoyed!  Arriving during the prime dinner period, my friend and I immediately noticed the good amount of people waiting to be seated.  Note: they do not take reservations.  Our party of 2 put our name in and sat down, fully expecting to wait the 30 minutes that we were told by the hostess.  Shockingly, within 5 minutes we were called up and seated; sometimes being just a party of 2 helps a lot!  I ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger, which came topped with chili mayo, a fried egg, furikake, \ncaramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings, as well as their salt & pepper garlic French fries, with a side of pineapple ketchup.  From the first delectable bite to the last, this meal was fantastic.  The burger was prepared perfectly and every bite was FULL (FULL!) of flavor.  The fries were great and the pineapple ketchup was sublime.  I enjoyed three burgers during this recent Vegas trip (Bachi, Fukuburger, and BurGR) and this meal was by far the best!  The two locations are off of the Strip, but do yourself a favor and go!"

S"So this place amuses me. Why? Because the burgers here, are outstanding. I mean outstanding. There's a good chance you'll come, eat a burger and decide that it's one of the best burgers you've ever had. Among your top 10 even top 5. This is how I feel about the burgers. Everything else on the menu? Craptastic. I mean, just garbage. The coffee taste like water, their cocktail barely had liquor in it, the dessert like some supermarket bought concoction, it just goes on. So just don't order anything else but the burger."

S"Came here with a party of 9 on a Saturday night. Previous comments were unhappy on the service but I think the owner listened because we were served in the 30 minutes they told us. They even came out to tell us the previous table has paid and just needs to pack their leftovers.\n\nFood here was up to the hype. I am a big fan of burgers! I had their shogun burger, that's wagyu and unagi with seared foie gras... This burger melted in my mouth. I tasted the buttery foie gras and when I asked for medium, it came out medium so there was no hesitation there. The appetizers were good. I recommend the oxtail fries with an egg over. Truffle fries were good too but nothing extraordinary. \n\nThis will be one of the spots I will come back to everytime I'm here. See you in June for sure!"

S"Ohhh goodness. My boyfriend has a timeshare in Las Vegas right down the street from Bachi Burger. Everytime we go, we devastate this place.\n\nThe burgers are gourmet, Japanese fusion burgers, but so delicious! First off, their quality of meat is great. The ground beef is very tender and juicy, not dry at all. They also offer so many choices of burgers that are so interesting! \n\n-If you really want to splurge, try the Shogun burger. It's the best burger I've ever had, hands down.\n-Miyagi-san is definitely the best burger if you don't want to take risks. It's not bad, it's a GREAT burger! But if you're not feeling some of that fusion stuff.\n-The Ronin Burger was awesome. It had so many layers of taste; my friends and I decided that it tastes somewhat like a sushi roll. Sounds weird, but it's really goooood.\n-Kiki burger is a really good mushroom burger!\n-Their oxtail chili cheese fries were HUGE. And delicious! However, like everyone else, I do wish for a bit more oxtail in it. But nonetheless, bomb.\n-Their truffle fries are amazing too! Definitely my favorite truffle fries I've had yet. Not dry at all! Crispy and moist.\n-Mr. Ho burger. If you like sweet taro bun and pork sausage, try it. It's a bit on the Chinese bun side, it was very interesting, but I couldn't finish it because it was a bit sweet for a burger.\n\nNever had Umami Burger, but my friends at the table are quite the foodies and had quite of a bit of Umami Burger... Bachi blows Umami right out of the water.\n\nPrices are around $9-$15 per burger (except the Shogun, that one is $25), but the burgers are HUGE. Eating just the burger alone, you'll be stuffed. Thick patties, fat bun. No skimping here.\n\nDamn, now I'm hungry talking about all this food.\n\n5 stars!"

S"I wanted to like Bachi Burger. I've been here a few times, hoping that the visit before was just a fluke, but nope, Bachi is not for me. The service is fine, the waiters attentive, and I really enjoyed the fries, but there was just something off to me about the flavor of the burgers. Maybe it's just me because the people I go with enjoy the burgers, but it is what it is.\n\nThe latest visit was with a friend of mine from out of town and I wanted to take him to a burger joint off the Strip. We ordered edamame as our appetizer and truffle parmesan fries. I ordered a Kiki's Burger (angus beef, sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli) and while I finished the burger, I tried really hard to not show on my face that I thought it tasted off. My friend enjoyed his burger just fine which makes me happy, but I did not enjoy mine. I had hoped it would because I love mushrooms! Everything about the burger on paper sounds great. It's just something about the sauce or something that makes me not want to order it again."

S"I've heard of this place for a while and finally got to try it this past weekend!\n\nI spent the weekend in Vegas with my friends and on Sunday noon before heading home, we decided to check this place out. They opened at 12 and we got there at 12:20...there was already a 30 minute wait :o This place gets crazy crowded, so I only hoped it was because it was delicious.\n\nService here is pretty good. Workers were friendly and apologetic about the wait, even though it didn't seem TOO long. They were also very accommodating for out party of 11 :) I decided to order based on Yelp reviews, so I got the 'Ronin Burger' ($10) and our table got 4 orders of their Truffle Parmesan fries ($3.50 each) to share.\n\nFood came out in a reasonable amount of time. It was funny because they recommended we should get the fries now instead of with our burgers because the burgers would take a long time, but we got our burgers a few minutes after we got our fries. So?? Haha I don't know.\n\nThe Ronin is a burger with caramelized onions, cole slaw, sesame dressing, fried egg (I asked to take it out since I don't like egg), Katsu BBQ sauce, and a yuzu citrus aioli on the side. The flavor was good, but I found it too be a little too sweet after a while. I think it was because of the BBQ sauce and caramelized onions together. Too much, plus I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ sauce. The truffle parmesan fries were really good. The fries are the thin cut type and were nicely crisp. They also came with a sun dried tomato aioli sauce that was really good with the fries. MMMM :)\n\nPrices are pretty reasonable and this location is pretty spacious. I would come back to try their other popular burgers (Kiki and Miyagi). Also, I hear they have good soft drinks, so I'll probably try those next, too!"

S'There are three parts to a burger - the meat, the bun, and the fixings. Bachi Burger nailed them all. I ordered the Kalbi Burger, Salt and Pepper Fries, and Green Milk Tea Boba for lunch. In a word, it was a taste treat.\n\nThe meat was glazed with a sweet (I want to say BBQ) sauce that penetrated the surface and made it into each bite. The bread was soft, with a nice crust. Easy to get a grip on your burger. The fixings were unique. Spicy, pickled cucumbers and cabbage. It was an unexpected flavor, but it tasted great.\n\nThe fries were great as well. Golden brown and seasoned perfectly. It came with a sauce that complemented the fries perfectly.\n\nI spoke with Guy (owner) and found out that they had only been open for about two weeks. Not bad! The place was busy for a Monday at 1pm. I look forward to bringing my out-of-town friends to this place.'

S"I've died and gone to Asian burger heaven!  With burgers that are high quality and entirely unique, and drinks that you'll remember (Jasmine Lemonade is a personal favorite), Bachi Burger is a can't-go-wrong place when you have a bit of money to spend.  Unfortunately the prices are bit high, so you probably won't want to eat there all the time, but with lots of specials and new things to try, there's always a reason to go back.\n\nI don't know where these other people with bad reviews ate, but I've never had a problem with the service at all.  They're always very friendly and while they could be a bit more prompt, there's no complaint here!  \n\nFirst timers should try the Truffle Parmesan Fries, Jasmine Lemonade, and the Kiki's Burger.  I recommend the Banh-Mi Burger, but it probably wouldn't be for everyone's palate."

S"I'm usually weary when a friend suggests a fancy burger joint, especially since I derive most of my burger pleasure from the likes of a quick and affordable visit to In-N-Out. But, I like Bachi Burger for a couple of reasons: the location is off the Strip, making parking easy and the burgers are damn good and full of flavor. \n\nBachi is one of the few fusion restaurants where the menu works on so many levels. Drink options include several Japanese import beers, boba milk teas, iced teas, and house sodas. I tried the cherry yuzu soda, which was quite refreshing. We started the meal with oxtail chili cheese fries. The portion was huge and meant to be shared. I loved the flavors of meat, cheese, garlic aioli, topped off with a perfectly runny fried egg. \n\nThere were several options of specialty burgers to choose from. I went with the Ronin burger while my friend got the Kiki's burger. These burgers were all about flavor and texture. The angus beef was perfectly cooked, but everything worked so well together from the cole slaw to the miso goma dressing with the perfectly toasted buns. The yuzu citrus aioli was also a nice complement. Although I liked my burger better, the Kiki's burger is a great alternative, especially if you love mushrooms. Three different types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, and a sweet onion marmalade takes this burger's flavor in a completely different direction. Bachi Burger is one of the few places in Vegas where I will endorse a $12-15 burger."

S"So I dunno if you've ever been in a situation where you're really hungry and you're thinkin, 'Do I want a Burger, or do I feel like a hot bowl of Noodles?'  So typical..... I've been there on numerous occasions and let me tell you, I could ponder that fork in the road for hours...if only there was a place that served both..... Tadaaaa!\nWell, it's not exactly one place, more like two places adjacent to each other by chef/owner Lorin Watada; whose fusion burger fame, 'Bachi Burger' has propelled her into Ramen game - the current 'it' food in Vegas.  Not that there can be enough Japanese fare in my opinion!\n\n\nHachi Machi, give me a Bachi!!!\n \nBachi Burger is a Japanese Hybrid Burger joint serving the American classic  with Japanese twists.  It's become the culinary zeitgeist to throw a bunch of 'Asian' ingredients on anything and see what whacked flavor comes out (yack) yielding moderate to disastrous results.  Innovation is great but sometimes you just have to go simple.  \n\nBut when I feel like having something other than you standard Burger fare, I look to Bachi - the flavor combinations are nostalgic and the burger quality is pretty good.  Also, there's a proximity and it's open all the time (unlike the Foodtrucks that are sooo good, but just a scheduling/coordinating pain).  There's a previous review of Bachi - go ahead and read and you'll get what I'm talking about below...\n\nDid you read it? Ok, good. Just as a summary, they serve a lot of Asian style dishes as appetizers, Chinese Bao's, Chicken Karage and Edamame, so you get a harmonic blend of Asian bites with All American Burgers. And for a guy like me who has trouble deciding on one cuisine, I get a bit of everything like an international buffet..but with good food.\n\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries:\n\nParmesan Reggiano + Black Truffle Porcini Cream + Sun Dried Tomato Aioli.  In my previous posts, I complained that I enjoyed what little gravy they provided for this cone heap of Fries that they stingily provide.\nIt seems that someone was listening; upon my recent visit, the Fries came with a generous portion of the creamy gravy that made those Fries uber luxurious and thoroughly fulfilling.  The Sun Dried Tomato Aioli does not work at all with the Truffle cream, however, since there is a portion of fries near the bottom of the cone that is not coated with decadent sauce, the Aoli serves a good condiment for those untouched by the earthy goddess...\n\n\nKiki Burger \n\nI've had the Ronin Burger which was pretty good, and the Black and Green Burger was amazing.  But my favorite is the Kiki Burger: an Angus Beef Patty with saut\xc3\xa9ed Shitake, Eryngii and Enoki Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese and a Garlic Aioli.  When I first reviewed this Burger, my biggest complaint was that overabundant smattering of the Aioli drowning out the flavor of all the other ingredients, including the Burger.\n\nWell, much to my pleasure, they had listened; the Plate was served with the Aioli on the side, which could be knifed on to one's liking.  This made a world of difference, you could taste all the awesome flavors that this burger has to offer: The charcoal permeated through the Beef, which alone was satisfying, the Gruyere + Caramelized Bacon elevated the unctuous bass level notes, while the Sweet Onion Marmalade was savory and sweet. I added my own level of Garlic Aioli, just enough kick to spice it up before each bite....Super delish!\n\n\nSo, now it come down to the Battle: who won?\n\nFor Appetizers:  I don't know, they both so different!!\nFor Main:          I can't choose - they're both sooo good!!!\nFor Dessert:      Bleah.....\n\nThere really is no battle, if you feel like having Burgers, ie. red meat, got to Bachi.  If you cold and need to warm up with a great bowl of Ramen with some great Broth, get yourself on over to Shoku Ramen Ya.  I love both of these places and it's always hard to decide each time I'm in front of these two doors!\n\n\n\nBachi Burger                                                     \nRatings (Out of Five Stars)                                   \nFood:         4.5                                                   \nAmbience:  3                                                      \nService:      4         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways start off with a plate of Gyoza, it's like a cultural tradition of Ramen Shops to provide these half dozen, moon shaped crispy delights stuck together like little piglets.  It's always a little game to try and pick them off without ripping the skin, retaining the piping hot filling within its crackling confines.  As for t"

S"Forget about the fact that you'll be spending about $20 for a burger and fries.\n\n\nIt was Saturday night on the strip and craving a burger at around 11:15pm.\n\n\nNot to worry, Bachi Burger is open til midnight on Saturdays.\n\nSo after a quick drive to an unsuspecting strip mall off Windmill, you'll find some unique gourmet-ish type burgers to kill that craving. It was my first time there so of course I had to have a burger but there are definitely some other things on the menu that I'd love to go back for and try ... like the chili fried chicken, pork buns or the oxtail chili cheese fries.\n\n\nBut I stuck with the plan and had the Miyagi San grass-fed Wagyu burger that had chili mayo,  fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon and crispy onion rings. You pretty much feed any cows grass and you know that shit will taste delicious. \n\nI really can't tell the difference between the grass fed beef compared to others but the burger was damn tasty and I'd definitely come back to Bachi Burger when in LV even though it's off the strip.\n\n\nSo if you're craving a burger while in Sin City, haven't lost all your money gambling and drinking and have means of transportation to get here.\n\n\nGive the place a try, just expect to overpay for a burger and fries but then remember again where you are.\n\n\nYup, LV."

The ambience was positive. \n\nBased on Yelp reviews, I ordered the Ronin burger. My wife ordered the Veggie burger. We also got some edamame, garlic fries and sweet potato fries. The presentation of all of the food was awesome. My burger was good, but all of the ingredients together made the taste uniquely sweet. I expected alot more fire and brimstone. I couldn't help compare this burger to the ones at Umami's, pretty similiar in my book. The garlic fries wasn't too garlicky, pretty mild. The dipping sauce was excellent. Not a big fan of sweet potato fries but my wife enjoyed it.\n\nOur server was great and friendly. He made sure to go out of his way to take good care of us. Overall, a hip and unique burger joint.

Although, I was bummed that when I requested to cook the eggs over-easy, the chef said no. That would have been delish! The yolk oozing out....I know.. weird.  The truffle fries were ok. I know right? Chocolate + fries = hmmm..Something I still need to get used to. Also, try the hot green tea. Will definitely aid with digestion:).\nThe bf was the only one that ordered the Kiki's burger and he only ate half; he was definitely FULL which is rare. \nThe first time we ate here, I got the Kalbi burger, which is also yummy but I prefer the Ronin burger. \nOh, and if you crave for this place on a random Saturday night (midnight-ish) come early or ORDER ASAP!

My friends have raved about it, my fellow Yelpers have raved about it, so when I had a burger craving, I drove across town and gave it a go! And I was not disappointed!\n\nWe started off with the pickled appetizer. It was light, different, and delicious. My favorite was the pickled garlic. Divine! Some of the other pickled options were alright, but the garlic blew my mind.\n\nI got Kiki 's Burger which had a carmalized onion, bacon marmalade and two types of Asian mushrooms. It was great, but the way the patty was put together was odd. It had a sweet taste to it. It was odd, different, and good. I just wasn't expecting a sweet burger. \n\nI paired my burger with the Truffle Parmesan fries. They were delicious and crispy. What I didn't like was that the truffles and Parmesan were all pilled on top of the fries instead of mixed all the way through.\n\nOf course, being the foodie I am, I had to try a dessert. I ordered the Portuguese donuts, with Vietnamese Cinnamon, and Coffee gelato.  The donuts that are dusted with cinnamon is a divine heavenly combo. It's melt in your mouth delicious. I would only order this is you are a coffee fan because individually the items are okay, but when paired together, your socks will be rocked off!\n\nBachi Burger was inventive, fun, and reasonably priced. The inside of the restaurant was clean and their was adequate seating. I will definitely be back to try more Bachi amazingness!"

S"My favorite uppity burger before was probably the truffle burger at Umami in California because I LOVE the taste/smell of truffle oil.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and say that the Shogun burger($26) is easily the best burger I have ever had. The price is high but omfg the taste was off the charts.  What really drew me to order it was because I wanted to try what foie gras tasted like for the first time and it did not disappoint. It's a perfect burger to me.  Juicy patty, fatty truffle foie gras, sweetness from the pear, and the soft crispy crunch around the edge of the bun.  It had all the right textures and flavor.\n\nWe ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries like everyone recommended and it was damn good.  We also ordered the Kiki and Spicy Miso burgers.  I didn't really care for them after trying the shogun burger though.  Angus patty wasn't as good as the wagyu but don't get me wrong, they were still good burgers.  Little things bothered me with each burger like how the spicy miso burger had too much sauce for my taste and the bacon in the kiki burger was a salty pop that I thought was too much at times.\n\nService was top notch.  Server and hostess were great and empty plates and trash were never on the table for more than 3-5 minutes.  Water was always topped off.  Places like this is what 5 star ratings are for."

S"Premium burgers with lots of fixings at affordable prices makes this place a Vegas must-try!\n\nAfter hearing so much about Bachi Burger from fellow Honolulu Yelpers, I added this to my list of Must-Try's when visiting Las Vegas.  I've heard that the restaurant's owner originated from Hawaii(?), hence the menu's Asian and local influence.\n\nUpon setting foot in the restaurant, I noticed that majority of the patrons were Asian.  Not to be stereotypical, but it seemed like a good sign to me as a fellow Asian...haha\n\nMost of the burgers are very affordable, in the $10 range, though I did see a $25 burger which came with foie gras to justify its price tag.  The downside is that all burgers don't come with fries, which we had to order separately for about $4 per order.\n\nI think what makes these burgers so awesome is the unique variety of toppings/fixings you get on your burger:\n\nI got the KIKI'S BURGER which is an Angus beef burger with saut\xc3\xa9ed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli.  Supposed to be a popular choice.  As a mushroom lover, this burger was pretty bomb.  Not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but definitely up there!  The burger was juicy and the toppings were delicious and offered a variety of textures and flavors!   And the bun was heavenly soft yet still with enough substance to guarantee proper bun to fillings proportions.  My only complaint is that the burger was cooked in that sweet onion marmalade which was tasty, but a bit too sweet for me...\n\nKIKI'S BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ\n\nMy BF got the MIYAGI-SAN BURGER which is a grass fed wagyu beef burger with a fried egg, bacon, crispy onion rings, chili mayo, and furikake.  Also supposedly a very popular choice.  He really REALLY liked his burger.  I didn't get to try it myself since I was getting way too full from my own burger and fries, but it definitely looked like a burger any man (or woman) would love!\n\nMIYAGI-SAN BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#aMTZaqmcmkR_sifO0NEgtg\n\nWe also got sweet potato fries and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  The truffle fries were pretty good but the cheese made it a little soggy.  The sweet potato fries were also very good, but didn't justify the price tag for me.\n\nSWEET POTATO FRIES - $4.50 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#qcyiyggpwYcyI4XJdNihiQ\n\nPARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - $4 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#7erf_MxA6MMN-ueKQkzcUg\n\nService was just okay, though I may be influenced because a bowl of ranch sauce bounced off the floor and some of the sauce got all over my legs, shorts, and in my BF's eye when the waitress was taking away our plates.  Obviously not her fault, but she could have been a little more accommodating about it...\n\nBottom line, delicious burgers with unique ingredients and flavors!"

First try I didn't check and went on a monday and they were closed boo....\n\nI had their regular burger with bacon, eggs, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo....and....drum roll....the Bacon was really tasty.  That was the only thing that really stood out.  The presentation was good too...But the burger itself was pretty bland.  Maybe ive been spoiled with so many gourmet burger joints in california and vegas....but the bachi version was ok.   I didnt try any of their other specialty version as im not too fond of some of the items.\n\nThe seating arrangement was nice, i liked the decor, and service was good as well.  Looked liked they may be able to some outdoor seating?  shrugs...perhaps it is too hot in vegas....\n\nI would come again if i was hosting an out of towner who wanted an away from the strip experience...\n\nwe ordered 2 versions of the fries...and both were just a ok.  the truffle fries and some other ones with cilantro in it.  \n\nI think they tried to get a bit too creative ... at least for my taste."

I would have liked to try the short rib one but they told me they took it off the menu.  The Banh mi burger was also very good.\n\nI would love to give this place 5 starts bu the location is not great for people staying on the Strip--about $20 cab each way from Mandalay, which basically doubles the price of anything on the menu.  5starts is you have your own ride but not worth the cab ride.  \n\nPlease open a location on the Strip!

For a Saturday night, when most are out drinking, there was a surprising amount of patrons.\n\nI won't bore you with a rundown of our orders, but I will mention a few things:\n\n- Great presentation of fries, go with a group of 4-6 so you can try em all.  Unless you're a fatty.\n\n- The Vietnamese coffee had a strong hazelnut flavor.  Fail in my book.\n\n- Your burger choice may be hit or miss... but I'm pretty sure you'll have some interesting flavors to talk about.  I think I'll follow Arvin T's lead and build my own solid and regular burger with their quality ingredients.\n\nBy no means cheap, come here for a bit of a tasting adventure at a chic spot.  Plus its off strip, so you can claim some street cred for bringing an out-of-towner here."

S'I finally made my triumphant return to Bachi Burger a few weeks ago onky a girls\' escape-from-LA weekend. \n\nAfter this visit, my sister and I have tried almost all of the burgers and will need to move on to the crab, chicken, and fish burgers (and baos).\n\nDuring this visit we ordered the bahn mi burger and the kalbi burger, both of which were absolutely delicious and craftily done. The kalbi burger was topped with kimchee and tasted like a korean bbq meal in a bun. However, for me, the bahn mi burger really stole the show and may just be my favorite choice so far. Burgers are inherently greasy and meaty and, although this burger accomplishes that "essence," it also managed to be really light and clean on the palate and brought through all of the herbal and fresh flavors of a traditional bahn mi sandwich. \n\nSeriously, the bahn mi is bomb-ass. \n\nThe wait was about the same as the last time, but the timing was much better, with everything coming out at about the same time as opposed to the fries coming out first with the burgers following some time after. The service was great as it was the first time- the staff is very attentive and you can really tell they take pride in the menu. \n\nThe only sadface from this visit is that I was really intent on trying the homemade poptart only to find that it wasn\'t on the menu anymore. Maybe next time! *fingers crossed*'

S'Burgers re-imagined in the style of popular Asian comfort food...fusion disaster or synergistic food nirvana?  That was the question I sought to answer when I stepped into this southeastern joint with my sister visiting from out of town and two other friends.  \n\nBeginning with an appetizer: \nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries "garnished" with a sunny side up egg...let that concept wrinkle your brain for a minute,\n\nPortion is definitely worthy of sharing with 4.   Shaq would have better luck winning a game of Jenga than my attempting to eat this with one\'s hands without making a hot mess.   Armed with forks, we broke the egg all across the beautiful pastiche of crisp golden fries, hearty oxtail chili, and luscious gooey cheese that harmonized in a beautiful symphony of texture and flavor.  \n\nThe hardest part was deciding on burgers, so we each agreed to order a distinct burger and cut them into quarters for all to sample.  Although the waiter suggested we order them medium, I think we chose wisely with medium rare.\n\nBurger #1 The Ronin\n\nIn the movie Ronin, when DeNiro\'s character is asked about how he avoids an ambush, he replies "Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt."  When I glanced at the description and read the reviews of my trusty Yelpers on what appears to be the gold standard of the Bachi Burgers, I had no doubts this one was going to be a winner.  Perfectly cooked patty topped with some nuttiness from miso-goma dressing, tanginess from Katsu bbq sauce, crunch from the Japanese slaw, binded together with the runny yolk of a fried egg and then slathered with a citrus-yuzu aioli, if you haven\'t started drooling on your keyboard, perhaps you need to get your salivary glands checked out.\n\nBurger #2 The Kalbi Burger\n\nSomewhat of a misnormer since they use ground beef and pork rather than the marbly beef short rib from which its name sake is inspired, but nonetheless well executed.  Along with a korean-inspired mayo, green onions, and a healthy punch of kimchee, the flavor profile is great although I would have preferred a stronger spice component with hotter chili paste.  Nice touch with a banchan accompaniment of spicy korean pickles.\n\nBurger #3 "The Crusty Crab\'s replacement"\n\nCan\'t recall the name of this one since it was one of the specials and is supposed to be the replacement for The Crusty Crab, which was essentially a crabcake sandwich, but this one is like a Steak Oscar between two pieces of bread so I\'ll temporarily call it the Krabby patty, in honor of Spongebob Squarepants.  Beef patty topped with crab, scallop, a fried egg, and some crispy vegetable component that has slipped my mind, Plankton would gladly hatch a scheme to serve this burger to compete with the Krusty Krabs.   \n\nBurger #4 Spicy Miso Burger\n\nHighlights include Angus beef, roasted garlic, apple vinaigrette (side note: totally would have missed this word in a spelling bee because of that sneaky extra i), and shishito peppers.  This one was like the cute girl next door standing alongside the other three supermodels of burgers.  Nothing to complain about, but not much of a revelation either.  The finely shredded lettuce has a propensity to lose its crunch amongst the liquid components without providing any added flavors like a spicy arugula.  Don\'t be intimidated by the name, as shishito peppers are not considered anywhere close to spicy as its other Asian cousins in Chinese or Thai cuisine...not really sure if I could even make it out, which probably relates to the final point: the apple vinaigrette overpowers the other mild components so that you don\'t get the popping off of distinct flavors as in the other burgers.\n\nIn summary, the patties were well seasoned and sufficiently moist, the brioche-like bun is probably personal preference since it is soft and heavy as opposed to light and toasty (reminds me of the baked pork buns at dim sum), although I would have to say the Ronin comes closest to living up to Barney Stinson\'s highest compliment for any budding burger connoisseur:  "I love this burger so much I wanna sew my ass shut!"'

Foie gras, eel, pear, miso butter - my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.  My wife had the Kiki's burger and was very happy with her selection (but envious of my burger once she had a bite.)  We also tried the pickle appetizer (meh), the oxtail chili cheese fries and the salt and pepper fries (both very good.)  I had 2 different ciders (who's names I don't remember), and they were both excellent.  While the prices are high, this place is on the same level as Umami Burger - only better.

However, we ordered quite a lot, including oysters, steak, duck salad, lamb (I think), sparkling water, truffle fries and dessert. The ambiance is dark and romantic, but honestly, I believe there's better value for dinner elsewhere and the food good, just didn't have a wow factor. That being said, I still had a good time and the service was excellent. \n\nOne bonus is that at night, after dinner you can take a little stroll through their pool area right outside Buchon.

Soo I plan on trying it again and getting something different next time!\n\nAnyway, they bring complimentary bread out with butter and a cherry jelly. I heart bread and butter so that was already a pretty good start. I ordered the Bouchon French Toast and my husband got the Croque Madame (because all the other tables around us had fries and he wanted to see what all that was about!). My french toast was small, dainty, and very beautifullly plated. It was tasty and I enjoyed it, however it comes out soaked in the maple syrup and there weren't enough slivers of the apple. Overall, it was good, but just a tad too sweet for me. My husband's croque madame was very good! And so were the fries. :) I wish I could have tried other things like the special appetizer of the day and the doughnuts, but we were full and I really wanted to get stuff from the bakery. =)"

Overall a better experience than Payard's with a more reasonable price tag.\n\nThe duck confit crepe however was underwhelming however.\n\nI have not experienced this place for dinner so I cannot comment.\n\nSo overall, I would go back to this place for breakfast - more for the pasteries.

Simple and hits the comfort food part of my soul. \n\nI mostly come here for brunch.\n\nLove the Croque Madame, quiches have been flaky and flavorful, and the mussels served with fries are wonderfully  fresh mussels with a nice saffron wine sauce. The whole thing about his fries being the best- these are good fries but its debatable if its the best...on the other side of the casino is Pinot Brasserie and I favor their fries more. To each their own- there is no "best" out there but the "best" to each our taste. Chicken and waffles were good but its not FRIED chicken which I looooveee...separate elements each are yum, but together I can\'t get past roasted chicken...but the chive and bacon waffle is awesome! . \n\nI have no complaints about service. It is decent and hasn\'t slipped up much. Still it\'s not the best and the Bouchon Beverly Hills staff is a lot more friendly and attentive to me....and the Napa Bouchon is the friendliest of the Bouchons. \n\nThis is a recommended spot when people ask me about where to brunch on the strip.

The chef here knows his stuff , food is 100 consistent and delicious .\n\nThe management is is the most dedicated I know of in any place . They go above and beyond to make sure you have an experience instead of just a bite to eat, Huguette was so good to us and made each dinning experience an awesome one . We are in Vegas 8-10 times a year and I look forward to my trips knowing I get to stop in and stuff my self with all these delicious choices .'

S'You no doubt are wondering why only two stars for what SHOULD have been a five star dining experience.  \n\nStopped in for brunch last Saturday around 12:30 - we were super excited to try this landmark French restaurant.\n\nFrom the minute we were seated, service was sub par and disappointing.  The waiters were more preoccupied with anything other than customer satisfaction.   We learned later that the restaurant closed at 2 pm and that the staff\'s focus was on ending their shift.\n\nUpon ordering, We were told that several of our first choice items (regular menu items, not specials) were out.  We had to ask multiple times for our coffee which was not delivered until the end if our meal.  After delivering our meals, the waiter once again scurried quickly away.  We had to TRACK him down and ASK (multiple times) for silverware...  First he brought only forks.  But we needed knives to cut our meats as well...  I had ordered steak and pommes frites with aioli.  And, when delivered, i wasn\'t surprised to hear they had no more aioli.\n\nI don\'t mind expensive French restaurants with attitude.  I do believe, that if you are promoting a that restaurant is "open for brunch", the restaurant should deliver on that with a menu and staff in place.\n\nThis was NOT the five star experience we had previously at Le Cirque.  I wouldn\'t go back to Bouchon nor would I recommend it.'

S"Hey it's my 200th review, glad I saved this review for my landmark moment.\n\nI've always had a fondness for this French bistro in the heart of Vegas (yes I know the original is up in Napa, but who has time to go there?) and yes 4 stars may be shorting it slightly, but if yelp allowed half stars, I'd easily give it a 4.5.\n\nBouchon was my gateway to the culinary world of Thomas Keller and I first went there for brunch back when I was a relative food ignoramus and enjoyed their much praised brunchtime meal with an assortment of breakfast meats and some chicken & wafflers, Keller-style.  \n\nNow I've returned nearly 2 years later with a bit more taste, perspective and experience under my belt, and having eaten at many french influenced places, bistros and brasseries, I can say Bouchon still does it right and maintains its well deserved reputation.\n\nComing here for a late dinner on a Fri night due to a friend's delayed plane flight, the management was gracious to let us arrive later than our arranged time and to be honest we might have been the last diners of the night coming in the door around 10pm.  Getting to the restaurant is a relative maze and fortunately having been their before I helped guide us thru the treacherous mazeways that is the Venetian hotel.  Taking a dedicated elevator up to the 10th floor, you walk down an ornate and sumptuous hallway leading to the restaurant entrance, hinting you are in for some kind of occasion.\n\nWe sat down and starting attacking the menu with a series of orders that go something like this:\n\nMarinated octopus salad with grilled eggplant, cucumbers, parsley & mint vinegrette - This was a pleasant surprise as the octupus tentacles were sliced, cooked to near perfection meaning  they were tender to the bite, not rubbery in the least and unless you see the suckers you would have no idea you were eating mollusk meat.\n\nEscargots in puff pastry - I'll be honest, while I always order escargot, its not because I love or even like snails that much, its because of the rich, buttery, garlic sauce that I soak up with the accompanying puff pastry and any bread that maybe leftover on the table.  Ah what a delicious heart attack in a mini baking tin\n\nCod brandade beignets with tomato confit & fried sage - I had no idea what to expect but these weren't like the beignets I've tried before, almost like a light, crispy potato or taro fritter and also really good.  Something reminiscient of Indian pakooras or samosas but much more delicate.\n\nKurobuta pork loin with summer stone fruit - Juicy and tender pork loin, I love pig, this is prepared very simple without and excess of sauce and garnish.  \n\nWhite sausage with potato pur\xc3\xa9e & French prunes - I'm a fan of boundin noir, french black blood sausage so I decided to give its mirror counterpart a try.  Again, fantastic and with a totally different flavour to black sausage it tasted quite meaty like any good breakfast sausage and something I could see myself enjoying with eggs and a french toast.\n\nSteak frites - Now I've been to NYC Brasserie Les Halles which prides itself on its steak frites, but to be honest theirs seems like an overcooked, flat piece of meat compared to what Bouchon serves up, good lord, you get a surprisingly thick and juicy piece of steak for surprisingly not a bad price.  Sadly the pommes frites are cooked in peanut oil and not duckfat like the NYC counterparts are.  Gotta love the lardons canard...\n\nI feel like any Vegas trip should be crowned by one destination meal if budget allows and Bouchon certainly did the trick on this trip.  Wonderful for a casual or more intimate meal with friends or loved ones, highly recommended."

S"Again my BF picked this place.....i trust him....he is a chef...The service is awesome.  We walked in without reservation on a Sunday night. We only wanted around 15 minutes.  For appetizers we had oysters and duck confit.  Oysters were fresh, but my BF claimed that the duck was not as tender as he would have liked.  Also, he said is makes it better....I had the beet and pear salad with goat cheese and BF ordered the fris\xc3\xa9e salad with bacon and a sunny side egg. For the main dishes I got the pan-roasted trout with almonds,\nbrown butter & haricots verts and BF got a skirt steak with risotto.  For dessert we shared creme brulee.  Dinner was awesome!!!!  This place will be a regular spot to go whenever I'm in Vegas."

S"This place exceeded my expectations.  Came here in a party of 8 and was seated for brunch in about 30 minutes.  Our table was near a bright window.\n\nThe prices aren't cheap, but the portions really are more than adequate.  The complimentary bread was good, but a bit hard.  It came with nice raspberry jam and butter.  My orange juice tasted super fresh.\n\nEveryone seemed to enjoy their food -- the country breakfast is $25 but comes with eggs, biscuit, meat, gravy, and buttery grits.  Yum!  I got the salmon baguette plate, which was very fresh.  The others at the table seemed to enjoy the chicken and waffles, corned beef hash, etc.  I'd say the only dish that was not super mindblowing was the french toast that someone let me try... plus it pretty much just stands alone like a dessert (though it looks/tastes like one).\n\nWe also ordered beignets, which were more like doughnuts.  They come three to an order but are fairly large.  The insides were warm and soft and came with nutella and raspberry jam.\n\nStaff was very nice, though a bit slow at some points (like bringing the check).  But the point is to enjoy your food and company, right?  The five-star rating is mostly for the overall experience, I've had slightly better selection and similar food at other breakfast places, but the overall experience was a 5."

S"The annual firm dinner was held in one of the private dining rooms, and I must say, we had the most exceptional service and an unforgettable meal.\n\nWe had an array of appetizers to start:\nQuiche du Jour - creamy and not too heavy\nCharcuterie plate - one of my favorites, I love all kinds of charcuterie plates and Bouchon's had a wonderful array of cheeses and salumi\nMarinated Olives - not a huge fan of green olives, but these were nicely presented and tasted, well, like salty green olives\nSalmon Rillette - melts in your mouth, simply amazing and I don't even like salmon\n\nFor my entree, I had the their renowned Poulet R\xc3\xb4ti. This was SO GOOD! I never thought roasted chicken would blow me away like this. It came with chanterelle mushrooms, caramelized figs, pickled ramps & their chicken jus. This sauce just brought everything together so wonderfully.\n\nFor dessert, I indulged in one of their port wines, the Fonseca. By this time, I was probably 2-3 glasses of wine in from dinner, so needless to say, the port wine ended my alcohol streak on a nice and sweet note.\n\nThank you to Mike and his colleagues for the wonderful service and charming anecdotes."

S"Came for dinner on a weeknight. Luckily there was no wait, and the decor/ambience are absolutely gorgeous in a classic, old world charm sort of way -- tucked away on an upper floor in the Venetian, it's a welcome change of scenery compared to Vegas' other fine dining establishments that have a not so discreet view of the casino floor, and yet you're still in the midst of the action on the strip. Unfortunately, the positives of my experience at Bouchon end here.\n\nService was god awful -- inattentive, unaccommodating, and generally disinterested in making my evening a pleasant one. After being completely ignored for 15 minutes upon being seated, I got up to use the restroom only to find that my table setting had been cleared away by the time I returned. No apology whatsoever. When I finally got my waiter's attention after another 15 minutes of being ignored, he didn't bother to walk me through the menu or the special of the day, and he was unwilling to help me choose a dish/work with the kitchen to prepare something that would suit my not uncommon dietary restrictions. I finally settled for the trout, although at that point I shouldn't have bothered. The dish was just as bad as the service: the fish was entirely unseasoned and flavorless, and the rudimentary, unmemorable cauliflower amandine felt like an afterthought thrown on top. What the plate lacked in flavor it more than compensated for with a completely gratuitous amount of added fat: as if being served in the veritable pool of butter in which it was pan-fried wasn't enough, the top of the filet was slathered in enough oil for the trout to positively swim in (if it wasn't already fileted down the middle). FYI Mr. Keller: oil is not a substitute for flavor!\n\nBlegh -- meal was such a disappointment that I wasn't even interested in taking the 15% off coupon for the similarly mediocre bakery. Next time I remotely consider patronizing Thomas Keller, it's French Laundry or bust."

The brunch plates came in very generous portion, I would recommend ordering 2 brunches to share with 3 people.  \n\nI ordered the American Brunch (first on the menu) and cost $25.  The brunch comes with a fresh orange juice, a coffee, choice of pastry, 2 eggs and sausages with toasts.  I picked their specialty butter croissant and they were the best ones I had.  We didn't finish everything and had to pack to go.  \n\nI think my money is well spent at Bouchon and would love to come back again!"

S"Bouchon is practically perfect in every way.\n\nIt's a beautiful restaurant, with high ceilings, booths upholstered in blue velvet, and an impressive display of fresh shellfish on ice. The service is nearly impeccable.\n\nWe went for brunch, which, I think, is my favorite meal at Bouchon. When you sit down, they bring a baguette that is just fantastic, with ramekins of butter and apricot preserves. Bread and butter is one of my favorite things to eat anyway, but when it's superlative bread and exceptional butter, it's one of the very best things.\n\nOne of the specials was Country Hash (potatoes, Merguez sausage, red peppers, red pepper hollandaise), and it was savory and earthy and really, really good.\n\nThe Croque Madame was fantastic as well--your traditional grilled ham and cheese sandwich, on buttery brioche, topped with a perfectly cooked egg, and sauce Mornay (a cheesy cream sauce). \n\nI've been saving the best for last--the Chicken & Waffles. I'm not sure that it's really chicken (if it is, it's a very petite chicken), but you're served a breast, thigh, and leg of perfectly roasted chicken. The skin is browned and crisp, and the meat is juicy and flavorful. The bacon and chive waffle is light and fluffly. They bring the condiments on a separate place--vanilla bean butter, sauce Chasseur (a gravy-ish brown sauce with mushrooms and shallots), and maple syrup. Heaven!"

S'We visited Bouchon in Yountville, CA last year and decided to visit Bouchon Las Vegas this July for breakfast. We arrived about 9:00am and were seated right away. The decor is beautiful and everything is immaculate. The staff was very attentive. My husband ordered the corned beef hash and eggs/toast for $16.95 and I had the Breakfast Jardinere (garden breakfast), which consisted of two eggs, brioche toast, potatoes, gnocchi, fruit salad, juice and daily pastry for $21.95. The food was impeccable! More than we had expected! Not your typical Vegas breakfast. One tip, when ordering water with your meal, as most of us do, they will ask you if you want still, tap or sparkling water. They charge you $7 for a carafe of still water, but the tap is free. \nThe food was amazing, as in true Thomas Keller fashion. Each bite left us wanting more, but eagerly anticipating what was next. We were thoroughly pleased with our meal and will gladly return.'

S"This was my second time eating at Bouchon. My prior visit was a year ago & a positive food experience (had the saffron mussels and have been hunting down a bowl that can compare to this one) \n\nGlad to report that the quality of food is as expected with Thomas Keller's name attached to the place. This is a beautiful space that make you feel like you are in a bistro in Paris (with a lot of personal space). We had the chocolate beignets to start which were delicious with the raspberry & nutella that they were served with. Almost too large a portion and we had to waste one in order to not fill up.  \n\nI had the shrimp & grits topped with runny over easy eggs. This was a very comforting & hearty dish. My girlfriend had the boudin blanc, which has a soft texture and delicate flavor. \n\nThe only downside was that after prompt initial service, our waiter was no where to be found after our food arrived. They forgot our order of frites (which are some of the best I have had, as per my last visit,) and i was not able to request some from our waiter. Quite disappointing as the frites were one of my main reasons for coming back :(  \n\nThe downturn in service put a slight damper on things. However, the food is excellent and this place is a must for anyone who loves French food. Memories of trips to France are definitely going to be rekindled in terms of food!"

My beet salad was wonderfully refreshing, the moules frites excellent, and creme brulee great (can you really f-up creme brulee?  I hope not).\n\nMy husband had the french onion soup and blood sausage.  Both were exceptional. \n\nThe service is top-notch and we will certainly be back again next year.  I didn't quite have same the earth-shattering experience that Tony Bourdain had over the frites- they were good, but got a little soggy as the meal wore on...  However, I was quite pleased that I finally found a restaurant on the strip that could make a gin fizz.  Bouchon is worth the stinky walk through Venetian for a great meal."

S"OH im so disappointed at you bouchon!  as one of my favorite brunch restaurant, i was looking forward to eating here ALL weekend!  First the service was horrible today!  We waited about 30 minutes and was asked whether we wanted to sit outside.  The hostess made it seem like the weather was really nice and breezy with shade that fully covered our table.  We decided we didn't want to wait any longer and agreed to sitting outside.  OMG it was freaking hot.  There was some shade, but the heat was very unbearable.  The heat rays were penetrating through the umbrella and my head was burning hot.  To make it worse it took 10 minutes to bring ice water to our table.  as we were melting  away i wanted to get the water myself since the pitcher was only 5 feet away... we asked to be moved inside and 15 minutes later the waiter came back and told us we had to wait because there are tables inside that are being given to other guests who were waiting for a table.. wtf???\n\nThe food of course is always delicious except for my mushroom quiche..  It tasted way too soggy and did not hold itself well.  The mussels and fries was very good and as always the corned beef hash was good, except it doesn't come in the cast iron pan anymore.. boo =(  it probably was too heavy for the waiters to carry.   They also forgot my friends coffee and orange juice.  \n\nits ok, i still love you bouchon, but please give me better service next time."

I thought my husband would be happy because he loves pastries and people rave about Bouchon pastries.\n  The ambiance is beautiful of course, your in the Venetian, but the service was a tad off and the food did not make up for it.  I had the croque madame, which was pretty good with a ton o fries.  But I felt bad for the hubby.  He ordered the breakfast americaine and you could see more of the plate than food.  And he said the cheese danish from the random coffee shop in another hotel was better.\n\nSo this was a definite miss, and for the price and quality I would go to Grand Lux any day.  At least you get a good portion for what you pay.'

S'On the last day of my stay in vegas, my friends and I decided to go eat brunch at the bouchon, thinking it was going to be extremely expensive because it was French. We were seated immediately next to the window looking out to the venetian pool outisde. The view was enough to make me happy that morning. We ordered the mussles, steak with fries, chicken and waffles and I had the white sausage with eggs and a crossiont. We were served warm bread with butter and apricot jam i think. The jam and bread was to die for. It was so delicious and delicate. After that we recieved our orders. I did not know what was in my sausage but it was soft and tastey along with my warm flaky crossoint and eggs. The mussles were juicy and tastey. The chicken was roasted I think along with some bacon and chive waffles. The waffles came with a sauce and syrup and was very tastey. The fries were okay but the onion topped steak was so juicy and tender it melted in my mouth. It was a very nice meal before we left. Nice and paradise like environment for friends to talk and enjoy the vegas lifestyle.'

We requested a table change and serval order alterations as well in which he addressed on a positive note with good humor. \n\nMenu offerings were all mouth watering, our  ordered dishes were even more delicious!

(Seriously, what's up with this weather?) \n\nI ordered the french toast and my boyfriend ordered the croque madaam.\n\nThe french toast was SO GOOD. Don't expect to be getting actual slices of toast either! This was a little tower of toast complete with apples.\n\nSo good.\n\nThey also have a plethora of champagne cocktails which is a major plus because I love champagne! \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the hibiscus cocktail and it came with an edible flower too!

On top of that they had a few really excellent specials. \n\nWe started with the bone marrow - because, when else would we ever order bone marrow?! My other half LOVED it, but unfortunately it wasn't for me. I still recommend you try it! If we go back I'll probably try the fois gras instead. Our entrees were the lamb and the saffron muscles. Both were beautifully prepared and presented... and delicious!!! \n\nThe wine list was extensive, but also very expensive.

Second, Thomas Keller? You can't get anything else from him unless you go to Per Se in New York or French Laundry in Napa. So if you want a piece of him go for Bouchon and meet in the middle.\n\nFor breakfast I enjoyed the Croque Madame. Sounded neat, tasted phenomenally. Toasted ham and cheese on brioche. I can drink the Mornay sauce as if it was water to live. Put it all over my face why dont you. Comes served with Keller's version of Pomme Frites. I've had better fries but rightfully tasty in its own self. Also tried the Oeuf Au Gratin. it was eh.\n\nDefinitely a place if you want to impress a chick. Won't cost you much. Gorgeous in and outside. The breakfast will start up your whole entire day in Las Vegas.\n\nOnly thing that prys me away from giving Bouchon a five star rating on Yelp.com is the service. Went a couple of times and all those times the service sucked donkey balls. I don't think their PR or Keller himself would like to hear that but that's the truth."

We also ordered Salmon Rilletes, which was fabulous as well.  Even the plain table bread that comes with the butter and spread was just delicious.\nSo the food was great, but it did take a little while to come out of the kitchen.  The server kept checking on us, making sure our drinks were full and our bread kept coming.  Before we even mentioned it, the manager came over and apologized for the wait on the order and comped us some drinks.  I have zero complaints about the service, as our server was charming, friendly and kept us in the loop with regard to our order.

S'With so many celeb chef outlets in Las Vegas, which try to mimic the original locations in high profile dining cities such as New York, San Francisco and London, many disappoint, however, Bouchon Las Vegas does not.  Not only is the Las Vegas location similar in style as the original in Yountville, the food is spot on as the dishes served at the Napa Valley location.\n\nThe foie gras is silky smooth once it reaches room temperature and while on my most recent visit, the "foie gold" as the layer of duck fat is referred to, was removed and whisked away, it can certainly be enjoyed on the never ending toasted bread that is made available for this delicacy.  While all the dishes I have tried at both the original location and the Las Vegas location are identical in taste, portion and presentation, I do find it amusing that the servers need to educate the Las Vegas crowd as to what certain items are, including certain spices and seasonings, including perhaps taking my "foie gold" away as they assumed that I was not educated enough to know what it was - this would never have happened at the original Yountville restaurant, as the Bay Area is foodie central.\n\nOverall, a wonderful meal.'

The duck confit, which was tasty beyond word.  I had the endive salad and my entree was the roasted lamb.  Dessert was the caramel custard with banana ice cream.  I enjoyed the ice cream more than the custard.  And an after drink of the Absinthe Drip.  The service was exceptional,so don't know if I just got lucky or not, but I was very happy when I left."

The hash is prepared with tiny ham squares, not at all oily, but during the meal I was wishing for a hamsteak. The chicken and waffle was all right--the chicken was just a tad dry, and the waffle didn't have that satisfying crunch, but the syrup was yum.

S"This is the best breakfast in Vegas.  It's the kind of place to linger, so though they'll probably try to accommodate it, I wouldn't recommend Bouchon for just a quick breakfast because you would miss so much of the overall experience.  They don't take reservations for breakfast, so call ahead of time.  It's a bit tricky to find.  Start from the Venetian lobby, ask for directions at the info desk or concierge and follow the signs to Venezia tower and Bouchon.  The room is beautiful and you can get seating inside or outside that overlooks the pool.  Service is very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  The breakfast food is spectacular, and the menu items are pretty diverse with the standard egg/'meat meals, things like french toast and waffles and very french fare like the croque madame and egg gratin.  Some dishes come with one of their famous pastries, but if not I recommend you order one anyway.   The ingredients are extremely fresh - the eggs themselves are just amazing."

S'Our group sat on the patio at lunch time, and the atmosphere was lovely.  Service was friendly but a bit slow.  Note that their lunch menu is quite small and simple.  It consists of a few sandwiches and salads.  I tried the steak sandwich, which was good but not mind-blowing by any means.  The sandwich came with kettle chips, and fries are extra.  Dessert consisted of double chocolate cookie, chocolate chip cookie, chocolate bouchons, and a "fat boy" ice cream "sandwich".  I place quotes around "sandwich" because our waitress said it was a sandwich, the menu says it\'s a sandwich, but when it arrived at the table, it was an ice cream bar on a stick - the kind you get from an ice cream truck.  Vanilla with chocolate and chopped peanuts.  It was also cracked, like someone sat on it.  So, I don\'t understand this at all.  On a brighter note, the chocolate bouchons were heavenly - like molten chocolate cake bites.\n\nAs far as French bistros go, I would prefer to go to Boulud at Wynn.'

S'Brunch here was absolutely perfect. Everything I ate, my comment was "couldnt be any better."\nStarted with their baguette w/ housemade mango jam and delicous whipped butter. Very few things I love more then a perfect bread. \nFresh fried raspberry beignets were amazing.\nSourdough waffles with strawberries were the perfect crunchy/chewey texture, yet I would of liked bananas on mine. \nAlso ordered their pomme frites which could be the most absolutely perfect traditional french fry.\nTo top it all off this restaurant is beautiful and aside from being 10 times larger then any french bistro, it really is themed very well. \nWas told wait was 45 and we waited no longer then 20 and the nhl playoffs were on tv. Just an amazing place and I cant wait to try the beverly hills and yountville locations.'

S'We tend to be "less is more" types for meals.  The idea of "all you can eat breakfast buffet", no matter how good it might be touted to be, just isn\'t our thing.  \n\nSo, we\'re glad we followed both the recommendation of acquaintances and our own instincts to choose Bouchon (at the Venetian) for breakfast one morning rather than the buffet at another hotel.  Having enjoyed dinner with at Bouchon in Napa with friends a couple of years ago, we were expecting good things at this Bouchon Bistro.  Our expectations were met.\n \nNo need to recite the menu as the web site provides a good view of it.  But worth sharing that the smoked salmon and baguette choice was wonderful.  The salmon was perfectly seasoned, the crusty bread top notch and the chive cream cheese and capers the perfect partners.  At about $14 for this salmon selection, we thought it was a good deal as Las Vegas goes, in particular factoring in the quality of the food, the service and the lovely setting.  We also had a delectable almond brioche pasty and some perfectly cooked bacon.  Really good coffee too...and bet you won\'t find THAT at a buffet!  \n\nAs an observation, the pastries here are really, really good...but we think the ones at Jean-Phillipe (pasty and chocolates) just off the lobby in The Bellagio are better.  Unfortunately, you have to stand in line at Jean-Phillipe and seating is at tables lining the public spaces at The Bellagio.  You may not be able to eat the lovely ambiance at Bouchon, but somehow it did make that almond brioche taste even better!  (That said, don\'t miss Jean-Phillipe for pastries. They ARE worth standing in line for.) \n\nThere are lots of good photos of Bouchon as posted by others to help underscore just how lovely this is.  Light filled from big windows.  On a warmer day we\'d be tempted to try the terrace seating.\n\nDid we say "lovely" yet to sum up this experience? :-)\n\nWe put Bouchon in a tie with Hash House A Go Go (but only the OFF STRIP location)  for the best breakfast in Las Vegas.  Two very different dining experiences, but each really great  ones.  You\'d be missing out if you didn\'t try them both.  Seriously.'

S"I had high expectations for this place, what with Thomas Keller's reputation and the gaudy yelp standing and the circuitous route to get to the spot and my love of brunch.\n\nWe left disappointed.  The service was awful.  My theory behind th bad service stems from the preponderance of European and foreign folk that seemed to fill every table.  Euro's don't tip.  The wait staff surely gave up trying to earn their tips through stellar service long ago.  \n\nThat attitude is unfortunate because I am a fat tipper and our server ignored us and rolled her eyes at us and otherwise undermined our meal.  \n\nThe pastries were all stale.\n\nThe entrees came out one at a time over the course of 15 minutes.\n\nI had to ask 3 times where my sticky pecan roll was.  When I finally got it it was dried out and uninspired.\n\nSauteed spinach that came with one of the dishes was unseasoned, inedible, and unnecessary.\n\nI had the croque madame which was really good.  All of the entrees were great, actually, but the combination of awful service and stale pastries left me with a bad taste in my mouth."

S"While in town for the weekend with friends we decided to try out Bouchon.  Being a Thomas Keller fan and enjoying his creations I had really high hopes.  The menu comes wrapped around your napkin in a folded paper.  Out waiter was nice, but a little over the top for us and was a bit chatty.  Some people might like that, but not our group.  It made it a bit awkward for us.\n\nI started with the beet salad and a selection of oysters.  The salad was yummy and the oysters were a fair selection from the waters of the north pacific.  I've had a better selection with better condiments to go with them.  The wine was fair, but I'm always trying new things and the waiter didn't have much input in my selection.  I had the lamb for my main entree and even though it was a smaller sized portion it still had a lot of great flavor.  You don't get that gamey taste, but just a full savory one.  The steak my gf had was delicious with the smothered butter and caramelized onions.  For dessert we had the profiteroles, which was a-ok.  Nothing like the foie gras profiteroles we had at le pigeon in portland, but just ok.\n\nWould I go back?  Most likely, but I'm sure to try out some other places before doing so."

Friend had lobster benedict, a special of the day.  She approved, which is hard to come by.  Her husband had the dish where you have a little of everything, eggs, pastry, drink, and breakfast meat... we wouldn't recommend it as it was just so plain compared to other fabulous dishes you can gorge on.  Sticky cinnamon pecan bun was nutty and the orange juice tasted freshly squeezed.\n\nAwesome brunch place! A must visit spot."

S'So many reviews of this restaurant rave about the amazing service and food. I unfortunately have to share my experience and it was a sorry excuse for an establishment of this caliber. I went for brunch on a Sunday, and arrived shortly before it got really busy. We had an abundance of waiters so it was nice to have drinks constantly refilled. The bread was nice and chewy, the beignets were delicious and the mimosa was divine. I decided to order one of their specials, the eggs Benedict. My entree arrived looking like it sat under a heat lamp for 30 minutes. I immediately cut into my poached eggs to see if they were runny, and was sadly disappointed to see that they were fully cooked. I hesitated to send them back, then my friend reminded me that I was paying $27 for this plate so I might as well get it right. I sent it back and received another plate a few moments later. The eggs on this dish were better, still not completely runny but I accepted it. The dish was quite tasty and satisfying. The waiter apologized several times for the mishap but it still left a sour taste in my mouth after wanting to eat here for so long and then paying $80 plus tip for brunch.'

S"Second time here wasn't as good as the first.  I was hoping to see Chef Keller's legendary awesomeness at breakfast, but surprisingly came away disappointed.  \n\nIt was pretty spankin early for vegas standards, so my friend and I came here for breakfast.  It's set away from the casino, which makes it's a nice, relatively quiet place.  The sausages were great, but the crossiant was really greasy.  I mean it made my lips extra-shiny-greasy.  And the potato was very salty.  But the sausages were just that good that i overlooked most of the imperfections.  \n\nIt's a nice dining experience here and in the summer you can eat on the patio that overlooks one of the smaller, more private pools at the venetian (which i did last year).  One thing of note is that my friend felt uncomfortable with all the old men leering at her throughout our meal.  I think they thought i was taking my hooker to breakfast, but um, no that's not it.  Bouchon can't control that, but it did make her uncomfortable."

Our coffees tasted amazing (I went down to the bakery to buy the beans right after) and was possibly the best blend I've had. My friend's waffles came out perfectly (crispy with generous specks of bacon and chive) and her chicken was so moist. I loved the maple syrup and vanilla bean butter that came with it. The ligonberry jam and butter that came for my brioche was really high-quality (I noticed it and wouldn't normally notice my butter and jam!) and my eggs were the most perfectly fried eggs I've ever seen - evenly fried, not too greasy. Fresh grapefruit juice, 6 crispy strips of bacon, and two sausages later, I felt sufficiently but not overly full, and appreciated the fresh and expertly cooked taste of each item we had."

S"Judging from the hundreds of glowing reviews here, you don't need me to tell you that this place is awesome, but I will anyway. \n\nI was recently in Vegas to celebrate my birthday, and decided this would be the best way to start my actual day of birth. So we showed up (kind of on the late side for brunch) and put our name on the list. Though the host said it would take us 50 minutes to be seated, we were seated in more like 10-15. (Yes, he said 50. Not 15. I checked.) Nice surprise!\n\nAfter inspecting the menu, we had to go with some of the more famous brunch dishes on the menu. My boyfriend chose the chicken and waffles, and I went with the mussels and frites. We also couldn't resist the salmon tartare appetizer that was on special that day.\n\nFirst off was the salmon and a couple of mimosas. Both were extremely tasty. The salmon was super fresh, and served with bits of egg, red onion, capers, along with a bit of toasted bread. My only complaints was that we didn't get quite enough toast to eat everything and the small pieces of eggs and such were kind of difficult to get on the bread. The taste was fantastic, though.\n\nThen came the main courses, and they were as good as everyone says. The mussels were a nice variation on the usual preparation, as the mustard in the sauce gave it the kick that it needed. The fries were nicely crisp and perfectly seasoned, definitely in the top five of best fries I've ever had. And the chicken and waffles? I got to try a bit, and it was amazing. The waffle was nice and fluffy, with bits of bacon and chives in there. And they serve it with roasted chicken that was perfectly cooked. Perhaps most surprising were the portion sizes, which were enormous. I wasn't particularly hungry for the rest of the day.\n\nThe service was top notch and the atmosphere was nice and laid back. A+++. Would brunch again."

My wife got the French Toast which was made very differently than normal French Toast...it was very rich n too sweet, couldn't eat it after a while. Drinks were ok.

In short, it is a ham and cheese sandwich made with toasted brioche and smothered with bechamel and a sunny side up egg.  Perfect balance.\n\nQuiche Lorraine - SO GOOD.  Probably on my top 5 quiche lorraine list.  Creamy, eggy, and oh the crust.... the crust was just right.  Texture held up great against the filling and had a nice flakiness.  \n\nBeignets - Not your traditional doughy, fluffy, chewy beignets.  More of a cakey feel, these were just ok.\n\nOVERALL:  Service was top notch & food came out flawless.  \n\nLike I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"

The Madame was delicious!\n\nAmong the other dishes we ordered, the salmon appetizer stood out. The service was very prompt. We never had to ask for more bread to go with the salmon spread, it just continued to arrive. \n\nWhile I felt the wine list was a bit small, I was happy with the Chardonnay that we ordered.

My homie Jon Margarte called up his boy Thomas to let him know the YOLO crew is coming through and to have the reservation for 20 ready.  \n\nBouchon is pretty much the best french spot in Vegas. Way better than anything at the Paris hotel. The experience is exquisite and first class. It's the spot to be scene and dressed up (we wore our YOLO sleeveless shirts). The food is nice, clean, flavorful, high quality, cooked to perfection, and petite. I had the roasted lamb which was joy in every bite, but after a day of drinking did not soak up the alcohol. Every dish and side is done with detail and emphasized on flavor from the bread to entrees to the fries. So good! Highly recommend Bouchon Vegas for a visit."

S"Don't hate on me, Yelpers, but I really wasn't satisfied with my visit to Bouchon when I went a couple of weeks ago. First of all, the wait was only supposed to take 20 minutes according to the hostess, but we waited outside for a good hour. This isn't some Asian restaurant where the host/hostess always says the wait will only take 20 minutes so that people will be fooled and stay longer because they already stayed for a long time. The good thing is that they provided us with some really good pastries while we were waiting. But then more bad things happen...\n\nThey take 30 minutes to get our order.  And it takes about another 40 minutes to get our food. My friend didn't even get the diet coke he ordered at the beginning until after we already started eating. Was this special handmade diet coke? NO. It was from a freakin bottle. I know because he got the bottle with his glass. \n\nI ordered the croque madame expecting goodness considering we waited so long to eat there and it was ranked so highly on Yelp. I gotta say, I wasn't too fond of it. The taste was just meh. And the price I paid for that was disgusting ($19 before tax and tip). I also got to try the mussels, which were alright, but the taste was a bit overwhelming. I think I would have been sick of them after 5 mussels. I got to try the waffles from the chicken and waffles dish as well.  The waffles were disgusting. There are bacon bits inside the mushy waffles. Gross.\n\nWould I come back? With all the quality food available at Vegas with a much shorter wait, probably not."

S"Jon A. was an instant fan once we found out that Bouchon would take some effort to get to. At first, we thought we could get to the Venetian from the Palazzo, but we didn't find a secret passageway that would get us there. We then managed to find the entrance to the Venetian and find a casino directory that would help us get to Bouchon. There were instructions on the map itself that indicated that we would need to take the guest elevators to the 10th floor to find it. We successfully convinced the security guard that although we did not have room keys to the Venetian, we did want to visit Bouchon on the 10th floor. A few floors higher, we crossed a lounge area and selected the path that would take us across a skyway and straight into the welcoming arms of Bouchon.\n\nNow that the trek was over, we were greeted by a friendly host who promptly showed us to a table. We admired the breakfast menu for some time and luckily looked up long enough to see the chalkboards with the day's specials. Jon ordered one of them: three-egg omelet with short ribs, tomatoes, and cheddar. He also got a side of pommes lyonnaise (sliced potatoes and onions, cooked in butter and herbs until golden brown). I went with the Bouchon French toast. All of their juice offerings are freshly squeezed, so we tried the orange juice.\n\nWhile we waited for our food, we surveyed the bar's selection from our table since the menu listed each of their breakfast cocktails at $12 each, including mimosas and bloody maries. (They must use real champagne from Champagne, France and fresh-squeezed orange juice for those mimosas.) They seemed to have a nice selection of the hard stuff, but Jon wasn't impressed with the scotch selection.\n\nThe food made me happy that we chose Bouchon for breakfast: the eggs that made up the omelet shell were nice and fluffy, and the short rib meat inside was cooked perfectly. The pommes lyonnaise made me want to learn how to make it so that I could eat it at home. And the French toast, albeit small in portion size, was delicate and combined several of my favorite things: brioche, apples, custard, and bread pudding. Definitely a great start to the day.\n\nThe restaurant was relatively quiet (definitely quiet compared with the hubbub in the casino area), the atmosphere was calm and elegant, and there wasn't anything to complain about the service. In fact, they probably refilled our water glasses one too many times, but they never let them stay low or empty for longer than two minutes.\n\nThe verdict: Great splurge breakfast spot. (We left there $45 lighter, including tax and tip.) It's a nice oasis that makes you (mostly) forget that you're on the Strip."

I hit this place for breakfast (if I get up in time) at least twice each trip to the city. The clouds of pommes frites, crusty epi baguettes and wonderful sauces keep me coming back. \n\nWhat doesn't: the service. Out of the multitude of times I have eaten here, I have only once gotten decent service. Is it the early mornings? The management? I don't know, but they can't keep any decent servers here. It is bordering on comical.\n\nBut one moment thinking of their tuna tartine, and I am back there again, wanting more."

There were plenty of meat dishes to choose from, yet I was feeling more adventurous and decided on the monk fish with lobster sauce. \n\nThe monk fish by itself didn't have much flavor, but dipping it in lobster sauce makes it go from okay to amazing. It fills you up and leaves you craving for more. Be warned, one of my friends had the steak and fries and there is simply too much fries.\n\nThe service is something you would expect from such a highly rated restaurant.

S"If there is any place in Vegas that we wear out it's Bouchon. The breakfast experience here is the best (as long as there isn't a wait). A French brasserie, Bouchon is an ornate high-ceiling restaurant that brings the feeling of an old cafe in Paris to the strip.\n\nThe breakfast menu is simple, but good. Probably the best oatmeal I've ever had. Like other reviews, it's just a good place to start off the day; especially if it's nice enough to sit outside in the courtyard. The pommes frites are a must. Fancy name, but really good fries. And yes...the fries work in the morning fare.\n\nWarning to vegetarians. While I've never had a problem with finding things I like to eat here, they do like to include bacon with and in lots of dishes so watch out. The potato croquettes have bacon in them. Sorry piggies...I didn't know until I swallowed a bite."

Delicious fresh sourdough bread to quell your hunger while awaiting your entree.  My friend and I shared the famous chicken & waffles and croque madame.

S"If I knew how to say amazing in French I would.\nMy party has reservations for 8:30PM. I have to say, I was skeptical at first as we waited almost 15 - 20 minutes to be sat even though we had a reservation and it was clear there tables open and available.\nSkepticism GONE!\nOur waiter Paul was amazing. Althought the Bouchon is sophisticated, he was so down to earth and friendly that ordering from him and taking his advice seem natural.\nWe order wine, drinks, apatizers, meals and desserts. The Steak Frites and Rack of Lamb were both wonderful!!!!! I wish I had the steak frites right now in front of me.\nAfter dinner as we contemplated dessert, Paul asked what we were in the mood for and said he knew exactly what to bring us. He surpised us with the most amazing desserts that weren't even on the menu. Then the two tables next to starting talking and before we knew it Paul combined all three tables and we stayed an extra hours with our knew friends and amazing wine. \nWonderful restaurant, wonderful experience!!!!!!!!"

S"Bouchon, how have we never met before?\n\nMy bf is a chef, and has loved Thomas Keller for as long as he can remember. He always told me about Bouchon, and how he had never been... so for his birthday I decided to make reservations at the LV location.\n\nReservation service on the phone was helpful and on point. I notified them it was his birthday and they gladly served him a dessert at the end of his meal.\n\nUpon getting there (with our reservation being at 8P) it was packed! With it being such a popular place I wasn't mad even though I was hungry. It took about 30 mins to get seated.... but once being seated they gave us complimentary champagne for having to wait, win!\n\nThe service was efficient and accurate. Remember if it's busy, the time from ordering to getting your food can take a while. This restaurant is beyond amazing and extremely busy, but it's clean, intimate, and the food was amazing.\n\nDid I mention the portions are big? For it being a chic restaurant, my beau and I assumed the portions would be a bit small.... once we got our food we were shocked, they are very giving. \n+Fries are heavenly.\n+Bib salad.... the dressing with herbs is fresh & out of this world. Light & simple.\n+French Onion Soup - will get your taste buds going crazy, very savory & onion-ey!\n+Trout with the best green beans you'll ever consume\n+Complimentary bread & pistachios (bread is cold.. pistachios are warm!)\n\nBy far one of the best dining experiences I've had. They have one in Beverly HIlls which is in my area, so I will be back. Check the menu since it changes with the season. You will not be disappointed with your dining experience at Bouchon. Cheers!~"

S'I spent my birthday here with a party of 8. After dinner we have mixed review about this place among friends, but this is my review so I will stick with my 3 stars while my friends are yelling at me right now to give it 4.\n\nAfter we were seated and placed our order, I must say the wait for the food was above 35 minutes, thank god for their freshly made delicious pistachios and bread. I really enjoyed their Foie Gras for appetizer. But the food was below expectation especially their sandwiches. There were an unusually large amount of fries with my food, most of it went to waste.\n\nMaybe the long wait for food after we ordered disappointed me, but I definitely had better quality food with the price we paid.'

And enjoy a cocktail with your meal. I'd recommend making reservations before going, just so you don't have to wait. If not, the wait time is about 30 minuts.

S"I'm definitely a fan of Bouchon.  I've been to both this location and the BevHills location, and although I would say I favor the BevHills location this one still does a good job.  I still haven't made it to the one in Yountville yet!  Anyway, I have had both bunch and dinner here, and I have to say they do a great job of fancified French bistro food.  Personally I think dinner here is a better value. \n\nFor food, I recommend the steak frites - their fries are delicious (and the steak isn't so bad, either).  This time I for some reason got the vegetable gnocchi, and they were a nice departure - I wasn't looking for something super heavy and it delivered, with lots of fresh veggies and pan seared fluffy gnocchi.  Since it's Vegas, I also got the opportunity to get my foie on.. I got the terrine of foie gras - which I unfortunately was not able to finish (but they packed it up for me for later!).  One of my friends got the pan-seared foie gras which I thought was a better choice flavor-wise.  Anyway, no real complaints for me.\n\nService was good - my water glass was never empty and the waitstaff was efficient enough.  Decor is upscale-bistro style, classy but nothing special.  There is a nice hustle and bustle inside the restaurant but you can still talk to your friends, which is nice.\n\nBouchon, it's always a pleasure."

S"Thomas Keller is a genius!  And I love that he does breakfast- my favorite meal of the day.  It was tough getting up early enough to make the 10:30 am cut off but it was worth the effort!  Midweek bfast is served until 10:30 on the weekends they serve brunch until 2:30pm.  Going for breakfast is a great way to taste the high level of cooking without the price tag of dinner.  A fan of Bellini's I was excited to see them on the list- and happy to say it was well made just like they do on the coast of Italy.  I would almost consider staying at the Venetian just to eat there as often as possible- except that the Venetian is just such a zoo I can't bare it!  Seriously the gondola singing gets old really fast."

S"This place was great. The atmosphere is wide open yet cozy, the service solid, and the food absolutely amazing (most importantly). We got the bone marrow to start, and while that was great, the best part was the bread. Simple, grilled, oiled, it was perfect. It matched the fatty goodness of the marrow perfectly and was a tremendous start to the meal.\n\nFor the main course we had pork cheek with barley and yams that was heavenly and lamb with white beans. Both of these dishes were delectable and enjoyable; something mixed together perfectly within the pork cheek, barley, and yams combination that made me wish it'd never end.\nFor dessert we had ile flottante with almonds and caramel. I'd never had ile flottante before, and I was pretty much done food-wise, but it was like eating sweet air. The almonds were slightly crunchy and a perfect compliment.\n\nAll in all a great meal."

This time around, I ordered their Smoked Salmon Rillettes w/ Toasted Cro\xc3\xbbtons as my appetizer. The salmon is served in a small flip-top glass jar and literally filled me up before my main dish was served. Had I known about the serving size, I wouldn't have ordered this! NOTE: It's recommended to share this dish w/ everyone at the table since this will fill your appetite if you try to finish it on your own. The salmon itself is pretty rich in flavor, however my friends did discover that the salmon tasted even better as spread for their toast! \n\nFor my entree, 2 words: CHICKEN & WAFFLES!!!\nAt first, my impression was WTF?!? Chicken & waffles at a French Bistro?? This, I GOTTA try.... Entree is served w/ 2 pieces of chicken, 4 pieces of waffles (made w/ chives!), mushroom gravy sauce, and best of all, maple syrup is NOT served. Instead, vanilla bean syrup is served for the waffles. Chicken was perfectly grilled tender w/ moist meat. It wasn't stringy, nor was it dry. Waffles made w/ chives was delicously fluffy w/ the off-the-hook vanilla syrup. \n\nIn the end of things, I was disappointed that I had to pass up on dessert since the damn salmon rillette filled my tummy.

S"Food was good, service was good, and wine was good.  Overall, I can say that I was a fan of Bouchon, and will gladly try the restaurant again.  My friend, Mr. Bloewen had the steak and fries.  The fries were the most amazing french fries I had had the pleasure of trying.  His steak looked to be cooked perfectly, and my taste was really good.\n\nMy Booth had the Croque Madam.  For those of you that know Mr. Booth, he is a big chicken guy.  However, he ventured off of the norm, and really enjoyed his french specialty.\n\nI had the lamb.  The lamb had good flavor, but there were olives that it was served with.  I am not a fan of olives, so it did slightly decrease the experience for me.  Had I liked my dish better, or gotten one of theirs, I would have given Bouchon 5 stars.  It may have been my fault that I didn't read there were olives, but I wish the waiter would have given more suggestions or been more interactive.  He as basically just going through the motions.\n\nOur desert was OK, but not memorable.  We had some chocolate dessert, and an order of profiteroles.  The profiteroles were good.  Overall, it was a good meal, and I am glad that I finally went."

S'I  have been to Vegas many times, for poker marathons and the occasional guy\'s weekend/bachelor party. This was the first with the GF. I wanted to take her somewhere fancy, and she is a Keller wanna-be-groupie (ain\'t easy getting into Fr. Laundry). Being poor, we went with the breakfast. It was resonably priced, quite good, and pleasantly informal.\n\nNothing leaps off the menu as "holy crap that sounds great!" It\'s just simple things done really well. Perusing the menu allowed several fills of the bottomless superb coffee. I ordered quiche, which was spectacular. The filling was essentially custard, that gave way to an extra-tasty egg/spinach layer, and a structured but yielding crust. The crust edge was just on crispy edge towards burnt. I\'ve always thought of quiche as dough with egg and veggie scraps thrown in, but this was a masterpiece of the form.\n\nWhen you take the mudane and make a subtle masterpiece, that\'s impressive. Kudos. Only four stars because my GF got the oeufs au gratin, and it was in the pedestrian realm. Alas.\n\nThe bistro itself is elegant but unpretentious, and the patio to the bizarre 10th floor pool lobby is a fine environment. Strangely, the prices were included on both menus. Service was excellent.'

S'This review has been long overdue with my first visit dating back to the beginning of 2011. Each of my three visits since then have not strayed from fantastic. It\'s no secret that I am a huge fan of Thomas Keller and I\'m simply grateful that I can access one of his restaurants easily.\n\nA beautiful restaurant with wonderful views of the Venetian courtyard, floor-to-ceiling windows, but it doesn\'t feel too fancy with the bustling atmosphere. It\'s such a wonderful setting for breakfast or brunch and catching up with old friends. The service is always phenomenal. On my last visit (09/08/13), our server and busser were both so friendly with great personalities! My friend and I had so much fun interacting with them. The server was even kind enough to write down the details of the special since I want to report it accurately for my review and photos! He even signed the paper, haha.\n\nI have tried the Croque Madame, French Toast, Salmon Tartare, Omelette Du Jour (12/31/11), Chicken and Waffles, Beignets, and Breakfast Pot Pie. I have also tried their French 77 and Hibiscus cocktails. Everything is really great! On my most recent trip, the Breakfast Pot Pie was the chef\'s special composed of a Bouchon puff pastry, scrambled eggs, cherry heirloom tomatoes, country gravy, and crispy bacon and served with Pommes Persillade. The "Chicken and Waffles" is a dish I will always go back to even though I want to try so many other dishes. The roasted chicken is always juicy, skin crispy, and with the Sauce Chasseur, really savory. Paired with the bacon and chive waffles and maple syrup. The perfect sweet and salty relationship. The pot pie was actually my least favorite of all the dishes I\'ve had.\n\nI absolutely recommend Bouchon for a nice brunch with a loved one, a great setting for a morning date! Always check out the chef\'s specials for the day as well!'

Because as soon as we flew in the first thing on our mind was food....GOOD FOOD.  We were really hungry and knew we would need a good meal to fuel us for late night clubbing plans....\n\nBouchon did not disappoint.  We all shared the melon and ham salad, the octopus salad, and the endive salad with a side order of fries (that was the size of an entree)!  \n\nThe bad side is that we were staying at the Venetian and even though the restaurant is in the hotel they will NOT delivery to our room (lame).  And we could NOT pre-order.  Restaurant policy is that the customer has tp be in the restaurant to place an order.  I guess we we're not high rollers (even though there was a baby grand piano in the room). Oh well..we got over it quickly and the food made up for it.\n\nP.S. be sure to visit the walk up bakery on the Venetian Casino Floor for dessert!"

During weekend brunches, it's first come, first served. \n\n*Croque Madame - Ham and cheese on toasted brioche. Amazing with the fried egg on top, egg yolk just perfect as it drizzles into the brioche.\n\n*Bouchon French Toast- creatively pieced together with layers of bread pudding rather than regular toast. Topped with thinly sliced apples and just the right touch of maple syrup.\n\nPaired with a cup of good coffee that's constantly refilled as we enjoy the view out the windows towards the pool garden of the Venetian...it's breakfast bliss."

(next time we want to try the donuts/beignets tho...)\n\nI can't remember exactly what my mom got, cause I cant find it on the menu.  But it was a baked egg dish, I believe topped with Mornay sauce, and maybe mushrooms and artichoke/spinach in it?  It was delish, but a bit rich, and served with yummy potatoes.\n\nI got the Croque Madam which is toasted ham and cheese on brioche with a fried egg and Mornay sauce.  It is served with a ton of yummy pommes frites which were extra yummy dipped in the egg yolk/Mornay sauce concoction.  my mouth is watering now... yum.\n\nFYI, it is not cheap, about $15-$20 a plate.

S'Appetizer compressed melon with white anchovy was awesome.\n\nThen I had the pork belly main.  The pork had zero taste.  It was made sous vide which means that whoever seasoned it screwed up the entire batch.  I returned it.\n\nThis happened on 7/26.  \n\nWhoever is reading this at Bouchon please forward to Keller.  The guy who prepared the pork belly needs to be reamed out.  Keller is arguably the top chef in America.  This was an embarrassment to him and to American cuisine.  I can understand if a dish seasoned at the last minute in the heat of service is off but a sous vide dish?  Basically no salt at all???? Inexcusable.\n\nSo I returned it (no charge) and got the bone marrow.  The toast was burnt.  OK that happens.  I got new toast.  The bone marrow sauce (red wine vinegar I think) was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Truly spectacular.  Keller is the man.  \n\nThe chocolate mousse (which was in a terrine) was amazing.\n\nThe red wine by the glass was too woody.  Get a better producer.  People drink cru bourgogne young - it should not be woody.\n\nKeller needs to visit Vegas, get  a megaphone and scream at the staff.  Bouchon is an American treasure.

S"Maybe my expectations were too high coming into Bouchon, especially since it was from Thomas Keller.\n\nMy friends and I had made reservations for 6:30pm on a Sunday night so the place was pretty empty. We were seated after about 5 minutes of waiting, which still surprised me I guess since we had already reserved a table.\n\nThe decor and ambiance of the place is very appropriate; dimly lit and nice chairs/booths.\n\nThe menus surprised me a bit: they were made out of tissue paper and were used to wrap the napkins. Is that typical for a really nice restaurant? \n\nAfter ordering, we were given bread, which was plopped straight onto the table along with some butter and pistachios. I thought that was a bit awkward. We also had no bread plates. I guess Bouchon can't afford enough plates? \n\nAfter a bit, we were also served some marinated olives, which confused us a bit since we didn't order any olives. They turned out to be really salty and I only ended up spitting one out after trying it.\n\nThe wait for food wasn't too bad and our orders all came out at once. I had ordered the leg of lamb (about $33). The portions aren't especially big but it filled me up. The lamb was very good and flavorful and it definitely ended all too quickly. The thing that looked the most appetizing of all my friends was the chicken, which had a much bigger portion than the other dishes and smelled delicious.\n\nFor dessert, everyone had ordered one of everything on the menu (caramel custard, lemon tart, chocolate mousse, meringue, and chocolate bouchons) and we went around tasting all the desserts. Overall, all the desserts were really good.\n\nWe were having a pretty good experience until the bill came and it turns out that those olives they served us were not complimentary. Somehow they ended up serving us olives (which we did not order) and charged us for it. We told our waiter and he was very apologetic and immediately took it off our bill.\n\nOther than that mishap, I would say overall I had an OK experience at Bouchon. The waiters were nice, the decor was nice, and the food was nice. But with all the little details that were missed, Bouchon did not wow me, especially for a Thomas Keller restaurant and for the price we paid."

Bouchon seemed like the perfect place to go, since it's conveniently located in the Venetian, where we stayed for the weekend.\n\nDespite my hangover, the food was delicious! I stayed on the safe side and had an American breakfast even though I was in a French restaurant... yes, a bit lame. But that seemed to be the most appetizing thing for me. I didn't have much of an appetite, so I boxed about half of it. And even a few hours later, it still tasted amazing cold! Haha. I know... I felt like I wasted my money on food I could make easily at home, but oh well.\n\nThe croissants are to die for. So flaky, buttery, and bad for you... but man, worth it. I don't normally eat bacon but I caved in and ate them since they couldn't substitute it with anything else unless they charge you extra. The eggs were fluffy and they even took my nit-picky requests of egg whites only. \n\nI'd totally come back here for the croissants... At that time I wasn't feeling adventurous with French cuisine (most likely because of my nauseous state) but I'll def be back to try them! I was also surprised the place wasn't packed and crowded. The restaurant itself isn't probably known for its breakfast... I'm a bit bummed they didn't have the chicken and waffles on the brunch menu as others have mentioned =(\n\nOur server was also super nice and gave great recommendations!

Located on the 10th floor this was my first visit to Bouchon Las Vegas.\n\nI was greeted by my waiter who took my wine order and his assistant brought out \nthe Epi - branch leafed bread.  The bread was overcooked and some was inedible due to the hardness. I went with the Gigot D'Agneau - Roasted leg of lamb with wilter cavolo nero, garden rubard, nicoise olives, crispy panisse and lamb a jus. The lamb was not gamey and cooked perfectly at medium rare, the rubard was yummy and I enjoyed the panisse. I deliberately ordered only a main entree so I could save room for dessert and went with  the waiter's suggestion Mille-Feuille - Puff pastry, vanilla bavarois and raspberry sorbet. The dessert was off the chart - devine!\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my meal here at Bouchon although I feel the Yountville location was slightly better but then again my choices of food were different."

S"I am giving it a 4.25.\nMy first experience with a Thomas Keller restaurant and it certainly did not disappoint. I came on a Tuesday evening so luckily it wasn't too packed.\n\nWent with a group of four so we all got a different dish to try and taste as many things as possible. Food goes as follows.....\n\nFrench Onion Soup- One of the best preparations of french onion soup I've had, if not the best. The broth itself was extremely rich and flavorful and the cheese exterior was crunchy and went amazingly when mixed with the broth and onions. Beware because this dish is very rich and filling so it may be best to share it with someone else.\n\nPork Chop with brussel sprouts-This is the dish I ordered and I was very glad I did. Pork was super flavorful and paired with the rich sauce and brussel sprouts, the combination was great. Would have liked the pork to be a little more tender though.\n\nSteak and Frites- The steak was done medium rare and was super flavorful. Came alongside a huge portion of frites which were damn near perfect. Great Dish.\n\nLeg of Lamb-My friend got the lamb medium rare and it was pretty good. Wasn't the best preparation of lamb and wasn't as tender as I would have liked, but the flavor was good and he really enjoyed it.\n\nGlazed Pork Belly-This was an appetizer special of the day. The pork came with a tiny portion, but was packed with flavor. Would definitely recommend this if it is a special of the day.\n\nUnfortunately we were beyond full at the end of the meal, we weren't able to order any dessert. Overall I really liked Bouchon and can't wait to try Keller's other restaurants. The reasons that it wasn't a 5 star for me was that it was a little pricey and service was a little pretentious, but other than that I was very satisfied."

S"I had very high expectations for this place and I really tried to like it, especially because it was right downstairs of our hotel, but I've honestly had better buffet at cheaper prices elsewhere. First of all, it cost around $40 each for this single meal, so our group of friends were expecting to be blown away. The decor is fancy and all, but what really determines a buffet for me is the taste of the food.\n\nAll the food was nicely plated and had tasty sounded description cards, but there were quite a few things that I felt that a buffet of this fame should be able to easily cook right. The New York strip steak I had LOOKED medium rare, but it was tougher than being well done! The egg benedict that I had was UNDERCOOKED...the egg white was undercooked to the point where it was still liquid-y and mixed together with the yolk when I split the egg open. Disgusting. The macaroni and cheese was bland like they tossed pasta with just heavy cream or something.\n\nHowever, I will give credit to Wicked Spoon for their dessert options. They had good gelato (I had the tiramisu and toffee) and their chocolate desserts were served in cute chocolate molds. There were several options of chocolate-covered strawberries, such as ones that had been rolled in Heath Bars or Oreo cookies. \n\nOverall, the dessert was the highlight, but I would not pay $40 for under/overcooked food again."

S"Finally after a few trips to Vegas, I got to try out Wicked Spoon!  I already had a pretty good idea what to expect from this buffet since all my friends have been here already and posted positive reviews and delicious food pics.  My first foray with WS was for Friday Brunch.\n\nI liked how everything was served in small portions so you could try things without picking up too much.  The best things I had for brunch were the Kalbi Ribs, The Smoked Salmon, Beet Salad, Eggs Benedict, their Mac N Cheese and a good amount of stuff from the Dessert Station.  I wasn't too fond of the meat selection from their Carving Station though.  The Bacon Slab was pretty bland and the Tri-Tip was tough even though I had a medium rare piece.\n\nI'm not a big buffet person, but Wicked Spoon was a really fun buffet.  I can't say it edges out the Wynn, but they're both pretty close overall.  I wouldn't mind going back again to see what they have for dinner."

S"A very delicious buffet, though the secret about it is out and the lines are getting longer! Came on Christmas weekend and was astounded to find the 3+ hour line for dinner on Christmas day and stood in line for almost 2 hours for the day after Christmas brunch.\n\nI came here for dinner on a previous trip and loved their flat iron steak, their fried chicken, and DESSERT! Everything here is all in individual sized portions, even down to the miniature pot or frying basket. Even the ginger soy edamame comes in a takeout box! Dessert is so good--including the gelato, Oreo chocolate covered strawberries, macarons, and red velvet cookies. Only thing is they are not known for seafood, so the most you will find is some shrimp cocktails.\n\nYou can add in a wine flight for $15 - $25 to the delicious meal and don't forget to use the Cosmo membership card for some points!"

S"I'm not usually a fan of buffets, but this one was different and the little details definitely stood out to me. I liked the small portions.. that probably helps with their waste of food from customers.. smart. I also liked the purified water bottles that are environmentally friendly and also cuts down on bugging the wait staff for refills. We came in for lunch and waited about 20 minutes in line for a seat... this place is no joke! I couldn't fully enjoy my meal after a wild, crazy night in Vegas.. but I tried. I really liked the mashed potatoes, mussels in wine sauce, their salmon, pastas, pizza and short ribs. For dessert there was some nice options, including massive chocolate covered strawberries, macrons and other various desserts. I also forgot to mention their wide selection of gelato. I'd definitely wanna come back to try their dinner selections."

S'"A bloody mary first thing, a bite at the King\'s Head, couple at the Little Princess, stagger back here and bang... back to the bar for shots." -- Shaun of the Dead (2004)\n\nBuffets are hit or miss for me - they can either be stellar and full of amazing bites, or kind of gross and disappointing.  I had heard great things about Wicked Spoon from a friend who had visited last year, so we hoofed it to the Cosmopolitan from Mandalay Bay.  We were not disappointed.\n\nWe were greeted by lovely hostesses and walked to our table.  Our server immediately asked us what would we like to drink - the other 4 ladies opted for mimosas (bottomless) while I went for the bloody mary (also bottomless).  Our drinks would be half full and a new one would be delivered - that\'s what I call service.\n\nOur timing was such that breakfast items were still out and they were slowly being replaced with lunch items - so we got the best for both worlds. Pastries, eggs, ham, bacon, pancakes, waffles. etc. And then came the lunch items - quiches, pork loin roast, roast beef, mac and cheese, shrimp, stir frys and more.  \n\nEverything I ate was delicious and well-prepared. There was just so much of it, and I wish I had a bigger stomach, or maybe a second one so I could enjoy it all.  The service was spot-on - the emptied plates were cleared out quickly so i had a cleared place when I returned with a new one. Our server was also delightful and quite personable. \n\nI would come back for the food, the service, the cleanliness of the establishment and all for a great price. And the drinks were potent and ever flowing.  I\'ll be back again.'

S'We went on a Monday and found out it is actually quite a bit cheaper then going on the weekend so safe some $$ and try to go on a weekday if you can. The waiter will greet you and take your drink order which we got coffee but then you also get one bloody or mimosa with the buffet. We both got bloodys which were just a ok. They have a huge buffet. Everything from make your own omlets, pancakes, carving station, bagel bar and lox, sushi and asian food, wood fired pizzas and beautiful desserts. The one thing that I did not care for was that they put carrots in the sushi. Too big and takes away from all the other good stuff. Staff is really friendly.'

S"Well, I have a new favorite buffet in Vegas!  This buffet is about quality rather than quantity.  They have less options than some of the other casino buffets.  However, they still have a lot of food.  Unlike many of the other buffets, the food is portioned out in small plates.  You take the small plates as you go by.  I really like this because it helps with portion control.  It definitely helped me from eating too much.  \n\nThis is located in the Cosmopolitan and it was hard to find.  It took us nearly an hour to get here from the New York New York hotel.  To be fair, we got awful directions from our front desk that involved like three hotels and a tram.  We should have just walked here on the strip.  \n\nThe service was good and place was clean.  We didn't have to wait when we came here on Friday around 7pm.  However, we came during the off-season.  \n\nAnyhoo, my boyfriend and I loved this buffet.  I will come here again!"

With that being said, they have a nice, tasty variety of food although they don't have as much as the other buffets. They only have snow crab as a seafood option as well as other tapa style options (ex. shrimp ceviche, blacked tuna..that sorta thing). So if you're looking for AYCE seafood, skip out on this place. All the food here is done and served tapa style so you'll have to make several trips considering you can only fit so many little plates on a large plate. Most of the food I tried, I loooved!

S"Interesting concept. For 27 bucks for dinner, one of the cheaper gourmet buffet options on the Strip. \n\nWicked Spoon's concept is a buffet tapas thing - everything in small portions on small plates. Unfortunately, there are several problems: one, the stations aren't very clearly labeled. So you have to wander around a bit to figure out the layout and there are a couple of stations I didn't really get. (I THINK it's a make-your-own-Thai-rice-noodle-soup station at the end of the Asian portion.)\n\nThe second problem is that any time you plate several small plates on top of a larger one, they start to slide around as you walk. And it made for stacking the dirty dishes difficult for the waitstaff. Who, coincidentally, are not super amazing at their jobs. I can't IMAGINE what the dishwashing looks like behind the scenes.\n\nOverall, there was a wide range of food options. I enjoyed an udon noodle stirfry, some Korean riblets, and the little shrimp cocktails. Lamb chops in olives and artichoke hearts was a stand out, if they could get some more olive flavor into the meat. We also uniformly enjoyed the sausage in balsamic grilled grapes. (Okay, not exactly sure what this was, wish I'd taken better notes. Sorry Yelp.)\n\nI see that other Yelpers have given the Asian section bad reviews but I honestly thought it was one of the better Asian sections on a buffet in town. Less focus on sushi, and more on regional foods that don't always show up on a buffet line. (Probably because middle America is just getting around to trying it.)\n\nWe didn't like the already-lumped crab. It was chewy and overdone and we all commented that we preferred the mess of shelling it because it usually tasted better. Other misses: lamb ragu with gnocchi. Saffron cod barely tasted saffrony. \n\nDessert was eh, but we didn't have any of the gelato. I did like that they had a bowl of mixed berries - should have stuck to this, a bit of fresh cheese and bread off the salad line and gone with a European dessert. The cheese selection is quite nice for a buffet in this price range.\n\nI hate to feel so mixed. I'm sure management will dumb this place down soon, so go experience it for yourself before they do."

S"My sister had raved about the Wicked Spoon, so it was on the top of the list of Vegas buffets I had to try.  Last time, the mister came out here, the line was hella long, so his experience was a little tainted.  For my first time, I wanted to make sure that we got their early so we can avoid the lines.  \n\nThe buffet opens at 8AM on Saturdays, so tried to get there when it first opened.  We arrived past 9AM and I was scared to find a huge line awaiting us, but luckily there was none.  We were seated right away.  \n\nI love the decor. Very modern.  It didn't feel like a typical buffet. They had very creative menu selections like corned beef hash eggs benedict, salted caramel pancakes, gnocchi, and very cool desserts like berry fudge.  I also liked how some of the food is served in cute small individual pans and their fried chicken in a wire basket.  The food quality was really good, but I am not giving Wicked Spoon 5 stars because they didn't offer many seafood selections.  Crab legs and oysters would be nice. Also, if you want mimosas, it's $8 extra, but they didn't tell me that until after I was seated and the waiter asked what we wanted to drink. So, they had to give us another check before we left.  They should charge for that when we first paid.  \n\nService was okay. Even though our waiter was nice, It took awhile to get refills on our mimosas and coffee.\n\nAlso, now that I have a baby, I have another criteria I look for in restaurants...diaper changing stations in the restrooms.  You'd be surprised how important this feature is until you have kids.  Fortunately, they have a family restroom w/ a changing station near the front entrance of the restaurant.  They don't have changing station in the restroom inside the restaurant, which I thought was a huge oversight.\n\nOverall, Wicked Spoon is one of the better Vegas buffets out there.  Just make sure you get there before 10AM on the weekends because when we got out at 11A, the line was pretty long."

S"I came here with virtually no expectations and came out extremely amazed.  Maybe I should've came in with expectations... after all, it's a location in The Cosmopolitan, what's probably the best hotel in the Las Vegas strip.\n\nWhile the place is indeed a buffet, there is sort of a cool portion control trick they do here.  A lot of their menu items are served on smaller platters or containers.  For example, edamame was put in their own Chinese to-go boxes, and the mac and cheese came in their own little saucers.  It's a good strategy because people waste all sorts of food at buffets, and it allows people to rethink what actually goes on their buffet plate.\n\nMy group arrived for brunch and it was right before 2PM, so we were greeted with complimentary mimosas. On that note, they're bottomless for an extra $8.  While it's a tempting option, I didn't do it because I knew I'd be having a rather large Fat Tuesday a little later.\n\nWicked Spoon's international buffet options are simply amazing.  From well-marinated Korean BBQ beef strips to their fried rice, the food was amazing.  Mind you, the sushi isn't anything to write home about.  The coolest fusion at the buffet was probably the pork inside the falafel.  The plum sauce really added quite a zest to it.\n\nAnother buffet item worth a mention is their eggs benedict.  Call me a noob, but I've never seen eggs benedict served at a buffet, and Wicked Spoon had a lot of things you wouldn't normally see served including bone marrow... which I didn't get to try, but I will next time!\n\nThe dessert options aren't as great as what you'd find at The Wynn's buffet, but there are some head-turners.  I got this huge cake pop that I thought looked delicious...until I bit into it to find out it was a huge truffle.  Scrumptious!  The gelato here is also good, though I only tried the mango, biscotti, mint, and almond joy.  And for the record, the almond joy gelato is a silent killer of great flavor.\n\nWicked Spoon is simply great.  I might even call it the best buffet in Vegas.  Might.\n\nAlso, if you gamble a lot, sign up for the Cosmo's Identity Card.  For every 25 points you accumulate, you get a free spin on the wheel, and one of those prizes is a free meal at the buffet.  Definitely worth it."

My party of 9 was there on a saturday the 14th of july and the food was just not picking up.\n\nHere are some things I noted from my experience:\n1) They didn't refill the trays fast enough, if at all. \n2) Some of the food had already been sitting there for a while.\n3)  Some of the food were rather bland (pastas and even the chicken shawarma had no taste :( ) makes me sad. \n4) Presentation was what they were going for. Everything looked beautiful.\n5) The food containers made it impractical to have more than 2 -3 dishes in a plate. Unless you wanna play tetris with it.\n6) I liked the bone marrow and that was almost about it. \n7) The service was exceptional.\n\nAfter my experience here, I don't think I will be coming back. Unless someone wanted to treat me. hehe. I was so excited to go and had so much expectations especially from everyone's reviews, but was met with a disappointment as far as food selection and food taste went. Now, i wasn't able to try the mac and cheese line because it seemed that everyone was there. They probably have better mac and cheese than any other, but who goes to a buffet just for mac and cheese? it is a buffet after all. Maybe it was a bad night for them.

There are a lot of meat carving stations, seafood options, and a lot of vegetarian options as well. They also have a gelato bar and tons of miniature desserts.

S'I have never wanted to try a Las Vegas buffet as much as I wanted to go to Wicked Spoon.  The concept of individualized containers and high-end items really appealed to me. After a couple of failed attempts and massively long lines, I got my chance.  \n\nThe individualized containers were all that I could have ever hoped for.  Little ramekins, bowls, and cups of pasta, meats, and salads were so cute and portioned for grazing.  Those containers also made handling a plate really difficult since you could never put more than 2-3 containers on a plate at any one time. \n\nA major disappointment was how quickly Wicked Spoon ran out of "the good stuff."  Someone walking out of the buffet at the end of his lunch warned me that they had run out of both salmon and bone marrow.  When I returned for the first seating of dinner, they were still out of bone marrow.  I managed to try the salmon and beluga lentil dish, which was delicious.  They one measly plate of macarons which I later discovered they had no intent of refilling.  They udon noodle bar never seemed to have any noodles.  \n\nI enjoyed the prime rib, fried oysters, gelato bar, marshallows, kale salad, and variety.  It was very heavy in carbs - lots and lots of pizzas and filling pastas as per buffet usual but they were well-done too.  \n\nMy major gripe was that it didn\'t seem luxurious or interesting enough.  No bone-marrow, sweetbreads, lamb chops, macarons, rilletes, pork belly, xiao lung bao, all of which I saw in other yelp photos.  One of the more unique items on our visit was the calves liver and onions.  Just because it\'s offal doesn\'t make liver and onions a desirable dish! \n\nIt\'s still up there as an interesting and delicious buffet but at $42 dinner and $37 lunch plus the long lines...just know what you\'re getting yourself into.'

There's a lot of care put into the detail of the food here, which starts with the presentations. Many of the dishes are placed in individual pots or dishes. This is nice for two reasons: it maintains portion control and it also makes for easy pick up. \n\nSome of the plates I loved were:\n- The mac and cheese\n- Gnocchi\n- Yogurt parfait with honey and granola\n- Watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe (topped with cilantro and a sauce)\n- Korean BBQ ribs\n- Banh mi with pork belly in a steamed bun\n- Clams\n- All of the desserts!\n\nThere are many others that I can't even remember, but mostly everything was delicious!"

The Asian dishes were completely sub-par and not up to the standard set by the rest of the buffet.\n\nThe $22 entry price came with a complimentary glass of champagne, mimosa or bloody mary.

And it\'s not just typical buffet food which is totally refreshing. When my wife said "take me to this buffet that will cost $60 a pop" I thought " Baby you are completely insane". Then I went. Now I feel stupid, because it is worth every penny \n     Also the service was stunning for a buffet. Most buffets have the obligatory former bartender or cocktail server reaching their twilight years, but the service was effective and personal. I don\'t normal tip the typical 15%-20% for buffet service because my rational is that their role in the experience is limited. I think I tipped that guy like 25% of the total check.

The crab legs is decent but not as good as the ones from Bachannal or Studio B. The presentation is classy and very appealing but I was hoping for a bigger selection since it's Cosmo and all. Their gelato is amazing tho!\n\nTIPS:\nIf you're in a big group and is paying separately then don't tell them you're a part of a big party to avoid the 18% service charge. Also, have someone from your group go wait in the table line (on the left hand side if you're facing the buffet) so you get seated MUCH faster!"

S'hands down the best freaken buffet ive ever eaten at in my life thus far. i personally think its better than that bacchanal buffet and well priced. i came here for brunch with my husband and it was 27.99 per person. 37.99 if u wanna do unlimited mimosas/bloody marys/ and other things which i dont remember. the food there was soo good! im being super hungry just thinking about it. down to their small ramekins of scrambled eggs to their bone marrow station everything was amazing. it was so good that the next time we come to vegas we are definately staying at the cosmopolitan just so the buffet is in  our hotel! CANT WAIT TO COME BACK :D'

S"To be entirely honest, I'm not really seeing the hype. While the concept of a tapas style buffet sounds amazing, my excitement towards eating here didn't quite equate to a superb dining experience.\n\nMy group and I arrived around 1PM and although the line didn't look super long, the wait seemed agonizingly slow. We didn't get seated until around 2:30PM. After we were shown to our table, my group dashed to the food to check out the selection. While there were many chic and modern dishes that you would find at a hip, fancy restaurant, there wasn't really that large of a selection. Compared to the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, the choices seemed barren. Oh well, I told myself. Hopefully the quality of the food will make up for the lack of selection. \n\nFrom the meat section, I tried the bone marrow, kalbi (Korean beef short rib), five spice pork belly and ham. Now I was ecstatic to try the bone marrow and I've never tried it before. However, it just tasted really...weird? I don't know how to quite describe it, except for the fact that I'm not convinced that the flavor was what people usually went gaga over. The five spice pork belly was AMAZING though! Layers and layers of greasy, fatty, pork goodness will lead to feelings of immense satisfaction. And perhaps a little guilt afterwards. \n\nWicked Spoon had some of your standard buffet finds such as a meat carving station, crab legs, salad bar and pizza station. The Chinese station had a pretty cool concept, with some items stuffed inside a little Chinese takeout box or a dim sum basket. There was also a mac and cheese section that I didn't get to try because I thought it was an omelette station. For that, I want to cry a little. \n\nDessert was definitely the best part of the experience, since I ended up stacking my plate full of macarons, chocolate covered strawberries, small slices of cake and double scoops of gelato. Everything was quite tasty and sort of made up for the rest of the food. In fact, the macarons were so delicious that the Asian in me compelled me to hoard a few macarons into a Chinese takeout box. Shhh. \n\nOverall, I'd give this place more of a 3.5. This wouldn't be my first choice upon returning to Vegas for buffets since I've been to places that had both great food and dessert. But the rest of the girls in my group loved this place, so whether or not you like it is pretty much based on your own experience. As for me, I kind of wish Wicked Spoon was a little more wicked so that it could've really unleashed the glutton in me."

S"Yup, that's right. Sadly, not even 3 stars. We came here for a Saturday brunch with 7 other people and definitely a disappointment. There was no prime rib available, only tri tip. Who would choose tri tip over prime rib?? Kudos for having leg of lamb, but still - don't ditch on the prime rib. That is a Vegas buffet NO NO.\n\nThere was no line, and now I know why. Food is mediocre, despite the nice presentation, taste was just not there. The only good part of the buffet was the dessert area. Desserts were cute and tasted very good, especially the gelato! The gelato is the only thing saving this place. \n\nService was also below par - our waittress disappeared for long periods of time and just didn't seem very happy with her job nor with serving us.

S"I have had many experiences at Vegas buffets over the years and I can tell you that my experience at Wicked Spoon left me positively giddy and going from station to station to thank the chefs for going the extra mile to make each dish perfect. \n\nThe buffet was fresh and colorful with such a wide array of foods served in their own serving vessels. We enjoyed breakfast (complimentary due to my husband's platinum status at the hotel) and we were so pleasantly thrilled with the experience. The omelets were made perfectly. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. The salads were cold and fresh. The fruit was perfectly in season. The individual serving dishes of butternut squash ravioli and mac-and-cheese orechette made it easy to not over-eat. The pizza was crispy with perfectly melty cheese.\n\nThe service was friendly and prompt with the drinks and quick to bus the tables. \n\nThere was truly nothing I would change about this place. I just loved it. I wish I could eat breakfast there every day."

S'I was so disappointed with this buffet.  I heard great things, but we went on a Monday at 1100am for their brunch and it was not up to par.\n\nThe service is good, but the food was disappointing.  I tried a lot of items, and the turkey and chicken adobada was dry.  The bacon slab was good, and the tri tip was great.  Everything else was a bit bland and tasteless.  It was nothing special above the M buffet or the Wynn Buffet.\n\nI think I might have to try the dinner, but as of my experience yesterday, I would not go back.'

S"Wicked Spoon can stand up to the best buffets in Vegas.  A long-time fan of the Bellagio and Wynn buffets, I was worried Wicked Spoon was all flash and no substance.  I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nSmall plates are all the rave at Wicked Spoon.  Creative showmanship, like tiny fry baskets with chicken wings, make for a fun presentation and ensure you aren't over-eating.  Plan on making several trips so you can truly get a taste for every item. The atmosphere is fun and fresh, the exact opposite of your typical feeding frenzy buffet.  \n\nI had the brunch buffet, with fresh squeezed OJ, exceptional french toast, and bottomless bloody mary drinks.  I made my way through mouth watering short ribs and homemade sausages, and enjoyed an impressive spread.  Usually I skip the dessert items (or end up being disappointed by the phoned-in offerings), but Wicked Spoon really delivers here.  Their gelato was smooth, creamy, and worth the wait in the small line (The line is what drew me - people waiting in line for ice cream at a buffet seemed out of the ordinary).\n\nFor brunch, there's no better place to spend your money in Vegas.  I'd still look for Bacchanal or Bellagio for dinner, but Wicked Spoon gets my 5 stars for Sunday Mornings in style!"

S"I had been looking forward to this indulgence-my first Vegas buffet. We did brunch on Saturday for about $35/person. The chocolate covered strawberries alone made it worth every penny. \n\nI'm a carb-lover so buffets are usually a waste for me, but wicked spoon had lots of choices for a picky eater like me. Highlights include wild mushroom carbonara, gnocchi, Korean mochi, saffron risotto, and angry Mac and cheese. I loved it all. \n\nI was impressed to see Hamachi nigiri on the buffet, until I tried it. The rice was way too mushy. The cream of mushroom soup was good, a little on the rich side but good. Of course I had to try the famous bone marrow. That was surprisingly good too. \n\nDesserts were good while simultaneously being disappointing. The chocolate covered strawberries stole the show. The other desserts not so much. Raspberry rice crispy squares not so hot. The coffee tort was meh. The cheesecake was just average. The other complaint I have is they give you pre-warmed plates, which melt the chocolate! Then all the chocolate cracks off the strawberry! Not the best idea. I grabbed a cold plate from another dessert for my strawberries."

S'I\'ve been here three times over the past two years. I like the idea of gourmet buffet food served in small elegant and varying ways, but the huge problem with that is that the food gets colder and staler quicker, which totally offsets the "prettiness" of the dish.  I liked the kalbi ribs but nothing else stood out during dinner.. until you find the godiva chocolate dessert. That alone gets five stars, but overall only three.'

S"Whoo-hoo! My very 1st Vegas buffet!\n\nWicked Spoon is located inside the Cosmopolitan. Fortunately, there was no waiting line Friday before the Christmas. The price was $42 for holiday dinner. Once I walked into the buffet, I was simply overwhelmed by the elegant dining atmosphere. However, I wasn't particular pleased with the service I got. Not only did I not receive a bottle of water when I sat down, our waiter was slow and non-responsive when I tried to request for more water.  \n\nWhat a food selection! Pork ribs, kalbi beef ribs, miso soup, bone marrows, prime ribs, risottos, etc. Nevertheless, I was disappointed on how SALTY some of these food were (especially Asian food). For instance, miso soup tasted like salt water. On the brighter side, salmon was very good and gelato and kalamansi coconut panna cotta were not too shabby! Gelato was creamy and kalamansi coconut panna cotta wasn't too sweet.  \n\nOverall - 5 stars for dining environment and food selection, 4 stars for desserts, and 2 stars for service and salty food."

S"I was really happy to finally be able to get to try this place, but only to be a little disappointed. Their pricing is pretty good compared to most of the other buffets. ( 25 for lunch, 35 for dinner ) Most of their food is whatever, it's basically alot of exotic food  with weird names I never heard of.\n\nI saw some different food such as the lamb and pork meatball ( which was the most horrendous meatball that has ever touched my tongue), cauliflower puree ( sounds pretty gross so my friend and I didnt even look twice on it) and those were the only exotic things I remember. There was also prime rib, fried rice, many asian cuisines that i'm just totally sick of. Their sushi tempura one was pretty good though. I hate the fact that they tried to decorate some food by putting it in those silver cups because I only get one spoonful servings of each food just to try every food and if a food is bad, I wouldnt have to worry about wasting food which me and my friend did on every of those silver cans we got. Their mac n cheese bar is a cool setting where they make it in front of you, but the mac n cheese wasnt even that great.\n\nDesserts was the one thing I was looking forward to for this place, but they didnt have macaroons that I was informed of. Most of their desserts are not even that great. The best one would have to be their dark chocolate covered strawberries. I tried many of the little ones and none of it really stood out to me.\n\noverall, it was okay. I would rather pay 10 more dollars to hit up the bellagio buffet."

Each station had something very unique that you can\'t find in buffets like Wynn and Bellagio. \nI also liked the individual mini metal "pans" that had single serving dishes which kept the quality of foods high, but the plates were kind of small so you could only put like 3 or 4 metal "pans" on your plate. heh'

S"Wicked Spoon is the newest buffet on the Strip, located in the Cosmopolitan. The interior design matches the rest of the casino -- modern, chic, and sophisticated. The food has that same style. This definitely ain't your grandma's buffet.\n\nUnlike many buffets in town the food isn't presented in huge troughs that you dig into to serve yourself. Here everything comes pre-plated for individual servings. Although they do have several carving stations scattered about. The food that is pre-plated is served on small square plates, or small pots and pans that make it all look more upscale than your typical buffet.\n\nNot only does the food look good, much of it tastes good. Here are some of the hits and misses.\n\nHITS\n- Steak w/ chimichurri sauce: tender strips of meat cooked to about medium or medium rare. Delicious\n- Huevos rancheros: a single, lightly fried tortilla folded in half and filled with ground beef (I think?) with a fried egg on top. Tasty.\n- French toast: stuffed with cinnamon apples and walnuts. mmmm.\n- Short rib pasta: small chunks of boneless beef short rib with pasta and mushrooms. One of the best dishes of the day (along with the steak).\n- Kalbi beef: savory, sweet and delicious\n- Mashed potatoes: creamy, rich and buttery\n- Fried shrimp balls: not the best, but not bad\n- Mussels: like the shrimp balls, not bad, but not great. \n- Desserts: there were plenty of desserts but I only grabbed a few to taste. Among the standouts were a pecan tart, key lime tart, chocolate covered strawberries, and gelato. The tiramisu wasn't bad. They all looked spectacular and many were topped off with what looked like gold leaf, which was a nice touch.\n\nMISSES\n- Risotto: one bite was enough for me. Funky taste and too mushy\n- Sushi: I've never had good sushi at a buffet. I don't know why I ever bother. There was a California roll and a spicy tuna roll that were average at best.\n- Desserts: not all desserts were good. I tried some sort of chocolate tart which was dry and bland and there was some sort of parfait-looking thing with chocolate, raspberries, and some sort of crunchy stuff that tasted off.\n\nThere were plenty of other dishes that looked good but i just didn't have room to eat any more. The individual chicken pot pies looked good, as did the shrimp, stuffed pork loin, mini sandwiches, and what looked like chili.\n\nThe biggest negative about the place was that there weren't any signs indicating what the food was. So, I had to ask the employees. All the employees were incredibly friendly -- from the cashiers to the waiters and buss boys to the kitchen staff. Everyone was eager to answer questions and were genuinely excited about the new hotel. Our waiter was probably a little too friendly, as he spent most of his time talking to people and very little time getting our drinks.\n\nI'm not sure how much the lunch prices or dinner prices are because we got there at 10:55 am and they charged us the breakfast price ($16 ea.). But, I'm sure it saved us a few dollars.\n\nWhile I still think the Bellagio and M Resort buffets are slightly better, Wicked Spoon isn't far behind. I do think it's better than other buffets I've been to (the Wynn, Red Rock, Palms, and Rio)."

The decor of this place is AH-MAZING! The food presentation is AH-MAZING-ER (Is this a word? Well, now it is.) However, the taste of the food is just okay. Although there are a million choices - breakfast, Asian, meats, salads, seafood, and desserts (oh gosh, the desserts!) - nothing was too satisfying for my taste buds. \n\nThis restaurant is definitely a buffet to try for the experience and pictures, but if I wanted to make my taste buds dance, I'd go to another buffet."

Very very good stuff includes:\n\n- Prime rib- meaty & juicy!\n\n- Snow crab legs- served warm, with hot melted butter, and already split that allows for very easy access to the crab meat! delicious succulent crab meat it is!\n\n- Bone marrow - OMG! OMG! OMG! so tasty and soft and gooey and so so sooooo freaking good!! once you try it, you just fall in love with it!\n\n- Prawns in tomato sauce over grits- i love the grits! big prawns, too!\n\n- Tomato Basil Soup- gorgeous and done right!\n\n- Made-to-Order Mac & Cheese- Mooey gooey mac & cheese with ingredients of your choice! yummy!!\n\n- Desserts- CRAAAAAAAZZZZZY!! (please see photos) All desserts look fancy and cute and taste amazingly good!\n\n- Gelato- 16 different flavors i counted! First time for me to try the PB&J gelato! interesting!\n\nThere are of course many other things that i have tried, but i\'m just lazy to type \'em all out over here!  No matter you are a buffet lover or not, you need to go eat at Wicked Spoon, or you will be regretting for the rest of your life! hahaa :D\n\nThe only one thing i was not very happy with on my previous visit was the server. i\'m not saying the service sucked because most of the staff were pretty nice and attentive, but this guy serving our table was really really bad! He never looked at us in the eyes and NEVER SPOKE!!  When we asked for refills of drinks or extra silverware, etc., he would just walk away like he had heard nothing and then come back in a few minutes with the requested items!  what kind of service is that!!! He did not have to be all chatty and friendly, but at least say something as short and simple as "OK" so i wouldnt be wondering he heard me or not!  At first, I was sorta suspecting he had disability in speaking but my boyfriend confirmed that the server could speak because he actually did speak with my boyfriend a little bit as he was taking our drink orders......Anyway, the foods made up for the horrible service, and yes, Wicked Spoon I love you!

It makes you not load up on a particular thing so you have room to enjoy the other things they've prepared. Not your average buffet fare of crusty eggs, bacon, and packaged salad. The food is very unique and ever changing, so if you go two days in a row you'll definitely have different things. I appreciate that. They even changed out some items while we sat. Definitely go for the all-you-can-drink package for $8 more. The drinks aren't strong at all, but it's still not a bad deal. \nI really enjoyed eating here and will come again, perhaps it will be my only buffet stop in Vegas!"

It was okay but lacked flavor.\nEggs Benedict - Served in a tiny pot.  soggy bread, smoke salmon was okay, egg is obviously overcooked if served in a closed pot.  It would be better if they let the guest make there own benedicts while someone cooks the egg. \nGeneral's Tao Chicken - this wasn't that bad and would be the only thing i eat here.\nCoconut Curry - Served in a tiny pot.

S"Best buffet I've ever been to in my life? No. One of the best in Vegas? For sure. Wicked Spoon offers a nice variety of options and has some cute touches that distinguish it from other buffets. I like that many of the offerings come in already proportioned serving sizes like shrimp cocktails or ceviches in shot glasses, mac and cheese or shrimp and grits in metal ramekins or edamame or noodles in chinese take out boxes. Some of the favorite dishes at our table was the mac and cheese (with a hint of spicyness), a corn risotto, and the shrimp and grits (the grits were pretty boring but the shrimp was good). They had a to order shrimp, mussels, clams, station. I tried it out but found it not too appealing and admittedly only had two of the mussels before passing on that plate. To speak to the variety offered in this place I was impressed when my friend returned to the table with a huge thing of bone marrow. Seriously, bone marrow, in a buffet? Variety. The dessert bar was fun as well. They have a gelato counter with a good selection of flavors. I found the gelato a little bit icy in texture but I've definitely had worse and I thought some of the flavors still turned out quite good. I enjoyed the PB & J and Salted Peanut Caramel the most."

So the selection here isn't as large as Bacchanal but it was great overall. Everything I tried was delicious minus the indian cuisines. Way too much spices for me. \n\nSome of the notable dishes for brunch included bone marrow, the Asian porridge, dubuki, and duck eggs benedict. Overall, the dishes were all pretty decent. The dessert here was really good as well, I liked the thai tea gelato, chocolate oreo strawberry and coffee cake. \n\nSo why the 3 star review? It is an average between brunch and dinner, the brunch was 4 stars but the dinner was 2 stars for me.\n\nOverall, come here for brunch but go to bachannal for dinner."

I asked the pilot to drop me off in Vegas. \n\nI was heading back home from Jolly Old England where I was invited to some Royal Wedding. \n\nOther than the fact that I was indiscriminately throwing up dubs in the air through out the procession, shit was mind numbingly boring. I think I developed restless leg syndrome because of it. Talking mad shit to Oprah, who I guess snuck in, was fun too. \n\nThat Kate girl is pretty. The prince, though, homeboy isn't aging very well.

Very Chic.\n\nSome of the nice looking  individually served tapas style dishes at Wicked Spoon were like the wedding....bland and a pain in the ass to sit through. But, some of the other things, were so good, that I forgot about the wedding.\n\nThe selection did seem somewhat limited, however.

S'Omg how can anyone not like wicked spoon! This is the best "buffet" I\'ve ever eaten at!!!!!! It\'s so yummy, delicious, amazing, appetizing, delightful, heavenly, tasteful ahh I\'m drooling right now thinking about all the food wicked spoon has! I\'m a huge fan of this place, as you can tell!! :D\n\nMy 5 friends and I decided to go for lunch on a Saturday. We came at 12PM and it was not busy at all, surprisingly. It\'s probably because it was April haha. Oh wells, I got in super fast. Thank goodness because I was really hungry. The buffet was about 35 dollars BUTTTTTT if you want bottomless mimosas (IT\'S A MUST), it\'ll only be an additional $9! I drank 9 so it was totally worth the $9. It was really good too, one of the best mimosas I have ever had! Ahhh I\'m still thinking about how wonderful it was. \n\nNow let me tell you about the food, there are so many options! I decided to walk around the whole place before I decided on something. I WANTED TO EAT EVERYTHING! Everything looked really cute and delicious of course. For their Chinese food, they even had it in take out boxes! They had mini pans for their "angry mac and cheese." Everything was really decorated! I was amazed by the presentation and the quality of the food.\n\nMy favorite was probably the clams :D. I\'m a huge seafood person so I can eat that all day.\n\nAs for desserts, I hear it\'s amazing but my 9 mimosas had hit me by that point, so I was not able to remember any of the desserts. I ate them but I just don\'t remember how it tasted like! Oh wells, there\'s always next time! I\'m definitely coming back for the food, desserts, and bottomless mimosas. $45 (tax and gratitude included) for this meal was totally worth it! :D'

Management needs a crash course in customer service.\n\nMy friends and I (total 18 girls) made group reservations and when we got there, there was a mix up of how they wanted us to pay. We paid for our own meals, got seated and began enjoying our food when the manager of the restaurant came to us to tell us that WE made a mistake and we were NOT allowed to pay individually. He then told us that he was going to VOID all of our transactions and wanted us to have one form of payment.\n\nWe couldn\'t understand... but we didn\'t want to cause a scene, so all of us gathered our cash and the manager came back and said "oh, you\'re paying with cash?" one of the girls asked "is that a problem?" and the manager said "well, we prefer card, but cash is ok." WHAT?!?!?! u prefer a cc over cash???? what planet are you from?\n\nhere is the kicker.\n\nwhen he got the money, he didn\'t leave the table, find a corner to count cash. RATHER, he took the bill towards where I was sitting, then started counting the money in front of us. RUDE!\n\ndid he think that 18 girls in some high heels and pretty flashy dresses were going to dine and dash? \n\nin the end, the bill was different by $13.28... I would\'ve been more than happy to throw a $20.  had he figured out the difference, and came to just one of us, we could\'ve resolved the situation instead of interrupting our meal 3 times!\n\nthe macaroni bar is worth a try... it was like all the other buffets in vegas. decent, but nothing really worh all that hassle for a meal that was $50 bucks. Take me to in and out in a cab and i\'ll still be happy as a clam.'

S'This place is hyped up by fellow Yelpers & foodies that I follow. And there are PLENTY of damn good reasons why it\'s hyped up. For one, it\'s the best damn buffet I\'ve ever eaten at! \n\nWe literally had less than 40 minutes to grab a quick bite to eat before heading over to The Orleans to watch the prejudging show for The 2012 Mr. Olympia. So me, being stubborn about the main places I wanted to hit up while we were in Vegas, still wanted us to dine here even though we wouldn\'t have enough time to even enjoy all the wonderful food they offer here...\n\nI paid about $82 for the both of us. Yep, the dinner price here is quite high but here\'s why I feel it was still worth it. 1) The seating arrangements are super fancy schmancy including the silverware, glass water bottle and cloth napkins on your table. 2) The waiter service is exactly like the service you would receive at a Michelin starred restaurant. 3) The FOOD! Delicious and quite fancy too.\n\nI really enjoyed the seafood selection they had here. Some of the items that I devoured that stood out to me was the bone marrow, yes! bone effing marrow at a buffet, the duck confit ravioli, the seared raw fish plates, the fried oysters, the shrimp ceviche...and oh gosh, so much more...but I can\'t seem to remember much because I literally devoured 7 full plates in 30 minutes. I\'m a binge eater, and effin proud of it!\n\nThe best station hands down here would have to be their dessert station. OMFG! Macarons, freshly baked red velvet white chocolate chip cookies, chocolate dipped waffle cones, fruit tarts with chocolate mousse, cheesecake, gelato, pecan pie and so so much more! I had 2 full plates of desserts. If we seriously had at least an hour or 2 to dine here, I would have ended up eating 10 plates of desserts alone. Amaze balls!\n\nI really really love how most of the food items here are portioned out into "spoons". Even though I have no portion control, I like the fact that I don\'t have to wait in a line to scoop any food out of a tray.\n\nWicked Spoon, you won me over with your wicked wicked sweets! :D'

There was basically no line since I think most folks leave and get back to reality.\n\nI love that food in presented on small plates and it makes it seem like it was just made for you.

S"If there was any buffet that surpasses everything a buffet should be, it is Wicked Spoon. With a set price that you paid before you go in, you get escorted in a wonderful bacchanal paradise. The food selection is enormous. The quality is impeccable. The presentation is elegant.\n\nWhat stands out in the Wicked Spoon is their little tiny pots, pans, and steamers that they put their single serving portions in. That and they seem to really put effort in every one of their dish in terms of taste and presentation. The result? Food that satisfy the taste, the eyes, and the stomach. And with the environment looking like an upscale 5-star restaurant with the fun of a buffet, this is what makes the Wicked Spoon so innovating, so brilliant, so awesome.\n\nI ate until I couldn't eat anymore, and then I ate some more. And after that, I finished with a chocolate-covered strawberry. Divine."

It's practically hidden in some far corner in the farthest end of the hotel - at least that's what it felt like during our trek to the Wicked Spoon. Food was good, but the meat carver hated his life and showed it to everyone. Lol. My favorite - the dessert! They had Thai tea ice cream!"

S"For a Vegas buffet, this one is one the best I've been to. Nothing tastes the same.  \n\nI went for brunch time on a Saturday, so the line was about a 30 minute wait.  I asked the cashier at the front if we could pay to skip the line (cuz you can do that everywhere in Vegas) and she got all snooty about it, said I'd have to go back downstairs and speak with the concierge, but no skipping the line with her. Calm down, lady. Just asking.\n\nFavorite highlights were the mini pumpkin pancakes, angry mac and cheese, warm apple cobbler.  Love that they have homemade juices (like a juice bar) and a gelato station. I did not go for much of the asian stuff just because we ate at Hakkasan the night before, but the fried rice was pretty good for a buffet.\n\nI love that they have things in little pots or little bowls for you to take back to your table, it's so cute! It took the worry out of the portion sizing and also made the lines go faster because you could just pick up a little pot and walk away instead of waiting for someone to scoop. \n\nIf you are in the mood for a buffet, I recommend doing this one! So good."

So when that buffet black sheep of the family kept texting me pictures of her time at Wicked Spoon on her recent conference trip,  I just KNEW it was gonna be worthwhile....and it was!\n\nI just love the tapa style of servings here. It kind of makes me feel like they\'re looking out for me....like, "here\'s your small taste so you don\'t have to spoon a ton of it yourself and waste it. and if you like it, well grab a little taste more."  And the food is GOOD. Like REALLY GOOD. \n\nThis buffet is just really pretty, too. The set up is swanky, smaller and sexy. Not like the bright, large packed dining rooms I\'ve seen. I would definitely come back here again but of course there\'s some other ones that I need visit as well.\n\nPros:\n-Food is great, not slapped together after thoughts, but creations. Good variety, too. \n-D\xc3\xa9cor is dark and sophisticated\n-GELATO BAR.

S'Definitely not worth 4-5 stars! The price is expensive at $65 for 2 people for sub par food taste, quality, selection, ambiance, and decor. This place looks like a staff canteen with few decorations and some lighting. Other than that the food were served in an ordinary looking like plastic bowls and tray. I was looking for the sexy-posh-blingy flair that the hotel exude which was definitely missing in Wicked Spoon. We saw food preparers with piled up plastic containers filled with food just right behind the counters refilling the food. This can view can really looked very unappetizing. There is a discreet way to do this I am sure.The cheese selection was nothing extra ordinary unlike the Bacchanals. The salad table was nowhere to be found, the prime rib was tough and chewy, the seafood selection was limited and most of the food available were cheap eats. They had 3-4 pizza selections? Why and for what? I dont have to go to Wicked spoon for pizza. Again cheap eats. And if I can I would give Zero star to the unhappy, mean and unfriendly man serving the ice cream on the desert section. Of all places why in the dessert section. They need to fire that man because he is very miserable.\n\nReally, eating here I felt like I was in a different lower quality hotel but paid for the Cosmopolitan rate.'

S"4.5 stars.  This is my new favorite buffet in LV.  Their offerings are just creative enough to keep me coming back but not too creative that it's too foreign to me and turns me off.  I love that they serve many of their dishes as individually portioned items.  I loved their braised short ribs w/ creamy polenta, kale salad, mango mousse/ daquoise, korean bbq short ribs/galbi, korean spicy octopus, tomato salad, slab bacon, yogurt and fruit parfait, raspberry and chocolate tart, and their pistachio gelato.  Brunch is $28 a person.\n\nOther important info: no seafood (cocktail shrimp, oysters, crab legs), vast gelato selection, individually portioned items, fresh, clean, don't forget to try their mango mousse/ daquoise, and offers take-out for $18."

I can't imagine what it would be like on the weekends.  We came pretty early therefore there wasn't much of a line although it did take them forever to seat us even though the dining area was practically empty, which I felt was a little ridiculous.  As we were eating the line gotten longer and for the same reason, it takes them so long to seat people.  They should really have these girls wear flats rather than heels if it's gonna take them that long to walk and set up the tables.\n\nThe food.  The food was good, although I didn't think there was that many choices as a buffet should have.  Although, I did like the fact that they were already pre-individually plated.

S"I've always been slightly concerned that a buffet is a hit or a miss when it came to adequate quality, but not a Las Vegas buffet that is. Had I never been to one before and always felt quite skeptical if it meets up to par, and so glad that a Las Vegas buffet was my first. After our exciting outing at the day pool at Wet Republic, we went to the Wicked Spoon to replenish ourselves for the evening ahead of us. Besides, after the fun we had in the pool, we were looking for good food to eat!\n\nThe cover admission was about $51, and this was at about a quarter after 5pm. The food that were on display was incredible; they had anything from Middle Eastern to European delectables; my ultimate favourite. I wanted to try everything and anything, but I had to chose wisely (I want to fit into my dress for the evening of course). I immediately scanned the European station that had delicious Spanish inspired mashed potatoes/polenta, French baked salmon, a mac + cheese station (we made one with salmon of course, it was the best!), and steamed mussels in white wine & cream base (I made sure to take advantage of this, I did not care). There was also bone marrow, and yes, we took quite an advantage of those as well. \n\nI skimmed through the Asian station, but my friends said some of the items like the egg rolls, some chicken dishes were adequate. There was a carving station as well, but I do not consume red meat often so I actually stayed clear from that although one of my girlfriends did comment that the prime rib was surprisingly tasty. I'm also a very big proponent of dips, and I'm not so sure as to why! I love babaganouj with cucumbers so I made sure to stock up on those as well. It was delicious and made just right.\n\nHowever, if you truly know me, European pastries is where my palette calls. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with any of the dessert selection, and even the mango macaron wasn't good either. The only cake I can recall being memorable was probably the carrot cake (which is my favourite cake). \n\nAs Wicked Spoon being my first Las Vegas buffet, I was happy, satisfied, and impressed. I look forward to dining here again, and I hear that their menu changes quite frequently, a good plus! x"

S"after reading the reviews on here, i must admit that i too was quite disappointed by this buffet. wanting to try this because of yelp, i went here when my parents were off watching a cirque du soleil show.  \n\nnothing stood out as being particularly bad, but nothing really was memorable. i liked the idea of marrow, but then i realized it really doesn't have that much flavor. the presentation was cute, with the little plates and pots, but in some cases when i didn't enjoy the food, i felt like i was wasting a ton of food. the pastas in those little dishes were cold and didn't have enough sauce. i also love the idea of a mac and cheese station, but there really were no suggestions about combinations or any really unique cheeses. even the kalbi were super greasy and i feel like i could have made the shortribs better myself. \n\nas far as service, it was great. the wait staff was super attentive and always friendly (which is why they get three stars). value? not really worth the 40 bucks you shell out. I would much rather go to the wynn, cravings at mirage or the m resort."

As other (more classy) patrons started glaring in disapproval, a server made his way towards my friend.\n\n"I\'m glad you like the Korean BBQ, you can eat as much as you like. But sir, you need to stop screaming!"\n\nSo sums up our trip to Wicked Spoon. My friends were all inebriated and alternating between frantically stuffing food in their mouths and raving about the sheer deliciousness of it all. I, being sober, ate the food with a more critical eye (taste buds?).\n\nAmericanized French and Asian cuisines seemed to be the main theme, plus American food. Most everything was tapas style (served in cute mini metal pots) and their dessert bar (I was pretty excited about it), featured mounds of chocolate covered strawberries and cute little pastries and gelato.\n\nNothing really stood out to me (except the corn on the cob... so sweet and yummy!) so I, thankfully, restrained myself from indulging too much.\n\nMy friends paid dearly for their buffet madness in forms of nausea, staggering to the bathroom and trying to lighten their stomach loads, and deadly food coma.

Some items were standard-fare that were delicious without any particular twist to them, like the Korean BBQ short-ribs, but that doesn't earn you the coveted 5th star, it really was the unique items that did it for me.  Items like the Wicked mac-&-cheese and Wicked fried chicken have a unique, delicious twist to them. Here's a tip: if you see something that is served on its own little special container, try it!\n\nAnd of course, the desserts, oh my god the DESSERTS!!! A magical medley of tiny-portioned gourmet cakes, souffles, pastries, fudges, cookies, and if that isn't enough they've got like 12 different flavors of gelato."

The food comes in little pots, pans, and plates which is very cute; HOWEVER, you can't get a lot of food at one time since all that takes up a lot of space. I like their cocktail shrimp and crab claw(dinner). Everything is peeled for you which is always a bonus! The korean style ribs is very good! Sometimes a little on the ssalty side but its yummy! The pork belly with the chinese steam bun is SOOOOO GOOOD!!! I think they only have that for dinner though :( .The spicy tuna rolls is one of the better ones i've eaten at a buffet in general. The dessert is 50/50 for me. The plus is the gelato and the HUGE chocolate covered strawberries. The con is everything else isn't that good. They don't even have cheesecake! The price for brunch is $29~which is $32 plus tax. Dinner was $29 as well but that was in April I don't know if it went up. Overall very worth it and delish! Its a MUST TRY!"

We got to the line a tad before noon and it was still really short.  We walked around to get a scope of the place.  There was an area with Asian foods, carving station, and breakfast area, and two islands on either side of the buffet for the salad and cheese bar, and the dessert bar.  I love how many of the dishes are served in small dishes.  The shrimp cocktails was in a dish with on 2 shrimps, but they were really good, too bad there were no crab legs.  Also, the prime rib was delish!  It was really juicy and there were different kinds of condiments to choose from, I chose the chimichurri.  I also loved that there were chocolate dipped strawberries and gelato in the dessert area.  My only disappointment was that our server wasn't really timely with taking away our plates.  Other than that, this is a definitely a buffet worth your money."

We are simple people who enjoy amazing food.  The price was right at $35 each and from what I had heard, the food was great.  We got here at 5 p.m. right when it opened for dinner so there was no line.  The first thing I noticed was the excellent cheese, bread, meat, and salad section.  I love a good cheese plate and I was able to make an amazing one of my own from what they had to offer.  The Caesar, BLT, and Beet salads were awesome and perfectly portioned in the little dishes.  One thing that I knew I had to try was the Bone Marrow.  I had never had it before and the gentleman at the meat station was kind enough to give me a quick bone-marrow-eating-lesson.  Delicious!  Besides the Gnocchi, every single thing I had here was incredibly awesome!  General Tsao Chicken, Braised Short Rib w/ Pasta, Potatoes w/ Truffle Oil, etc., etc.  My wife was stuffed full but could not stop eating/raving about this little chocolate cake drizzled with caramel sauce.

S"I can't lie, I had overhyped this place in my mind after checking the reviews here at yelp.  The bone marrow roast and the lamb had me sold.  The Guinness pancakes were just the kicker.  It was ON!\n\nHowever, we went for Saturday brunch and neither the lamb nor the marrow were available at that hour and the guy behind the counter said that they don't do Guinness pancakes.  I was crushed.\n\nThat said, the food there was just fine, it just wasn't what I had hoped.  The variety of foods was impressive but I have to say that the selection within each food genre seemed kinda slim.  My favorite dishes were the prime rib-y thing and the kielbasa.\n\nFor dessert, as others have mentioned, look good, but there were no signs to suggest what each item is.  I was mighty full by the time I hit the dessert bar so, while I was quite impressed with the presentations, I statyed away fro most of ht pretty looking unknown treats.  I got a plate of berries and lemon gelato which was just light enough for my dessert.\n\nI have to also mention that I got the bottomless mimosas with the meal.  I had two mimosas and then moved to bloody Marys.  The bloody Marys were much better than the mimosas.\n\nThe ambiance was much nicer than those of the Rio World Buffet or the M Resort's Studio B buffet, but I have to say that I preferred the food at both the Rio and the M over Cosmo's Wicked Spoon.\n\nOne final note.  We had a large group, 16 people.  The manager was kind enough to allow two of us to line up while the rest of our group gathered (most of us had a late night).  After the pair reached the front of the line they gave us 15 minutes to gather our group and then they let us all right in, reserving a pair of cashiers to let us all pay individually.  After seating us, the initial response from our waitress seemed kind of annoyed and b*tchy, but after we figured everything out (drink orders and what not) the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  I can't say I blame them for being initially annoyed at the confusion.\n\nIt was a good experience, and the food was good.  But I would be sure to check the food list before coming in, and honestly, I think I'm more inclined to check out some of the other buffets or returning to Studio B before coming back to Wicked Spoon."

Everything looked as good as it tasted and they came in organized little containers as well so it was so much easier to get what you wanted. \n\nThere were a lot of good selections of foods here. There might not have been a TON LOAD of food choices like some other places but they had a decent amount and they ALL were worth tasting. And this place actually gives you the OPTION of paying more if you want free alcoholic drinks (more than just beer and wine too) unlike the M which just automatically charges you for the alcohol even if you don\'t drink. \n\nBut enough of  the comparisons, this place is just overall the best buffet I\'ve been to in vegas and I feel like I need to inform everyone that if they\'re really hungry and want a buffet that won\'t let you down then COME HERE!'

Overall took about 30 minutes to be seated.\n\nService - Once you're seated the service is great. The waiters who bring you drinks and clear your plates were all very friendly and quick.\n\nLocation - In the Cosmopolitan. Lots of room inside. Didn't seem crowded at all. There was a bit of a line for the crab legs, but other than that there were no lines for any of the food.\n\nFood - Great. Lots of breakfast, lunch, and dinner food options. Lots of dessert options too! We came for lunch, so I'm sure there would be even more options and variety if you go for dinner.\n\nDrinks - Water, soda, and coffee are complimentary. Alcohol is not included. I wish mimosas were complimentary. \n\nPrice - Expensive. Be prepared to spend some money. For lunch on the day after Thanksgiving it was $42 per person. \n\nI would definitely come back here again. In my opinion the food was better here than at the regular restaurants in Vegas."

The ONLY 2 things I would go back for are the chocolate covered strawberries with toffee and for their version of the banh mi ( a Vietnamese sandwich ) .\n\nI really wanted to love this place cuz its in my favorite hotel (for now) and cuz of the other reviews that I have read but I really can\'t. I don\'t think my hubby and i will come back...\n\n=/'

S'I didn\'t think this place was nearly as good as the buffet at Wynn, or even planet hollywood. I came here for lunch and was disappointed by the mediocre selection. The best thing was probably the duck ravioli. I didn\'t think having typical mexican and chinese food really fit the image of a higher end buffet in Vegas. Their most "high end" item is probably the bone marrow but it wasn\'t prepared very well...almost like it was just for show.'

S"WARNING: I'm about to go into full detail of every aspect of Wicked Spoon so if you just want the quick version skip to the bottom!\n\nI kid you not, I sampled almost everything. So here goes.\n\nAsian: Don't be lured in by the ridiculously cute takeout boxes. The ddukboki, or Korean spicy rice cakes were horrendous. Any Korean who tried that probably swore shibal because they were absolutely horrible. I don't ever eat rice or Panda Express type dishes at buffets, that's just dumb. Sushi rolls looked unappealing. Nigiri had a lot of rice but the salmon was fresh. Kalbi short ribs were pretty decent, tender and marinated well maybe a little under seasoned. Star of the section was pork belly. I really had to stop myself from eating a whole block. Slather on the hoisin sauce, how did they know it would complement the fatty cuts so well?!\n\nItalian: Bleu cheese and short ribs pizza was a no go. The meat was tough, under seasoned, and dry. Mussels had no flavor even though they were swimming in sauce. Risotto was rich and creamy but I'm no connoisseur. Pasta cavatappe next to it was yummy. Meatballs were tender, nothing spectacular. Rice was bland. Brussels sprouts were not good. \n\nMeat station: Shepherds pie had a really funky taste that I didn't enjoy. They were really cute served in a mini skillet though. Candied yams are my weakness. I mean marshmallows and yams, hello. Prime rib was sooo delicious. Get two slices minimum. Bone marrow intrigued me but I didn't like the texture. It was just really fatty and oily in my mouth. Not pleasant at all. The huge ribs next to the prime rib were sad. Not tender, not seasoned, overcooked. The fingerlings in duck confit were not good. I didn't taste anything unique or duck-like. Fried chicken was ok. Not super crispy or spectacularly seasoned, once again. Man, I think the head chef might have been sick cause I'm now seeing a pattern. I'm Asian, we like our food well seasoned!!!\n\nSalads: Watermelon with balsamic dressing was a nice, juicy, and refreshing bite. Kale salad was worth trying. And the soup, which was unlabeled, was ok. Nothing else worth trying except maybe the ceviche. \n\nSeafood section: Get the Mac and cheese with prime rib. Those were like little nuggets of gold swimming in a cheesy pool. Tender and a little fatty and oh so delicious with the cheese sauce. Salmon was cooked perfectly with this tangy white sauce and buttery butternut squash bed. \n\nDessert: This was the absolute star of the show both in taste and presentation. See the picture of my plate to see how much I enjoyed myself here. Two words: pistachio gelato. Hands down, the best pistachio flavor I've ever tasted. Seriously like eating a mouthful of toasted pistachios in every spoonful. It was so nutty and creamy. This is how pistachio gelato should taste. Strawberry balsamic was unique but I didn't get that much of the balsamic flavor. Salted peanut caramel really fell short for me. The apple caramel puff is really deceiving to the eye because it looks like a toasted meringue sitting on a little tartlet. The puff is filled with this tangy and slightly sweet green apple custard on a thick, gooey caramel. It was a beautiful sensation of flavors and textures in your mouth. Skip the molten chocolate cake (and most of the chocolate desserts actually) and go for the warm apple crumble. That warm apple crumble was heavenly, I couldn't stop eating it! It was warm and cinnamony with the perfect crunchy topping, ugh, magical. The white chocolate mousse cone brought the child out in me. It's like the bottom part of the drumstick cone that's filled with the surprise chocolate nugget but instead with yummy white chocolate mousse. The carrot cake was perfect. Orange macaron was too crunchy and sugary.\n\nFinal verdict: Wicked Spoon did not wow me as I had hoped for. Maybe I had my expectations set too high but if I'm going to be paying $50+ for a buffet it better be damn good. I think I really expected for this buffet to be filled with unique and innovative dishes. There was mostly traditional dishes that they attempted to revamp but failed to execute well. I would not wait more than 30 min on a normal weekend and 1 hour on a holiday weekend. If it's going to take longer, go somewhere else. If you are looking for lots of variety and amazing seafood, this is not the buffet for you. However, this buffet is worth checking out if you love dessert and appreciate beautiful presentations of food. The ambiance is gorgeous and hip. The staff is friendly. But the food is just ok. This buffet is slightly overhyped. A cool scene to hang out in since it's in the new Cosmo hotel and all, but overhyped, definitely overhyped. My advice: Do the $18 express take out box deal if you're not willing to commit $40+ on the buffet. You get to sample as much as gourmet food you can fit in a Togo box (without overeating too much) for less than 20 bucks. I don't know if you get to forgo the line but it's a pretty sweet deal if you ask me!"

S"By far the best buffet in Vegas.  The food selection is unique and huge, but also has the buffet staples, so it truly is a perfect balance.  Hot, cold, desserts all are great, the only drawback to the big selection is that when there are times that don't get taken, they sit there for a long time and you can taste that.  It is the most I've spent on a buffet in Vegas, but it was worth it."

S"A classic example of food looking better than it tastes. I was very excited to come here after looking at pictures on Yelp but ended up feeling underwhelmed. Let's start with the positives: presentation. I like that Wicked Spoon understands the concepts of small plates. A lot of the hot food was placed in small iron skillets and bowls, which made it look exciting to look at. The point of a buffet, at least to me, is to sample a little bit of everything it has to offer. Small portions are genius because it allows me to try everything, and then go back for seconds if I like it. Another aspect I really liked was dessert, namely the chocolate-covered strawberries and gelato.\n\nMost of the food I had was disappointing. The mac n cheese was so-so, the crab legs had an oddly bitter taste (from the lemon?), and the salad was drenched in dressing. I didn't try the cakes but the BF said it wasn't good. Bottom line: I didn't find myself going back for seconds. One thing I did really like was the cauliflower puree. But I mostly had everything once and once only.\n\nNot really worth $45 in my opinion."

S'As of today, I have dined here 7 times - 3x dinner, 4x lunch.. witnessing various changes to the selection.\n\n::: [ FLAVOR ] ::: \n\nStandard buffets seem to focus heavily on selection/quantity. Better buffets seem to focus heavily on selection, quantity AND quality. Wicked Spoon might lose in the selection department over others, but focuses on quantity, quality, & one essential but oft overlooked criteria: FLAVOR. \n\n::: [ TECHNIQUE ] :::\n\nDue to preparation of large batches, many buffets (including Wynn\'s, which I haven\'t been back to in 2+ yrs) tend to offer food with less desirable textures due to being left out for too long and/or imperfect cooking temperatures, Wicked Spoon rarely makes that mistake.\n\n::: [ PRESENTATION ] ::: \n\nPerfectly portioned little bowls/plates. Reduces chance of cross-contamination by other guests and things being mixed around on your own plate. Maintains presentation - consistency in plating technique is a 3.5/5 - 4/5 depending on the station & dish.\n\n::: [ SERVICE ] ::: \n\nOnly experienced poor service 2 out of 7 times. Yesterday\'s visit was excellent - our server randomly checked up on us at least 4 times throughout our meal.\n\n::: [ DRINKS ] ::: \n\nWine & cocktails are available. They also have a selection of Coke products, juices, & ice tea. Don\'t forget to ask for coffee when you\'re ready to move on to dessert!\n\n::: [ DIET-FRIENDLY FOOD ] ::: \n\nI\'ve dieted while dining here twice and was able to get extremely full on less than 700 calories. Also, SUGAR-FREE DESSERTS! You can also request a cup of berries from the dessert station.\n\n____________________________\n\nKEY:\n(-) Skip This\n(+) Try This\n(++) Love This\n\nI have either 1.) never tried or 2.) feel indifferent towards the ones that have no symbol next to them. \n____________________________\n\n\nDATE/TIME: MONDAY, MARCH 25, 2013 // 7:30PM\n\n::: [ SAMPLE OF THE SPREAD AT DINNER ] :::\n\n\n[ ASIAN ]\n\nEgg Drop Soup\nCabbage Salad\nWok Tossed Udon\nHar Gau\nBeef Stir Fry\nCompart Duroc Pork Ribs (+)\nKorean Kalbi Short Ribs\nSushi\n\n[ ITALIAN ] \n\nDuck Ravioli (++)\nItalian Sausage Pappardelle (++)\nSpaghetti w/Smothered Cherry Tomatoes\nAsiago Gnocchi w/Lamb Ragu (++) / sometimes chewy, good flavor\nBraised Beef Short Rib w/Polenta (+)\nMargherita Pizza\nChicken Garlic Pizza\nSausage and Roasted Tomato\nProsciutto Stromboli (+)\nPrime Rib Pannini w/Truffle Aioli\nBroccoli Rabe w/Pine Nuts & Garlic Roasted Red Peppers\nCrispy Chicken Thighs w/Pancetta and Romanesco\n\n\n[ MEAT ETC ]\n\nShepherd\'s Pie (+) / too much potato\nTruffle Potato\nPotatoes au Gratin (++) / not there yest but usually\nCreamed Spinach (+)\nRoasted Sweet Potato w/House-Made Marshmallow\nCarnitas w/Black Bean & Salsa Fresca\nGreen Garlic Roasted Tomatoes\nPotatoes O\'Brien\nVeal Sweetbreads "Dirty Rice" (-) / missing sweetbreads\nWicked Fried Chicken (-)\nRoasted Chicken\nPrime Rib (+) / good quality & texture\nLeg of Lamb\nBone Marrow (++)\nSAUCES: Au Jus, Chimichurri, Horseradish Cream, Red Onion Marmalade\n\n\n[ RANDOM ]\n\nWild Boar Sloppy Joe\'s (+)\nCitrus Glazed Salmon\nBBQ Shrimp & White Cheddar Grits (+)\nCrab Legs (+)\nCrispy Corn Tacos\n\n\n[ MAC AND CHEESE ]\n\n* This station is always either a Design-Your-Own Mac & Cheese or Shrimp Station.\n\n\n[ COLD FOODS ]\n\nFRUITS: Bananas, Apples, Mandarin\nSquid Chili Gochuchang (+)\nEgg and Candied Bacon Salad\nChopped Salad\nBlistered Vegetable Panzanella\nSmoked Trout Salad w/Frisee (++)\nMarinated Mushrooms w/Burrata & Foccacia\nShrimp Ceviche (+)\nShrimp Cocktail\nDeviled Eggs\nWhite Bean and Tuna Crostini w/Truffle Oil & Parsley\nRoasted Beet Salad w/Arugula, Goat Cheese, & Sherry Vinaigrette\nKale Salad (++)\nBocconcini Salad\nRoasted Garlic Soup\nSoup Du Jour\nOlives\nCold Cuts\nSmoked Salmon (+)\nPickled Cornichons (+)\nMaytag Bleu Cheese, Brie, Manchego, etc (+)\nCrunchy Pita Bread\nHummus\nTomato and Chickpea Salad\nBaba Gannoush\nTabbouleh (+)\nTzatziki (+)\n\n\n[ DESSERT ]\n\nMolten Chocolate Cake w/Caramel Sauce (+)\nPeach Cobbler (+)\nChocolate Marshmallow\nFudge\nCarrot Cake (+)\nOpera Cake (+)\nCheesecake (+)\nGodiva Lolli Cakes\nFreshly Baked Cookies: 4 Types\nSweet Potato Flan w/Toasted Marshmallow & Rosemary Shortbread (+)\nGingerbread Shortcake w/Eggnog Whip Cream & Milk Chocolate Sauce\nChocolate Covered Strawberries\nSmores Chocolate Pudding w/Graham Crackers & Melted Marshmallow (+)\nCaramel Apple Streusel Tart (+)\nTiramisu Chocolate Cup (+)\nChocolate Mousse Berries\nSugar Free Chocolate Custard w/Raspberry Compote (+)\nLow Sugar Vanilla Cream w/Blueberry Compote\nStrawberry Gazpacho (+)\n\n\n[ DESSERT: GELATO + SORBET ]\n\nMint Chocolate Crunch\nSalted Peanut Caramel\nVanilla\nCoffee White Chocolate (++) \nPistachio\nCaramel Candy Bar\nAlmond Joy\nOreo\nThai Tea (++) \nNutella (++) \nTiramisu\nStraciatella\nStrawberry Balsamic\nRaspberry Sorbet\nMango Passion Sorbet\nBlood Orange Sorbet\nLemon Sorbet (+)\nSugar Free Chocolate\n\n____________________________\n\n\n3/27/13: Tried Bacchanal - amazing selection.

S"Decent buffet.  It is inside the new Cosmopolitan Casino.  In my opinion, The Cosmopolitan is the nicest of the new casinos on the strip.  I recommend visiting the casino even if you don't eat here.  We came here on a Friday at about noon.  Waited in line for about 15-20 minutes.  The price was about 23 bucks per person.  I see that other reveiwers paid more so maybe the dinner buffet is more expensive.  I suspect the dinner menu selection might include more than the lunch.  There was no sliced prime rib, only red wine marinated tri-tip.  Good selection of seafood, I enjoyed the salmon over risotto and steamed mussels.  The sushi wasnt very good, it was kinda dry.  The strawberry shortcake and gelato were the best dessert options.  I wasn't a fan of the pre-made salads, I would rather have a traditional salad bar.   I won't go over everything the buffet has.   If you have been to a buffet in Vegas, then you know what to expect.  While this buffet was not amazing, it wasn't bad either.  Good service.  I left satisfied."

S"Delicioussss! Let me tell you why :)\n\nI personally love that they put most of their entrees in smaller plates. Can you think about the last time you had portion control at a buffet?! Nope! This allows you to taste everything without weighing yourself down too much!\n\nTheir salad section was a bit lacking, but the rest of the plates were great. This buffet in particular had very interesting flavors and pairings. I would say it's a bit more gourmet than the average, but definitely not as high end as Wynn. \n\nTheir dessert bar is pretty stellar. Not only did they have 16 flavors of gelato (which Tiffany H. tried EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR!), they also had a nice selection of pastries and chocolate errthanggg. Their chocolate covered strawberries were the largest I've ever seen at a buffet! HUGE. I'm talking shari's berries sizes. \n\nIf you come here, you MUST try their chocolate cake (the one in the silver pan). It rests on a bed of delicious caramel sauce.

I had to pace myself and count out my bites just so I didn't get too full too fast.  I wanted to try everything!  We topped off our brunch with some bottomless mimosas - like the food, the servers kept them mimosas comin'!  Good job!\n\nThe restaurant is fabulously decorated, spacious and clean.  There was adequate seating and space for large parties.  Be sure to make this a restaurant to experience before leaving Las Vegas.  You will regret not going here, and I'm so not even playing..."

S'I think I\'m probably haten because I believe this place is overrated.  They serve a lot of perceived high-end quality dishes but the taste and quality just lacks IMO.\n\nIt\'s like taking a very average looking girl, doing a full-out makeover to be a 10 but beyond the surface and disguise you uncover that her confidence and skills just don\'t match up.  Either you got it or you don\'t and the food quality just doesn\'t match up with all the glitz and glamour.  \n\nWicked Spoon "tries" too hard to be hip.  Yes the food is plentiful and it is good but I would rather go to a buffet that serves stellar everyday American food rather than subpar food that with ton of lip stick and makeup all over to be cool.\n\nThis review won\'t hurt a dime since there\'s so many followers.  For the price, long wait, and quality of food, I was very dissapointed.'

S"I built up so much anticipation before trying the Wicked Spoon, and it definitely did not disappoint! We came for brunch on a slow Friday, so there was no line at all. Going into a buffet of this size, you definitely need a strategy. I tried to avoid filling up on carbs like french toast that I could eat anywhere else. I loved that a lot of dishes were pre-portioned into manageable sizes that allowed me to try a little bit of everything!\n\nStarting out on the appetizers, they have a great selection of salads, cheeses, and cold dishes. I probably had 3 of the mini parfaits because yogurt, granola, and fruit is one of my favorite combinations. However, the stand outs are really the main dishes. The fried chicken comes in a cute little frying dispenser. Usually I am not a huge fan of fried foods, but the way this chicken fried was perfection. The skin was crispy and well-seasoned, but not too oily. The meat inside was tender and cooked just right. I also loved the gnocchi that was served in its own little pot. Made out of sweet potato, the gnocchi's texture was nice and chewy. The sauce was delicious and not overwhelmingly creamy, which would've made the dish too heavy. In the Asian section, I loved the papaya salad because it provided a light finish to some of the heavier foods. \n\nDessert. With a sweet tooth like mine, the selection of desserts was a dream come true. The mere size of the chocolate covered strawberries was incredible, but they went one step further and coated the outside with Oreo crumbs. Another one of my favorites was the espresso-flavored Rice Krispy treats. It took one of my favorite childhood treats and brought it to a whole different level! The plain chocolate cake was also heaven for a chocolate lover like me. As if that wasn't enough, the gelato selection is amazing with flavors like Nutella and Stracciatella, so you really can't leave without trying at least one. \n\nWicked Spoon is definitely one of my favorite Vegas buffets, and the price is actually relatively reasonable. I can't wait to go back!"

But when they're serving bone marrow, a wide selection of charcutterie and cheeses, fried oysters, endless crab legs, meats galore, and an assortment of desserts that'll make you full just with a glance, you'll gladly shell out $50 to dine here. \n\nI have to add that even the guests at this buffet are the hottest in town! So you get a feast for the mouth AND the eyes! \n\nBest part about this place is the built-in portion control. I'm sure everyone has experienced the eating-overboard that occurs at buffets. At Wicked Spoon, they help you out by serving everything in their own containers and if you want more, just take another cup/bowl/serving."

It takes quite awhile to work your way from one side of the buffet to the other, which just goes to show how extensive the selection was.\n\nWhat I tried (or at least what i remember trying)\n\nBone marrow - kinda bland, tastes like fat\nFried Chicken - nice baskets, skin could have been crispier, a little soggy but still good\nSweet potatoes\nShort ribs - extremely tender and flavorful\nShrimp Cocktail\nDuck Confit Ravioli\nFried Calamari\nSalmon with Lentil salad - Excellent, perfectly cooked\nSheperd's Pie - Tasty\nCrab Legs\nShrimp and Grits\nRisotto - bland\nCeviche - bleh, not a fan\nSushi - bleh, rice sucks\nSchwarma - not good, pita with chicken was dry\nSloppy Joes\nBlood Orange Sherbert\nMacarons\nThai Tea Gelato\n\nI liked how they served many of their dishes in individualized serving containers.

For the most part, everything tastes good but since most dishes are served in individual (large) portions I wasnt able to try everything without throwing a lot away too and I hate wasting food!

S'we tried to be sly and show up between lunch and dinner to "double dip." however, they actually shut down the boofet at 3 and reopen at 5. bastards! dinner came out to $44.14 ($35 + tax + mandatory gratuity), quite the violation.\n\nthe selection at ws was smaller than bellagio/wynn. however, food presentation and choices were quite unique. i especially liked the concept of a mac n cheese bar. the lady in front of me kept trying to order an omelet. haha. it would have been waaay better if there was bacon, lobster, crab, and more cheeses to choose from.\n\nthe problem with vegas buffets is everything looks great, but tastes just ok. ws was no exception. i find the made to order items usually taste better.\n\ni really enjoyed the dessert here. the mountain of chocolate strawberries were bomb. loved the bowl of berries and gelato. i also devoured a very delicious chocolate chip cookie. soft, chewy, with huge chunks of chocolate swirls inside. i\'d pay $5 to eat that cookie again.'

The mac & cheese station was not what I expected and I would probably skip it in the future - which is sad, because I do love me some mac & cheese, but there is so much else here that is good.  The prime rib was excellent, the mashed potatoes were addictive, the mushroom risotto was superb and the deserts were absolutely delicious.  \n\nThe meh:  the pizzas were dried up fossils of something that might have been good had they not been sitting under heat lamps for extended periods of time, the bone marrow (though I'd never had it before, I just didn't see what Anthony Bourdain raves about when I tried it), the aforementioned mac & cheese bar is decent but I can make better at home, the beignets were also dry.  \n\nFor $40 this is not a bad deal at all, considering I've paid well over $50 for prime rib at a steak house and at Wicked Spoon I got prime rib, all the trimmings and more.

S"Buffet dinner for 2 is is 79.99 and make sure to add the $9 endless wine or beer.  No lines on a Monday night.  \n\nThe presentation of food gets 4 stars, the quality gets 3.5 stars and the taste gets 3.  The food definitely is my type of buffet, little bites to sample everything.  They do a very cute job of presenting their main dishes in little pots, dim sum in tiny chinese containers, ramekins, and shrimp cocktail in shot glasses.  They must go through a lot of dishwashing detergent. \n\nSalad/cold dish bar - the shrimp cocktail was OK, shrimps were large size, there were a variety of different types of salads and I love the different types but the only one I think was beyond par, was the caesar salad and arugula beet salad.  They also have a cheese bar - gouda, brie, blue, and cheddar.  Only 2 types of soups plus the ramen soup at the chinese bar which had potential but when tasted, it was soooo salty.  The only thing that was extraordinary here, was the rambutan fruit (something you don't normally get at a buffet or anywhere's else for the matter).  The ceviche was definitely worth tasting, it was a simple ceviche with bay scallops but flavors depicted a seafood melange with tomatoes & cilantro.  I've had better, but it was good compared to the other salads.\n\nMain dish bar - Some of the dishes had a lot of potential such as the bbq shrimp with grits, leg of lamb, prime rib and bone marrow but when tasted, it was just OK.  The grits were delicious and definitely did not need the shrimp, the prime rib was delicious according to my husband, and the leg of lamb was good and not too gamey.  All the hype about the bone marrow is soooo overated.  It really just tasted like a spoon of fat to me.  I've definitely had better.  I didn't bother with the comfort foods like spaghetti & meatballs, truffled potatoes, etc.\n\nBread bar - They had a variety of mini pizzas which I didn't taste.  The grilled whole shrimps they made were not good, maybe the 2 shrimps I picked out where just bad - they were mushy like old shrimps when peeled but I tasted the sauce and it wasn't even worth tasting.\n\nChinese bar - The korean bbq beef was really tasty.  I didn't taste the ribs but they looked good.  The dim sum spare ribs were yummy.  They had the usual fried rice but it didn't look good.  The ramen as I said earlier was way too salty.  They should not even advertise sushi here because it was all rice and there were only 3 types of rolls.\n\nDessert bar - OK, so I thought since everyone raved about the dessert bar I figure I at least have to taste it.  The molten chocolate cake was one of the worst, the chocolate strawberries with health bar topping (my favorite) was nothing to write home about.  The strawberries were large but not sweet.  The mini parfait was eh, and so were the mini cakes like tiramisu & a variety of others.  The only I really enjoyed was the coffee white chocolate gelato.  My husband & I are now converted fans of gelato from ice cream.\n\nMy husband enjoyed the endless 4 glasses of pinot grigio he had for $9 but the pinot was definitely better at the Rio Village buffet.  This buffet does not compare to the quality and taste of the Village seafood buffet at the Rio.  If there were 1/2 stars, I'd give this buffet a 3 and the Village one a 4.5 star.  Is it worth trying?  Probably, if you enjoy comfort foods that are boring."

S'I had to try it.  We were tired of the M (except I really like their cider, and when they serve it to me in a wine glass) so we wanted my brother to be the first in the family to try the Cosmo buffet (since my parents already hit up the M years before he could visit me again).\n\nWe went on a Sunday night - line was nonexistent, price reasonable, ambiance great.  Our server Will was fantabulous - attentive, sense of humor, super fast on drink requests and refills.  He gave Eric R. three sprite refills at one time since he was unusually thirsty for soda, something he never drinks.  The iced tea was good - definitely brewed and not Lipton.  It was sort of oolong ish.  Will was the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one.\n\nYes, the plates are awkward.  You can fit like 3 or 4 items at a time, they are clunky and sliding everywhere.  Will told us he can only clear one person\'s mess at a time, which slows down his progress.  The worst for me was the lack of signage.  Personally, I don\'t like to put a bunch of food in my mouth that has no distinguishing characteristics.  What the heck were in half the dishes?!  I honestly have no idea.  I wasn\'t in the mood for an omelette, so everything was out of my control.\n\nThe shrimp and crab fingers - served in pairs already in sauce...yuk.  Almost every dish I could find, labeled or not, had pork in it, except carving station stuff.  Pasta, shrimp dishes, creamed corn, you name it, it was pork-infested.  With limited options, I didn\'t enjoy much except the make-your-own noodle bowl station at the end of the buffet.\n\nThe desserts were worse - nothing was labeled except the gelato.  I didn\'t know what the hot pink goo was or the purple fudge looking stuff was, so I didn\'t get any of that.  I asked Will why the food wasn\'t labeled.  He said lots of people ask him that, that the management is aware, but that the "signage is delayed on order."  I would hope the Cosmo has its own printer.  Oh well.  Not coming back here.'

S"$26 for buffet or 36 for buffet + bottomless mimosa.  I thought those are reasonable prices for buffet in Vegas.  Great selection of food and elegant settings.  I felt like I was dining in a nice restaurant rather than the average Vegas buffet.  Not only does this place has a great selection, presentation and the quality of food was definitely beyond buffet standards.  \n\nThe only thing I thought wasn't very good was the ham, it was a bit dry.  But I definitely over compensated by consuming a large amount of chocolate strawberries."

S'It\'s one wicked buffet indeed! Hip and trendy, this is located inside the very chic Cosmopolitan Hotel. \n\nI\'ve frequented this buffet quite a handful of times now so my review here is long overdue. My last visit was over Thanksgiving and it was only by default that we came because our original plan was to hit up Bacchanal Buffet (the new and very hyped up buffet at the Caesars Palace) which had a ridiculous wait of 3-4 hours at 2PM. Sorry, I\'m not THAT crazy to stay in line that long. Wicked Spoon here we come! Ohhhh yeah!!\n\n45 minutes of waiting in line to pay and another 45 minutes to get seated, not bad! We paid about $50 per person for dinner as opposed to $60 in Bacchanal for their Thanksgiving rate. You have to pay extra $$ if you want mimosa included. \n\nSo among the plethora of food choices to choose from, arranged by cuisines from all corners of the world, below is an outline of the reasons why I love Wicked Spoon. \n\nFOR STARTERS, I WENT CRAZY OVER THESE:\n-Pumpkin Soup---Not sure what else is in this soup aside from the pumpkin but it\'s hearty and addicting! \n-King Crab Legs---Fresh and sweet! \n-Shrimp Cocktail---Succulent! \n\nFROM THE CARVING STATION:\n-Bone Marrow---I ate this like there was no tomorrow. I probably need to see a heart doctor soon but it was all worth it. "A moment on your lips, a lifetime on the hips!" \n-Roast Beef---Yummm...\n-Lamb---Cooked perfectly, not gamey, tender, juicy, tasty...Need I say more!?\n-Turkey---Not a turkey fan but it was Thanksgiving so I had to eat some. It was great! \n\nSEAFOOD ENTREES:\n-Shrimps---Cooked in butter, garlic, and other spices. I got down and dirty eating these crustaceans. Delicious!\n-Mussels Mariniere---I had 3 bowls of these. The sauce was fantastic! I was literally slurping it down. \n\nASIAN CORNER:\n-Roasted Pork Belly---5-spice infused, the pork was beautifully cooked. It was juicy, tender, and flavorful! The crispy skin was a nice added touch. \n\nCARBO LOADING:\n-Paella\n-Mushroom Risotto\n-Mac N Cheese---Dude!! They have a MADE-TO-ORDER STATION for this! It\'s amazing! You get to pick what you want in your Mac N Cheese. Sooooo goooood!\n\nDESSERT:\n-Chocolate Covered Strawberries---This is one sight to behold and an indulgence to partake. A must!\n-Gelato---A myriad of flavors to choose from...you\'ll go crazy! Thai Iced Tea and Nutella were my top two favorites! \n-Macarons---Last but not the least, these are not to be missed. They had the mango flavored that day and it was divine! Sad to say, the next batch didn\'t have the same perfect consistency as the first ones I\'ve had. All\'s well though because I may have had as much as my heart\'s content before the 2nd batch came out.   \n\nSERVING:\nMost of their dishes are already pre-plated in small portions. It\'s nice how they do this because not only does it minimize waste, it also allows you to try small portions of all the food selections they have to offer without over filling yourself. I like their concept: unique and practical! \n\nSERVICE:\n-From the people at the register, to the receptionist, and to the server, everyone were all smiles and efficient in what they do. Our plates were cleared whenever needed and our drinks were always filled. Top-notch service! \n\nFor now, I think Wicked Spoon is the best buffet in Vegas. Quality food and service. Then again, I have yet to try what Bacchanal has to offer. Until then...'

S"The mister and I had spent months gearing up for our trip to Vegas and wrestled over which buffet we would end up at over and over again. We managed to watch a bunch of those food network / travel channel specials on the best buffets in Vegas and reluctantly decided on the Wicked Spoon. \n\nI don't know if its because I had too high of expectations or that maybe I'm just not a buffet person, but I only thought it was just OK. \n\nWe went for dinner, and I tried a little bit of everything, but the highlights were probably the made-to-order macaroni and cheese bar (5 stars!!) crab legs (can you really mess those up?), and the prime rib. The mussels were meh and some of the Asian inspired choices were also meh. \n\nI tried a handful of the desserts and nothing except the gelato was really memorable but I'll give them an A for effort in terms of the presentation. \n\nI don't know if I'm willing to shell out the money again for another mediocre experience when there are so many other buffets to try on the Strip, but I guess if you're a buffet-a-holic this one is probably up there as far as the quality and quantity of what they offer."

S"When I heard about the concept of Wicked Spoon's small plate buffet, I was excited. How many times have you been to a buffet only to be disappointed by the poor quality of 85% of the dishes there?  Wicked Spoon seemed like it had the potential to not fall into the quantity of quality trap with its unique concept.  They did have bone marrow there, which was kind of cool. Unfortunately, it ended up just being like almost every other Vegas buffet, just with nice plating.\n\nAlmost everything sounds really good until you actually eat it. I was saddened that I wasted my calories on this place.  \n\nIf you really have to buffet in Las Vegas, go off strip and go to Texas de Brazil, where EVERYTHING is delicious and quality."

S'I can eat, but Wicked Spoon defeated me!  There were so many things that I wanted to eat but did not have the room in my stomach for.  I filled up 3 full plates and barely had a little taste of everything that I wanted to try! The quality of the food for a buffet was very good, but I noticed that everything was a little extra salty. The selection was overwhelming (in a good way)  After being so totally full, took a deep breath and had a plate of dessert (because we all know that there is a different area in the stomach for dessert!)  The blueberry crumble was absolutely delicious!  For a buffet, this is probably one of the best that I have been to.'

S"The trick to the Wicked Spoon is to come around 1 PM on weekend days. Yes, you will spend over an hour in the purchase line and the seating line, but when you sit down around 2, 2:15, the place begins to clear and there's not much jostling for that last slice of fancy meat or cornbread. \n\nAnd the other part? Around 2:45, they begin clearing the breakfast/lunch items and begin setting out dinner dishes. We began seeing people rush towards the food at that time, so we ventured up and each got a mountain of huge crab legs. They switched the omelette station with a gourmet mac n cheese station, and put up a fancy make-your-own-ramen station.\n\nThe desserts are all gorgeous, but we found that the best ones weren't the chocolate ones - they were the cream ones (panna cotta-like ones) or fruit ones. \n\nOur waitress was really nice. A friend ordered the unlimited bloody Mary and didn't like it, so she took it off the bill, no problem."

S"I consider this place one of my all time favorite buffets in Vegas. You don't get an overly huge selection, but what you do get is 5 star quality gourmet food. Word of advise I would suggest coming for the weekend dinner over the lunch or breakfast just because the selection is way better.\n\nThere is so much to love here. Spare ribs, skirt steak, crab cocktails, cheesy shrimp & grits, bone marrow, gnocchi, pork belly, smoked salmon, risotto, mussels, and a mac n cheese bar just to name a few. What more can you ask for?\n\nThey do lack in good sushi and dessert though. Other than the gelato the other desserts are only so so. I also don't get a lobster tail which I hear you get at the Aria, but then again i don't want to pay $50 for a buffet. The Wicked Spoon gives you top quality food at a great price."

S"The hostess who does the seating was really rude.  She wanted to seat us in the front table and I asked to be seated at a different table and she exhibited a few poor non verbal  expressions.  She rolled her eyes and made a snide face and  told us there were no other tables available so we waited and watched as she seated give other groups before she seated us.  The entire time we waited she didn't seat any one at the  front table that she wanted to seat us.   She was rude, and she did a poor job representing the hotel.   The food was amazing, however there are several $40 buffets in the Las Vegas area and you don't have to put up with crappy customer service.  So when you spend $86.00 on a buffet for two, don't expect a smile, because your not getting one!  We will try the five or six of the other $40 buffets before we go back to the Wicked Spoon."

I quite enjoy the Mac n Cheese and the desserts.  There are plenty to choose from and they are all very pretty.  I like the gelato bar too, that is MONEY!  \n \nLike most buffets, you get a fusion of flavor here,  you can get tacos, asian, sushi, korean short ribs, and you american flare. \n\nService was great too with an attentive server clearing out plates. I would come here again if I am in the mood for a buffet.  But hand down, best dessert buffet."

S"Having grubbing here twice, my rating is an average of both times. Wicked Spoon is a pretty cool buffet. It looks high class and trendy. Not too big and the lines are mild compared to other buffets in town. It's kinda hidden in the back of the 2nd floor of the Cosmo, past the giant shoe. There's even a restroom inside, most buffets have it outside. Their logo is this spoon with a keyhole in the middle, makes a bad soup spoon!\n\nBrunch - 5 Stars\nThe Sunday brunch buffet is a bargain! Comes with complimentary champagne. It closes at 2PM. We barely made it and had plenty of time to chow down. The highlights include:\n\n-Chicken wings - These were flavorful succulent wings that I still dream about to this day. They were like crack!\n\n-Bacon - No this isn't regular thin crispy bacon. It was a fat slice of pork belly the chef cuts for you. It was fat, juicy, and delicious. The outside was dry rubbed in heaven!\n\nDinner - 3 Stars\nDinner on a Friday night was lackluster. It was way pricier. I was disappointed they didn't have the chicken wings or fatty bacon. I was in fact very sad. The dishes were hit or miss here. Some were dry because it was left on the heat lamps for too long. Some were great. The Korean BBQ was on the dry side.\n\n-Bone marrow - It's a giant beef bone cut in half and full of bone marrow. Might gross many people out, but I loved it.\n\n-Dessert - All the dessert was yummy! I like salted peanut gelato.\n\nI recommend the Sunday Brunch for maximum food for your buck. Otherwise, I think there are better dinner choices around."

S"I'm in love with this buffet.  I used to have a serious relationship with the Wynn Buffet, but now Wicked Spoon has seduced me.\n\nThe usual motive for a buffet is eating until you can't move anymore, and getting your money's worth by stuffing yourself.  However, I look more for the quality versus quantity, and this buffet really does hit the spot.  No, this buffet doesn't have the most types of food available, but it sure does have tasty options and everything is beautifully presented. \n\nMy favorite highlights:\n-Fried chicken, which came in individual fryer baskets\n-Creamy polenta, in individual mini pot. So good. I couldn't believe how great it was for a buffet.\n-Sushi was surprisingly good. Not Nobu, but for a buffet it was pretty damn good.\n-Tri-tip (and all other meats) - AMAZING. If you were to stock up on a food, I'd suggest getting a few cuts of these!!! Very juicy, again very surprising for a buffet. Good quality meat.\n-Vietnamese sandwich - SKIP. Bread was soggy which threw off the whole sandwich.  Definitely not worth space in your precious stomach.\n-Brown rice & cranberries - so delicious. Not the best but definitely up there!\n-CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES. A noob to Las Vegas buffets. I was in shock and heaven when I saw these. \n-Unique flavored ice cream, including Almond Joy. Delicious.\n\n****Important announcement: complimentary mimosa upon request!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWill be returning during my next visit to Vegas!"

Do not have it first!  \n\nDessert choice is great, a lot of choices (macarons even!) to be had.\n\nService is normal for buffets, the servers are attentive and friendly, clearing your multiple plates away without you noticing.\n\nOut of the way to get to in the hotel though, which is both a good and bad thing.  Good in that it reduces lines.

Between my fiancee and myself we tried many things and liked almost all of it. She got the one marrow and said it was good, just a bit greasy. She loved the crab legs. Me, I got some gnocchi in a cream sauce that was exceptional, the meatballs are fantastic, the Sheppards pie, the best I have had yet. But even with that, my 2 favorite things were the carnitas, served kind of in a deconstructed way and the fried chicken, utterly divine. So with all this great food, We decide to go for dessert. That is when things kind of went south. We found them to be a bit bland, a bit lacking in selection, basically just not as good as the Caesars's buffet, but a close second. If they fix the desserts, they could easily be neck and neck with the Caesar's Bacchanal buffet as the best in Las Vegas."

I could have just eaten those. \n\nThe walk through the cosmopolitan was great too. Modern style and interesting art. \n\nWas it worth $41 per person?

Hostess tells us the line shuts down at 9pm, food is taken away at 9:45. Dessert will be the last to go. Now things are getting interesting. Desperation breeds among ourselves but we have a common enemy to contend with: the Others. The other diners in line before us taking away our precious seconds to get in. \n\nDo we go or do we stay? Will we be able to get another restaurant that is still open? How long can we sustain ourselves before dropping dead from hunger? Some decisions are not made for man alone. \n\nWe stayed. \n\nAnd we got in. 9:01PM. Take that, Vegas odds. \n\nNaturally we all split up, focused now. Desperate, but intent. I grab two plates. Skip the pasta and carbs, who are we kidding? This guy knows the drill. Crab legs and chunks of sashimi. Pass on the California rolls. Bone marrow? Don't mind if I do. Grab a chunk of fudge from the dessert bar to give me buffeting-energy. Load up on fresh fish, truffle-potatoes win me over. Finally the carving station: Tri-tip, prime rib and lamb leg. Smother in chimicurri/horseradish/onion confit. Load up on whatever else I can grab in both hands whilst balancing two plates. \n\nFirst round is gorged, sighed, devoured. Now it's time to get to the real business. Now it's time for seconds. No games here, tri-tip and prime rib. A bit of hummus because sometimes a man needs hummus. 9:30pm. Friends are caving in to the pressure, start to swarm the dessert station.\n\nI get an omelet. \n\n9:40pm, I got this dessert Tom Cruise style. A little crazy, a little close but can't deny the excitement. This isn't my first rodeo, I know how it ends. \n\nIt ends with coffee and tiramisu gelato, fudge and chocolate mousse, strawberry covered chocolate. \n\nBest buffet I've been to in Vegas."

Try the Truffled potatoes, Korean BBQ (lots of meat), Prime Rib (cooked perfectly), crab legs, fried chicken, and baked salmon.\n\nBut the highlight would have to be dessert. Everything is good. SAVE SOME ROOM!\n\nThe only drawback was an annoying one. After we initially saw our waitress, we never saw her agin for almost the entire night. And our dirty plates were piling up high. They only saved themselves when we all got some great coffee and tea at the end of our meal.'

S"After hearing about the eclectic offering at the Wicked Spoon, I had to visit. The dinner buffet is very expensive -- $41 -- but it is totally worth it. They are famous for their bone marrow, which I appreciated but didn't care for.\n\nCompared to the Wynn, I found this place to have a more exotic selection and the Wicked Spoon was possibly larger, but I found the quality to be inconsistent. Some items were the best I've ever had of that specific item, such as the Korean BBQ ribs. However, many things, including their mac & cheese, didn't cut it for me.\n\nI'd come here if you're looking to try something new on the Vegas Strip, and for only that reason. I'd recommend The Buffet at the Wynn as my favorite buffet on the Strip."

S'There was a variety of different foods.  My one issue was that the food was not piping hot.  It was luke warm and then it was cold and not appetizing.  The mashed potatoes looked smooth and creamy, but were super salty.  I think they may have been boiled in salt water, then butter and salt added at the end.  I loved the look of the buffet area.  \n\nOur server Sally was great and attentive.  There was variety I just was not satisfied.'

S"Decided to give it a try based on the reviews.  I expected a totally untraditional buffet after reading through the reviews.  It ended up being a pretty traditional buffet, with the exception that many items were served in smaller contained dishes (the harder to load things up on your plate).  There was a pretty good selection of food.  Standout items for us included the kalbi ribs, fried rice, caprese salad, watermelon salad (watermelon disk sitting on some balsamic glaze with a dollop of mascarpone) and shrimp cocktail.  Crab legs were a huge disappointment - wimpy snow crab clusters that did not look edible, didn't even go there.  Flourless chocolate cake was delicious and my son enjoyed the ice cream selection.\n\nI have been to Bacchanal for brunch and I would imagine that dinner is just as fantastic.  I would probably opt for Bacchanal next time but overall, we did enjoy Wicked Spoon.  Crab legs are really the draw for me at a buffet and Wicked Spoon did not come through!"

S"We came here for lunch right after we landed from SFO.  It was noon on December 26, 2011.  The line was ridiculously long.  An hour and a half wait to be exact.  Actually, the wait was deceiving because upon observation, the wait time is only half of what it is actually.  It turns out that after the ridiculously long line to pay, there is another line curved around the register you stand in simply to be seated.  That line, which was invisible earlier, is just as long as the first line!\n\nMy tip is for your party to wait in the second line while one person waits in the cashier line.  This way, by the time you pay, your party is close to the front of the line to be seated:)  BRILLIANT right?\n\nThe food looks amazing.  Most items are in cute little serving dishes so you don't have to scoop them out yourself.  The variety is impressive too.  There is a good mix of food from all sorts of cuisines.  \n\nSadly, when you sit down and taste the food that you have been waiting what seemed like eternity to try, it is disappointing.  The dim sum is dry and the har kow has thick skin.  The shrimp cocktail didn't taste that fresh.  The cookies from the dessert bar were hard as rock.  The experience was a serious let down:(  \n\nI hear the dinner is way better.  Now only if I could convince my boyfriend to give this place another try..... May be tough given so many other choices on the strip."

S'The Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan is definitely in the top 3 buffets of Las Vegas.  This upscale and modern buffet will please anyone who is hungry, and looking to dine with class.  The price is what you would expect from practically every top buffet in Vegas.  Unfortunately for me, I lost credit card roulette, and had to fork out a few hundred dollars for my friends.  Despite my loss, the food was great.  There was a lot of selection.  All the food was fresh, and very appealing to all the senses.  I absolutely loved the presentation of all the food.  They were all individually portioned already, and placed in a special plate, ready for the taking.  They even had a mini deep fryer to put the fried chicken in.  They also have an omelette bar which was excellent because I love breakfast food.  \n\nMake sure to save room for dessert because they have a vast dessert section too.  Ladies, you can take all the instagram pictures you want and post it on facebook for the world to see!  \n\nI would definitely come back in the future.'

S'The theme for most of the Hotel Buffets seem to "let\'s present the food to make it look like 5 star quality, but the taste is actually 2 stars."  Wicked Spoon has a unique business model.  Individual portioned servings are set so that customers don\'t overplate their plates and waste food. \n\nThe food is presented well.  What i noticed about WIcked Spoon was that they have higher end food items available then other buffets.  Roasted Bone Marrow, suckling pig, prime rib, lamb chops, and shrimp ceviche to name a few.  They offer different cuisines from various regions.  There\'s a salad bar, shell fish, meat, pasta, asian, italian, bread, antipasta, and dessert section.  Just by looking through the pictures on yelp shows you that the food looks absolutely great.  Just remember the taste isn\'t at par with the presentation.\n\nI\'ve only tried Wicked Spoon and the Wynn Buffet, so i have no idea how Wicked Spoon Compares to The Bellagio or the Rio, but what i can say is that The Wynn fares slightly higher then Wicked Spoon.'

S"I enjoyed my first meal at Wicked Spoon after reading and hearing about what it had to offer for several months. We had a party of about 25 on a Saturday night before hitting The Chandelier bar at The Cosmopolitan. Some of the things I enjoyed was the roasted bone marrow which I spread on some challah bread & topped with a sprinkling of sea salt flakes. The combination was so sacrilegious but oh so damn tasty. Yumm. I had seconds so that was double the sin. I also liked the different salumi & other deli meats that you could pair with various crackers & cheese. The batter fried squid on a stick was delicious. The pan fried chow mein had good flavor. The furukake covered shrimp balls was mighty tasty. The lettuce cups filled with bamboo shoots and char siu pork in asian spices was also quite tasty.\n\nFor dessert, I liked the salted caramel macarons which we thought was all out and it gave the females in the group a lightweight anxiety attack. Thankfully, 10 minutes later they reloaded. Wheww! Crisis averted. The standard coconut macaroons were also good. I really enjoyed the apple cobbler. It was still warm and tasted great. The miniature eclairs were just ok. I thought they would be better. \n\nWicked Spoon is good. I recommend it. I like the different spin on the typical Vegas all-you-can-eat buffets. There was so much food to choose from that it's a little overwhelming at first. Service was good. They were always on top of clearing away our plates, refilling our drinks and offering us coffee at the end of the meal. The customer service of the waitstaff was really good. Would I go to Wicked Spoon again?? Yes. I definitely would."

They service bone marrow, kalbi beef, chicken sausage and all the trimmings. It was very good, they do have an omelet station, wished i tried it, but was too lazy to wait.

S'Came here for lunch at 1pm on a Friday and there was no waiting time.\n\nThe food is simply amazing!  The quality is evident and the choices are numerous.  Although we came during lunch time, they had a few breakfast options available, and why not?  Some folks love breakfast and I appreciate that they included this in the lunch menu.  The smoked salmon eggs Benedict is delicious.  \n\nI typically don\'t like mac-n-cheese, but their "angry mac-n-cheese" is delectable.  I didn\'t eat much of it but I finished the amount I got on my plate.  Normally, I toss aside whatever I don\'t like on my plate at buffets  but I finished all the mac-n-chees here!  \n\nBut anyway, here\'s a run down of what they served for lunch when I was there.  No shell fish of any kind was offered.  So if you\'re looking to score on seafood, go elsewhere.\n\nPulled pork eggs Benedict and smoked salmon eggs Benedict (so good!)\nRed velvet pancakes and french toast (pancakes are delish)\nBreakfast patty sausage\nBacon (who doesn\'t like bacon?)\nHalf bagels with cream cheese and/or jam, butter\nMore breakfast options I can\'t remember\nCreamy mushroom soup with corn and jalape\xc3\xb1o (amazing, grab two)\nCreamy pasta with mushroom and peas (think Alfredo with twisted pasta)\nCreamy polenta with escargot (yes, you read that right! Snails are alright!)\nRisotto with saffron ( a little salty but still tasty)\nIndian curry with lamb, with option of raita (pretty darn good)\nBone marrow ( tasted like fatty oil, lard...? At least I tried it!)\nPortobello mushroom topped with goat cheese and some balsamic vinaigrette\nSpicy mac-n-cheese (darn good!)\nKielbasa sausage\nPineapple glazed pork roast\nPork roast\nBeef roast\nFried chicken wing in a mini basket \nSaut\xc3\xa9ed zucchini with olive oil, salt and pepper (my fave veg dish here!)\nSaut\xc3\xa9ed red and yellow bell peppers (loved this too!)\n4 diff pizzas and a 3 cheese and egg panini sandwich\nMade to order omelet station\nHeirloom tomato caprese salad (fresh mozzarella balls!)\nKale and cranberry salad \nCobb salad with bacon\nCaesar salad\nA big ol\' plate of smoked salmon (OMG, love)\nSome sort watermelon smoothie in a small shooter (got at least 3 of these!)\nLots of fresh fruit \nOther salad options I can\'t remember\nBuild your own salad\nCalifornia, spicy ca, and salmon nigiri rolls\nCongee with Chinese donuts\nStir fried udon\nChinese spicy chicken stir fry\nChinese BBQ pork\nShrimp balls\nTeriyaki chicken wing over white rice\nAbout 6 more Asian dishes I can\'t remember\n\nI\'m not a huge fan on Chinese food (no offense, I just can\'t digest them readily, maybe the ingredients don\'t like me?) so I didn\'t try any of the Asian dishes offered, but there are a lot and I saw a lot folks go for them so they gotta be good!\n\nNow for desserts! \n\nAt least 10 diff gelatos (blood orange and thai milk tea are my fave, ran out of pistachio :(\nChoc lava cake\nPeach cobbler\nChoc chip, oatmeal raisin cookies\nMango/raspberry panna cota \nGoat chese with lavender syrup (lavender is strong...interesting flavor)\nMini cupcakes and various chocolate cakes with different flavors\nAnd more that I can\'t remember, not much of a sweet tooth so I can\'t really comment on a lot of the dessert section\n \nI\'m 100% sure I\'m missing many more dishes! but as you can see! wicked spoon has an extensive offering.  The quality and presentation are evident and you\'ll love this buffet.  IMHO, this should\'ve been voted as best buffet in Vegas.  Tried others and I don\'t understand the hype for some...maybe the lack of shell fish (crab, lobster and the like) bumps this down a couple of ranks.  I honestly feel that other buffets hike up their prices because they offer seafood, and neglect the rest of their other dishes. As a buffet, attention should be given to all areas, not just one area, like the seafood section, IMHO.\n\nBut Wicked Spoon is really an upscale buffet.  The food is way above buffet quality.'

S"I went to this buffet at around 7 and after reading all the awesome reviews I was really looking forward to it. I'm not sure what the deal was but almost everything was absolutely not worthy of the rating it has right now. \n\nThere's a decent selection of food, from Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican and uh, steaks.\n\nThe steaks were really hit and miss. If it was rare enough then it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really seasoned enough so prepare to drown it in Au jus or gravy. Every other time it was an extremely well done piece of leather. When you accompany that with wrong labelling (ie. Kobe Roast Beef which was just regular roast beef [an extremely lean one at that]) you have an even worse experience. \n\nThe Italian pastas and pizza were okay. They were probably my favourite, but I didn't really want to load up on tortellini all night.  The brocelini was really good. \n\nThe Japanese was also hit and miss. If you don't eat any of the rice, then the fish alone wasn't bad. They had tuna and salmon nigiri and a handful of mixed rolls and viet fresh rolls. The thing that bothered me most was the nigiri rice. It's not the right type of rice, it isn't seasoned properly and it's shaped with some sort of rice ball machine that makes it taste like rice paste afterwards. The seaweed salad was pretty good though.\n\nI honestly didn't touch the Chinese and in terms of the Mexican, the paella just had the taste of salted rice, and the slew of poached fish was extremely dry and overdone as well.  I didn't try the made to order tacos.   \n\nThe crab legs come in king and snow varieties. I'm not sure if this is their fault, but I found them kinda powdery in terms of texture. Maybe it's because I think they use a band saw or something to cut them in half. \n\nThere was a nice selection of deserts ranging from ice cream to cakes to flans. In my opinion the flans were way too sweet, the cakes had no personality (cheesecake tasted like cream and the tiramisu tasted like crappy coffee and nuts with cream).  The macarons (not macaroons btw) looked and tasted like they came out of a box and were the hardest things in the world. \n\nEither way, I didn't exactly pay for this dinner as it was a comp. at 37 dollars, I would NEVER recommend anyone pay this for a mediocre buffet. Unless you can prove me otherwise I would advise to stay away."

S"I had really high expectations for the Bellagio Buffet, especially since it had good reviews and people have said that it rivals the Buffet at The Wynn in almost every way.  I was a little hesitant though when I saw that it cost $32.99 for New Years Brunch.  It's times like these where posting up a menu is very important, but I didn't see it anywhere.  So I took a chance with it.\n\nThis Brunch Buffet didn't really do it for me. I pretty much got the same stuff that I would've picked up at Flavors at Harrahs or Le Village at Paris for half the price.  The only way for me to make up the $32.99 was to load up on Crab Legs which is what I did (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=JP-DNf9eXH1T9IsESWsR5g).  I also picked up some Prime Rib and Eggs which were just okay.  There wasn't really anything offered at Brunch that really blew me away.\n\nIf you've gone to the Wynn Buffet and haven't been to the Bellagio Buffet yet, just stick with the Wynn.

This is even with the fact that I didn't have to wait in line because my aunt waited for us! \n\nI feel like the food was not worth $35 for dinner, with the steak being plain, mediocre sushi, and very limited options. I had a custom chicken and vegetable crepe after trying out the steak and sushi and it was pretty gross. I thought it was going to be like a pot pie but it was just disgusting. After all this, I was hoping dessert would redeem the poor quality of entrees but there were few choices and none of them were very good.

S"So, I've been to the Bellagio buffet before and I thought I remembered having a great experience there although, to be honest, I can't really remember. It was like when I was 5 years old so I guess I might have matured in my taste buds since then. Who knows?\n\nAnyway, the food was mediocre at best, but the choices were so slim I was shocked. I mean, there was a good variety of standard American staples like chicken, mashed potatoes, turkey, pasta, pizza, etc. (although I guess those last two are Italian, but whatever.) But, I was really hoping for unique food items that you don't get on the day-to-day. This is definitely not the place for that. They are way more focused on quantity over quality. They did have a sushi bar, but it was the type of sushi you would find at a supermarket (mostly rice, basic ingredients, blah). \n\nThe one good thing was that the waiter refilled our drinks whenever we needed it (even sometimes when we didn't need it) and a soda comes free with your dinner so you're not charged extra for it.\n\nI dunno, everything was FINE, but for the wait and the price, I was hoping for something great."

S"I am so sad that my stomach decided to rebel against me on the day I was to eat at The Buffet @ the Bellagio. Because of my body's revolt, I was unable to eat as much as I wish I did. I managed to eat a few bites at a time, because my stomach was feeling queasy since the morning. At the time, I thought I'd give the place 3 stars, but now that I am more clear headed, i think the Bellagio is well worth 4 stars.\n\nIf you come here during lunch time during the weekday, you can get in for $20.99 and stay till dinner! Are you kidding me? That's a freaking good deal! It's nothing phenomenal, but for $20.99 the food is pretty damn good! If you come during lunch, they even have some breakfast foods out. I had some eggs benedict, and it was pretty good!\n\nThe pastas are also delicious and so are the meats. Had my stupid stomach been feeling better, I would have totally gone after some prime rib, crab legs, and all that deliciousness. They even have jus to put over your roast/meat, and it's delicious! They have a pretty good selection of food. It's not individually portioned out. \n\nOne thing that bothered me was the soup station. the ladle was too damn long! It was so hard to ladle soup into my bowl. I burned myself. Shorten that ladle, dude. \n\nSeating for me took about 30-40 minutes, kind of what you would expect from a buffet. But I would say it was well worth it. To get the biggest bang for the buck, come during the weekday during lunch (like around 2:30) and stay til dinner. =) cheers!"

DEFINITELY worth the 30 dollars I spent (we went on a Monday night)!  The crab legs were a little salty and not as good as I thought they would be.\n\nMushroom raviolis were also really good.\n\nDEFINITELY though, the sea bass... is to die for.'

The lunch menu just seemed to have a bigger selection and offered desserts during that time as well. All the usual buffet food choices were available for both meals, but nothing really "wowed" me. I guess I was expecting that wow factor coming from one of the most prestigious properties on the strip, but I\'ve honestly had better buffets at a few other properties nearby.

Oh it was painful (every bop, every sip of champagne), plus I don't think I even maxed out my stomach space.\n\nMy favorites of the night included grilled veggies (http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k4l1M4GEfqHvS7eh0leAGQ/l), pumpkin couscous, Chilean Sea Bass (this inspired me to cook my own inferior Chilean Sea Bass upon my return home), and the succulent fresh shrimp (http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RwGvwSnjuOLa9AWaxU3wSg/l). I love how they cut the crab lengthwise (sooo convenient) though the taste was a bit too fishy for me.

S'I took the "Capitalistic" approach from a previous Yelper and decided to take my three interns from mainland China to the bastion of Capitalism, Las Vegas, where excess is best.  We did not fret on the long lines waiting to enter the buffet, but we were a little hungry after their long flight, wrought with delays, coming to Las Vegas.  But the Bellagio did not disappoint.  From the seafood platters and bottomless Alaskan King Crab helpings to the Prime Rib, all were delicious and nutritous.  We all passed on the rice and bread and loaded up on the beef, crab, shrimp, and sashimi.  I was even surprised they served Poke here.  My favorite dessert was the mini creme brulee, a treat that can\'t be beat "Sorry, Twinkie the Kid!"  The price for four people during dinner was about $112, and it was well worth it.  The service was exceptionally attentive and surprisingly timely.  Whenever we got up and returned for another round of epicurean delight, our plates were cleared from the table.  My goodness, how often does that happen?  Bellagio buffet is here to stay. Well Done! And I shall return.'

S'I love a good Vegas Buffet... it\'s a staple that you need during your weekend or weeklong bender. It\'s the cure for a hangover. It\'s also a great way to fill yourself up when you\'re not sure what you even want to eat. \n\nWhen I go, I always have what I call "The Noah\'s Ark" - as you can imagine, this is where I put two of every animal in my belly. \n\nBellagio is one of my favorite Buffets. I like Treasure Island and Mirage buffets as well - wasn\'t too keen on Aria\'s. Some of the best buffets can be had outside of the strip, but we\'re here to talk about Bellagio...\n\nThis casino is beautiful - the walk to get the the buffet is pleasant - we usually travel past the garden that they change seasonally. It\'s touristy, but it sets the mood. I also appreciate that the Bellagio casino doesn\'t smell as overwhelming of old lady perfume and cigarette smoke as others on the strip.\n\nThe line for this is INSANE if you show up during peak hours - here\'s a tip - after you check out, have your hotel hang on to your bags and get some shopping done or have a nice walk before heading over there. If you go between 10 and 2, you\'re waiting at least an hour. \n\nEither that or bump your mlife card up to a pearl or higher to cut the line. Gamble, gamble gamble...\n\nHalf the time I"ve been here, it\'s been amazing - 5 star all the way... the other times, it has been merely a 3 star experience. Mirage is more reliable, but not as good when both are at their best.\n\nIf you\'ve never had a Vegas buffet, this is a solid pick to be your first. If you\'re a veteran to it, you should really give this place a try as well.'

S"This has always been my favorite buffet in Vegas, and I find myself coming back here every time. As much as like to eat bigger meal during dinner, I think the buffet here is more worth it at lunch time. They serve almost the same stuff as dinner like prime ribs, king crab legs, sushi, etc etc, for a few bucks cheaper. Oh yeah, I like weekend lunch because there's breakfast food and bottomless champagne or mimosa for like $5 extra.\n\nBellagio also have more selections in seafood and meat compared to other places. And of course, their desserts are always very delightful! \n\nI recommend the spicy tuna hand wrap, and their cold udon salad. I also like how they have both king crab legs and snow crab legs, and of course, both pre-cut in the middle so the meat is accessible. \n\nThe waiter I had this time was super nice. I asked for both iced and hot water and he kept coming back to refill them. He also take our finished plates away really fast."

The things I enjoyed...prime rib (pretty good but the outside was chewy and had to get many slices to satisfy my appetite), shrimp cocktail, eggs benedict, cheese blintz, smoked salmon and some of the desserts (they were just ok). Didn't like duck leg, leg of lamb, or the lack of seafood, no lobster, or crab or fish that I wanted, also they started clearing the selections so I felt like we had less and less everytime I went back. Also Deb felt sick for the rest of the day and next morning most likely related to our food here. Maybe it was bad timing @230?!"

S'I walked out of the buffet the fullest that I have ever been in my entire life. I happened to be wearing some really tight, constricting articles of clothing and ended up taking pieces off until I was down to my spaghetti strap (and jeans, I wasn\'t walking around pant-less). Not my proudest moment. \n\nThe Bellagio Buffet is definitely tasty and something to be experienced when you go to Vegas. The quality of the food is superior to a lot of other buffets and you can just taste it when you eat it. I was actually really surprised at how good the sushi they had was, especially the tuna poke salad. And their prime ribs & baby back ribs are delissssh. I wasn\'t a fan of the crab legs that they had out though. Snaps to them for cutting them for you already (because I\'m a baby & hate having to go through all that work for such little pay off) but it tasted incredibly salty to me. I\'ve had better. And I was a little disappointed by the desserts. They were tasty enough, but not nearly as good as they looked. No big though, everything else made up for it. \n\nJust a note, the wait is kind of long. And there\'s only like 3 stalls in the ladies restroom, so there\'s always a wait there too. Seriously? It\'s a buffet. You\'d think they\'d be sensitive to that, and to those that might want to "unload" before going for round 8. The service is great though- my drink was always filled, tables quickly cleared, and the waiter gave me some bomb green tea after to help digest. Also, as nice as the hotel itself may be, there\'s really no need to get dressed up for it as it isn\'t really a "nice" restaurant, in case anyone was wondering. I truly felt bad for the girls I saw dressed to impress teetering back and forth on their heels. Dress comfortably in loose clothing, stretchy pants not optional. :)'

It was cheaper, the staff was nicer, and the food had better quality.\nFamily came in once it opened, paid upfront first, and we immediately got seats close to the food. Roughly 30 mins later, 12:30pm, the place was getting packed and there was a huge line outside. Definitely come here early! They have everything you can think of: sushi, pizza, prime rib, crab legs, salads, soups, sirloin, omelet station, I'm not even covering the best and most! It was super delicious! The waitresses were attentive and refilled the drinks even before it was half empty. If the entrees weren't enough, the dessert station was going to finish you off! Sorbets, chocolate cakes, key lime pie, pumpkin pie, ice cream, cookies, cheesecake, etc!\n\nJust try this place out for lunch, it's cheaper than the other guys and much better too!"

S'The Bellagio buffet gets my vote as the best buffet on the strip.  I cannot count the amount of times I have been here, but every time, it is excellent.  I do not really recommend the breakfast or brunch, as much as I can recommend the weekend dinner.  While the breakfast or brunch is very tasty (especially the nutella and banana stuffed french toast), it is pretty standard fare.  The weekend dinners typically include the king crab legs, jumbo shrimp cocktail, kobe beef, beef wellington, and rack of lamb.  All excellent entrees.  The swordfish and mashed sweet potatoes are also excellent.  Come early (around 5ish) and with a good appetite and you will not be disappointed.\n\nAlso, the desserts are high end restaurant quality in both taste and presentation.  You cannot go wrong with anything you grab from that station.'

I then went to Wynn for a lot of years before giving Bellagio another chance last weekend.  OK ... they are doing better.  I would say they currently are on a par with Wynn and Wynn recently seems to have raised prices.  Bellagio is edging them out for value.  Wynn was running very close to $50 and it was early afternoon and not crab time.  Bellagio was cheaper than that and it was dinner prices."

S'Meh. I\'ve experienced better.\n\nI tried the Bellagio buffet a couple Vegas trips back (about a year ago) and all of my friends thought it was alright, we were more excited about leaving to watch the water show.  The next day, we went to Rio and regretted even wasting our money at the Bellagio buffet.\n\nSince that time, I\'ve heard so many good reviews about the place.  My boyfriend told me it was on Food Network for its fine selection of fresh meat!  So two Vegas trips ago, I willingly went with my friends to give Bellagio buffet another try.\n\nIt was Memorial Day weekend so prices were more expensive, however I can\'t remember exactly how much because my boyfriend paid.  We came around 3pm for a late lunch so we could stay until dinner ;P  When I walked in, I thought "maybe I was wrong about this place".  I was so excited to dig into everything they had because everything looked so good and there were so many selections!!\n\nHowever, for me, it was all looks.  I probably grabbed about 3 full plates piled with food and two plates of dessert (one for fruit).  My favorite was the dessert (as always).  I didn\'t finish any of my 3 plates and wouldn\'t have been able to even if I forced myself to.  To get a better picture of the food, the BREAKFAST BACON was my favorite item -_-  because it was so crunchy.  Maybe the pesto mashed potatoes were high on my list.  The meat was disappointing, considering it was raved about on Food Network.  The pasta was good but my favorite was rotated out before I could get seconds =(  OH YEAH, and the sushi sucked!!!!!  I couldn\'t even swallow my first piece.\n\nFor dessert, I grabbed a bunch of different pastries that looked pretty.  I\'m used to pretty looking dessert that tasted mediocre.  However, their fruit tarts were yummy from top to bottom!  The crust had a nice texture, the creme wasn\'t too sweet or too bland and the strawberries had dark chocolate sprinkles on top!  It was heaven, I tell ya.  Then I found chocolate dipped strawberries!!  The thing was: they were half milk chocolate and half white chocolate!  And the strawberries were huge!!!!\n\nAll in all, I\'m not paying for Bellagio buffet again.  Compared to a buffet from home, it\'s really good!  The food isn\'t horrible but I\'d much rather go to Rio!'

There were so many different things to choose from, and almost everything I tried was tasty rather than just a few things.

Unfortunately, the mac and cheese didn't stand out to me, but considering the wealth of amazing food they have, I don't think that merits any form of deduction in rating.\n\nThe line is ridiculously long, so don't come hungry!

S"I'd been to the buffet at Paris: not impressed. The buffet at Mirage: definitely not impressed. The buffets at Wynn - all three meals: somewhat more impressed, but not enough to return. I decided buffets were not for me.\n\nSo what happened? As luck would have it, I ended up in Las Vegas at the same time that my brother was visiting. We have different tastes in restaurants, and a buffet seemed like a good compromise. He thought Bellagio was pretty good, so off we went.\n\nThe buffet area is busy and not particularly pretty. It feels a lot like an upscale cafeteria - not bad, but lacking character. No big deal. Service was fine, with drinks coming quickly, and dirty plates being cleared quickly. I still haven't figured out how buffet staff know not to give your table away when you get up to get seconds (and thirds and...), but somehow it works.\n\nCompared to Wynn, the selection at Bellagio is smaller, and the overall quality is about the same. However, Bellagio has a few dishes that are more interesting, or of better quality. The evening I was there, the standouts were:\n     Beef Wellington with Bearnaise Sauce. The pastry crust was reasonably flaky, the beef was tender, and the sauce was good. I went back for seconds.\n     African Bluenose. Some sort of firm white fish, it was fully cooked but still juicy.\n     Whole Quail. There really wasn't anything special about the quality, but I give the buffet extra points for offering something a little different.\n     Desserts. The variety of desserts is small, but I'm a sucker for rich chocolate offerings, and there were several that featured ganache or other chocolate fillings. The creme brulee was also good.\n\nThere were plenty of other items that were nothing special (e.g., marinated squid that was pretty standard, curried duck that didn't have much flavor, dried out gyro meat). Nonetheless, I give Bellagio the nod over my prior favorite buffet - Wynn - because Bellagio's offerings are a little more interesting. I still think buffets aren't worth it, but if you want to try a dinner buffet, this one is a good choice.\n\nBecause of this experience, I went back for the lunch buffet. I should have stuck with dinner. The lunch buffet was very similar to the dinner buffet - minus the more interesting or better dishes. Beef welling at dinner was replaced by very mediocre Chicken Wellington at lunch. African bluenose, cooked so nicely at dinner, was dry at lunch. Leg of lamb was plain and didn't taste of much anything.\n\nIf you're interested in a lunch buffet, I recommend Wynn, where the quality is very similar to that at dinner."

S"After missing the dinner buffet on a Saturday night due to the long line, we made it to the Sunday brunch buffet.  The trick about catching this buffet is that you get there late enough to enjoy the brunch foods, but stay long enough to enjoy the dinner foods too.\n\nFor example, my dining companion had her eyes peeled for the crab legs.  When they finally arrived at the very end of our long long meal, she made room in her stomach for the crab.  The poke and sashimi stuff started coming out later on too, and I gorged on that as well.  (It's not exactly the highest quality, but it'll do.)\n\nOverall, buffets are what you make of them.  You overeat and you overeat more.  The good thing about this buffet is the huge selection of food and you're bound to find at least a few things you like.  Everyone in your party is bound to be happy, and that's the good thing.  \n\nThe question always remains though, did I eat my money's worth?  And sometimes you do, and sometimes you don't.  I try not to do the buffet thing anymore.  I don't think I'm getting my money's worth.  I think I rather pay more for quality than quantity.\n\nUpdate: 04/24/07 - Last Friday I tried doing the Bellagio buffet again.  This time we went at 3:30, just in time to pay the lunch price ($19.95) but see the dinner goodies come out at 4 pm.  Dinner goodies include king crab legs, prime rib, kobe beef, etc.  Other honorable mentions include rack of lamb, creme brulee, caramel flan, chocolate-covered strawberries, shrimp cocktail, ceviche, and poke. \n\nSadly, I'm an embarrassment when it comes down to buffets.  I know that I definitely didn't get my money's worth at all.  We stayed there for at least two hours and I could even eat twenty dollars worth!  I'll have to say no the next time I'm invited!"

S"$50.00 per person to eat here. I was hesitant at first and was like WHY NOT, I AM IN VEGAS. There isn't much to choose from the buffet but it was pretty good. I thought that crabs were super salty and I wished they have more of a dessert selection to choose from. The buffet overall was ALRIGHT. Not the best, I still prefer the World's buffet over this. At least they have FRIED CHICKEN which was something that I absolutely craved while in the Bellagio's buffet. Also, they have NO RESTROOMS there! What the heck is that?"

S"Go 'head and stuff yourself.  The food is good.\n\nSomeone wrote a review about the plates being dirty and that... which could be true.  You have to remember that it is a place that serves in huge quantities, and it's where you can get the most (or least, if you just want to sit there) out of your dollar.  It's got a nice atmosphere and good selection.  Service is good too.  I mean, when you compare it to places like Todai... this place is fabulous...\n\nMmm.. I loved their creamy polenta and pesto mashed potato.  Otherwise, the food served is what you would expect of one at a buffet in Vegas.\n\nLong lines... so try not to go while everyone is planning on going."

S"From everything I've heard, The Buffet At Bellagio was the gold standard of buffets in Vegas, and all other buffets are trying to do what the Bellagio is doing. But from my experience the buffet at Bellagio is just OK.\n\nWe were staying at the Bellagio and ended up eating the buffet there twice. Once for breakfast. I'd say it's actually better at breakfast. The price is cheaper and there's more than enough of everything you could possibly want. We went the following day around 2pm and it wasn't as good. They were sort of transitioning between brunch and dinner and it was just not that good. No seafood? No crab legs. Just meh. I guess you have to come for dinner to get the better spread.\n\nAs far as the layout goes I was more impressed with the buffet at the Wynn and Caesar's palace. Check this one out for an early morning meal, but otherwise not worth going out of your way for."

S'Since my office didn\'t have a Christmas party last year, the owner of my company told us dinner was on him and to pick any place our little hearts desired. We immediately thought "buffet!" and then eventually narrowed our choices down to the Buffet at Bellagio and Wicked Spoon. Suffice to say we did not choose wisely.\n\nFirst off, the decor is laughably bad. Really killed the ambiance for me. I mean, the food can be luscious, but when you have to look up at ugly cream wallpaper and tacky mismatched china-as-wall-art, it takes away from the experience. \n\nNow, the nitty gritty: the food. Frankly, I was extremely underwhelmed. I go to a buffet for the sheer variety of food. I don\'t go to create one plate of meat & potatoes, a salad and a dessert. I like to go get a scoop of everything. Here, that added up to maybe 3 plates-worth of different dishes. Not a whole lot, comparatively. Some items were stand-outs though. I kept going back to the sushi bar again and again. Their sweet soy sauce is delicious and the fish was fresh. Also, there were mushrooms that were cooked to the point of melting in your mouth, with a great garlicky sauce. \n\nEverything else was average and, honestly, when you\'re paying around $30 per person, it should be way, way better.'

S'Before you read on, the 5 STARS is because I\'m comparing it against ALL other buffets I have been to & especially the ones in Vegas.\n\nonto my BRIEF SUMMARY!\n- Buffets are usually about quantity not quality, but Bellagio gives you great quality food & a whole lot of it\n- Smaller than Rio but better quality\n- Great service\n- Wasted food goes to Pig Farm\n- Quality Deserts\n\nEvery time I go to Vegas, I\'ve officially been there 3 times in the last 6 months, I\'ve got to hit the Bellagio Buffet. Bottom line. Yes, you should go to Rio because it\'s the world\'s biggest buffet, but when you\'re done poo-ing your brains out, you\'ll want to spend an additional 5 bucks and go to Bellagio.\n\nVEGAS = LINES. So if you\'re gonna cry about waiting in line for the club or a really great restaurant, then don\'t go to Vegas. It\'s like going to an amusement park during some busy holiday weekend and crying about how you have to wait in line for a ride. It\'s RIDICULOUS. Suck it up and wait.. the longer you wait, the MORE food you\'ll probbaly eat. HAHA\n\nSo we waited like 10-15 minutes in line to eat dinner on Friday Night around 7 or 8pm. Normal wait time in Vegas without reservations can be at least an hour. it is a little bit pricey but again, it\'s worth it. Yeah it\'s 34.99 and basically you pay $40/a person.\n\nIn general the Bellagio is a NICE Casino and the buffet has nice decor. As soon as we sat down we were greeted and put our drink orders in. and then headed towards the buffet!\n\nIf you haven\'t been to the Bellagio Buffet yet, make sure you go around ONCE and look at everything they have to offer. The stuff on the right side isn\'t always the same as the stuff on the left side, so you wanna plan out what all you want to eat lol. The thing about Bellagio is that unless you\'re absolutely stuck on something in particular, you could probably eat a whole bunch of different meals in one setting haha.\n\nMy first stop is always the salad bar. They have freshly prepared salads to choose from and then they have the built-it-yourself. I love that their field greens are always fresh as well all of the other ingredients. They\'ve got plenty of salad dressings and toppings. \n\nOn to the stuff that everyone wants, but rarely matters to me. Seafood! There\'s so much food in general, that I basically ignore all the crab legs and other seafood. There is sushi available and it looks ok. I think I had it back in December and it wasn\'t anything to brag about. \n\nBellagio seems to specialize in giving you different "gourmet" type foods. I especially loved the Kobe Beef Top Sirloin, Beef Wellington, Roasted Turkey and the Ostrich. Although, I\'ve never ate Ostrich, I thought it was cool that they had it! They also had roasted Quail. Didn\'t try it but hey if you\'re adventurous, do you!\n\nBellagio also has all of the staple foods that regular buffets have. Super creamy and fluffy mashed potatoes (& a pesto version), fresh artisan bread, Asian cuisine, pastas, and carved meats.\n\nDeserts is where I think Bellagio sets itself from the Rio. Rio has a lot of selection, as does Bellagio. But Bellagio\'s cheesecake is legitimate. I think it\'s plain cheesecake with a fruit topping is equivalent to cheesecake factory. The cheesecake itself is very rich and smooth. And they have other deserts as well. I ate a few different things, but usually you\'re too full to even eat desert, depending on who you are.\n\nAll in all, Bellagio to me is the best buffet in Las Vegas. I prefer it over any other buffet that I\'ve been to and the service is great. They constantly filled up my drink, took away my dishes and offered advice on food. I\'m sure there\'s people that may disagree with me, but ehh they\'re not as cool as me! haha.\n\nGo to Bellagio and eat the buffet. Don\'t waste your money on a cheap buffet that\'s gonna keep you on the toilet. Get quality & quantity here!'

S'Bellagio, what can I say?\n\nI stood on line for like an hour plus and when I finally sat down the server came by frequently.\n\nHowever, I was truly baffled by how small the area for the buffet was! I have seen bigger buffets at 2 and 3 star hotels on the strip and off!\n\nI enjoyed the crab and the carrot cake, and everything tasted like "expensive" rather than rich and hearty. Thus, the quality of the food was not necessarily better but it was "superior" in the subjective high-end realm of taste. \n\nWas it worth $20 plus dollars for a smaller-selection dinner with fast service, long lines, expensive-tasting but not comfort-like food? It depends on who you\'re asking. \n\nI\'ll pass.'

S"I came here and decided to try this Buffett since I heard it was highly recommended from other people and I wasn't very much satisfied for a buffet especially in Vegas at the Belagio.  I thought Belagio would be more high class for a better buffet but it wasn't.  Their food just seemed normal and some of the pastas I tried weren't really tasty at all.  The food selection I thought seem to lack a lot.  The dessert selection does not compare to Wicked spoon's Buffett inside of the Cosmo especially since they do not have real ice cream and it's the one that comes out of a machine with very limited toppings you can choose (like 4 toppings total).\n\nI will definitely not be back here."

S'It could because I came here two or three years back when the quality was a lot better, but I was a bit disappointed with their selection of desserts and the quality of their entrees. At the same time, it could be because we came here for Sunday dinner so the gourmet dinner option was not offered. Honestly, remembering back they had a lot more food. This time around, there were no macaroons, tortes or mousse. And the creme brule was extremely watery in consistency. insert sad face.\n\nI thought what stood out were the rack of lambs, kobe beef, sea bass king crab legs, white chocolate nutella cone, strawberry cheesecake, and banana foster bread pudding. Everything else began to taste the same when we were 30 minutes into the buffet. A lot of people were in line for salmon and maguro poke but I stayed away from the raw seafood because it was a buffet after all. Upon leaving, my impressions of the Bellagio buffet had decreased and my stomach was unsatisfied. \n\nI would recommend trying the newer buffets if you\'re ever in town, like the Wynn, Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan--which may temporarily become the next "it" hotel) and if you\'re a real carnivore--Texas de Brazil would be more satisfactory.'

It has never let me down.\n   It is an example of, "you get what you pay for.\' Not of being ripped off. I rate the ambiance and quality of food highly.\n  The live meat station has featured top tasting ribs and steak on my dinner visits. On brunch visits, I have enjoyed a bagel with lox and cream cheese. And I have had zero complaints over any of the food here.\n   Timing is everything when it comes to paying.

S"I'm not really sure how to rate the buffet at The Bellagio. It's good quality, but if you don't like seafood you are having your options cut down significantly and your enjoyment will largely depend on what interests you out of a limited selection. Sometimes it's OK, sometimes I end up eating the same 2 or 3 things and filling up on the very good desserts.\n\nThe non seafood eater is simply subsidizing everyone else at this expensive buffet. Not only is there a dedicated section full of fish and other seafood, the Asian food is strongly fish themed. \n\nSeafood lovers rejoice. Seafood haters are probably better off at a Station Casino."

S"This buffet goes head to head with the Wynn's buffet for the best in Vegas. I pick the Bellagio over the Wynn every single time and I'll tell you why-- THE WAIT IS SHORTER.\n\nHonestly, when it gets to the fancy $40 per person buffets, the food is pretty much the same. You get all the gourmet meats, all the gourmet desserts, and excellent service. To get anything else would be business suicide especially when you're catering to supposedly rich clientale.\n\nThe difference is the wait. The Bellagio used to be excruciating before the Wynn opened but it's manageable unless you come 7pm on the dot. Then I will laugh at you. That's like coming to the DMV after everyone's off work.\n\nThere is something for everyone at this buffet and it's good breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nOne cute trick my brother figured out is if you come in towards the end of lunch and pay the lunch price, they will switch to dinner with the dinner foods. Thus, you can get dinner for the price of lunch. I'm not sure if they close down the buffet during this period, it's been a few months since I last visited."

This is one of the best buffets in Vegas and my personal favorite.'

S"I'm not generally a buffet fan so this is a grain of salt review. We headed over to Bellagio for Saturday brunch. Got there a little before 11 and waited 30 minutes-ish before getting seated. Lunch menu was $32.\n\nSelection was quite impressive with a lot of variety. It reminded me of a Mexican/Caribbean resort venue, where quantity abounds over quality. Usual stuff like the omelet station was available, though for that coin I'd have liked to see more high-end stuff. Prime rib, roasted turkey, smoked salmon and a decent-looking sushi bar were probably the best bang for the buck. No problems with service; drink refills were plentiful and easy to come by."

Occasional as in, at least once every other year. Came this past week for an early birthday celebration for my dad. We stayed in Bellagio and dined at this buffet twice this trip. And there is always a line!\n\nSo here is my TIP: Get a MLife card people! Once you reached past the beginners card, you can skip the long line at the buffets and go to the front. It probably saved us hours (no exaggeration). You also receive points on your card when you dine here (make sure you give it to them to slide).\n\nWeekday lunch review: Used the Mlife card to bypass the long line. Super crowded. I would come before 11AM since it would be considered breakfast time and stay for both. There is a omelette service station with crab legs, shrimps as options. Eggs Benedict, salads, pizza, cocktail shrimps, carbs (pasta, bread, bagels), desserts (same as dinner), ice cream, sushi (few options), soups.\n\nWeekday dinner review: Snow crab and king crab legs!! Prime rib (overcooked), ham (salty), rack of ribs (not bad), forgot what type of beef they had at the craving station but it was good, cockshrimps, pizza (why would you..), salad, 5 types of soups, dessert, ice cream machine, sushi, fruits, pasta, lots of fish, tuna and salmon poki. I had a food baby that night. As I recall from trips before, the Wicked Spoon had better options for desserts. Dessert isn't the best here nor special. Overall it's a good buffet though."

S'The Bellagio buffet does not live up to the hype. While the selection of the food is pretty good during dinner, the flavors of just about everything I tried was mediocre at best. Everything was either overcooked or oversalted, especially the crab legs, which tasted like it had been boiled in pure salt water after being split in half. The only savory food I enjoyed was the salmon and ahi poke and grilled asparagus. The dessert station here is pretty small and pathetic as well, especially compared to the buffets at the Wynn and Paris. At least the tiramisu and apple cobbler I tried were good, since many of the other desserts fell flat. \n\nThe only good thing about my experience here was that we paid lunch prices ($20) for dinner on a weekend, since the nice Asian hostess hurried our party of four in through the guarded entrance just 3 minutes before 4 pm. \n\nI guess one has to accept the fact that a buffet is still a buffet at the end of the day.'

That was some good times haha.\n\nAnyway I remember I went to bellagio a couple years back and I was totally dissappointing.

It was truly disappointing.\n\nAnyway I went back 3 weeks ago and I thought it improved from the last time. I wouldn't say its amazing but they do offer a lot of hot food,salad,bread and desserts. I went there for a Sunday brunch which brought me happiness because I love omelettes. So I got like 3 omelettes which made me pretty happy. I find the prime kind of rare but the taste was pretty good. There were a few items on the hot entree that was pretty delicious while a few I tried one bite and I left it there.

Otherwise, be prepared to wait- especially around dinner time. \n\nIt's a shame though that I stuffed myself silly with food, martinis, and champagne...the proceeded to sit backwards in a limo where the driver didn't understand the concept of slowly accelerating and slowly braking, got carsick, and yacked everything up by the time I made it back to the hotel.

(To note, I had the Sunday brunch for $29.95 with unlimited champagne).\n\nAfter getting seated at a table and paying, you are greeted by a waiter that gives you drinks of all sorts.  Afterwards, the variety of food is wonderful.  From seafood to breakfast items to noodles to meat, nearly every item at the buffet seemed to have a great taste in mind behind it and was just a joy to eat.  The unlimited succulent shrimp was delicious and the bowtie noodles with fettuccine sauce and chicken were superb.  Add to that the banana hazelnut french toast and the great desserts (sugar-less cheescake was wonderful), I had a hard time leaving. \n\nAdmittedly, the Asian cuisine was not up to par at all whether it was the oddly flavored shrimp spring rolls or the bland sushi and there was some other bland dishes, but the variety and the taste were great.  \n\nThe line is long; for non-Bellagio residents, the Sunday Brunch wait for me was about an hour.  Bellagio guests had first priority.\n\nSo yes, I am a Las Vegas newbie; but as an introduction to buffet life at Vegas, life seems pretty good.'

S'When I heard I was going to Phoenix on business, the first two words I thought were "Pizzeria Bianco." Food and Wine named them one of the "Best Pizza Spots in the U.S.," and Bald Bryan was always singing their praises on the Adam Carolla Show. So of course I had to check them out.\n\nBesides the high praise, I had also always heard to expect a long wait. So I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at 6 and found several empty seats outside. I ordered a pizza, half Rosa and half Wiseguy, and some of the house white wine. The Rosa had red onion, Parmesan, rosemary, and pistachios. The Wiseguy was topped with smoked mozzarella, roasted onion, and fennel sausage. Both choices were good, but not as awesome as I had expected. I actually was more impressed with the house wine.\n\nThis is a traditional wood-fired pizza, light on the toppings and with no tomato sauce. And while I have no problem with that, I\'ve had much better wood-fired pizzas elsewhere. That said, I\'ll leave it up to you whether this is one of the best pizza places in America. I definitely think it\'s worth a visit, but not if you have to wait three hours. And if you\'re eating by yourself, as I was, I suggest getting a half and half (definitely try the Wiseguy; I\'ll leave the other half up to you).'

S'First some background for context. \n\nOne of the two of us who contributed to this review is of 100% Italian heritage and grew up in an Italian neighborhood in NY. Pizzeria Bianco was recommended to us by another couple who are long time friends, who used to live in Paradise Valley and who ate at Bianco frequently. They are "foodies" whose judgement in food we trust and the husband is also a native New Yorker with 100% Italian heritage. So, when they highly recommended Bianco, we were looking forward to great pizza. And since great pizza is among the world\'s most perfect food, we didn\'t even mind the long wait we knew would be a part of eating at Bianco. \n\nBUT...well, we felt completely duped by this experience. \n\nThe pizza just was not that good. And it certainly wasn\'t good enough to justify the nearly two hour wait for a table. Even if that wait was made easier by being able to sit outside on a lovely Arizona evening while enjoying a good glass of wine from the wine bar next door and getting to meet a nice family of New Yorkers, also with Italian heritage, who had come all the way from Queens to try Pizzeria Bianco. \n\nWe went in for our table ahead of them. On our way out, as they were eating their pizzas and we had finished ours, the father gestured with a big "thumbs down" and we said we agreed. \n\nI guess it made us feel better because we felt very much like the little boy in the story of the Emperor who has no clothes who, while all others are admiring the Emperor\'s finery, cries out "But he\'s nude!" \n\nThe good news is the salad that started off the meal was delightfully fresh and dressed just right with a lovely vinaigrette. The pizza itself was just not "all that"...the crust was OK but burned on the outside edges. Not burned as in nicely charred, burned as in incinerated. We\'ve had lots of good wood fired pizzas and this is not a "requirement". Toppings were minimal, which is a good thing to let the crust shine when the crust is great, but in this case there was just too little topping. And the poor, harried waitstaff acted as if they were doing diners a favor to let us eat there. \n\nAll in all, we\'re glad we tried this one time to simply experience first hand a place that was getting so much hype. But with so many really great dining options, including pizza, in the greater Phoenix area we won\'t be back here during our upcoming visit. Fool us once, shame on you, fool us twice...'

S"Yes, there's a wait even on a Tuesday night but the wine bar next door was quaint and had some games (chess, checkers) for you to pass the time, along with drinks.\n\nEnjoyed the level of thin-crustedness that the crust was.  Pizza was delicious.  My wife and I got the Biancoverde (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula) and the Wiseguy (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage).  Both were good, though we regretted it a bit after for eating so much.  Would definitely go back again."

Coming from San Francisco where there are a lot of good pizza places, I thought that the pizza was good but I wasn't impressed. I think I had extremely high expectations after hearing that Oprah and Martha Stewart love the pizza here... Got the local green salad and the Wise Guy and Sonny Boy pizzas, the Sonny Boy was a tad too salty."

S'After living in the Phoenix area for 3 yrs, we finally had the opportunity to try the legendary Pizzeria Bianco.  We heard all of the horror stories of 2 to 3 hr long waits and to grab yourself a Bottle of Wine and prepare for a long night out....we didn\'t care and went out on a Monday night to give it a try.  To our surprise, there was NO WAIT at all, YEAH!!!!\n\nWe were immediately seated at a table (2 top) and given our menus.  It\'s very dark in the dining room and the menus were a little difficult to read in the ambient light....had to use our cell phone flashlight.  We decided to order:\n\nSonny Boy w/Sausage \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=MyRRg57xLO58zg7bbf2fcg#MyRRg57xLO58zg7bbf2fcg\n\nBianco Verde w/Prosciutto\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg#39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food they sat a table of 5 at the 4 top next to us....since the tables are so close, the back of the 5th person\'s chair was nearly touching our table...that kind of crept into our personal space and was a little uncomfortable.....especially since one of the girls in his party looked at us while getting seated and proclaimed "It\'s his birthday, woo-hoo!!!".....that\'s awesome and I hope you guys have a good time, but we came here to dine by ourselves and enjoy each other\'s company, not join a strangers birthday party....*ugh*...\n\nOur Pizza came out a short time later.  I had the Sonny Boy w/Sausage added.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan of their Pizza.  It was cooked perfectly with a nice thin crust.  The dough wasn\'t chewy or undercooked....it was just right.  The Sausage had good flavor and the Pepperoni didn\'t overwhelm the Pizza.\n\nThe Better Half had the Bianco Verde w/Prosciutto.  When it came out, it was covered in Greens....LOL, it looked pretty hilarious as I\'ve never seen a Pizza that looked like this before.  It tasted pretty good though.  I had a slice and thought it would suck because of all of the greens on it....it\'s not something I would personally order, but my Wife enjoyed it and said she\'d order it again.\n\nThe service here was pretty good.  The server was pleasant, friendly, and attentive.  I\'m not sure the Pizza is worth a 2 or 3 hr wait, but it\'s pretty good.  We\'d come back on another slow night.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%'

S'this place pissed me off.\n\nwhy I am giving it 4 stars? well Im not sure. It is more like 3 1/2.  Yes the pizza is that good.  I found there sauce to be some of the best I have ever had.  \n\nWhy does the wait have to be 3 hours though? There is no need for it.  I know it creates a stir, and it is something to talk about and people have talked about it... but it is bullshit.  Open tables in front of the place outdoors and you cant sit and eat out there?

S'Okay so this is a good pizza but not the best. I love the ambiance of this place brings, reminding me of a typical portland OR eatery. Love the friendly customer service we got and the beer served on draft was good (sunbru). The pizza itself is a wood fire burned style reminiscent of Italian pizza. The brucheta was good and the ingredients seems of good choice. One pizza can be eaten by a hungry brat and even a normal sized girl. Best way to eat is order different pizzas ( sonny boy is my fav) and drink beer or wine with friends and comrades.'

S"I had a few hours to kill on the Strip recently and I was famished, so I decided to finally try the Earl of Sandwich to see if it lived up to the massive amount of hype it gets from tourists. First impression: Ugh. There was a long line, a couple of the employees looked pretty frazzled and many of the table were littered with trash. \n\nI ended up ordering 'The Best BLT'. A little cocky, are we Earl? I love BLTs and I love BLTAs even more, so I had them add avocado for a $1 upcharge. Then I waited another 10 minutes after I ordered to pay another employee $10 and change for the sandwich and drink. After paying I was given one of the buzzers many places use to let people know their tables are ready.  Thankfully the wait for my actual food was pretty short, I had just grabbed some napkins and filled my drink. \n\nMy sandwich was good but mindblowing? No. Not even close. The bacon was well cooked, nothing ruins a BLT quicker then soggy bacon.. but I have had more flavorful bacon elsewhere. The bread was tasty but greasy, causing me to require a ton of napkins. The avocado really made it as good as it was, but I get the credit for that, not Earl. \n\nMany people call The Earl of Sandwich inexpensive, I guess for the Strip it isn't insane, but I am pretty sure that for just a few dollars more I could have found a place on the Strip where I could get a BLTA with waiter service.\n\nIf you are stumbling around Planet Hollywood all wasty-pants, these sandwiches would probably blow you away. If you are sober, or a local (or both) chances are you won't be THAT impressed by these. Worth a visit if you are in the area but not worth a special trip to the Strip in my opinion."

I maybe waited 10 minutes in line and another 10 minutes for my sandwich. Although that may seem like a long wait for a simple sandwich, it is definitely worth it!\n\nMy most recent trip to Vegas, I finally had my long awaited Earl of Sandwich craving fulfilled and it was so much better than I remembered it. I'm usually let down a lot of the times when I have such intense cravings, but I was more than happy with my order.\n\nCan't wait for my next Vegas trip!"

S"It's really not the best sandwich I've ever had... and actually it doesn't come close. Not sure why it has such high ratings on Yelp... (maybe i gotta try the tuna melt!)  I got the Earl Club and my boyfriend initially ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. The jerk sauce that comes with it is a mayo-based one, which is not what we were looking for. So my boyfriend exchanged it for the The Original 1762 (minus the horseradish), which he enjoyed. \n\nMy Club sandwich was tasty, but not oh-so-amazing. Their bread is pretty light and toasty, which I liked more than your chain sandwich joints (eg. quiznos), and their deli meat is just standard, not like from a real deli. That being said, they make a pretty good sandwich with the ingredients they use. Not to mention, it is really cheap and 24 hours! \n\nI'll definitely be back if I'm craving a sandwich in Vegas, but I don't think I'll be dreaming about those subs :)"

In case you've never been here before, you can just follow the long line of people- you order your soup, sandwiches, salads, or wraps at the first register and pick up extra goodies like cookies and pasta salad on the walk to the second register where you pay for everything.  You'll receive pager which will beep when your food's ready.  It can be hard to nab a table here during meal times but it's worth it.\n\nI got a chicken salad here since I'm trying to get ready for swim season and it's just not the same as the sandwich.  The chicken is that refrigerated/packaged chicken strips which are kind of spongy and bland.  On the brighter side, the dressing was great and the other toppings like kalamata olives and roasted red peppers were great.  The bf was smart and got the full montegue.  We also ordered the original to go.  Any sandwich here is a must.  Don't try to get something healthier like my salad cuz it just isn't worth it.\n\nand for all you lucky LA people... we will be getting one at Downtown Disney soon!!!"

It also holds up all the ingredients really well.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of their sandwiches. \n\nWe shared:\nThe Full Montagu - roast beef, turkey, two cheeses (aged swiss and sharp cheddar), lettuce, tomato, and house mustard\nThe Italian - salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, and zesty italian dressing\nMediterranean Chicken Salad - super fresh, and the chicken was really tender!  \n\nI can't even tell you which sandwich I liked better because they were both good in their own right.  \n\nThey're open 24 hours so eat here for dinner, go gamble, then come back and eat some more.

Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.\nBut make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time!

As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!\nThe bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!\n\nJerk Chicken Sandwich\nFilled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!\n\nDessert\nBrownie Cream Sandwich\nImagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!\n\nService was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!\n\nWith that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!\n\nHappy Eats!"

I always order the full montagu but for some reason the one in ph serves it different every time. Sometimes the beef is completely brown and cooked through .. Sometimes it's perfect and sometimes its dripping blood and when you bring it to their attention .. They say that's how its cooked .. I now only go for sugar cookies and their salad ... Though still not as yummy as the earl in Orlando .. So depressing :("

By pairing it with an Earl of Sandwich sammich, of course!\n\nI was reserving my 200th review for a place that I considered near and dear to my heart, and Earl of Sandwich is just that!  I have been here countless times. I'm sure I have also been here without any recollection of eating here .. or of the night :)\n\nAlthough I try to order something different every time, I always find myself devouring the Full Montagu. What can I say? It just tastes right with my hurricane + octane + 3 extra shots Everclear / 151 FT concoction! Or maybe it is just that being inebriated dulls my decision-making ability. I also tried the bf's Caribbean Jerk on my last visit... not something I would have ordered myself, but surprisingly really awesome!\n\nI usually eat here during normal eating hours (mid-afternoon, dinner), so the wait is not bad, even though there will always be a line. It would be cool to check out this place post-clubbing hours, but there are so many graveyard steak & egg deals around the Strip that I have not made this place an option yet.\n\nLike the opinion of fellow Yelp! friend Michelle F., a Vegas trip without a visit to Earl of Sandwich just feels incomplete and disappointing. But now that Earl of Sandwich will be extending its franchise this summer to Downtown Disney Anaheim (most likely with shorter opening hours), I will get a chance to try every sandwich on the menu after all!"

S'God I love this place. Ever since I turned 21 back in 2009, I have been enjoying this eatery in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. Ironically, the first place I stayed at in Las Vegas was at the PH and I got to enjoy this place up to 3 times during a weekend trip....\n\nOkay the star missing is because of their "factory-like" mechanical processing of their sandwiches now that they have 1100+ reviews and hundreds of hungry, drunk people wanting their food everyday. Hey, they\'re open 24 hours, so I understand their concern to be quick... but at the same time they are affecting their quality.\n\nIn 2009/2010, I could enjoy multiple sandwiches that were fluffy and not mashed together by the server. Maybe I\'m just bitter or maybe I glorified those first few sandwiches, but I don\'t think Earl will ever be the same. It\'s still worth the $6 for each sandwich compared to some pricey, fast-casual eateries on the strip, but I\'d rather just go to the Monte Carlo Food Court and grab a McDonald\'s sandwich or Subway instead for less.\n\nIf you\'re staying in PH, stay alert for the coupons as well. The location, btw, is at the entryway of their shops right off the strip.'

The sandwiches are perfectly balanced. The price is a steal for Vegas.  The service is quick and efficient.  Also, free Wi-Fi.\n\nMy fear is that as it expands EoS will lose its high standards and become just another chain.

S'Over 1,000 reviews for a franchised sandwich shop with a rating of 4 &  1/2 stars......Wow! \n\nI\'d heard the chatter about the great sandwiches here, so I immediately bookmarked it and knew I\'d have to try this place for lunch. Located inside Planet Hollywood\'s shopping mall, I wasn\'t surprised to see a long line, but it moved quickly. The first thing I notice was the prepacked sandwich rolls stacked up in the prep area. I guess the key to a good sandwich isn\'t fresh bread because my toasted sandwich was damn good! I had "The Earls Club" which consisted of turkey, smoked bacon, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. For $5.99 it\'s not a bad price in Vegas! I grabbed a small side of potato salad and a brownie cream sandwich for dessert. The potato salad was good, but nothing amazing. The Brownie sandwich ($2.49) will add an inch to your waist just looking at it. It was good if you like sinfully rich desserts, but I\'d recommend splitting it with a few people. \n\nIt\'s hard to rate a sandwich franchise. Do I compare it to other sandwich franchises or an independent big city deli? I\'m undecided between 4 & 5 stars, so I\'ll be nice and give\'em a 5.'

Poor guys tried 3 times to make my sandwich, and finally after the 4th time, they got it right.  I didn't even know what was going on, I just thought it was taking forever to make my sandwich until I got it and they told me how tough it was.  Sorry Earl of Sandwich!"

S'I\'m not familiar with the Earl of Sandwich chain, but the whole Tudor imagery thing seems so very 70\'s. And yet somehow it appears less ludicrous in Vegas where everything has to have some theme no matter how contrived. This busy sammie shop is in the middle of the hubbub of activity in the Planet Hollywood\'s never-ending Miracle Mile Shopping Center. Gee, maybe it would have helped to have the staff dress like a cut-rate Masterpiece Theater production of "The Six Wives of Henry VIII" because the food deserved a beheading. \n\nOK, it wasn\'t that bad ...just unexceptional. It reminds me of the equally mediocre Cosi chain in New York where they serve up sandwiches between flattened, toasted buns over-doused with dressing. I had the Veggie, which had feta cheese, lettuce, a Roma tomato, cucumber, red onion, roasted red peppers & Mediterranean dressing (see my photo). I just remember that it was mostly wet and turning quickly into a sponge as I was munching it. The Tomato Soup almost saved it, but it was scorching hot...why oh why do chains always do that? \n\nFOOD - 2 stars...unexceptional veggie sammie...off to the gallows with you and Anne Boleyn \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...one busy mall with jiggling masses of cornbelt tourists in heaven here \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...it\'s just a line and a tray \nTOTAL - 2 stars...the Earl needs to be exiled to Togo\'s'

Your stomach is grumbling and you decide that it might be best to fill it with something before everything you consumed earlier that night comes up in a very unpleasant way.\n\nIf you're ever in such a situation, Earl of Sandwich is definitely the perfect remedy for you. Though there's usually a line, it goes pretty quickly, and especially late at night there are always interesting people to talk to in line.\n\nI usually go for the full motagu, which has turkey, roast beef, and some sort of mustard in it. However, I've tried the Tuna melt and the jerk chicken, and both are pretty good.\n\nThe sandwich is decently sized for around $6, so I usually split the sandwich with a friend or save it for drunchies later.\n\nEven when I'm not staying at planet hollywood, I always make an effort to try to come to Earl's for at least one meal, and I'll definitely be back in the future."

It was strange because he was directly behind me in line and when I saw him, I thought, "What the hell.  Small world."\n\nAnyway, the line  moved fast. The decor was cool and from what my friend told me, everything on the menu was delicious.  I was happy since the prices were actually reasonable.  $6-$8 for a sandwich.  I ordered a bacon chicken sandwich.\n\nI can see why this place is so popular.  The service was great, the price is fair, and their sandwiches were so tasty.  They had a bread which looked like cibatta bread and their ingredients seemed fresh.  It came out warm and newly made.

There is always line but don't let that deter you from trying this out!  It takes 10 minutes maybe even less to stand in line, order and get your food.\n\nMy new goal in life is to try every sandwich here and I definitely see more vegas trips in my future.  So far I can cross off the Caprese, Original 1762 and the Holiday Turkey.  The Caprese consists of mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and drizzled with basalmic vinaigrette!  It was exactly like a Caprese salad in sandwich form.  The Original 1762 has slices of roast beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce.  The horseradish sauce is perfect and really makes the sandwich.  Now last but certainly not least is the Holiday Turkey!  After one bite, I just wanted to make out with that sandwich.  It was a unique thanksgiving sandwich for me because I had never come across one with stuffing before.  And boy did it make a difference.  The stuffing was soaked in gravy and kept the sandwich very moist!  And the turkey, cranberry sauce and seasoned mayo was good as well. But sadly the Holiday Turkey is seasonal and will be offered until January 8th. \n\nIt's open 24 hours so there's no excuse for you not being able to try it!

I wasn't a huge fan of the full montagu (it tasted overly salty and the meat was kind of bland) or the other sandwiches.

To my surprise, this place was a complete failure.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nThe Full Montagu (Roast beef and Turkey with Swiss and Cheddar) - This sandwich was just less than OK. Absolutely nothing special about it. I believe every sandwich comes with 'lettuce' and 'tomatoes'. Wait what? WHAT LETTUCE? WHAT TOMATOES? They were so dinky; there was absolutely no crunch from the lettuce NOR juiciness from the tomato. This sandwich was just so dry... my love and I had to drench each bite with the mustard provided at each table to keep from throwing the sandwich across the slot machines.\nThe Cobb Salad -  Again nothing spectacular about this salad. I'm a Cobb Salad fanatic, and I can honestly say I've had far better from grocery store deli's. They really do skimp out on everything :(\n\nI feel semi-bad for bashing on this place... but I'm utterly disappointed that it was all hype. I believe the 4.5 stars comes from its convenience and price, not the quality of food. I can see this place being OK drunk food since it's open 24/7.\n\nWhat I recommend? Save your $6 and walk over to Chipotle a few minutes down the strip. Get your money's worth!"

Because the sandwiches are that. good.\n\nEarl's has never disappointed me - other than the brutally long wait that occurs at literally the most random times of day. I think I've waited less at noon than around 3-4pm. But duh, it's vegas, and when in vegas, bedtime doesn't happen til 6am so of course, lunch will take place later. So I suggest go as early as physically possible. \n\nThe full montagu and caprese sandwiches are my favorites, but literally everything on the menu is delicious.\n\nConsidering the lengthy line, service here is quick. I mean, lightning fast. After you order, the wait is no longer than 7 minutes (oddly specific of me, but I'm serious) to get your food. Making the long wait that much more worth it."

S"I normally wouldn't rave over a sandwich place because I normally don't do sandwich places, I have a small issue with paying people to do something I could easily make at home but I must give credit where credit is due, the Earl of Sandwich is worth paying somebody to do something that seems so easy.\n\nI went with a club sandwich and it was easily one of best sandwiches I have ever had. Bread beautifully toasted, meats fresh, tomatoes and lettuce fresh and just the right amount of condiments, this sandwich was everything I needed and more.\n\nMy only issue with Earl of Sandwich was it was hard as hell to find, I wanted around in loops forever looking for it, I'm not really holding this against Earl of Sandwich as my horrible sense of direction was truly to blame. Anyway this place is worth a visit for sure."

I mean where else can you get a legit panini-type sandwich that tastes like heaven at an odd hour of the evening/morning for less than $10...while tipsy...\n\nI've had the Full Montagu and Chipotle Chicken Avocado - both of which are great choices (thanks yelp friends that suggested!). The Chipotle Chicken Avocado I appreciated for the light spiciness and fresh avocado, and the full montagu for their roast beef.

S"This was such a great find during my Las Vegas trip over the weekend.  Located in Planet Hollywood, the lines were long during lunch but it moved quickly.  The ordering process is quick and painless and finding a seat can be a tad bit hard during their peak hours but never impossible.   We ordered the All American sandwich, Full Montagu, Chicken Wrap, and the Berry Salad.  \n\nThe All American Sandwich was absolutely delicious and flavorful with roast turkey, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and cranberries.  The bread was perfectly toasted and the cranberry added an extra sweetness to the sandwich which made it a little bit more heavenly.   Please order this during your first time here. \n\nThe Full Montagu sandwich was good but not great.  Consisted of beef, turkey, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and mustard sauce.   The meat was a bit under-seasoned and the whole sandwich tasted a tad bit bland and light.  The Chicken, Berry, and Almond salad was good.  The whole combination of almond, berry, chicken, and lettuce was good.  The vinaigrette that comes with it was also decent and I would probably order it again if I needed a side of salad to balance out my meal. \n\nThis place definitely does not specialize in salad nor wraps so I would stick with the hot sandwiches when I come back.  This is an order-and-find-your-own-seat type of place so don't expect quality service... but DO expect great sandwiches."

They had a decent size menu with a variety of choices.  The price was very affordable at $5.99 for a hot sandwich or wrap.  Their service can be improved because the cashier was definitely not helpful. But at least the food came out fast and fresh. \n\nHawaiian BBQ: If you like ham and pineapple this is definitely a top choice.  The bread was perfectly toasted like a panini and the BBQ flavor was sweet and flavorful.  \n\nThe Full Montagu: Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomato, and Earl's mustard. This one tasted like a classic sandwich.  It was hot, fresh, and of great quality.  It wasn't greasy, but delicious.  However, it doesn't have the unique flavors of the Hawaiian BBQ.\n\nOverall: Probably the cheapest, yummiest, and most convenient food spots in Vegas!"

S"Hey, so one of the greatest things about PH is that its got EARL OF SANDWICH. Open 24 hours to satisfy your lunch, 2 dinners, and drunk munchies needs. \n\nDid you know that the sandwich was named after a man who was the Earl of Sandwich? Wikipedia says: \n\nIt was named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, an 18th-century English aristocrat... It is said that he ordered his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread... It is said that Lord Sandwich was fond of this form of food because it allowed him to continue playing cards, particularly cribbage, while eating without getting his cards greasy from eating meat with his bare hands.\n\nIf Wikipedia said it, it must be true.\n\nCaribbean Jerk Chicken is absolutely splendid, though you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Bread is freshly made and toasted, meat is meaty and plentiful, and sauces and other sandwich toppings perfectly complement the bread and meat to form the perfect sandwich.\n\nMy mission is to eat every single sandwich on the menu."

However, their bread, which is toasted and buttered is very tasty.  This is a good place for a quick bite in Planet Hollywood, but there are a lot of other food options in Vegas.\n\nAlso, beware of their seating setup. There are very few tables despite their very long line. Be prepared to not have a place to sit if you come during a rush."

It has stuffing, cranberry sauce, turkey and gravy allll in one sandwich. Taste bud explosion. The tuna is amazing !! Cold tuna, spread on 2 puffy pieces of bread and cheese melted to perfection. Spicy Italian, just like that all warm spicy meats sandwiched between 2 toasty buns !! I also have 1/2 a salad the Cobb is perfect.

You'll probably end up buying more than one to feel full. Thankfully, the staff is super fast and the intimidating line really isn't a problem. The sandwich itself was really good though.

S"Researchers at Northwestern University conducted a study in mice linking late night eating to weight gain.  I, on the other hand, conducted a study of my own that found in a sample size of 3, following significant consumption of alcohol, there was a 100% chance that consuming a sandwich from E of S after 3AM would be astronomically delicious.  \n\nLocated just inside the entrance of Planet Hollywood facing the strip, this is the ideal place to grab a late night snack if your wallet is thin from a cooler at the casino tables ($5.99) or you're too incoherent to sit down and order from a server or drive off the strip.  From the name, it's pretty obvious that the sandwiches are the star.  My first trip we ordered the Holiday Turkey and the Carribean Jerk sandwich and the sandwiches are all wrapped in foil and shaped like gold bars.  The first thing you will notice upon taking the first bite is the amazing panini-like crunch from the exterior of the bread followed by the chewy, gooey, and occasionally crispy components within.    The Holiday Turkey pretty much tasted like Thanksgiving dinner between two amazing pieces of bread and the Carribean Jerk sandwich, albeit tasty, didn't necessarily remind me of the islands since I was expecting less mayo and more spice.  The remaining sandwiches all looked really solid, especially the Roast Beef, the Club sandwich, and the Full Montague.   \n\nSomewhere along the hallways of the pantheon of great sandwiches, the Earl himself is giving his seal of approval."

It's a simple and humble little sandwich shop with a nice seating area. I had the tuna melt sandwich- I am a tuna fan. No lies, one of the many best tuna sandwiches I've tried. \n\nI'm coming back here to resume my quest."

I had The Original and hubby had the club.  The bread is toasty perfect and that horseradish cream is divine!  Hubby and I agree that mine was waaaaaay better than his.  It was so good that I had to eat extra fast so he couldn't ask for another bite.  :P  I took that last star off for his sandwich.  The club was pretty mediocre.  Definitely get The Original instead!"

S"What is there left to say when 653 other Yelpers have already spilled the beans about the Earl of Sandwich? There was only one thing left to do which was to see what the hype was all about myself. \n\nThe place is located inside the Planet Hollywood across from the sports book. It's open 24/7 for all you lovely belligerent and drunk, 5 inch heels in hand meaning blackened Hobbit feet, crusted yack on chin folks. The Earl just might be your savior.\n\nFor a measly $5-6, you can get a nice, freshly made and toasted sandwich. There are many options to choose from such as the classic club to the Hawaiian bbq. Of course there are other items on the menu like their rich tomato soup (I recommend the croutons on the side), salads, wraps, and so forth. \n\nThe word about the Earl of Sandwich is out so don't go bezerk if you see a pessimistic long line. Their efficient staff will keep the lines steadily moving and it shouldn't take too long for the orders to be called. The only downfall is possibly the seating for it may fill up quickly.\n\nOn our most recent trip to Sin City, we stopped by Earl's twice due to the fact that we stayed at PH and so it was always a short walk away. On a random note, I would like to state that for some odd reason I enjoyed the sandwiches from Earl the next morning after it was left out over night more than straight out of the oven. Perhaps it was the hangover munchies?\n\nGive the Earl a hollar if you're ever in the (702) area code."

S"I have eaten here on numerous occasions when I come to Vegas. I always get the Tuna Melt Sandwich because in my opinion I think it is one of the best sandwiches on their menu and I'm not even really a big fan of tuna. I think all their sandwiches are good because it's the bread that actually stands out.  The cost is $6.49 for the sandwich. The chicken ceasar salad was $6.99 and not worth it's price. It is relatively small with a few chopped lettuce, very little chicken, some croutons, shaved parmesan and very little dressing that comes with it. You are better off getting another sandwich which is cheaper or adding soup to your order.  I've had the broccoli cheddar soup and it's pretty good. Soda is $2.49 but you get unlimited refills.  If you gamble and have a Diamond or Seven Stars Total Rewards card you can bypass the long lines and go to the front as well as use your points to pay for your meal. Don't worry, the line goes fast even if you do have to wait in those long lines."

The lines moved rather quickly: 1.you order and a receipt is handed to you 2.move along the line, pay at the next register with anything you picked up along the way and you also order your cup for the fountain drinks at this register. They hand you another receipt and a buzzer.\n3. When your buzzer buzzes pick up your sandwich next to the paid register.\nThe only thing I wanted more of was the meat! There was hardly any meat in The Full Montagu. It's not something I would go back for or crave for but  is something light and close by that I can grab when at Planet Hollywood. It's good enough to fill me for an hour or two. Something to try but not a must."

But couldn't soak up the whole experience since I had a protein bar an hour before and was trying to avoid eating heavy since were going to go clubbing afterwards. Yes a very girly thing but hey, got to fit in my dress! just tried a few bites here and there. Went both friday and saturday and wanted to go back again. Something about the packaging reminded me of willy wonka's golden ticket that are hidden in the chocolate hahah. Can never get enough. Please come to LA Earl!\n\n_The original, roasted beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce was pretty good. I loved the horseradish sauce! It really made the sandwich stand out. Although a little too much meat for me. \n_The Full Montagu, roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce was one big juicy bite. Although it seemed a little too cheesy. I think either swiss or cheddar would be good but having both was a bit too rich for me. But I'm sure most like a whole lot of cheese. Luckily the small amout of lettuce and tomato helped a bit.\n_Chipotle Chicken avocado, grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce was my favorite. The chipotle sauce was great and not too overdrenched. Every bite was better and just melts in your mouth. \n_Baja Chicken salad, romaine, grilled chicken, cheddar, cilantro, avocado, tomatoes, roasted corn, black beans, tortilla strips, and red wine vinaigrette was refreshing. The salad was a bit small of a portion but not bad. Nothing amazing. But good to share with a friend and half a sandwich. \n\nI would definitely come back and this time make sure not to eat any protein bars beforehand haha. And wear a more loose dress. Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!"

S"I'm actually quite surprised that I never wrote a review for this place.\n\nOkay.. well here goes. My friends are going to hate me for this, but I just have to say it. Earl of Sandwich is good, but it is definitely not amazing or 5 star worthy. I'm SORRY!!\n\nSince it opened, I've probably been here numerous times. And i must say, it's pretty much a staple in all of my Vegas visits. Why then, do I only give it 3 stars? Well.. personally I think the sandwiches are good here but it's not the best sandwich i've ever had in my life... \n\nFor a meal at the wee hours of the night, a nice pipping hot, cheesy, melty, carb heavy, meaty sandwich is probably the only thing that will make your night of debauchery even better.\n\nWith that said, yes, if you haven't tried Earls, you must do so. You just must.. for the experience, for the claim that you've tried it, and for your own judgment. You must wait the in the atrocious line (which really isn't that bad) and judge for yourself if this place is up to the hype.\n\nThe sandwiches are good a size, they don't skimp on the meat, and the ingredients are simple and straight to the point. Also for around $6, it's one of the better deals on the strip that won't go breaking your bank.\n\nAnyhow, if you must try it.. go for the Full Montagu. For a first timer, that is the best choice. But do be warned, their sandwiches are greasy! So be prepared...and the bread is pretty thick, so half the sandwich will probably fill you up.\n\nNonetheless, personally, I only come here because my friends are in LOVE with Earls and will not stand a trip without a visit. So, for the culture, for the fun, and for the love of late night drunken grub, here's 3 stars."

WHAT IS THAT?! I tried the Tuna Melt, Full Montague and Meatball. I really, really enjoyed the Tuna Melt. Simple, yet effective! I also tried the Tomato and Brocolli Cheddar Soup. Both were delicious for only $2.99! Soup and sandwich for $9.71!!\n\nI came here all three days I was in Vegas. That's right. 100% attendance for me at Earl of Sandwich. If only I could say the same thing about my class schedule heheh.\n\nAnyway, there was always a line when I came, but the line passes by so quickly that you'll be NOMing on your sandwich before you know it. They are so quick to make the orders. I seriously paid for my meal and my buzzer started buzzing as I was putting my card away. :O\n\nParking is in the Planet Hollywood structure. From the structure is kind of a long trek to this place, but it's worth it.

Line was long but moved relatively quick. Sandwich came out nicely put together and warm. Taste was good and fresh. Definitely worth a try considering husband wanted to order more and colleague (who happened to also be in vegas) texted me the next morning to make sure I had some before leaving and told me he ate there and then brought about $100 worth back for his family.

Some people like drunchies to be unplanned, but my trip to Earl of Sandwich was definitely planned days before. The line was relatively long, probably took over 20 minutes from standing in line to sitting down and devouring my sandwich but the wait was so worth it!\n\nI got three different sandwiches: the chipotle chicken avocado, the tuna melt and the hawaiian bbq! YES - a small girl like me had to have three, but of course I didn't eat them all in one sitting. Honestly, if my boyfriend didn't stop me, I would have gotten a dozen of these sandwiches to-go. They were simply too good and I can't even tell you which one is my favorite because all three were amazing!!! \n\nThere are plenty of seating but as you can imagine, the lines are long and there are always a lot of people so seating may be hard to find. I didn't have trouble finding a seat for two, but that was at 3pm, which is more of a lunner hour instead of normal eating hours. \n\nTRUST ME. GO HERE.

S"It's not that the Earl of Sandwich makes the best food on the Strip -- far from it.  Of course, the freshly par-baked bread is super hot and soft, and the fillings are generous and deliciously melted together in a fashion that will delight drunken and sober tastebuds alike.  However, the Earl of Sandwich deserves five stars for the fact that it is a cheap, fast, and delicious place to grab a bite at any time of the day.  Las Vegas seems to suffer from an excess of medium expensive restaurants that boast fancy-pants menus that aren't anything special, and this restaurant is just a refreshing, tasty alternative to that.  \n\nThis place looks like a fast food type chain (in fact, after examining their website I see that they are an international chain, and they most definitely need to open a shop in Los Angeles), but don't be fooled by the ultra-reasonable menu and the assembly line of workers: these sandwiches are def the real deal.  When I came here, I split a ham and cheese and an original roast beef with my friends: both sandwiches were excellent, with a nice tanginess from the mustard on the ham and cheese, and a very mild kick from the horseradish sauce on the roast beef.  The sandwiches were a nice size, although the boys in our group wanted two each for dinner.  At a little over $5 a pop, though, you'll still have plenty left in your pockets for the slot machine.  It's also open late at night -- a perfect post-club snack spot!"

Not the insanely best sandwich I've ever had but very good compared to any other run of the mill Vegas sammy.  Friend grabbed a Gatorade too before our epic day partying began, which seemed to trickle down to most of the group.  \n\nLuckily we snagged a table large enough to fit our group and began the pre-partying right there.

S"In my view, yet another overhyped restaurant. Earl of Sandwich is a glorified Subway. \n\nThe Food: The chips are greasy and not particularly special. The chicken tortilla soup is pretty standard, the kind of soup you'd expect at your local Panera Bread. The chicken mac'n'cheese was actually quite delicious, with a crunchy texture owing to the crumbs they throw on top (mmm mmm mmmm). And the sandwich itself? Nothing special. I got the chipotle avocado chicken sandwich: The bread was whatever-white-bread, the chicken seemed ok, but not explosive, and the big chunks of avocado were pretty good and fresh. \n\nPrice: Dirt cheap. Under $7 for a sandwich. I understand for the price it may be decent enough. But this is not nearly as good as Ike's in San Francisco. \n\nOverall, this may be a good place to check out if you and the squad are nursing a hangover on a Sunday morning, but I wouldn't go here otherwise. Also, the lines can apparently get pretty huge.\n\nIn the near future, I expect this place to explode into a national chain, losing whatever little cache it had in Vegas as a stop-over spot for hungover peeps."

She ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chick and I had the Chipotle Chicken with Avacado and Chicken.  My sandwich was pretty good.  As I said above the bread may have been the best part.  Ingredient-wise you can see they use the same chicken across all their sandwiches and just dress the differently.  The chipotle dressing was nice and added a lot of flavor and the bacon and avocado where lacking a bit and didn't really punch through as much as I hopped.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken came out without any dressing so my GF had to get another, upon the second try it was better.  It didn't really have as much flavor as I was expecting.  Again, it was a solid, even a good sandwich...it just could have been more.\n\nService was kind of wonky.  You order and one register then pay at another down the line.  The cashier at the end disappears to refill some napkins and disappears for almost 5 minutes.  A line quickly formers behind us and the food orders come in before people could pay.  The ladies running the sandwiches looked dumbfounded because they didn't know what to do.  Finally the cashier comes back, but it was still rather annoying.\n\nI do want to give Earl of Sandwich another try down the road, particularly the one near disneyland.  While it wasn't everything I was expecting, the sandwiches were still of a good quality and an easy pick over Subway, Quiznos, Togos or any other fast food sandwich shop."

S"Reasonably priced place to grab a quick lunch in Vegas. This actually means a lot because almost nothing is reasonably priced in Vegas. It's open late for drunken munchies, but we came in the middle of the day. I got a Mediterranean salad for like $6 or $7. It was full of olives, feta, tomatoes, the good stuff. \n\nI didn't try anyone else's food, but it all looked good. The Full Montague I believe is a popular favorite."

S'I was really excited to try Earl of Sandwich, since everyone has been talking about how delicious it is and how it\'s a must esp. when you\'re drunk, lol.\n\nLOCATION\n-------------------------\n\nMy friends and I went here because it is conveniently located in the Miracle Mile Shop which is connected to our hotel in Elara! It seems, that this location can get incredibly busy, but their workers are pretty fast with taking orders & prepping the sandwich. They have a system that works since we didn\'t have to wait so long for our foods! OH, and I guess they are open 24 hours!\n\nFOOD\n-------------------------\n\nMy best friend and I had to try the Caribbean Jerk Chicken since it stood out to us the most and.... well she hasn\'t had "jerk chicken" before!\n\nI\'d say this place is pretty cheap compared to other places on the strip! Me being a newbie expected it to be some big sandwich, but it\'s actually small, but good. It isn\'t the greatest or a five star sandwich in my opinion but it was good for the price and it\'s something that will fill you up if you are looking for a quick meal!\n\nSERVICE\n-------------------------\n\nI did mention their fast service here above which I thought was great! The cashier during our visit had mistakenly entered my friend\'s order,... which resulted to one of the managers yelling at him in front of us... *AWKWARD*. We all thought the yelling was unnecessary especially in front of customers. I didn\'t think the manager at that time responds well to pressure and the how busy they got.\n\nWould I return? Absolutely! I wanna try their other sandwiches, and will definitely go for the ones my friends had recommended next time!'

S"Absolutely the best sandwich around, and it's only $5.99.  The Original and Full Montagu are some of tastiest sandwiches I've had in my life.  You can't go wrong if you go to the Earl of Sandwich craving (duh) a sandwich.  They also have a veggie sandwich for those concerned types.  The soups, especially the Tomato Soup, taste great and it doesn't hurt your pocketbook as much with it being only $2.99.  The yogurt parfaits ($3.99) are pretty good too, my favorite being blueberry.\n\nAccording to Caesars Entertainment the descendant of the Earl of Sandwich started this little sandwich shop inside Planet Hollywood.  How can you not have a sandwich from someone who is a descendant of the OG of sandwiches.  Earl of Sandwich, oh yeah!!!"

S"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! Who'd ever thought sandwiches could be THAT good? I've had a couple different kinds here and they're all so goooooood. I had the original, tuna melt, chipotle chicken avocado and the Caribbean jerk. I would have to say my favorite is the tuna melt and the chipotle chicken avocado. The original is really good too with the horseradish. And the caribbean jerk has this sweet explosion of peppers. They're all so good! I definitely want to come back and get some more but I live too far... Next time during my trip back to Vegas, I will definitely try some other sandwiches. I did find there's a location in Anaheim. Maybe I'll have to make the trip down there."

S"THE BUFFET in Las Vegas\n\nParty of 4 was about $90. \nWalking in, the decorations were very nice. Overall very pretty, is it strange that I'm commenting on this? \nAnyways. We arrived at around 3 or 4. Our plan was to eat til the dinner food started coming out. The food selection here was THE BEST. and everything tasted fresh and clean. from left to right was seafood, asian food, american food, pasta, i forgot...and then salad bar! \n\nand the desert place. ice cream (i actually think it was gelato) and all sorts of yummy things. i personally thought their creme brulee was the best i've tasted in vegas!"

S"The Wynn buffet was something I was really looking forward to because of all the great and amazing things said about it. Then a friend who I was with informed me that it was overrated and just the decor was fancy. OH GREAT?.. So we got there and yes it was nice and all, it set us back about 30-40 a person, which isn't too bad considering it's Vegas and it's a buffet IN VEGAS. So we got seated pretty fast and went straight to the seafood. \nThere were about 5-6 different stations.\nThe king crab legs were good, nice and sweet and not too salty. The prime rib was delicious, and another dish that I definitely remembered was the clam chowder, which wasn't the traditional one but this one was in a tomato base, it was indeed.. very delicious. The dessert section had a pretty good selection. I think what stuck out was the crepes. Pretty cool.\nOverall it was okay, I wasn't overly impressed."

S"Buffet's are bad.  Wait, I take that back, they are dANGEROUS.\n\nAnd worst of all, they are extremely bad for people like me who run in there pushing down anyone in my way to get a look at the vastly large circle of food all smelling delicious and looking might good as it glistens in the light.  and go early to avoid the line.  we went at 4pm and stayed till 8pm.  Even reloaded.\n\nAs i walked passed the desserts to my table, I found myself at the center in front of the roast station with the seafood to my left and italian to my right.  It was like being a kid in a full on candy store, and knowing that I could eat as much as I want, was dangerous.\n\nSo what did I have?\n- Seafood - large cocktail shrimps were a little bit tough as if they were frozen for some time, but i do like me some shrimp (the ocean called, they're running out of shrimp).  The alaskan crab was excellent and we each got a cup of butter to go with each of it.  (you'd think, a cup of butter?  is that necessary?  but its all to make it easier to dip)\n\n- Chinese - The Siu Mai was good and the egg rolls were hard to look away from.  Normally I'd tell myself to only eat the stuff that are worth and not found anywhere else.  This rule doesn't always work.\n\n- Roast - My FAVORITE DISH was the lamb.  I kept going back for 3rds and it makes me very happy that several pieces of this was in my stomach which made me full.  Somehow, they managed to make it very tender and it tasted like butter as you bite off the meat.  The prime rib was alright, I didn't even finish my entire piece.  skip the turkey\n\n- Grill - the veal short ribs were another favorite of mine here.  even scored me some asparagus on the side which was nice.  The kalbi shank had a nice flavor, but still somewhat dry.\n\n- Dessert - I think the creme brulee was well worth getting above everything. Or maybe get some fruits since if you're like me, you fear that you eat so much that my diet is going to not like me.  \n\nFor a buffet, it's definitely good, but some small things got me dissapointed.  Still worth $40 tho!"

S'i\'m not a buffet fan only because i have a tiny stomach and i eat very little portions but it\'s vegas!! what\'s vegas without great dining experiences? especially buffets? so a couple of friends and i decided to hit up wynn buffet since it\'s "the best on the strip". the wait seemed short but it took about 20-25 minutes= [ i was starving and this felt like torture. it felt like i was standing in hot scorching weather while waiting in line for a ride at great america= [\n\nwhen we finally reached the cashier to pay, the total for 2 came out as 110$. this is a ridiculous amount for a buffet so i expect the best damn food i\'ve ever tried!! \n\nwhen we finally got seated, i was actually able to eat a lot and the food wasn\'t all that bad. it actually was pretty good. my favorite was probably the prime rib. my friend got a bunch of king crab legs which i really disliked because it was cold and tasted like nothing. the butter also didn\'t taste too great. the desserts, as always just like other buffets, were flavorless. they were super cute!! but lacked in flavor.\n\nthe restrooms were probably my favorite only because they were styled where the entire stall is sealed shut so no one can listen to you do your business....= ]\n\noverall, buffet was good, seats were spacey and not really that crammed, restrooms were a-ok, desserts need work, servers for drinks need to come around faster.\n\nwould i come back? probably not, only because there are dozens of other buffets i can try out next time= ]'

S"This is the buffet to go to if you don't mind paying the higher prices for a gourmet and fresher side to your typical buffet. They have better seafood selections here. A variety of cooked fish done gourmet style with fresh fruit toppings. It's a different kinda of buffet that's unlike any other on the strip. The selection of this buffet seems to be on the lighter and healthier side but that's a good thing because you get to taste everything and not get overwhelm with the heavier items which they still have a good selection of meat dishes. The only draw back is their crab legs/fresh shrimps station, somehow there's always a line at this station. They don't put out huge mounds of crab legs for the taking like some of the buffets I go to....not sure what's the deal with that. I would give it a five star...if it wasn't for the long line at the crab leg station, after waiting for about an hour plus in line to pay....I don't want to spend another 10-15min. in line for crab legs. I have to be nice...the dessert selection makes up for it. WARNING... to all of out of town Yelpers...don't come here on New Years eve...unless your willing to pay close to $90/pp. Our family was priced shocked last New Years eve when we saw the price. When we got there we were wondering why there's no line until we saw the price....it was highway robbery that night."

S"For those who are planning on eating the Buffet at Wynn and wants to see how the buffet looks like, here's a Complete steady tour of the Buffet at Wynn:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws5o24QQg3E\n\nIf you guys want to save some money and eat dinner food for cheap, this is what I did, first of all, lunch is served from 11am to 3:30pm and dinner from 3:30 to closing. I went and stood in line at 3:10 and got to the cashier at 3:20. I ended up paying the $26 lunch price. After that, we went to seat down, and viola 3:30 came around and they brought out all the premium dinner food like prime ribs and crab legs. By the way, dinner on Friday is $41, so I saved $16 and get to eat the good food.\n\n\nI had an opportunity to eat at Wynn for the 2nd times in 2 years. The food has gotten a lot better then previous years. \n\nThere were a wide variety of food to choose from. I believe the food are way much better when it's served on Friday to Sunday.\n\nThey now have street tacos, last time I ate here, they didn't have this.\n\nI wish they had King crab legs like at Bellagio buffet and Aria buffet. They only serve snow crab legs instead. \n\nDessert station was OK not that impressive like Ceasars Palace buffet. They do have candy apple.\n\nOverall the food was pretty good."

And for $35/person (before tax & tip)  it's cheaper than any non-food-court sit-down restaurant on the Strip.\n\nBest thing is that the food is presented on plates and not metal heat trays.  I would skip the Asian section (not a lot of variety and it's not the best) and go for the seafood and grill sections.  The selection is pretty limited, but it makes up in quality and taste.\n\nAs for dessert, I bet they were better than I give them credit.  I was stuffed by the end of dinner, but forced myself to try the creme brulee and homemade pineapple ice cream.  While good, they couldn't live up to that mango pineapple snapper."

S'4 stars? 1200+ reviews? Really yelpers? This food was mediocre at best, even desserts looked better than they tasted.  I don\'t over eat at buffets, I much prefer quality over quantity so this place was a "may-jor" disappointment.  Foods were bland, stale from sitting under heat lamps or in the built in chafing dishes. Salads were wilted.  Desserts were just pretty, but tasted pretty nasty.  I won\'t go back, I won\'t recommend it for anyone looking for a place to eat in Vegas.  As a matter of fact, if someone asked my opinion, I\'d tell them they were better of at In-N-Out.'

If you have any taste buds save your money as it was way to expensive for what is it, an average buffet. To make matters worse, the service was also below average with the waitress only coming to our table twice and the cutlery and cups smelt gross like eggs.\nI had a better meal the day before at a diner where the entire bill was cheaper than 1 person at the buffet."

I would recommend coming around this time if you can because you pay the breakfast price and get to eat both breakfast and lunch! Sodas and juices are included in the price of the buffet as well. My favorite things that I tried were the roasted cauliflower, corn, and mango sorbet. Everything tasted pretty average and nothing really stood out to me taste wise.

S"We left Los Angeles about 9:00amFriday morning and drove straight to Vegas. Why did we leave so early? Because we wanted to go to Wynn Buffet for lunch. I've read mixed reviews about Wynn Buffet. Some people say this is the best buffet in Las Vegas. And it's probably the most expensive buffet in Vegas, too. We got there around 2pm. There was a very short line of people waiting. Lunch price is much cheaper than dinner, $21.95 per person.\n\nWe went up to the cashier to pay first. Then we waited in the seating line for about 10 minutes. The hostesses wore a really bright fuchsia color uniform and it looked so tacky. The seating area was huge. After we seated, we waited for the server to come to take our drink order. Waited and waited and no server. They weren't that busy so where were the servers? \n\nThe serving stations were divided by cuisines or courses. There are: salad, soup, shellfish, seafood, pizza, Italian, American, the grill, Asian, chilled seafood, sushi and dessert. The stations were very clean, but not well stocked. We came toward the end of the lunch buffet hour. Some trays were almost empty and they didn't add any fresh food.\n\nShrimp cocktail was good. I really like marinated herring. Every time I see this at buffet I always get it. It tasted a lot like mackerel. A little sour and fishy. I like it! BBQ bun was bad. It tasted like it had been sitting there for a long time. Spicy miso udon was not spicy, and I couldn't taste the miso, either. The udon was mushy. No good. Orange chicken was alright. It's just like the Panda Express kind of orange chicken. The sea bass was the best dish. So soft and tasty. Spiced lamb leg was delicious, too. Very tender. But they didn't serve it anymore when I went back for second. The spicy tuna hand roll was pretty sad. The rice was mushy and the seaweed was soggy. Even though they had a big sushi station, they only served spicy tuna hand roll, cucumber roll and some sad looking California roll. Very disappointed about their sushi station. At the sushi station, they also served individual salad in cute little cups. I grabbed a marinated mushroom salad.  It was really good. Mushroom was marinated in balsamic dressing. Very tasty. But one salad we got no dressing and it tasted like salad with no dressing. I don't know it was meant to have no dressing or they forgot to put dressing on it.\n\nMy mom told me the way to eat buffet is to focus on the seafood. And that was what I did on my second plate. Clam chowder was rich, but a bit salty. Red snapper, salmon and sole were the three different fish I got. None of them were as good as the sea bass. The meatball was so dry and tough. Gross! Mushroom ravioli was good. Wish I got more of this. The corn was really really good. BBQ rib was good, but cold. Spanich rice and guacamole was yummy. Potato and beans were alright. \n\nWe were really full at this point. But still gotta eat some dessert. They have a huge dessert area in the middle of the buffet. Tons of pastry, cakes and ice cream. Everything looked so good. Even though I was full, still got a big plate. Yes, I was happy!\n\nWell, the dessert looked good, but tasted just alright. The homemade ice cream was good. I got pineapple and lemon. Both were perfect for summer hot weather. I also got cheesecake, cupcake, chocolate tart, caramel eclair, banana mousse, apple candy and chocolate cake. My favorite was the chocolate cake. The rest were only ok.\n\nSo what did we think of Wynn buffet? I thought it was just alright and didn't really live up to its hype. The selection was good, but nothing really stood out. There weren't much sushi nor seafood like we expected. Maybe there's a big difference between lunch and dinner? Well, at least we got really full. Will we come back again? Probably not."

S"This place went WAY downhill the past couple years.\n\n(This review is for Dinner only)\n\n I went a few times in the year or so after they opened, and was very impressed. They had rack of lamb, and better desserts.   The lamb chops were the highlight. They were seasoned very well, and were above average quality. They since removed them. last 2 times I was there, for dinner.  The last visit was about 3 months ago.\n\nThe last 2 visits were a huge disappointment..  The bread was stale, the meat was dry, and tough. Inedible for my party.. in fact one in my party couldn't find ANYTHING she could eat.  Everything was bad.  \n\nThe only thing I liked was the ice cream. It was hand scooped if I remember right.  All the baked goods were stale, and the cakes/pies were low quality. The creme brulee was watered down.   The candy apple was HARD as a ROCK!! I couldn't bite into it. I bet someone will break a tooth with that thing.  Did I mention the breads were STALE??\n\nThe quality of the food they were offering was worth about $18. Not the $~46 they were charging.  We complained to management, and they didn't want to hear it. They were rude.  Refills were slow. \n\nWe complained to hotel management, and wrote a letter.  About 6 weeks later all we get is a form letter saying they will talk to the buffet managers about it.  \n\nWe will try the buffet at the Encore, if they have one,  because in Vegas, the plan seems to be to start off high end, and get lots of hype.. then cut costs big time.  The Wynn cut costs big time alright, and we notice! \n\nWe now go to the Paris if we want a buffet.  The crepes are to DIE for... and the Paris has the best chocolate !!!!"

I love how they're already peeled for you, as I don't know how to peel my own. I'm a hugeee fan of shrimp, and probably filled most of my stomach eating way too many of them - they were delicious! I wasn't too impressed with the sushi though. Oh well, there were many other options to choose from.\n\nAll the meat dishes were excellent. Prime rib, brisket, short rib... they were all sooooo delicious! I can't really remember what else I had that night, but everything was really good!\n\nI had the gelato, cheesecake, and a bite of the creme brulee for dessert. \nGelato - pretty standard, tasted just like gelato served anywhere else.\nCheesecake - sooooo yummy, and it wasn't too rich!\nCreme brulee - soooo good!

S'As buffets go, not bad. $37 plus tax is pretty steep, but most dishes were well conceived and well prepared, variety was great, and much of the food could have actually stood alone as a dish at a non-buffet. This was a bit of a surprise to me. We ate on a Saturday night, and there was not enough staff to support the crowd, so I did come back to an empty plate more than once, and getting drink refills was impossible, even after asking. It gets knocked down a star just for that.\n\nThe braised duck salad was one of the highlights for me, and certainly my favorite salad selection. The "cups" of salads offered near the shellfish counter (I guess people go for the crab legs right off the bat, and can\'t be bothered to walk to the other end) were ok, but were too tough to eat out of the cup.\n\nThe four seviches offered was a nice touch, although the rock shrimp one was nothing special. The squid was nicely done, with strips of squid, cucumber, onion, and tomato all fitting the same form. I opted out of the four soups offered as somewhat standard fare (chicken noodle, clam chowder, red pepper bisque, and a fourth I can\'t remember), but the "white gazpacho", made from white grapes, parmesan, and some other stuff I could not identify, was one of the best things I ate all night.\n\nThe pumpkin gnocchi were of a very nice texture, to my pleasant surprise, and the sauce, while I felt it could use far more sage, was nice. The lamb osso bucco did not seem like it had been braised for long enough, and while the flavor was quite good, the meat was tough and very difficult to remove from the bone.\n\nThe item I was most excited about on my first walk through to look at everything was the rack of wild boar. Not so good. I got one chop from the end, which was pretty tough, and one from the middle, which was nicely cooked. The only flavors I picked up were wild boar, salt, and pepper; it would have benefited from a dry rub, marinade, or crust of some sort. The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and seemed better seasoned than the boar, but I would have rather enjoyed better wild game. \n\nThe tandoori chicken was well done, and there was nothing special about the fried chicken, but as I was trying to select sections of dark meat from the trays of each, I could not tell for the life of me what cuts I was pulling. They obviously do not butcher their chickens traditionally, and it looked like someone may have just stood at the chopping block waving a couple of cleavers and a bunch of chickens. This made eating around the bones a new and interesting affair, neither good nor bad.\n\nThe fish selections did not stand up to the quality of the rest of the buffet. I know it\'s hard to make fish en masse, but they could have done better. The tuna was actually not cooked totally through (a good thing), but the other three were just hammered.\n\nFor $40 a person, I would recommend finding somewhere else to sit down, unless you have your heart set on a buffet. Even for a few bucks more within the Wynn, you could do a lot better.'

S'So far, my favorite buffet in las vegas.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the buffet is "expensive" but you\'re getting quality, m\'dears!  Just fork up the extra 10.00 to experience a little more quality in the food.\n\n I missed the crab legs, but considering all the other foods were delicious and the shrimp I got was super fresh and tasty, I\'m SURE the crab legs were excellent.  I won\'t go into detail of what I got, but this buffet is HUGE.  two rooms for ONLY desserts which included home made gelato, and the buffet line is awesome.  Salad spread was excellent and so were the other entrees.  I know it might sound lame but the tastiest thing I had was their pizza! Super thin and perfect!  The hand cut bacon was bomb as well as the prime rib. \n\nI think they can work on their sushi and other seafood items, but other than that, it\'s still tasty.  I got here at a perfect time- just when brunch was ending and dinner stuff was coming out so I had the eggs, sausage and other breakfast items as well as the lunch/dinner items.\n\nSo far this review kind of sounds like a 4 or a 4.5 star, but what tipped the scales to a full 5 stars was the fact that they had congee (chinese rice porridge) with all the fixin\'s including 1,000 year old duck egg.  (I know, sounds gross it\'s def. an acquired taste).  Besides the food, everything was nice- seats made of what seems to be real ostrich skin, the silverware, the plates, everything was very clean, and the buffet tables were lined up straight so there was PLENTY of room to go from food item to food item without bumping into other people.'

S"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.\n\nThe line is uber long, but the wait is all worthwhile once you see and taste the food. It's like waiting in line at disneyland, the lines wove around and around. \n\nThe buffet is about 30 dollars but they have champagne brunch for 36 dollars as well. The champagne is good, they use Freixenet Champagne, which I like, and they also bring you orange juice for mimosas if you ask. The champagne is unlimited and we drank to our hearts content. \n\nThe food is gourmet from Asian sushi and soups to Italian rissoto and pastas. The thing I found most interesting is that all the food is gourmet, but they had congee with pork sung!! That is the ultimate Vietnamese porridge and we ate that because it was so cheap!! I had to try a bowl and it was delicious. \n\nI had mostly breakfast food, but I also meandered to the Italian section to try the lamb rissoto and it is the best risotto i have ever had. I think I had 3 bowls of it. \n\nThere is a whole dessert room that had different flavors of ice cream, eclairs, cupcakes, doughnuts, and cookies. You can get on a sugar high just being in this room. \n\nEven the coffee to sober up was good. I don't think I have anything bad to say about this buffet other than the lines, but it is understandable why is is so long now. \n\nThe is the BEST buffet ever."

S"Bordering near 3 stars.\n\nI had to wait like 6 years to finally eat at The Buffet at the Wynn!  And, wow, I ended up not being as enamored as I thought I would be.  I think I was spoiled a bit from other buffets.  Although maybe in their defense I didn't see the entire picture because we only went for lunch.  Maybe all the stops are pulled out for dinner?  I dunno.\n\nIt was a lovely afternoon with the wifey and after the HELL that is parking on any Strip property, we were on our way to The Buffet.  Line was already sort of long, we waited about 25 minutes before paying to go in.  After being seated, it was off to the races!  I was too excited to wait for a drink order.  \n\nWe approached the buffet line with a small crowd.  After the dust settled, what do I see?  A typical looking buffet?  Nah, can't be!  But overall, I was just not impressed!  What happened?  All the glowing reviews?  The heaps of praise?  I think my visit to Wynn's The Buffet came a bit too late, I really should have came when they first opened.  It just seemed so....average.\n\nThere were glimpses of good things at The Buffet, but that's all it was.  Many of the items available for lunch would probably be par for the course at other buffets in town.  Cheeseburger sliders?  Check.  But the ones at Golden Corral are just as good, if not actually bigger.  Rotisserie chicken?  Check.  Come on.  Costco's in my opinion is good too.  Pizza?  Check.  Need I go on?\n\nI tried to pick things that I wouldn't be able to enjoy at other eateries, or things not typically available on a buffet line.  But a lot of it seemed BLAH.  I did enjoy the small charcuterie section of The Buffet - a number of cured meats, nice cheeses, crackers and breadsticks for sampling.  The whole ground mustard was delicious.  But really, mustard?  One cannot get full on that alone.  If I was in a tapas place or something with a cold one, charcuterie would be ideal.\n\nTrying to make a plate was a bit of a challenge.  So many of the things were just TOO familiar.  I was expecting more.  The salad section was pretty but nothing stood out for me to try.  The congee section was a nice touch, and actually looked cool.  But the wifey loves congee in almost any form, and she said the one here at The Buffet was bland, not much taste by itself.  The condiments on top didn't really save it.  She said the congee at the Rio Carnival Buffet was better!\n\nI'm a little upset on Wynn's Asian section of the buffet.  So.  Damn.  Disappointing.  Mr. Wynn, you have one of the largest stakes of casino property in Macau...how can you ignore us Asians here in the states?  Your people should know that Asians visit the Wynn constantly!  Your Asian section is not up to standards!  So little choices, and bad ones at that!  Yes, that day at the buffet there were a TON of Asian folks eating, and yes, they all congregated at the Asian section.  The Asian sections of other top buffets in town are much larger, with better quality selections.  The dumplings?  Tasted store bought.  The hand rolls offered?  Soggy and too spicy.  The sushi?  Very, very mediocre.  It's like the person making them didn't know what they were doing or didn't care.  Rice was starting to dry out.  Why try making Hawaiian Poke if it's not made right?  The portion was miniscule in individual dishes, and the flavor profile was way off.  I should know, I'm from Hawaii!\n\nI had to stick with the other sections of the buffet to get something to eat.  There were a few gems, the meatloaf with the pearl onions being one of them.  Can you imagine that, meatloaf the highlight??  It blew my mind too.  But sadly, this is how it was for me.  I was expecting much better, and just didn't get that.\n\nI heard at the buffet at the Wynn they have their own dessert ROOM.  Ooh, an entire room!  But again, we were severely disappointed.  Where are the fancy desserts?  I saw the candy apples but I also saw some kid who looked like he was about to break a tooth on them.  So I skipped that.  The gelato wasn't anything special, we can now find that at the local Station Casino buffet.  A lot of desserts didn't look appetizing or worth the calories.  It really all looked like mini desserts brought in from another local bakery that supplies other restaurants.  Left the dessert ROOM very sad.\n\nThe service was downright lackluster.  Our server was only present at the beginning to take our drink order.  The entire meal we didn't get refills until near the end.  Totally irritating, especially since all we ordered was water and iced tea.\n\nFor the price of $25.99 for lunch I felt a bit ripped off.  Really, I think it's overpriced for what you are getting.  The lunch at the Bellagio buffet is less and I think offers better choices.  At Wynn you pay for the ambience more than anything because it is a nice space with lots of sunlight.  I'll visit again someday (maybe in another 6 years) but next time will consider dinner instead in hopes of there being a more varied food menu."

S'This place is amazing!  I have been on holidays and non-holidays and I think the holidays are much better overall.  But that is not to say that non-holidays are bad but it is excellent on holidays and above average on other days.  The pricing is rather high but it has quite a few amazing stations to choose from including the standards of beef, american, pasta, salads and deserts.  If you wanted a place to compare it to I would say that Bellagio is definitely the inspiration for this place. And they are definitely comparable.  The only downside to Wynn for me is consistency.  Again if you go on a holiday the pricing is quite high but the food quality is also much higher such as the pure prime rib that they provide during the holidays, and fresh crab legs, and other delights.  \n\nDefinitely recommended if you are in Vegas and looking for something that is Bellagio level of taste and quality.'

S'I expected so much more from Wynn.  We were invited by the Casino host Mr. Brando as we were about to cash out our chips.   We went for their infamous Champagne Brunch.  That Sunday was crowded but we didn\'t mind because the host said go straight to the VIP/Invited guest line, and tell them I sent you there and if theres a problem call my desk.  \n\nAs soon as we got to the front of the line, the rude cashier said to us go back to the end of the line bc you don\'t have a fast pass??  And before I could say anything she yelled out "NEXT!!!"\nI\n said to her,  "wait... call the casino host they\'ve invited us.  Here\'s our players club please look it up for our complimentary meal."  \n\nWhen we sat down, wasn\'t until 2 trips to the buffet line when our waitress finally came out and asked, "what would you like to drink???" \n\nWe\'ve both responded "Champagne brunch please..."  \n\nShe replied "You have to pay extra for that!"  \n\nAgain, I had to explain to her the Casino\'s host invited us if you have any problem just call the desk.  She didn\'t bother either instead just offer us water.  \n\nI must say the lack of customer service probably went down hill because it was overcrowded.  However, we\'re at the Wynn and not Circus Circus.  Obviously we didn\'t have problem paying $50/person meal when we were playing $500-$1000 hand probably the only reason why we were invited for complimentary meal.  Regardless, we\'ve been to plenty of fine establishments and we\'ve never been treated the way we did.  You would think at a 5-star resort place like this would have a superb customer service.  I guess I was too distracted by the pretty decor.\n\n**UPDATE:  Mr. Brando have been addressed with these issues and he\'s doing everything in his power to make-up for our bad experience.  He handled the issue very professional and we would definitely come back because of him.'

S'Definitely one of the best buffets in Las Vegas!  However, with this it is important to know it does not come cheap.  I dined here yesterday for brunch and several times over the last few years.  Sunday brunch starts at $31.95.    They have a great selection of food including: omelets, prime rib, french toast, pancakes, sausage, eggs, pizza, shrimp cocktail, sushi and the list goes on.  Everything they serve is fantastic and of quality.   I definitely think that the dinner buffet is better as they also include crab legs.  The desserts were just okay.  It can be hit or miss.  Lines are usually long.  If you are going here on a weekend expect long lines.  Thus, it is best to go early.  As for dinner, the lines are usually insane, so it is best to get there around 4-5pm to beat the crowd.  :)'

S'We had stopped by here on Christmas Eve only to find that the wait for the buffet was 4 hours. WTF??? So, we decided to come back on Christmas Day as soon as it opens and get in.\n\nChristmas morning, we arrived in line for the buffet at 11:07am (7 minutes after it opened) and there was a long line already. So what do we do? We get in line. I hate buffets. I hate waiting in line even more. However, it WAS Christmas and I did agree to hubby\'s request of wanting to eat here. He\'s been wanting to eat at the Wynn buffet the last few times we visited but I said no.\n\nSo there we were standing in line. Mind you, this isn\'t even the the line leading into the buffet. This was the line against the wall on the opposite side of the buffet. This is where you get a full view of all the people eating INSIDE in the dining room and all you can do is wait.\n\nThe line moves slowly. Luckily a friend was with us and so we were chatting. When the Wynn girls walked around passing out complimentary bottled water I was highly impressed and decided that the hotel was superb in customer service but still, the damn buffet better be mindblowingly good (yeah Frank K -- his suggestion for the Wynn buffet) to compensate for this waiting.\n\nBelieve it or not, but exactly 2 hours later we were at the front of the line, but not before forking over 50 bucks per person (lil guy was half price) tax included to go in for the "Christmas Feast".\n\nAfter we were seated, we made our way to the buffet. I was impressed by the lack of pushing and shoving along the buffet line. In fact, there just seemed to be very few people in the dining area. It then dawned on me that they make you wait because they didn\'t want their dining area to look and feel like a cafeteria which is essentially what a buffet is all about. This way, it still feels extremely civilized even though you\'re going through the lines like you do at a cafeteria and helping yourself to food.\n\nPROS: Peel and eat shrimps were already peeled and were large instead of the regular miniature sized ones you get at other buffets. The Alaskan King crab legs were fresh and not frozen. There was also smoked salmon, white anchovies, smoked trout and other smoked fish. Lobster/shrimp bisque was excellent.\n\nCONS: Although there was an abundance of meat such as lamb chops, the chops were overcooked and really dry. I was so disappointed that they ruined the lamb chops. The prime rib was rather good but again, I only like the end piece and it was really dry like jerky. The lamb shank was again over cooked.\n\nThere was also Chinese food including a few items of dim sum and roasted duck, Italian selections (which included thin crust pizza -- lackluster), a fish station with things such as halibut wrapped in bacon and a soup station. Like I said the bisque was fabulous but the french onion was way too salty. \n\nI think the Wynn uses really great ingredients to put their buffet together, but the execution of it was poor. They ruined great cuts of meat by overcooking and ruined the ceviches by bad marinades. For 50 bucks I had expected a lot more. The variety was very minimal as well for the 50 dollar price tag. I had expected a lot more variety especially since it was called a "Christmas Feast".  The regular dinner buffet is usually 10 dollar less but even so, if this was all they served I would say at 40 bucks a pop it was overpriced as well.\n\nThe desserts were hit and miss. The creme brulees were torched on site before placing on the shelves, but the creme itself was watery. The sorbet and gelato were also hit and miss in flavor depending on which one you got. I did enjoy the cheesecake and the sago (tapioca) pudding.\n\nTo have waited 2 hours for this meal garners it a mediocre rating at best. Not worth a 2 hour wait and definitely not worth its 50 dollar price tag.'

S"The ambiance was beautiful at The Buffet.  Unfortunately, you do not eat the ambiance.   The food here was simply terrible and the selection was very limited.  We went to the Buffet at 10 am and so we got to experience both their breakfast and lunch menu and it was very unimpressive.   \n\nSushi - was simply terrible.   The rice they used was no sushi rice and so it was very mushy.   And the scary thing was that some of its plates were dirty.  \n\nSeafood - it did not exist.  No crab legs, etc.  Menu was very limited.  \n\nGrill - only had one beef item and a turkey.  Both were dry as hell.  \n\nAsian - again, very little selection.  The best item was the siracha sauce.  The food was not good.  I tasted a few items and passed on the rest.\n\nItalian - they only had pizzas and a pasta item. Both could have been purchased in the frozen food section of Ralph's so there is no need to go to Vegas for that."

S"Okay, so the last buffet I went to was at the Mirage two or three years ago.  I've never been to the Bellagio buffet or the Spice Market at Planet Hollywood, and the Paris buffet is but a distant memory.  So for me, this is as good as it gets.\n\nThe moment I laid eyes on the beautiful, colorful, and slightly whimsical decor of the dining area, my mouth began to salivate in anticipation of good eats to come.  And when I finally reached the buffet, it was no disappointment.\n\nAll strategizing went out the window as I ran around like a fat kid in a candy store.  Seeing so many selections was sensory overload, and I became nearly dizzy with piggish happiness.\n\nFour kinds of ceviche, gourmet salads served in elegant glasses, chicken panang prepared as you like it, a bountiful heaping of preserved meats and cheeses, a generous selection of Indian cuisine, lamb prepared three of four different ways, rare prime rib and juicy plump sausage and tender veal, steamed Chinese pork buns and crispy wontons (no thanks), mounds of crab legs and a variety of smoked fish, pasta made to order (also no thanks)...and those were just the entrees.  When I saw the desserts...oy vey.  I almost cried with joy.\n\nNot everything was good (the scallop ceviche was a bit slimy, the red snapper a bit tough), but overall I was impressed.  I must have made four or five trips and gained five pounds that night.  But that's how I like to live--without regrets."

S"Vegas is all about doing it over-the-top. Partying, drinking, eating, gambling aka wasting money unless you're lucky for once, shopping, tanning, lying to strangers...as long as you're doing it over the top, then Sin City is your oyster. \n\nSo what better place to get brunch to nurse your hangover than an all-you-can-eat buffet? But wait. Not just any buffet. THE buffet to go is located at the Wynn. Here you can overindulge feeling classy all the while you are stuffing your gut with their huge assortment of food. Asian? Check. Mexican? Check. Italian? Check. American? Check. Unless you're a vegan with a wheat & nut allergy and a general hate for all things food, you'll find something here to please your palate. \n\nWhat's great about a buffet is that you can take a little bit of everything and then return for a larger portion of what you liked the best. Or keep trying things... By plate four (overflowing) I felt I hadn't even made a dent in the options available. There are fresh salads, soups, lots of meats, various egg dishes, a made-to-order omelet station, ham carving station, stir fry woks, pizzas, etc. etc. You'll discover something new with every trip to the food spreads. \n\nSecret tip: Be smart like us and get there around 10-10.30am. That way you can have all the breakfast options and then at 11am when they start serving lunch you can have a whole new buffet spread to choose from (and you only paid the brunch price). Pure indulgence. Food coma will ensue. Get the $10 bottomless champagne/mimosas to swish all that food down.\n\nLastly, a trip to the dessert display can never be avoided. This is my favorite part of any buffet. Who doesn't like little dessert concoctions served in shot glasses and mini pie slices on small plates? The Buffet at Wynn outdoes themselves every time on the desserts. Marshmallows on a stick dipped in white/milk/dark chocolate sprinkled with crunchy chopped nuts and rainbow sprinkles. Candied apples. Ice cream. Pastries. Fruit tartlets. Cakes. Pies. Mousses. Cookies. Eclairs. Beignets. *SIGH* everything a sweet tooth could ever want is waiting right here for you. My favorites were the rocky road cake and the mint mojito pie."

Also most of the food items do not change from day to day.This buffett no longer offers lamb chops on fridays,it also no longer has ice cream,but gellano  that just doesn't have the rich taste that the ice cream had. Recently the drinks come in smaller glasses and the soup bowls are maybe 1/3 the size that they once were.OK you can order say two glasses of milk and get two bowls of soup. They have also recently raised the price. I know people at the Wynn so I can pick up a comp once or twice a week so I shouldn't complain,but it seems like this buffett is going in the wrong direction.This is also a very expensive buffett around $36. now how can anyone eat that much to say its a good deal?

The shrimp and the seafood were ok, I have had just as good at cheaper buffets. The potstickers were very good and made a couple of trips back for those. The desserts looked great but tasted average. The cheesecake probably was the hottest food I had there. I will say the wait staff hustled their butts off and didn't let a drink get close to half empty. What did I pay for this experiance? 40 bucks plus tax. For the quality of the food for the price I paid it was not worth it at all and probably would say the same thing if it was half the price.

S'This review is based on the buffet lunch on 7/1/2009 at about 12:45 PM.  The food there could have been better overall.  The sushi was barely something memorable or more likely something one would like to forget entirely because of how mushy the rice was.  The smoked salmon was ok, but tasted way better elsewhere.  The chicken tandori was a pretty bad imitation of Indian food gone bad, since the flavor of the tandori yogurt never got past the skin of the chicken at all.  The roast beef was not as good as the lunch buffet Rio at this hour since the taste was as bland as the chicken tandori.  The beef brisket sliders composed mostly of fat with a overly oily piece of onion ring that hints at the awful tasted disguised in elegant preparation.  The BBQ Roast pork bun was a sorry excuse for Chinese cuisine because of how dry the inside of the bun was.  But the buffet did have its highlights.  The Raspberry Mango pudding was good and presentation was very good,  the tapioca mango lychee pudding was also great like a 5 start taste and preparation.  The Madelines were also fluffy and perfect.  The Eggs Benedict was medium to better then average, but local dinners would have fresher tasting Eggs Benedict with the yolk more fluid instead of already solid.  Overall if you can avoid the buffet for lunch time it would be a good idea.  For the price, it is not worth you money.  Bring your business somewhere else like the Mirage.  if anybody has had a dinner experience at this buffet please post the menu items and the highlights as well as what to avoid.  Thanks.'

It kicks sit-down restaurants like Bottero's and Wazuzu's butt by far.\n\nSome fav's over Thanksgiving weekend:\n- Butternut squash risotto\n- pumpkin ravioli\n- Oysters Rockefeller\n- crab legs\n- pumpkin pie\n\n\nThe crepe line was way too long, as was the wait too be seated, but otherwise, this place is still tops on my L.V. list.  I wish the server would clear out plates faster, but what could you do when they are packed?"

S"We decided to try a new buffet on this trip and settled on the Wynn. When we got there, we realized it was $34.95 for dinner. That's a lot for someone who just had McDonald's that morning and Pizza Hut last night. However, it was the end of a pretty long day and the line wasn't that long at 6:30pm on a Tuesday, so we figured we'd go for it.\n\nIt probably took 15 minutes or so to get seated. It wasn't that crowded and we were joking that they probably made people wait because it's a mandatory part of the buffet experience, but we realized that they didn't have too many staff members on hand to serve drinks and clean tables and whatnot. When we started piling up empty dishes, they stayed there on our table for quite a while. I expected better service for what the dinner cost.\n\nThe food was good, and there was a wide selection. I knew that I couldn't have everything, so I skipped things such as mashed potatoes and corn on the cob - why would you go to such an expensive buffet to eat those? I picked out more unusual and exotic selections such as octopus ceviche, veal, lamb T-bone, rabbit pasta, sushi (ok, couldn't resist), and pierogies. Oh, and of course the king crab legs, shrimp cocktail, and prime rib. I'm still pretty stuffed, so I'll just say that everything was pretty good.\n\nAfter taking a brief break, we headed to the dessert section. They're pretty interesting, with some even served in shot glass-like cups. I had a delicious tiramisu that way. I really enjoyed the chocolate/banana dessert and would've gone for seconds if I had more stomach room. The mint chocolate mousse was really interesting - it made me want to put down my toothbrush, spit out the contents of my mouth, and gargle some water. Yes, it tasted exactly like toothpaste.\n\nI wanted to try the ice cream (gelato?) at the end, but it was getting late and I preferred to visit the crepe station instead. The strawberry filling was popular, but I skipped it because it didn't look like much. It's probably still delicious I guess. I enjoyed the blueberry that I asked for, but I left the apricot on my plate because it tasted somewhat artificial and had an odd texture.\n\nSo how did I enjoy the meal overall? For the price of $34.95, it was pretty good. I don't go to Vegas everyday, after all. However, the service was somewhat lacking, and my financial sensibilities were offended.  I'll probably opt for something more inexpensive next time I visit Vegas."

S"*This is on my MUST-TRY list for Vegas*\n\nHands down the best buffet I've ever had in Vegas.\n\nIf you like king crab legs, then you're definitely in the right place.  I think they're the only buffet in Vegas (correct me if I'm wrong) that does not salt their crab legs.  Most places salt them to preserve them, which tells me that The Buffet's seafood is relatively fresh.  It's always really sweet and juicy.. yum! \n\nI'm sure they have whatever you like, and it's always cooked to perfection.  My personal favorites?  Crab legs.. duh..and the braised veal :)  YUMMY!!\n\nAnother thing I look forward to when I come to The Buffet..... DESSERTS!!!!  CREME BRULEEEEEEEEEE!  The tiramisu is also amazing.. and they have gelato too!  There's always a huge assortment.. it's always so hard to choose without feeling extremely guilty.\n\nA couple of downers:\n-On special holiday weekends, they totally jack up the prices.  The prices vary from day to day, but expect to pay around $30-40.    \n-There's almost always a line... and it's a long line too :(\n\nBut, the pros overshadow the cons.. so I still love it!\n\nTip: Get inside by 2:30 or 3pm.  You're paying for brunch/lunch, but just sit around for a bit until 3:30pm and you get dinner too!   \n\nHappy eating!"

S"I've had the Wynn Buffet several times, and it's one of the better buffets in Vegas.\n\nMost recently, I had the Wynn Buffet during me and Hubby's Las Vegas New Year's/Anniversary trip. We had the special NYE buffet, which included steamed LOBSTER!\n\nHubby and I proceeded to devour plate after plate of steamed lobster, king crab legs, and cocktail shrimp.\n\nI have to say, it was the best buffet experience I've had in Vegas. And Hubby agrees. Another bonus was that we didn't even have to wait in line at all, which almost never happens at the good buffets in Vegas.\n\nNeedless to say, we both had massive food coma and had to go up to the room to digest (him) and pass out for an hour (me). I did wake up in time to watch Jersey Shore and see Snooki get punched in the face, and eventually I was able to crawl out of bed to watch the fireworks, but the food coma ensured that watching fireworks was all that we had the energy to do for NYE.\n\nAdvice: Just because it's a buffet, even if they have steamed lobster, doesn't mean you have to stuff yourself until you blow up."

S"We came here after a long day at the trade show floor and were starving! So the idea of a dinner buffet obviously got our team excited. We called ahead of time to see if there was a long line which they said there wasn't and by the time we got there (I swear 5 mins later), there was a huge line! Do not trust the staff at these restaurants in Vegas when you ask about wait time - it's never right!! Always assume a wait or make reservations ahead of time.\n\nThe manager there was very accommodating as we were a large group and people were coming in and out at different times. Selection of food was good but the servers took forever to clear our plates so we would come back to our table with stacks of uncleared plates. Regardless, we were so hungry that everything tasted amazing. We felt like savages and despite sitting by the entrance where everyone can see us like zoo animals, we just didn't care."

Things I really looked for in a fancy breakfast buffet are a smoked fish station for my bagel. The Wynn did not disappoint. I also tried the bellagio buffet. I would say they were about even. They both had things I liked and things I thought could have used some work. Considering the Bellagio buffet is almost $10 cheaper for breakfast I would have to say that's a better bet, but you really can't go wrong with either."

S"In one word: meh. I haven't done the whole Vegas buffet thing, so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I keep hearing that the Wynn Buffet is the best. If this is the best, I'm afraid of what else is out there. The food was ok but not that good, and definitely not amazing. I did go to the lunch so there were no crab legs, etc., so maybe dinner is a whole other story. Maybe. But I think large buffets just tend to skimp a little on quality in favor of quantity regardless of when you eat.\n\nIf I hadn't won 2 free buffets I don't think I would have been happy paying the $22 + tax per person for lunch. What does make it worthwhile (if you love desserts) is the variety of good dessert selections.  Additionally, beverages are included, and if you get there early enough they will have fresh squeezed orange juice.\n\nThe Wynn buffet is probably the largest I've been too, but after circling the buffet twice, I only found a handful of items that looked appetizing enough to put on my plate. Of the things I ate:\n\nDECENT: Manhattan clam chowder, squid ceviche, mashed potatoes, grilled corn, salads, fresh fruit\n\nJUST OK: BBQ ribs, fried chicken--a little too sweet, cha siu bao (chinese pork buns), shu mai (dumplings)\n\nBAD: pasta--white sauce & cheesy kinds, white rice from the asian section\n\nAs for desserts, they all looked good. There are no dessert tasting restaurants where I live, so I love having the opportunity to try different sweets in one sitting. Overall, the desserts did not disappoint. \n\nBEST: caramel eclair\n\nGOOD: cheesecake, banana chocolate cake, madeleine\n\nOK: ice cream--a little eggy, carrot cake\n\nBAD: mini cupcakes--oily, not very flavorful, too much frosting\n\nEven though I enjoyed the desserts I don't think I'll be returning to the buffet. I think I would rather pay a little more and go to a restaurant where I know I'll get a good meal.\n\nFor info on skipping the line and free buffets via the Wynn Player's card (The Red Card) check out my review of the Wynn:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/wynn-las-vegas-las-vegas#hrid:B9ZZ0mwHbb8nD4EgsDl-Kg"

The only thing I didn't like was the sushi, and it was actually pretty crappy... but all the other flavors were incredible. My stomach didn't hurt at the end of my meal at the Wynn, unlike the Bellagio and MGM Grand, because the portions and presentation were all so perfect that it was easy to savor everything slowly.

S"So I literally just finished having dinner here today Sunday 11/24/13. It was $38.99 a person... So for two with tax = $85 (not worth it). First of all, I didn't experience a line wait at all! But then maybe because it just is not with the wait! After being seated, service was great and so was the decor. The food on the other hand was completely mediocre. They had a chilled seafood station that had sushi, cocktail shrimp and crab legs (but I like crab legs warm-not cold. **side note-Caesars buffet has both!- Anyways, on the the Asian station. Nothing great there. The next station with the meats is OK. My husband enjoyed the prime rib, but he's had better. And the there was a Mexican grill station that had tamales and potatoes. The seafood section was really disappointing. It had 3-4 mini options of fish... But missing the GOOD fish. Options were Mako, snapper, and salmon. For the price I would have expected quality like sea bass, Mahi- mahi etc. and it did not taste great either. Pizza station was unoriginal which every other buffet has. And the Italian station had someone available to make pasta customized. Didn't eat the Italian section tho. I figure Italian food/ pasta is relatively cheap to make do I would prefer to get my money's worth. The dessert has it's own room but highly lacks in quality. I literally liked on item in addition to the ice cream, which is pretty horrible because I'm a dessert fanatic. I only only likes the warmed brownie with ice cream. They have a gelato station with about 5 flavors. *side note - wicked spoon, aria buffet and Caesars buffet have more ice cream options.- the rest of the desserts did not taste good at all. Very average and below. I thought when I tried this buffet 5 years ago & did not like it that it was me because I tried lunch and should have tried dinner. Clearly, it's not me."

S'A solid choice buffet, quite good overall with very nice ambiance. Fair amount of variety, some items were really good some were so-so (as is normal in a buffet). In our minds, the flank-steak, pork, mashed potatoes, pulled pork with close slaw, mini-cup cakes and gelato stood out as quite good, with the flank steak, acc\'d to my husband, being really good. The pizza was so-so and the cheese cakes weren\'t to our liking (tasted a bit artificial and processed). The selection is large but not very much so.The seating environment is very nice (no casino view or sounds intruding here - as is standard in a modern Vegas resort) with an elegant decor, color palette, and plush, large chairs. A problem with the garden area is that the sun can hit at a quite uncomfortable angle (although we were impressed by the 19th century-style garden-room decor) and I  had to put my bag on the floor because it was a "fire hazard" to have a third chair with my and my husband\'s bags on it - I don\'t fancy having my bag on the floor with germs (which are there even if the carpet is spotless as it was here). In sum, very nice decor and ambiance and good food with a few opportunities for improvement.'

S"Went here for the weekend buffet dinner.  75% of my dinner consisted of me piling plate after plate of Alaskan Opilio Crab Legs.  It was great that the legs ware already split in half so it made scooping out the yummy crab meat quick and easy, dab it in a little butter and I pigged out.  I think I ate about 60 legs (give or take 10).  I also enjoyed the pea risotto which was delicious.  Other bits and pieces I got were the lamb t-bone, shrimp cocktail, salad shooters (thai, mediterranean, caprese).  The dessert selection was great as well - I really enjoyed the gelato selection they had.  I recall getting vanilla bean, white espresso, mint cheap, and chocolate fudge.\n\nPlus here's a hint, on Saturday night I got there at 6pm and my total wait until being seated was no more than 30 minutes :D"

S"Of all of the businesses that I've reviewed, I don't know if I've written one that has already been written about as much as The Buffet at the Wynn.  It seems like someone has something to say about this place practically every day, but that just goes to show how popular it truly is.  Hence, it gives me great pleasure to be reviewer #200. \n\nAn even greater pleasure however, is dining here during dinner.  Out of all the mega buffets that are in Vegas, very few compare to this massive upscale establishment.  With food from all around the world and various culinary wonders for tourists and locals alike, its hard to simply just pick one and go on.  The variety is obviously impressive, but the taste has always been my number one indicator for if I'm going to be back or not and I must note how good it is here.  \n\nFor those who are experienced in the world of casino buffets, this place is like a souped up Rio (Around The World) buffet, while trying to be on par with the Bellagio classy presentation.  It certainly is on par, but I would still give the Bellagio the upper nod for now.  It is a spendy joint but one that should be experienced at least once while indulging one's self in Vegas."

First of all, it looks so fancy shmancy inside! And they have a huge selection of different types of food! Seafood, sushi, lamb, and a ton of other stuff! I especially loved the dessert section, where they make fresh crepes for you! That was easily my favorite part. All you can eat customized crepes? I would have ordered more, but my tummy could only handle one.\n\nThe food is of great quality, and everything I tried was delicious! My favorite "combo" was lamb, mashed potatoes, and asparagus (it was some pretty damn good asparagus--I\'ve included a photo of this yummy combo).\n\nThe best buffet I\'ve ever tried! And honestly, what justified the 5 star review for me was their desserts! The crepe I ordered was super delicious, and their creme brulee was good too (and I love creme brulee... I might have eaten a bit too much of it)!\n\nWhen you come to Vegas, you have to eat at a buffet (for the full Vegas experience!), so you definitely can\'t go wrong with the buffet at Wynn!'

There is just about something from every type of ethnic food possible. There's even Korean! Sushi, shellfish, prime rib, slab bacon, seared salmon and snapper were just a few of the proteins that they were serving that morning. Everything was tasty, and not your typical quantity over quality buffet-type food. The dessert selection, particularly, was amazing.

As expected, the food was pretty diverse (American, Asian, Mexican, Pizza, fruits/salad, seafood) and there was the usual butcher station, but I was really impressed that they had congee.  I mean, it wasn't great congee, but it was still decent enough for a buffet.  My favorites were the eggs benedict and the prime rib though.  A little heavy to eat that much meat to start the day off, but it was delicious.\n\nMy friends seemed to think the desserts were pretty good, and I've seen a number of reviews mention that the creme brulee is something to try, but I can't say for sure myself (I was too full for dessert).

S'I might be a tad bit harsh, but in comparison to other buffets I\'ve had in Vegas, this deserves a 2 stars in my book. Located at the fancy shmancy Wynn, we\'ve heard great things about this buffet being the freshest, the best, in Las Vegas and we were beyond excited to try it out. \n\nThe unpleasant surprise we received when arriving at The Buffet drowned our mood the entire time. And that surprise was that men cannot wear sleeveless tops. Since its the Wynn, I suppose the owner wanted a more fancy and elegant type dining to match the Wynn\'s reputation, but let\'s be real, its a buffet in Vegas. And its hot during peak tourist time (spring/summer/fall), so men are bound to wear sleeveless tops. Anyways, we thought it was a dumb rule for a buffet, but we opted in buying a $12 tshirt for my boyfriend since he had a Jersey on and our hotel was too far of a walk to grab a shirt, and we really wanted to try out the buffet. The tshirt was a plain gray shirt with the logo Wynn on it. We thought it was a tad bit sexist since lots of ladies, including myself, were wearing revealing dresses, short shorts, crop tops revealing their bellies, etc. Sucks to be men in Vegas, I guess.\n\nThe foods were definitely fresh. The layout of the buffet was clean, elegant, and even though the mirrors made me lost at times when I was wandering, I enjoyed the atmosphere. I decided to spend the extra $13 (I think) on bottomless mimosas. The server refilled my mimosas almost every 5 minutes which I am grateful for. \n\nHowever, since its a buffet, the foods do stay out for quite awhile, especially unpopular items. I had the salami/prosciutto which tasted like it\'s been sitting out for hours. The spicy salmon roll were okay, Bellagio $20 buffet definitely tasted better in that aspect. The variety of the foods were quite disappointing, I didn\'t get that much items on my plate. They had rice porridge Chinese style, but thats dirt cheap to make. I expected better foods to be out. Plain veggies in containers to make it look fancy. The dessert section was okay, I liked how they had gelato. However Wicked Spoon\'s dessert trumped that in the dessert section. The fish were fresh, but I wasn\'t fond of the flavors/sauces it came with. One fish dish had cranberry on it. \n\nOverall, we had high hopes and were disappointed in the end. It\'s worth a try, just make sure to dress appropriate. It was $33 for a Sunday lunch without bottomless mimosas.\n\nI need to make one last comment: THERE ARE NO CRAB LEGS. You would at least expect the "Wynn" buffet to have crab legs, especially paying for a costly fee. No oysters. Just cold shrimps. My heart dropped. Should\'ve gone back to Bellagio\'s for $20.'

S"hello this buffet was just okay the crab legs were split and cold but really good i loved them. other then that the food was good just nothing to brag about the salad bar was small, they had a different types of food areas but not much for the culture to choose from. the set up was weird, it was clean and beautiful place to eat, I like all of it, but just for the price you pay you don't have a lot to choose from"

S"The reviews say it all...but what I love is how beautiful this buffet is.  Come, and be surprised! Rest easy that the food and the environs are stunning, not just for a buffet, but for....anything.  The entrance feels like you are taking the VIP route to a royal wedding!  The service is stunning, I'm so appreciative of how hard the kids work at this destination, it so obvious they care, and that says a lot.   It's a great place for a special occasion EVEN (yeah, a buffet).    \n\n There's bargains out there for the Wynn buffet, but it's more than a value no matter what your price point ends up being. Obviously if you are a newbie to the Wynn property you should get the Players card, 2 for 1 at the best buffet works out to $8.50 a person, if that's not the best food bargain in Vegas, er anywhere, name it.  Steal. \n\nHighly Recommended.\n\nCasual dress, but socks and shoes a must."

S"Not my favorite buffet but my experience here was great! We waited in line for about 30 mins to get a table. We were welcomed with such a beautiful sight in their atrium area. It was bright, colorful, and beautifully decorated. The receptionist seated us there but because it was by the entrance where all the people in line can watch you eat, we asked for a different table inside. They were very accomodating and had us moved right away. \n\nFood selection was not overwhelming. It was just enough to really enjoy what was good. My favorites are the carving station which had prime rib and a slab of bacon, their orecchiette pasta with pesto and pine nuts, maple fried chicken that went well with their bacon waffles, congee station, and the shrimp cocktail. \n\nAround 3pm, they closed the pancake station so I was disappointed I didn't get the chance to try their blueberry corn pancake. But lo and behold, they started changing the dishes for the dinner buffet!! Roasted leg of lamb and turkey was added on to the carving station, pancake station converted to pasta station, the seafood selection widened with the addition of ahi poke salad, fresh oysters and KIng crab legs, while in their dessert area, they opened up a crepe station! For $35, I think it was well worth it! \n\nShoutout to our server who was ever so efficient in getting and refilling our beverages and taking our dirty plates away. I wish I had gotten his name. But God bless you! \n\nTip: Steer clear from their sushi and hot asian dishes. Not impressive at all. Save space for the other better dishes on the buffet."

S"I can not go to Vegas without having a buffet and this time around is not any different. This time though, we decided to try the buffet at the Wynn. We stayed at NY NY and walked all the way to the Wynn. That is true dedication if you ask me. Our plan was to get there right before dinner to pay the lunch price and we made it with 5 mins to spare (whew!). I am so glad we paid the lunch price ($~22 weekday) rather the dinner price ($~35 weekday) because this buffet is not worth the high price for dinner. \n\nThe food was okay and I think the only change from the lunch menu and the dinner menu was just the king crab legs. I was hoping to get a wide variety of selection but to my disappointment, most of the things there;  I can make at home. Even the desserts didn't wow me and I am such a dessert lover.\n\nThere is definitely no privacy when you eat because they have the tables arrange so close together. I heard everyone conversation and ended joining a few; vice-versa. The servers were very attentive and nice."

S'This by far is my favorite Vegas buffet.  They have everything that I love to sample, and everything that I love to indulge on.  I have been here a few times and I am never disappointed.  This is my buffet of choice whenever I am in town.\n\nMy first visit I came here for dinner with my boss, yes it\'s a little pricey, but totally worth it.  My favorite item that visit was the creamed button mushrooms.  OMG these were awesome!!  Sadly I have returned and have not seen them since.\n\nMy second visit here I brought my friend that lives in Vegas.  Can you believe that, me bringing her!  Most locals don\'t venture out onto the strip very often, which is a shame, they miss out on some pretty good eats that way.  We were here forever!  We stayed so long that when we got up to cruise the buffet again the waitress told us "Thank you, have a good evening"  We both laughed and told her that we weren\'t leaving yet and we would be right back.  \n\nI came again on my b-day weekend.  Yes, the whole weekend was devoted to me, not just one day!  Of course I chose this buffet to come to since this trip was all about me.  One of my friends didn\'t think it was worth the price, but I think that\'s because she doesn\'t have good taste like me.  To her the best buffet is at the Rio, which to me that is like eating at Home Town Buffet.  Oh well, I got my way, so there!  \n\nWe piled our plates up with king crab legs and shrimp, and made to order pastas.  The desert bar is the best in any buffet that I have been to.  They have handmade ice creams, which are super yummy, especially the coconut flavor.  Creme brulees, which are my fav, I can sit there and just eat that the whole time I\'m there if you let me.  Candy apples, crepes, cookies, cakes, tarts, all super delicious.\n\nIf you don\'t mind spending a little more and getting great food, this is a definite stop while in Vegas.  You won\'t be disappointed!'

S"At $38 on weekends, not quite worth it, but not that far off. A decent proportion of diners were returning to their tables with huge piles of Alaskan crab legs, and with good reason. The rest of the seafood was also excellent, particularly the jumbo shrimp. Red meats were pretty good: I liked the prime rib a lot, though others thought it too rare and/or fatty, preferring the lamb dishes (rack and leg). I thought the salads were better than the cooked vegetables. Desserts were poor: I found only the ice cream to be passable.\n\nBest strategy might just be to grab what's been freshly cut."

CRAB LEGS!!!! unlimited crab legs that are already split open so theres NO work involved and all you gotta do is dip it in that BUTTER. SO DELICIOUS!!!\n\nservice was kinda ehh. i had crab legs and dirty plates all over the table and the waitress totally forgot about us. we had to get a new waitress who was more attentive. \n\nafter your gluttonous meal, go gamble in hopes of winning back that ridiculous price of a meal...'

S"They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Not this review about the Wynn buffet though. The people need to know how amazing this place is!\n\nBy far one of the best buffets I have ever been to! You pay about $44 during dinner hours for an AYCE GOURMET buffet. None of that quantity over quality stuff.  It's all quality here at the Wynn in Las Vegas. If that isn't enough to convince you to give it try, they say you have a 2 hour time limit. However, that is only if they are packed with people. If there is enough seating then stay as long as dinner permits (3pm-10pm actually) or until they kick you out.\n\nIn general anything you get here will taste above average; however, that may be an understatement, it is gourmet food after all. I feasted on endless amounts of crab, shrimp, prime rib, rib eye, lamb, and sorbet. YUM! The meats were cooked medium but you can ask for it differently and boy were they juicy. The seafood was awesome, and the sorbet was amazing as well.\n\nOverall: the service was friendly, the decorations look like you're in Wonder Land, and the food was amazing. It was well worth my $44, and I will definitely make another trip here the next time I'm in Las Vegas."

S"I'm sorry, I'm over buffets. Even this one doesn't impress me anymore and it's become a waste of money. When I was younger, I could eat and eat and eat but on this last trip to The Buffet, not that much looked appetizing to me. This most recent trip was for Sunday Brunch (~$35 after tax/tip.) Not sure if there is a kids price but there is no seniors price haha.\n\n- 70 minute wait (we got there around 10:40am and the line wasn't even out the normal buffet area yet; when we left at 1:30 it wrapped around the corner for who knows how long)\n- you could pay $15 per person to by pass the line, ha\n+ $5 more gets you unlimited bubbly\n+ great servers and friendly staff (very attentive with clearing plates and bringing drinks)\n- what's up with changing out the breakfast items at 1:30pm? did the price change?! I heard breakfast was only $20 hmm\n- the quality seems to go down each time I come here (ie., the crab legs were previously frozen and old; the prime rib was cooked medium and dry; the crepe was premade and cold)\n+ the ice cream/sorbet is always good and I like that they change out the flavors (ie., egg nog was delicious)\n- this is not about brunch but when we came to the dinner buffet last year people got sick, very sick (cough cough)"

S"I have to say that the Wynn buffet did impress me.  The different assortment of higher quality food (for a buffet) was excellent.  However, I was conflicted with giving it 3 stars because of the service.  It took a long time for my girlfriend and I to get a glass of water.  Then afterwards, they forgot about our refills even though we repeatedly asked.  Busy or not, this shouldn't be tolerated.  Also there was a gnat in my girlfriend's food.  This could have been from the floral arrangements located around the buffet.  They did give us a free glass of champagne for that, however, the service was still abysmal.  \n\nIf you can put the service aside though, the food was great, the desserts were average with ice creams, cakes, and other goodies you would find at a buffet.  If you want to try items such as lamb, rabbit pasta, and other entrees you wouldn't usually find at other buffets, then try this out."

S"I have eaten here twice.  Once for breakfast soon after they opened.  I remember that it was awesome.  Most recent experience was a few days ago for their lunch buffet.  I found it a little disappointing.  As for the intel on going right before they switch over to dinner items at 3:30, it is dead on....meaning that you can pay for lunch at 3:15 and eat dinner when they switch out.  Now, there is actually an even better reason for doing this other than saving at least $10.  The reason to execute this strategy is because now you have hot food arriving and also, much more seafood to choose from, including large shrimp cocktail and king crab legs.  \n\nSo why was I disappointed?  Well, we arrived at 2:30 pretty starving.  I had to pace myself to try and make it to 3:30 just to test if there was really no difference between lunch and dinner as many reviewers say.  I finally made it to 3:30 to see that the selection was much better at dinner.  Unfortunately my stomach didn't allow me to sample the new variety.  Standouts on the buffet for me:  kobe beef sliders,  kalbi steak, skirt steak and primerib and the jumbo shrimp cocktail which I managed to get at 3:30!"

Desserts... if you have the room, go for it.  They're all good!\nI think the only thing that's not worth picking up is the pizza.  Skip that, you can get better pizza at little caesars.

On top of that, the automatic 18% gratuity charged on groups of 7+ made it $40 each, more than Bellagio and Paris. By comparison, Paris' dishes are more unique and tastier. The Bellagio's desserts blow this and any other place away. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here when I can go to the Bellagio or Paris for better buffets at a cheaper price, unless you're staying at the Wynn of course, in which case you don't care about the price."

S"Must come back! It was my first time for my boyfriend and I and we agreed that it is the best buffet we have ever dined in Vegas. Sure the price is higher than many other places, but you get what you paid for. The place itself was beautiful, very simple and elegant. It felt like I was in some sort of a tea party environment. The clam chowder soup was delicious, it tasted was it was freshly made. Lots of varieties from different ethnicity such as American, Italian, and Asian food. For Italian food, there's pasta entrees and Asian food had shrimp dumplings (dim sum) and sushi with raw smoked salmon. American food had prime rib, corn on the cob, potatoes, etc. My boyfriend had the best prime rib from here because it was rare just how he liked it. We're both seafood lovers, so we had a generous amount of crab legs and it was sliced in half so no need to worry about cracking the shells. It was also warm so it was just about right to enjoy the crab. The dessert section was something I couldn't end my dinner without. They had marshmallow lollipops (marshmallow dipped in white or chocolate with sprinkles on top) which I thought it was pretty cute and creative for a simple dessert. There were a lots of cupcakes, cakes, and gelato! If only my stomach could devoured it all, I would if I could. The mini red velvet cupcake really caught my eye since it was sprinkled with glitter and I had to get it! I loved it, the frosting itself tasted fresh with real ingredients of a cream cheese frosting. Must eat the crepes, I fell in love with their crepes. It was freshly made from batter with fresh fruits! I had my crepe with fresh strawberries, whip cream, and a bit of chocolate drizzles on the outside. We enjoyed it so much that we're likely to come back and dine here, only if it happens to be on a weekday with no wait :)"

I've also tried the Mirage's buffet (delicious, a close runner up) and the buffet at Paris (very good, but food preparation could be better).  But the buffet at the Wynn sets the standard.  \n\nFirst, it's a bit pricey (I paid $42 for dinner on Saturday).  Lunch on weekdays is around $24, more like it.  The buffet is enormous.  Probably something like the size of a football field.  There are so many different types of food, you really don't know where to start.  Oh, and the food has been well prepared, but trained chefs who know how to create delicious meals.  I think the desserts are on par with some of the finest restaurants in town.

S"I'd give it two stars if it wasn't for the fact that we had our meals comped due to points racked up on the slot machines.  The entry into the place is horrible.  After meandering around a roped line, you have to pay at one of four open registers.  Problem is that there are two on each side, so if you go to the one closest to the part of the line you are standing at, someone else goes to the one beyond yours and potentially ends up in line to enter the restaurant before you.  \n\nIt's so disorganized just to get through the cashier line and is so congested with people that by the time you are seated, it feels like you've already been through an adventure.  \n\nThe food was ok, not worth whatever it would have cost to pay full price.

"don\'t touch!!"  "wait til i\'m done!!"  "i\'m not finished yet!!"  haha.  poor people...they\'ve probably never felt so intimidated at a buffet...anyhoo, she set up a whole bread basket full of nice looking rolls, baguettes, etc...and the meats looked wonderful...the cheeses were even more appealing!  but when i took it back to the table...most of it was super dry...and old...like they sliced everything a week ago.  the bread was decent though...and all the smoked fishes were pretty ok.  once again...nothing was really memorable!\n\nthe assortment of desserts was a lot smaller than what i\'ve seen at the other buffets i\'ve been to...but this buffet had rice pudding which i absolutely love...so bonus to them for that.  typical gelato, tiramisu, creme brulee...\n\ni really wanted to like this place.  so...i\'m considering giving this place a 2nd try...but this time, i\'d go for dinner.  the food looked too beautiful to pass by...but the flavor was so forgettable.'

S"Funny story about this place... as discerning yelpers know, it's a bit off the strip, somewhat near the convention center, in a run down strip mall; don't let that steer you away, though.  When we got dropped off around 1:30 for a late lunch, the cabbie advised us to just have the restaurant call for a cab when we were done.  \n\nThinking nothing of it, I approached the counter and asked them to call for a cab when our bill came.  We were told there was a cabbie strike in progress in vegas, and the wait times could be 30-60 minutes.  So, we went outside, and sure enough, ended up waiting 30-40 minutes, and still no cab.\n\nSince we had eaten a late lunch, so the restaurant had closed to prepare for the dinner rush at this point, and out trots Saipin Chutima, along with her son and daughter.  We were standing with another couple who had been waiting nearly as long as we were, and all four of us recognized the owner and head chef from her appearance in the most recent season of Top Chef Masters.  They walked over to a pair of cars, and pulled them around in front of the restaurant.\n\nSaipin's daughter Pennapa introduced herself, and apologized for the lengthy delay of our cabs.  They then proceeded to offer us rides to the Las Vegas Hilton, which is the closest major resort to the shop, so that we could arrange quick transport to our final destinations, rather than wait here with uncertainty.  Needless to say, we all accepted.\n\nThe other couple went off with Saipin's son, while my wife and I got to ride with Saipin and her daughter, who drove.  They were both extremely pleasant, with Pennapa making small talk about our trip and lamenting the service they've been getting from the cabbies due to the strike.  They asked about our meal, and what we had liked and disliked.\n\nOnce we got dropped off at LVH, we waved goodbye, and stood next to the same couple again laughing and wondering what had just happened.  Say what you will about the location and decor of Lotus of Siam; you will never in your life find better service than what we received there.  \n\nOh, right.  The food.  That's easy... simply the best Thai I have ever eaten.  No question.\n\nWe had Nam Prik Ong, which I had never had before, but will now actively search for.  Amazing, amazing, amazing.  Sticky rice is a must with this dish.  We also had an order of drunken noodles with soft shell crab.  My wife and I agreed that it was the best we'd ever had.  Of course, we also had some Pad Thai.  Also the best we've ever eaten.\n\nGive this place your patronage at all costs; you will not be disappointed."

S'Holy crap, that was a meal. The nam kao tod alone is worth five stars. Super crispy rice, but also super tangy. I had the soft shell crab over drunken noodles, it was good but not life-changing. My mother-in-law had the mussel fried omelette, crispy and amazing. My wife had the Thai spaghetti, it was fine. My father-in-law had a beef dish over noodles that was amazingly tender and also tasty. Mango and sticky rice dessert was ok. We ate everything.\n\nThe location is abominable, though rather than wait for a cab, we took the very crappy 20-minute walk back to Las Vegas Blvd. Man, Vegas needs Uber badly. Definitely still worth the visit, and I did derive pleasure from exactly how phenomenally crappy the external surroundings were.'

S'Sometimes you encounter a restaurant that knocks your socks off from out of the blue.  Lotus of Siam was not one of these establishments.  After hearing rave reviews from Gourmet Magazine, J. Gold and that putu from Kevineats.com, I felt compelled to dine at what many have claimed to be "The best Thai restaurant in North America".  Dear readers, I think they may be onto something.\n\nDitching our group of friends, my Thai paramour and I courageously walked-in to the restaurant without a reservation and were quoted 1:30 wait for a party of two.  Luckily, mi corazon is as fluid in her native tongue as she is easy on the eyes and successfully flirted (right in front of the ignorant farang guests) our way into a table after only 15 minutes.  Yet another example of the eventual geopolitical power shift from the West to the Orient, suckaz!\n\nThis would prove to be an auspicious beginning to what would culminate in the best meal of our Vegas trip and quite possibly the year.  Unfortunately for us, we were only a party of two and we also had a pressing engagement at XS after dinner.  Because of this, we weren\'t able to order the full breadth of the menu (like garlic lobster and crab dishes) but we made do with:\n\nNam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Salad with Issan Sausage)\nKhao Soi (Egg Noodles in Coconut broth with chicken)\nCrispy Duck with Penang Curry\nGarlic Prawns\n6 glasses (1 bottle plus 2 additional servings) of Prum 2009 Kabinett Riesling\n\nAs mi corazon expressed to me after the first few bites, this is as good as it gets outside of the homeland.  Granted, she remarked that the cuisine was a bit "fusion" and not within strict adherence to traditional Thai cusine, but she was nonetheless glowing with her praise.  As for your humble author, dear readers...  I was in Siamese heaven, fusion or no.\n\nAll of the dishes we ordered were excellent, with the Khao Soi and the Nam Kao Tod being my personal favorite.  In addition, the crispiness of the garlic prawns was perfectly married to the garlic infusion and the duck meat was SO juicy and provided a perfect (albeit extremely rich) counterpoint to the Penang curry.  All of the food went amazingly with the J Prum Riesling, a steal at $35 a bottle...\n\nMaybe I had a few too many glasses of the aforementioned wine, because I distinctly remember in between bites whispering to my girlfriend that I wanted to have sex with her on top of all the sumptuous vittles.  Of course, being the modest Thai lady that she is, she shushed me and expertly directed my passions towards the food despite entreaties from your humble author for acceptance of, "just the tip, sweetie...  come on, just the tip".  "OK, OK, later!" she hissed at me.  What a saint, mi corazon...\n\nLocated in a semi-grimy strip mall, the location is nothing special, but the food was several notches above any Siamese cuisine I\'ve had in the states.  Surprisingly, the service was very good as well.  Granted, I\'m always expecting treatment at Asian restaurants to be one notch above the brutality that American POW\'s experienced by the Japanese during the Bataan Death March...  but illustrative of Thailand\'s "Land of Smiles" moniker, the servers were gracious, friendly and efficient.\n\nTotal bill came out to $123 for all that food and wine.  Officiously, I took out $25 in cash and gently put it in the payment tray.  \n\n"What, you\'re not going to pay for the rest of the meal?" asked my now beleagured (but very satiated) girlfriend.  \n\n"Just the tip, sweetie" I replied slurringly...  "Just the tip."'

S'There\'s a lot of great things about Lotus of Siam, it\'s just not up to par with SF Bay Area Thai. But for Las Vegas, it\'s worth a shot!\n\nBrief Summary\n-- Location is off the strip, felt like "middle of nowhere"\n-- Must be a Local hot spot because it\'s packed and busy!\n-- Service was decent\n-- Food was pretty good\n-- Experience was just A-OK\n\nWith all of the high profile chef\'s having restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip or in the fancy, new hotels,  I would have NEVER thought of getting some Thai food in LV. Thanks to Yelp, I checked this place out with my GF and even called ahead and got a reservation on a busy Wednesday night!\n\nThis place doesn\'t look as big or as nice as it does inside. The outside made me feel like we were in the slums but the inside of the restaurant was very welcoming and nice. \n\nService was a little bit slow at times but eventually our server opened up and gave us a smile and great customer service. I guess he just needed some time to warm up.\n\n--- Our Order ---\n\n** Tom Kha Gai with veggies -- I think this one of the best dishes of the night. We asked for medium heat, and they delivered! The heat was strong when you ate the peppers in the soup, but otherwise it wasn\'t completely overbearing or too much. We were a little surprised at first but then were relieved that our mouths weren\'t completely on fire. We got the Hot Pot size and it was $14 ( a little expensive ), but the portions were HUGE. So it made sense. I definitely recommend this coconut based soup with chicken and vegetables.\n\n** Chicken Satay -- I like simple dishes. This dish was simple and delicious. BBQ chicken on skewers with a great peanut sauce and the cucumber salad. \n\n** Pad Thai with Chicken -- I\'m not a fan of places that serve Pad Thai with ONLY a certain type of meat. I\'m used to having some egg, chicken, tofu and shrimp in my noodles. So it would have been nice to have a few mroe ingredients, but in general the pad Thai was good. The noodles were a little bit thicker than what I like, but the flavor was very good. Pad Thai is the "make or break" dish for me, and I feel like they delivered well with the Pad Thai.\n\n** Pineapple Fried Rice -- This was probably the weakest dish. It wasn\'t very "fried" but more like a rice mixed with curry powder. It made the rice have a lackluster texture that was in between moist and dry. It was confusing. The pineapple did deliver a nice fresh crunch and juice, but I\'ve had better.\n\nAfter going over my whole order, it wasn\'t that this place isn\'t good. Everything was good, but nothing WOW\'d us or made me want to go out of my way for Thai in Las Vegas. If you\'re hankering for some Thai in LV, make a trip out here. Don\'t blink, or you\'ll miss it!\n\n** Quick Side Note -- They have a HUGE selection of Wine. If that\'s your "thing" then they will definitely be able to get you something that fits your meal.'

S'"The single best Thai restaurant in North America"? Well, that\'s a lot to live up to, Jonathan Gold of Gourmet Magazine. I thought it was pretty good but nothing mind-blowing. \n\nThe shopping center this is in was more memorable than the food. It was ridiculously RIDICULOUSLY big and full of really random strip mall retail oddities. Lotus of Siam was the gem of the center. There were a few run down restaurants but mostly really random businesses.'

S"Granted, I've only been to two Thai restaurants in my life.  Compared to the other restaurant I went to, this is, in fact, not the best Thai food in the United States, nor even in Las Vegas.  Going by taste alone, I enjoyed my dinner, but having ordered the exact same thing elsewhere, it did not match up.  It should not matter what menu I order from, if something is served on the menu from a restaurant touted as the best in the United States, I shouldn't have to limit myself to a particular item or set of items to taste this quality.\n\nThe location, as others have mentioned, is absolutely horrible.  Off the strip on Sahara, it's hidden away in an area that makes me feel uncomfortable every time I go there.  The interior was nothing special and did not stand out to me...seemed quite unauthentic, way to strip-mallish, but alas I've never been to Thailand, I would not know what is truly authentic.  We happened to sit nearby a group who met with the owners, who both seemed nice but Bill was quite dressed down for whatever he was doing that evening (sweatshirt and sweatpants...not quite what I was expecting).  Like I've mentioned in other reviews, appearance and first impressions mean a lot when you eat out...much of the reason why many never come back.\n\nTo have to put so much into going here (reservations a week in advance or waiting a few hours if you come unannounced, I was expecting more.  The reviews here were for the most part spot on, but to each their own I suppose.  I came with high expectations and left wishing I'd never came."

The ingredients were so fresh and tasty.  I had the Cashew Chicken, Thai spicy ~ and I ate every bite on my plate.  PHENOMENAL!  Make sure you have a reservation.  Reservations usually denote a very pricey restaurant but Lotus of Siam was VERY reasonable.  No more pricey than the place I frequent in my hometown.  Cannot give this place enough compliments.  Now I am only sorry I live so far away.  It\'s one of the only reasons I would want to go back to Vegas!'

S"Lotus of Siam definitely lived up to the hype. The food was really great, particularly with regards to the main courses. Appetizers were all decent, if a tad boring (with the exception of the bacon and wonton-wrapped shrimp). The wontons and dumplings were only offered with chicken, while most of us would have preferred pork. The beer and wine list was quite good, and I even saw one of my favorite IPAs for a jaw-dropping $3.50 (though our table opted for Singhas all around - when in Thai restaurants, right?).\n\nThe entrees are what really got everyone excited. Our table was filled with drunken noodles, pad Thai, curries and more. My crispy duck over drunken noodles was excellent. I mostly stuck to the outer edges since duck is just so fatty by nature, but I was able to get the flavor I wanted from a few of the leaner bites with my delicious noodles. I requested my heat level at a four, which was perfect for me (I like things spicy but not uncomfortably so). A friend requested her shrimp in green curry at a four, and it seemed much hotter. So I'd probably knock that down to a three. \n\nEven though the food was awesome, the service was a bit spotty at times. It was hard to pinpoint which person was our main server. We had to ask for drink refills more than once and a requested knife was never delivered. Still, I would definitely like to return on my next visit to Las Vegas. \n\n\n*Out of towners, definitely make reservations and know that a cab ride is going to cost you."

I can honestly say, this is THE best Thai meal I've had, hands down, outside of Thailand.\n\nWe had a huge array of dishes and my favorites were:\n\nIssan sausage -- these had great texture and the sauce wasn't overly sweet\n\nPad Kee Mow -- the best I've ever had! the perfect amount of greasiness and spiciness. The noodles were slippery just the way they're supposed to be\n\nChili and Mint Duck -- this surprised all of us. The portion was small but the crispy rice on the bottom was enough to send us off the edge -- it was THAT good\n\nNuer Nam Tok -- a version of grilled beef but with toasted rice sprinkled all over giving the sauce a thick consistency which clung to the meat. Absolutely divine.\n\nI'm trying to gather a group to go to Vegas just to visit Lotus of Siam. It is so good I'm craving it right this moment!"

When I first came inside though, I was surprised to find a lot of people inside with a lot of families coming here to eat. Looks like a lot of locals come out to this place to enjoy lunch or dinner. \n\nOrdered the Nam Kao Tod, which was highly recommended by fellow yelpers. It came out pretty quickly and is very comparable to Thai Larp Salad but with a crispy texture with the crispy rice. It came spicy but not overly spicy and all the flavors mixed well with the crispiness of the rice. Also I ordered a bowl of Tom Kha soup which was very fresh and flavorful. \n\nOverall, I had a great lunch here and I'd definitely recommend it to friends."

S"Funny story, Lotus of Siam when you drive by from Sahara looks like a hole in the wall broken down place that you would never want to eat at.  On 2 different occassions I planned on going there and both times when I drove by we decided to go somewhere else. About a year ago we bit the bullet and decided to try it.  Surprisingly enough the front of the restaraunt is in the back and we were basically looking at the back of the place when driving by. It can be deceiving. I've been there 1/2 dozen times since. Last night we went and there was a 1 hour - 1.5 hour wait to get seated. The foods so good we waited over an hour. \n\nI've read reviews from more than one food critic calling is the best Thai Food in all of North America and I believe they are right. I've been to Thailand for a month to train and the food is actually better at Lotus of Siam! The owner apparently started cooking in Thailand at age 5 with her mother/grandmother and brough that experience to Vegas.  Just yesterday I saw on Yahoo that Lotus of Siam was #89 on the list of the best 101 restaraunts in the USA. \n\nAs for the food, some things I recommened for an appetizer are the Prawns in a blanket, spicy chilli chicken wings and also the Tom Kah Kai Soup.  For dessert the Mango Sticky Rice is the bomb plus it is way healthier than eating cake or ice cream! \n\nI went with 3 people total and for our main courses to split we got Crispy garlic prawns, Panang Curry and Sea bass over drunken noodles.  I've had numerous dishes here and they are all good.  All the curries are great, the pad thai, the crispy duck. Great flavors and taste you wont find many other places.

Slightly more expensive than we expected it to be - probably because I didn't take a look at the prices (oops).  Never the less, it was so worth it.  AWESOME dishes: Drunken chilean sea bass, some appetizer with rice crispies (kom kao tod or something), def get a combo of the coconut ice cream, sticky rice and mango for dessert, crab fried rice, and the garlic charbroiled beef.

First lets start with atmosphere, the place is way down the strip where i don\'t normally roam. Located in a huge ass parking lot which looks like a strip mall is this gem in what is or was old vegas. Inside this dead looking place its packed, like i had to push my way through the front (lunch time) to put my name down on this long ass waiting list. Hit the bar in the restaurant where we were given a thick ass drink menu i mean thick!! stuck to the basics thai chang beer but for this place being packed we were seated fairly quick 20min at most. Now to the food... got the northern style food and with nothing to compare this restaurant to I\'m going by my experience with curries and asian dishes. Started with crispy rice, the fried duck pannang and the garlic fried shrimp... one word AMAZING!! the crisp rice was good but very heavy on the lemon grass which over powered the dish but was still good. The crispy duck was my favorite, now if you have ever tried duck you know that well most places do not know how to cook it and being Chinese decent we know our duck and well so does lotus of siam, cooked perfectly crispy still even when submerged in curry! next the fried garlic shrimp mmmmm, deep fried and very tasty. The service here was on point and when i mean on point, full waters, back to back beers and fast check turn around. Overall I\'m a fan for a very delicious meal, yeah i cant base it for any other northern thai restaurant but as far as taste goes this place is amazing and i will be back thank you Anthony bourdain'

I\'d say...it\'s not worth it if you\'re driving/heading back home, and thus would have to suffer through traffic after lunch.\n\nOddly, the Tom Yum Soup came out last, and was lukewarm; however, is delicious. I also love how they ask "how spicy" on every single dish you order.\n\nThe Drunken Noodles, with Duck was fantastic. Classic, Pad See Ew.\n\nThey also have a lot of Northern (Burmese) dishes, which are rarely found in Thai restauarants. The only other Kao Soi I\'ve heard being served, is in Portland, OR.

We got there during the lunch hour, for a table of 8 we had to wait 45 minutes which was understandable. When we were waiting inside, we noticed the buffet option but opted to order from the menu since the lunch buffet looked basic. When the food arrived, we all agreed that the food was delicious but many other Thai restaurants down the street offer the same great taste for half the price and double the size. Food may be great but their service was horrendous. For a restaurant with such great reviews, I was surprised we had to wait 30 mins for water and made many, many attempts to gather a waiter's attention for our check. Our party left unsatisfied and made a quick stop at Mcdonalds because we were still hungry.

The restaurant wasn't too far away. It was approximately two miles away from the Stratosphere. It is located in a rather big plaza with plenty of parking. The restaurant exterior was not much to look at. However, the interior is decently decorated and clean. After looking at the menu, my initial thought was this place is way too expensive for Thai food. Gave it a try anyway. I had the famous curry duck and various other plate, Which I do not recall the name (please refer to my pictures). They tasted really good, and I would go back for more given a chance.

S"I have to disagree with most reviews.  Lotus of Siam is a cult restaurant that definitely offers unique tastes but is not the best Thai in the country and may not even be the Thai in the Commercial Center.\n\nBy the way, although the Commercial Center is still an iffy place at night, a local business group has been trying to turn this around.\n\nSome reviewers must be judging this by their uniqueness.  I can understand if someone is jaded, they will find this an adventure but quite frankly its not that great.  Their duck curry is too sweet and their spicy sausage dish is way too acidic.  It appears to have flecks of ham in it instead of sausage but only the taste not description matters.\n\nI think that their abililty to pair wines with the food must account for some of their esteem by some food critics.  They do have a good selection and the husband of the chef is not bad at wine recommendations.  One of my friends in New York who was knocked on her heels by Michelin's star for Devi told me this is sometimes a factor.  \n\nHowever, there are at least 2 Thai restaurants in Vegas that I am sure most would find superior to LOS:  Pin Kaow and Archi with Komol not far behind.  Komol is in the same seedy center as LOS.  \n\nThis review is not based on their buffet which is not as bad as most reviews but a definite step below their regular menu.  I have eaten there 3 times, exhortations from visitors driven and have always been underwhelmed.  \n\nYes, their flavorings are unique but is it good?  Is it as good as some of the other Thais in Las Vegas.  I'm sorry but no it is not."

S"My definition of ZE BEST Thai restaurant in Vegas! I love love love their fried garlic prawns! It's a must have item on your order! We tried the crispy duck curry, sea bass with onion & ginger, soft-shell crab drunken noodle, pad see yew, tom yum goong seafood soup. They were all very delicious! For dessert, we tried the fried banana with coconut ice cream. The sticky rice & mango was out of season so we couldn't have it thus time. The experience was great, we love their food and service. Definitely will come back every time we're in town."

It looks like a small restaurant on a large empty strip mall but inside it's considerably spacious and nicely decorated. We ordered the nam kao tod, garlic prawns, crispy duck panang curry, and softshell crab drunken noodles. All were super delicious. Garlic prawns were probably my favorite - it's done so well - super crispy on the outside but perfectly done on the inside. Pricey but still worth it."

The best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas is at Lotus of Siam and it's only a 7 min drive from the strip off Sahara. Best make reservations if you have parties of 4 or more since this place always has a wait.\n\nHere are a few musts from the menu:\n\n1) Thai iced tea\n2) Garlic Prawns (they fry them season them and still keep the skin on...must have)\n3) Duck curry (spicy levels from 1-10, we had the 8 and it was pretty spicy...so stick with 5-6 for those who just want a medium kick)\n\nStaff's very attentive and supposedly they have a great wine selection, but I have yet to try anything. I always make a pit stop anytime I come back to Las Vegas...I found a gold mine."

S"This is my first five star review ( actually 4 1/2, but yelp doesn't do halfsies, lol) my friend micheal, picked this spot, and I was wary of his choices,( due to the SF Chinatown incident, )and upon walking in we were the only people there, so I wasn't expecting much, but we were seated promptly & courteously. I wasn't familiar with much of the menu, and many dishes had oyster sauce of which I'm allergic to, but the waiter was patient and understanding and gave us some suggestions. The tum yum soup with chicken ( # 4 on his spicy scale was recommended ) it was amazing !! ,beautifully spiced , nice presentation if u r dining with 3 or more guests get the big one for a few dollars more it feeds 4 !! Big pieces of chicken and tons of mushrooms and tomato !! Next came the chicken satay, very tasty !! Than the crying tiger , thinly sliced beef it was awesome but served cold, ( as I'm not familiar with the dish, it is said that that is how it normally is served) but could have used a little warmth for my taste! Very soon our entree arrived basil crispy pork!! I could just die!! It was awesome! I requested no oyster sauce and they said they cooked it in soy sauce and chili sauce!! But the flavor was absolutely amazing!! Also the green curry was great , a little to sweet for my taste, but request the chili tray , so u can spice things up to your liking, my friend micheal ordered the minced chicken 15 star spicy, which I didn't try , but made my friend cry!! Micheal loves his spicy food!! Lol we finished by sharing a banana cheese cake which was the perfect compliement to an already great meal!! And as for micheal he has redeemed himself!! Altogether for 4 courses and soft drinks it was 35$ per person including tip!! I will definitely be back!!"

They are criminally busy, so unless you're willing to wait for over an hour (which I have), make a reservation.  However, they do not take same day reservations, so you need to think ahead. The Tom Kah Kai and Nam Kao Tod are religious experiences.  Every dish I've ordered, from the Drunken Noodles Seafood, to the Pad Thai to the Panang Thai Curry, has been wonderful!  I can't wait to go back and try something new."

S'The wait at this "hole in the wall" (if you can call it that) is crazy.  I don\'t know why I thought that you can\'t make reservations, but the other ppl around me in line thought the same thing...well, at least misery had company.  A lot of it.  We were there 15min after it opened, but had over an hour wait for a table of two.  It was a real test of will power that we stayed since we had not eaten a meal today and had hiked through the Valley of Fire.  So by the time we sat down, we were ready to order.  Luckily, things came out within 10min of ordering.  Actually, we were sat in view of the kitchen and got to see Saipan herself run the kitchen.  She really does everything...she ran my container of sticky rice out.  I thought it refreshing that she didn\'t feel herself too important for such a menial task.  I ordered mostly Northern Thai cuisine:  nam prik noom (spicy green chili veggie dip to be eaten with fresh veggies, pork rind, and my favorite, sticky rice), koi soi (thai beef tartare), a catfish dish, and (don\'t think this is issan) drunken noodle with soft crab.  Everything was good.  Thai food is known for is cacophony of seemingly unmatched flavors that come together harmoniously in the final dish.  It\'s an experience for your mouth.  We\'ve been to the Northern area of Thailand, and it\'s very authenti...not that we need to tell you guys that.  Though my husband thought everything was just ok until we got to the final dish:  Pad Thai.  I know, right?  We\'re at a Northern Thai restaurant, and we order Pad Thai.  I read that it was good, and I wanted to compare this dish to others I\'ve had.  Though I disagree with husband on this one, he said that he\'d come back just for this dish.  I\'m not against that at all since there was a jackfruit dish I\'m still quite curious about.  (There were a lot of foods we didn\'t get to try on our trip.)  Though next time, we\'ll either call to make reservations, or just get takeout.'

However, David V. captured it best when he stated that L.O.S. appears to have been "the" Thai spot a few years ago. \n\nAMBIANCE\nL.O.S. is located in a sketchy little strip mall off Sahara. The interior is a clean, no frills decor, and the restaurant lacks a waiting area.\n\nFOOD   \nFollowing Yelp recommendations, we ordered:\n\n-Garlic Prawns                                            (5 STARS)\n-Drunken Noodles w/Soft Shell Crab     (4.5 STARS)\n-Chicken Pad Prig Khing                          (3.5 STARS)\n\nOur meal was good/okay, but when I think of L.O.S.

S'OK, reading the other reviews here, i will not be very original! This is a great Thai restaurant and the best I had in Vegas so far! The place is in a remote beaten down section of Las Vegas, not very far from the convention center. I came here with friends at the end of the "National Association of Broadcasters" convention and the place was packed! My friends made a reservation and were there before so I did not have to wait but I saw people waiting in line for up to an hour while we were there.\n\nThe place itself is plain in terms of setting and the service is efficient but basic... but you forget about all this when eating the food and enjoying the company of good friends!'

S"Crispy Duck Panang Curry. Garlic Prawns. \n\nIf you want the best Thai food in Vegas or anywhere within 100s of miles, go here. \n\nGood God it was so delicious and you would never expect it from the looks of the outside. Located in a shipping center off the strip near the older part of town, you expect a hole-in-the-wall and that's what you get walking in. What you don't know is they expanded to the space next to where they originally opened up and it looks like a Michelin Star restaurant. Service was comparable to a Ruth's Chris or any topend steakhouse. Always catering to your needs although very busy. Huge wine cellar in plain site and all the James Beard and Zagat awards on the wall. \n\nThe food. The food though!!! Don't make the mistake of ordering too much at once. Family style and the steamed white rice is endless. Hot pot Tom Kha Kai to start with medium spice. Super delicious, sour, spicy and the best way to start. Dishes came out shortly after. We also ordered the soft shell crab drunken noodles. The dish was super good but I want to focus on the first two I mentioned. Garlic Prawns. Came with the shells which were also fried. Best. Prawns. Ever. So good. But the true star: crispy duck Panang. Duck came in a lake of curry and still remained crispy. It was so good over rice and we ended up ordering another. \n\nGo here. Don't even hesitate. Go. You won't regret it. If you can find a better Thai place in the area, I challenge you to say that LoS isn't better. I CHALLENGE YOU! Aite?!?And bring your friends with you cause you might get embarrassed."

It's really interesting to try the soup at other Thai restaurants and then to try it here. The flavors are so well balanced (although it's still a bit salty!)  The mussaman was delicious as well, and I swear I tasted lemongrass in it.  \n\nThis place has quite a wine selection. My friend is a connoisseur and was impressed with their German selections in particular. \n\nWe did not get reservations but showed up on a weekday around 6:30 and were seated about 10 minutes later. The restaurant was not at all full, but apparently there is a shortage of menus, causing the delay.  Service in general is VERY slow. People who showed up after we did were served before we were, however, for reasons unknown."

S"***Lotus of Siam is a very good Thai restaurant and easily the best value I've ever had in Vegas, which is filled with overpriced and mediocre restaurants***\n\nLotus of Siam is a very well respected Thai restaurant in Las Vegas (it recently won a James Beard award).  The restaurant is off The Strip but not too far away.  The restaurant is located in a deserted kind of strip mall and has a no frills decor, but it is nice enough.  The restaurant is clean and has warm colors (the walls are outfitted with many photos--I guess with pictures of celebrities though I did not take a close look).  The restaurant is also bigger than I expected and was very busy (luckily, we had reservations).\n\nThe menu at Lotus of Siam is huge.  There is an unbelievable number of dishes and they range from all kinds of proteins (beef, pork, shrimp, chicken, many kinds of fish) to many different types (soups, salads, noodles, appetizers, and so on).  We tried several things.  Here is the rundown.\n\n(Deep fried chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and served with sweet and sour sauce).  The chicken wings were moist and flavorful as well as crispy (and not greasy).  The sauce was thin and mostly sweet.\n\n(Tom Yum Kung hot and sour soup with shrimp, lime juice, lemongrass, and straw mushrooms) The soup had a strong citrus flavor as well as good fragrance from the fresh herbs.  There was a very generous portion of shrimp, which were plump and moist.  The soup was surprisingly spicy and left quite the tingling on the tongue.\n\n(Thai Beef salad with onion, tomato, chili, lime juice, and greens) I liked this one more than my friends, who were surprised by its lack of salad-ness.  The salad was mostly a stir fry, but the meat was nicely cooked and had a good flavor.  I liked the lime flavor as well as the moistness of the plate.\n\n(Charbroiled prawns with garlic black pepper sauce) The prawns were big, moist and tender.  The garlic black pepper sauce was good and not too overpowering.\n\n(Pad Thai with chicken, egg, green onion, bean sprouts, and chopped peanut and Thai fried rice with shrimp, egg, onion, and tomato) Their Pad Thai and their fried rice were the only disappointing dishes of the night.  The noodles were too soft and clumped together too much.  The other ingredients were fine, but the overall flavor was nothing special compared to other Thai spots I've tried.  The same could be said for their fried rice.\n\n(Crispy duck with chili, mint leaves and Thai basil) The duck was very good--moist but with a great crispy and crunchy outside batter.  The garnishes were flavorful and fragrant.\n\n(Braised beef short rib panang with a red cream curry sauce and cognac) The creamy sauce was great--great flavor and incredible fragrance.  The short rib was just okay.  While mostly tender, the short rib varied from kind of dry in some parts to too fatty in other parts.\n\n(Fried banana rolls) I liked the very egg roll-like wrapper (crispy, thin and not too sweet).  The banana was sweet and good.  I liked it, but it was nothing exceptional.\n\n(Coconut ice cream) The ice cream had a good flavor and was creamy, but it was a little sorbet like.\n\nService was friendly, but it did take a while for us to put in our order.  The first dishes took a little bit of time to come out and I wished that our second run of dishes would have been spaced apart more (too much came out at the same time).\n\nPrices were very good.  Given the quality and the fact that Lotus of Siam is in Vegas, the meal was easily the best bang-for-your-buck meal I've ever had in Vegas.\n\nWhile I am not that experienced with Thai food, I really enjoyed Lotus of Siam.  Many of the dishes were good.  Since Las Vegas has so many overpriced restaurants, it was very refreshing to try a place like Lotus of Siam where you could spend less but not sacrifice in terms of quality.  If I was ever in Vegas again with a big group and needed a satisfying but also reasonably priced dinner, we would definitely head to Lotus of Siam.\n\nThe strip mall has a huge and free parking lot."

S"We went for the first time to try the infamous lunch buffet. The buffet was small, but everything on it tasted homemade and delicious. We eat at a lot of buffets, and normally the small ones end up being a waste. This was not! The service was a little slow, and it wasn't very crowded, so both of those things surprised us. The curry chicken they had on the buffet made up for most of it, and the most interesting and unique tasting hot and sour soup we have ever had. Each spoonful had a different and complex flavor. We tried to figure out what all was in it that wasn't obvious, but couldn't. We would like to come back and try ordering off the menu for dinner."

Here's the run down. \n\nYellow curry chicken- Delicious flavor, but not enough chicken. HUGE chunks of potatoes. Tasty enough to have thirds(shhhh) \n\nOrange chicken- Tasty enough to have seconds \n\nTeriyaki chicken wings- OMG these were good. \n\nChow mein and egg rolls- Nothing to write home about \n\nFried Banana Rolls- HOLY SHIT these things made me forget my name for a minute. I got lost in their warm, soft bananas with crunchy outside. You don't even want to know how many I ate. \n\nOverall I over ate and over drank with three Thai Iced Teas, but who's counting calories at this place? I am hoping to go back very soon and try something with beef or pork in it. Lotus of Siam is definitely deserving of a second date."

It\'s located in a somewhat questionable strip mall... and doesn\'t look like much from the outside, but have faith, brothers and sisters.  Lotus of Siam is the kind of foodie heaven we all dream about.  Can I get an amen?  Hallelujah.\n\nI went with a large group.  Half hour wait.  The place was packed... and for good reason.

S"After reading the reviews, I wanted to try the restaurant and this is a first that I've ever heard of a Thai buffet offered.  As a big fan of Thai food, I thought I was going to have a great meal, but.........NOT!!!!\n\nLocated in a delapitated strip mall of other restaurants  and shops, this hole in the wall I thought.......might be a surprise and thus this is why there were so many positive reviews on YELP.  However, my experience was not such.\n\nYou walk in and the entrance is small and 3 people can not stand comfortably.  It's a small area then you're at the cashier's and the front room is dated and has painted green lattice partitions.  The rugs appeared dirty and the lighting was dim.  this is the area we were seated.  There's another section to th right of this and you can tell it's a newer updated area and open and looked lighter and cleaner.  the bathrooms appear to be remodeled and was nice and clean.\n\nI wanted to try the buffet for $8.99 that seemed reasonable, but they didn't offer any curry dishes, or popular Thai dishes.  the variety was lacking compared to when you go to an Indian buffet restaurant.  they offered only had about 8 entrees, 2 soups, 6 misc of salad, fried shrimp chips, fried banana, fried curry pouches, apple slices and orange slices and that's it.   I was disappointed and do not recommend their buffet at all.   \n\nthey had 2 types of soups, duck soup which had bits of duck and was greasy and the other was a egg flower soup and was good.   They had pad thai, but it was nothing special, the fried garlic wings was good, the other dishes were just alot of stir fry vegetables, and a chow mein style noodle dish.  a green salad with ranch dressing, I didn't understand how this is Thai....why didn't they have payaya salad.  Overall, it was more of a chinese buffet type food then all Thai food.\n\nMy partner ordered the Pad Sew flat noodle dish, but the waiter came out with another dish altogether.  A disappointment, but he liked the dish anyway.   It was a beef stir fry with cashews and a bowl of rice. \n\nthe waiter charged us for the incorrect dish that cost more, and he wouldn't correct the bill bc he said we accepted the dish and didn't return it back to the kitchen.  He wasn't very nice about this and the mistake was most likely due to a language barrier communication.\n\nSo DO NOT go for the buffet.  Make sure you double check your order to get the right dish...best to point to the item on the menu, since English is not their first language.\n\nMost of the dishes were about $9. to $15. per entree and that's expensive compared to the bay area, probably bc they have to ship it to LV.\n\nI can't comment on their Thai dishes, but can say that the buffet is not worth it, and they should get rid of the buffet or expand it and keep it freshly stocked and not sitting there for so long.  No one refilled any of the pans when I was there."

S'My friend is a really busy lady so when we go out, I usually try to find places near her home to minimize her commute.  We had planned to have dinner at Pin-Kaow and originally planned  to meet at 6 PM, then delayed to 630, and finally 7ish was decided upon.  She called to let me know that she got a lot of work done and has a lot of free time.  We started talking about Pin Kaow and find out she she\'s been there.  I like her to have new experiences, so I asked if she would be interested in trying out Lotus of Siam.  An enthusiastic "yes"...\n\nIt\'s been 5 years since I\'d been here and called to see if reservations are needed.  I spoke with a guy named "Bank" who later I found out is the Manager.  He said they are booked and walk in\'s may need to wait 20 minutes.  I asked if they had a bar and he said that they do have a bar.  (that\'s new since I was last there)...I then asked if there was a "walk in" list.  He took my name and added my friend and we were good to go.  \n\nLast time I was here a HUGE fight with around 15 people broke out in the parking lot.  The neighborhood is sketchy so have  your head on a swivel if you go.  When we arrived, there are what looks like patrons waiting outside for a table.  I was beginning to wonder how big the bar is.  We walk in and THEY EXPANDED!!!  They have a huge wine selection now!  Wow!  We announced our arrival and let them know we would be waiting in the Bar.  Everyone was very nice.  Zero, zip, nada attitude.  \n\nWe sat down, had ordered wine by that glass and were seated about 10 minutes later.  \n\nI usually order the same foods regardless of which Thai establishment we go to so I asked Joe, our Waiter, for his recommendations.  We ordered the NAM KAO TOD Crispy rice appetizer that\'s mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice..  I\'m big on hot dogs/sausage, so Joe offered it made with Tofu.  Excellent decision.  For our main course we ordered a Northern Thai dish called Northern Laub, which apparently is ompletely different from the Issan larb in taste, this northern style larb (ground pork) is cooked with Northern Thai spices and no lime juice, garnished with fresh herbs and vegetables.  I think I would have preferred to have this made with Tofu too but didn\'t want to upset the Chef with too many changes.  However, I think it would ahve been cool if it did.  They are very accommodating.  I\'ve almost been kicked out for making a suggestion at a SF Chinatown spot. Anyway, an finally, La Piste de resistance,  Khao Soi.  This typical Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle is served in curry sauce and coconut cream (your choice of beef or chicken), garnished with sliced red onion, lime and pickled vegetables.  All of these dishes can be made with a spiciness range from 1-10.  We ordered a 7 for all and the smoke was perfect...I could have gone to an 8, but it was a perfect dish at 7.  Do NOT eat the little red peppers in the dish or have water ready.  Ice water.  Oh, we also ordered the Thai Tea.  Very refreshing.  They do not have coffee there.  Well, they do have instant, but is that really coffee, is it?\n\nOh man...the La Piste de resistance is really the sample platter dessert.  It\'s comprised of Coconut ice cream, Sticky rice with Mango\'s (if you like the salty sweet thing then this is your thing), and Fried banana rolls drizzled with honey.  Menu diva at it again...we were full so didn\'t want a Cheesecake Factory sized dessert.  Joe hooked up a sample Sampler for us.  The very sweet dessert maker delivered it for us and reaffirmed that it was made smaller for us.  It was sill plenty of food though.  ( I promised my friend I would not mention that she ate 75% of each plate, though she claims more of a 50 50 split.  Hey, I\'m not mad at her. A gurl\'s gotta eat, right?)   \n\nOur bill for the two of us was less than $50 and we got our grub and drink on big...well, at least she did...kidding of course...kind of...OKAY...I am kidding.  We both ate good.\n\nWhen I first moved here in 2001, I discovered Lotus of Siam listening to NPR.  The were saying how Gourmet Magazine chooses the top 10 restaurants in LV every year and every year, Lotus of Siam is selected.  How can one resist right?  The food was not awe inspiring, but I would not kick it out of bed for eating crackers either.  The food was 3 stars, the Service was 5 stars so I took an average of the two...(3+5)/2) is equal to 8/2 which equals 4...just in case...\n\nAlrighty then!!!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nChow!'

S"My friend who lives in vegas warned me that the prices were steep and the portions are small. And he was right. Everything that was on the menu was at least 2 to 7 dollars too expensive. I ordered the thai fried rice with pork and the nam prik ong (best thing I ever ate-food network). The thai fried rice was not only small, but also generic. The saving grace was the nam prik ong. Other than that, most of the menu items can be found at sanamluang in Hollywood, California (thai town). Sanamluang not only tastes better than Lotus of Siam, but also costs less and offers more portions. To be frank, I was tempted in giving this place a 2 star review. The nam prik ong was delicious, but wasn't worth the ten bucks I paid for it. The small serving of nam prik ong showed me that this place was nothing but a scam on people who can't get good thai food in Las Vegas. Alas, the nam prik ong did taste good, so I must give this place one star above two. Overall, I regret spending $20 something dollars here."

LOL.\n\nAs soon as we enter she was impressed with the see through wine cellar and pictures of celebrities and Iron chef Bobby Flay. I also mention the owner/chef Saipin Chutima was a James Beard Award winning chef. WIth that in mind our expectaction of her Northern style food was high.\n\nWe ordered Drunken noodle with seabass and Prawn.  \n\nDrunken Noodle with seabass gets 4 1/2 stars. The noodle (4stars)  was good, but i was expecting something speciall. On the other hand the Seabass was 5 stars. It was crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth fresh in the middle. WOW it was soo good. \n\nPrawn (5 Stars)  This is something special that you don't find anywhere else. Its skin was split away from its meat. Which both were cooked in perfection. I took a bite of the meat first and then ate the skin which were so soft and crunchy. Its texture mirrors a crispy potato chip. This was a perfect dish!! \n\nThere many good Thai restaurants here in LA. I have never taste anything as good as Lotus' Seabass and Prawn here in LA."

S'The renowned Lotus of Siam was a definite stop for the fianc\xc3\xa9e and me on our trip to Las Vegas.  We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM.  As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.  Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who\'ve eaten there.  \n\nFor lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu.  Skip the buffet.  We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line.  Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you\'d think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu.  We started off with the Nam Kao Tod.  The complex m\xc3\xa9lange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it\'s been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or "curry-like" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  \n\nLotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn\'t the best Thai food I can ever recall having!  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright.  Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven\'t tried, it\'s a sure thing that we\'ll be back.'

S"upon first reaction to the exterior of the restaurant you question to yourself how can this place be awarded with  2 Michelin stars! ?\nyou enter and again, your mind is blown by the Denny's-like interior but slightly fancier with a wall of wine cellar. All joking aside, the restroom is probably the most fanciest part of the restaurant with back to back cleaners and marble sinks and walls. \n\ni digress, so now the food :\n\nI ordered the meatless egg roll, and the veggie pad thai. \negg roll was just egg roll. \nthe pad thai was extremely sweet and i def had better! i didnt even finish HALF of the plate. \ninstead my favorite dish of the evening really surprised even myself, as i am not one for Spicy food. I noticed on the menu with big bold letters under Northern food - a popular veggie dish was this mushroom, which essentially was basically like a salsa to your chip, but instead of salsa its this delicious mushroom, spicy sauce with veggies surrounding it. IT was extremely spicy but like an addict i couldnt stop hurting myself! \n\neveryone really enjoyed there food as well, mouth of blazin'\n\ndessert- we ordered coconut ice cream and mango sticky rice both was pretty amazing !"

So happy we gave this place a try.  Food was incredible, service was a tad slow, but that was probably because they were slammed with people.

S"I hesitated between a 2 and 3 star. The food is a solid three star. Value for your dollar is a big fat 1 star. Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head because of all the rave reviews and also the long line waiting outside even before the restaurant opened.\n\nWe got basically most of the popular items.\nDrunken noodles with sea bass, we asked for level 7 spicy and it had a good kick and the sea bass was very moist and tender with it. However, for almost an $30 dish, it was not very much  noodles and just barely enough fish for our group of 4 to split.\nCrispy Duck Kha Soi (Sp?), this was a creamy coconut based sauce with egg noodles and crispy duck. I have to say, the duck was perfectly cooked and delicious, the noodles was good too, especially coated in the sauce. Again for the price of $25 it was barely enough noodles to split between 4 people.\nThe fried shrimp everyone seemed to get. I do love how crispy the shells are, completely edible and full of shrimp flavor. It looks like a big plate of 10+ shrimp, but it's more like actual shrimp meat is 4-5 pieces and the rest of just shell. \nThe spicy chicken wings were just OK, tastes like Costco wings tossed in the Asian sweet chili sauce, would skip next time.\nWe got the red chili dip, it was very smokey but that was about the only flavor it really had, not a fan of this one either.\nOrdered a curry dish, it didn't have coconut milk and was another one lacking in flavor, didn't finish this dish because it just didn't taste like anything, just a lot of boiled veggies in a red watery soup. \n\nYou'd think after 6 dishes between 4 people we'd be full but ended up having to order another drunken noodle dish but this one with just veggies. Sadly this second round was not as good as the first one with sea bass. We also go their mango sticky rice for dessert.\n\nOverall, some of the dishes were very good but not good enough to justify the price."

S'I was very glad to try this restaurant I\'ve bookmarked since I saw their episode on "The Best I Ever Ate." I\'ve heard they were great. Also, this was the meeting place for my first UYE lunch!\n\nFirst, I\'ll say it was awesome to meet fellow Yelpers who were in town for our Yelp Spring Break. \n\nAs for the overall food experience here, I\'d have to give it 3 stars for sure. It took a while after we were seated for us to receive menus. The server was very nice and friendly, it did get pretty busy at the end of our meal, but the service wasn\'t as prompt as it could\'ve been. Our food arrived pretty fast, but it just took an unusually long time to order and to get our check at the end.\n\nI tried the Khao Soi with beef. I usually always go with what the server recommends to me. It was decent, honestly. People around me tried the Nam Prik Hed and the soup Tom Kha Kai. Everyone said the food tasted fairly good. \n\nI\'d definitely want to come back to try a meal again. Try a different dish perhaps. Hopefully a better updated review to come...'

We went Sunday night at 5:30 right when they opened for dinner. The place was half full when we sat down. By the time we left, the lines were out the door and it was a zoo. Make a reservation."

If your first visit here is for the lunch buffet, keep in mind that the buffet is not a good refleciton of the quality of this place.\nThe Tom Yum Kai is awesome but the the En Tuan (Beef & Tendon Soup) is absolutely amazing. All the broths at this place are rich, spicy and very complex in flavor.  The curry here was good as well but wasn't much different from other Thai curries i've had before. The Pad Thai noodles were cooked just right and had a balance of flavors. The Papaya Salad was very refreshing and just the right amount of dressing. The unique dishes here is what makes this place a must. If you looking for mint and chicken, you can get that anywhere, read the reviews as you enter the restaurant and try something different and authentic to the region, you won't be dissapointed."

Had pad thai, duck curry, a suggested pork dish, and their sea bass over drunken noodles.  \n\nAll of it was good, well balanced with flavors.  Not sure what it is with drunken noodles but it works.  The waitress recommended us to pair our sea bass with it and we're glad we listened.  They miss most of the pad thai for you when its served except for the nuts.  We went through half of before we realized it and finished mixing it in.  \n\nThe thai tea was on the sweet side so we added water to ours.  \n\nWe'd be back to try different dishes when we're in town."

There was something different about it, the color was much darker almost as if they had added some sort of tomato paste (guessing). But everything else was fantastic.\n\nThe highlight for me was the thai dishes I had never seen before. There was a short rib in some very spicy orange sauce (forget the name exactly) which was absolutely superb and I will get it EVERY time I return. It is simply fantastic.

We thought it was just ok, nothing special.\nSome red onions, pickles, lime on the side.\n\nKang Hung Lay $10.95 - red pork curry.  It was a small dish of just pork and curry sauce w/ some cilantro on top.  Tasted just ok, nothing special.\n\nNorthern Tom Kah Soup $10.95 - a bit spicy and sour without coconut milk soup, chicken is dry, some grape tomatoes flavorless, some mushroom, meh.\n\nSticky rice $2 - for 1 person, meh, dry.\n\nThai ice tea $2.5 - very sweet!  Had to dilute it with lots of water & ice.\n\nHot tea $2 - some container of hot tea w/ tea bag, nothing special.\n\nGlad I tried it, but probably won't go back."

I don't think the have enough for the restaurant. They brought out all the food at the same time, and kept refilling the rice when we asked. \n\nATMOSPHERE (4 stars)\nReally big, tables are spaced out so you don't feel crowded. There are all these pics up of celebrities who came to the restaurant, but I didn't know more than half of them, haha. Waiting area in the front is crowded, and when you're done you feel the glare from the people waiting as you walk by hoping they get your table. The plaza it's in doesn't look like anything fancy. You wonder how this place can charge $23 for some dishes in this location, haha. There are taxis coming up dropping people off to try this place. I think it's just really hyped up.

It\'s hard to see from the front, and you\'ll think "am I really in the right place"????  Well, you are.  And you really did want to go here.\n\nThe food is frankly fantastic.  Every single thing I\'ve had there is some of the best Thai food I\'ve had, and I\'ve been there with several people who have spent time in Thailand, and they said it was some of they best they\'ve had as well.  \n\nMake sure to not skip out on the Northern Thai / Burmese food that\'s on the menu as well.  \n\nLast time I was here, we were in a rush to get to the airport, told the waiter, and the food was on the table in 15 minutes flat; it was amazing how good the service and speed was.  \n\nOh, and did I mention it\'s cheap?'

Perfect balance of sweet and spicy along with crunchy and soft. The Curry was very creamy with chicken and bamboo, I usually don't like bamboo but this was amazing.

Salads and sides were VERY small compared to other restaurants - especially given the cost.  I\'m a huge chocolate fan but couldn\'t finish the very small portion of cake provided due to the lack of flavor or any sense of gratification - its hard to ruin chocolate but they somehow managed to do so.\n\nWAY over priced!!!  Three drinks (tea, coke, cocktail), two very small ceasars, two very small sides, two filets, one lobster tail, two desserts - about $350.  Also two different prices and we were up-charged for lack of some rewards program - really??  Is the food here about the food or some frequent flyer program?  All I wanted was a great meal.  Not to feel like I was getting reamed further for lack of  casino rewards participation.  Let the food stand for itself and not some marketing scheme.\n\nFor all the talk and presentation about the meat here, it was the worst I\'ve ever had on the strip.

Had to seat myself down by the bar and wait nearly 15 minutes before any of the wait staff even came to me. Them had to wait another 15 minutes for my drink order. I realize it was busy when I arrived but still feel it was a bit too long for my drink. Only got checked on about twice during my entire 2 hours I stayed and felt the staff were paying more attention to the other guests.

S'When reviewing any eatery of any sort, it is always important to manage expectations. For instance, you might\'ve walked into a random dive that looked horrible and disgusting but ended up giving you above average food, which in turn might translate to 4 or even 5 stars. However, if a hyped-up steakhouse bearing the name of one of the most renowned chefs in the world were to give you anything but the finest cut of meat you\'ve ever had, it\'s easy to immediately downgrade the count to 3 stars and furiously copy and paste the word "overrated" a couple hundred times. So when a restaurant like Gordon Ramsay Steak receives a 5 star rating, you can be assured that this place is definitely no joke.\n\nI usually start with food but the entire experience was so well thought out that I\'ll just start from the moment we entered the restaurant. We had a reservation for 5 at 7pm and they promptly took us to our table when we arrived. The young lady who guided us even gave us a quick little tour/explanation of the restaurant, detailing the designs and the thought behind the ambiance. A nice little touch that was duly noted.\n\nOur waiter immediately brought out an ipad menu that showed different alcoholic beverages they were serving and gave us a chance to look it over before taking our orders. I decided on a Southside which is their take on a mojito. It tasted absolutely refreshing and had a little more kick of mint flavor than other mojitos I\'ve had but all in all, a solid drink. \n\nNext we were served three types of bread. One was some type of lemon focaccia, another was some sort of prosciutto roll, and the other I didn\'t try (sorry about the descriptions but I hadn\'t eaten all day in anticipation so my mind was pretty blurred by hunger). The roll was hands down the best one. It kind of looks like a cinammon roll and the prosciutto flavor came out really well; it almost had the flavoring of a chinese pork bun, but obviously a little more sophisticated and tastier. \n\nAnd to the main course we go. I really wanted to try both the beef wellington and the rib-eye so I ended up splitting with someone I was with. The beef wellington is his signature dish and it was absolutely perfect. The meat was sooo tender (all of them are cooked to medium-rare) and the puff pastry crust with the mushroom puree complimented the meat perfectly. I think there was also a hint of mustard somewhere in there but it wasn\'t strong at all and added a nice dimension to the steak. The rib-eye was also outstanding. Granted, I liked the wellington a lot so there is probably a marked mellowness in my enthusiasm for the rib-eye but I guess when you\'re eating two different steaks, one of them will stand out and inevitably cause the other one to take a backseat. However, to be fair, the rib-eye was riding shotgun and had one hand on the wheel. It was also cooked to a perfect medium rare and noticeably didn\'t have huge globs of fat hanging off the sides; the fat was well distributed throughout the meat so that it wasn\'t overbearing but still added that delicious lardy flavor we all crave in a good cut of steak :) This isn\'t a must but I saw bone-marrow on the menu and decided that I had to give it a try and let me tell you, it made the steak taste that much better. The bone marrow is pretty much just fat that you scoop out small portions and eat them with your steak. If it\'s in your budget, definitely give it a shot because it is well worth it.\n\nAt this point, your stomach is probably sending mad signals to your brain telling you to stop eating, that dessert is out of the question. This is the time when you must concentrate, dig deep, and order the sticky toffee pudding. There is really no description better suited for this dessert than an orgasm in your mouth. It comes with a toffee sauce they pour onto the pudding which just melts in your mouth and a side of butter ice cream (it literally looks like a stick of butter). You will not regret this.\n\nI must say that this is quite the premier steakhouse. Granted, we did run into a couple slips ups. Our waiter, for one, would disappear for prolonged periods of time and if it weren\'t for the sheer number of waiters passing our table, I probably would\'ve docked at least half a star. Also, make sure to specify that you want tap water. Our waiter gave us this glass jar of water and charged us for it, even though we had simply asked for 5 glasses of water. I guess I didn\'t specify what type of water I wanted but let\'s be honest, if you see 5 marginally employed college grads, you think they want to pay $18 for water? But when all was said and done,this was reflected in the waiter\'s tip and more importantly, I don\'t want one waiter to take anything away from the rest of this amazing experience. I generally hate giving out 5 star reviews but the amazing food coupled with the chill, hip atmosphere they got going on forced my hand. Just be sure to hit the tables afterwards so you can restock your wallet (or go broke).'

S"This was my first time at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and it definitely left me with a very good impression.\n\nI really had no expectations when I walked in, since I really had no idea what to expect. Some reviews say the decor was tacky, but I actually liked it. We had made reservations and were seated upstairs. It was cool seeing the whole restaurant layout from above. \n\nService was great too. Our water cups were never empty. When you are first seated, you are given an iPad with an interactive drink menu on it. You are also given the limited edition tasting menu that supposedly highlights the dishes made in Hell's Kitchen. The tasting menu also comes with an autographed picture of Gordon Ramsey. If you ordered the tasting menu, you get to take it home as a souvenir. Although I am a fan of the show, all I really wanted to try was the beef wellington so I opted out of the tasting menu. \n\nWe had a show to make so we didn't order much, especially with the beef wellington taking 45 minutes to make. The boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and we also got the brussel sprouts for a side. While we waited for our food, the bread came. \n\nI have to stop here and talk about the bread plate because I can't stop thinking about it!! The bread plate came with four different types of bread: lemon olive oil foccacia, prosciutto brioche, black truffle brioche, and I don't remember the last one. It was served warm, which made it taste even better. My favorites were definitely the prosciutto brioche and foccacia. We devoured the first plate VERY quickly and even though we knew we had to save room for our entrees, we just had to ask for a second plate. SO GOOD. I wish there was a bakery section because I would totally buy a whole batch of the bread to take home.\n\nNow, the entrees. The beef wellington was very good! It was cooked perfectly. The meat was very tender. Make sure to get a little of everything on the plate in each bite because the flavors all go together just right. The fish and chips (truffle fries) was also very good too, fried just right. The portions for both dishes were perfect. We were satisfied, but also not overstuffed. The brussel sprouts side was kind of meh. I think there was too much vinegar in it, but we'll just put that aside and remember the food that blew me away. \n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with my meal and experience here. When you go to Vegas, you are expected to splurge on the food. This splurge was definitely well worth it!"

Close to impeccable but not as perfect as his insane tantrums would warrant. That being said everything is pretty great. I had the "Hell\'s Kitchen" seasonal price fix dinner. All was great, the beef wellington was just under great and a little disappointing as this is one of his signature dishes. I will say our server was great. I would also suggest that the signature cocktails have some more non gin options, I know it\'s supposed to British but how much nature boy can you get? Still worth a stop in for a special dinner. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin\' out loud!'

S'Awesome restaurant, nice vibe to the place. Waiters kind of hover around you which is annoying, but the food makes up for it. Get a steak, since it is a steakhouse. Also the toffee pudding desert at the end of your meal is a must have...no matter how full you are!'

S"An English restaurant in the Paris Hotel?  Oh yeah, they thought of that, you cross through the Chunnel to get here! Cute.\n  \nAnyway, if you're a carnivore with any kind of taste for good steak, this place will treat you right.  A bit pricey, of course, but generally worth it.  I had the famous Beef Wellington, and something about it was really strange.  I mean, unique.  There were some flavors I couldn't quite put my tongue on.  None the less, it was fantastic.  IF you go with a group, you can try lots of different stuff to maximize experience.  \n\nI don't think that my heart can take going back here very often, but it's worth a one-off visit.  I also really like the Paris Hotel, so there is that."

They could get us in two hours later, even when they were told it was an anniversary at booking.  Nice job Gordon, rules like these will make you less successful.'

S'Okay. I won\'t go into detail about our entire experience, but I will point a few things out that I would like to have known pre-dining. We had a reservation and I am glad we did. This place was packed. We sat upstairs, right next to the staircase so we were able to not only look over the entire room, but we got to watch the food servers struggle to carry all of the food up the stairs for every table on the second level. Very entertaining. This place is open and loud and the club music that is piped-in only adds to the noise level. When your waiter asks if you would like a bottle of sparkling or plane water you may also opt for a bottle of house or tap water. We were not given the third option, but when asked if we would like a second bottle I asked about the different looking bottle that sat on a few surrounding tables and was informed that that way "just tap water", to which I replied "We will have one of the tap waters". Not a big deal, its done everywhere but GR bottled water is 8 bucks a bottle. That cuts into my cocktail budget. Our apps and steaks were perfect. We each ordered an addition of marrow for our steaks. One would have been enough for both of us. Kinda felt like the Fintstones with two BIG plates of at least 4 marrow bones, 4 to 5 inches each squeezed onto our 2 top with cocktails, entrees, bottle of water (tap) and water glasses. Server was a bit robotic, but the well prepared food was good enough to overcome that flaw. Pricey as expected. A great meal all around.'

S'I was told before coming to Vegas to book early and not a buffet on Christmas Day.  Which was great advice because many of the good buffets in Vegas had people in line waiting for four hours or more on Christmas.  So prior to coming I made reservations through yelp for Gordon Ramsey Steak inside Paris Hotel.\n\nI arrived about 15 minutes before my reservation for 6:45pm.  We weren\'t seated till 7:00pm but I let it slide due to the fact it was Christmas.  In front there is about five or six tall brunettes that seat guests. As they direct guests to their tables,  guests walk thru the tunnel into the Steakhouse and one of the brunettes will say "You have been transported from Paris to London".  Then she proceeds to take you to your table.  \nGreat, I\'m in London. (Music is thumping) Is London always this loud?  Don\'t take mom here for Mother\'s Day... Ambiance is more for a younger party crowd.\n\nThe server came promptly with an iPad to order drinks.  The water and drinks come very quick.  The service is what you\'d expect from a fine dining restaurant.  Here\'s what we ordered:\n\nShellfish Platter $75: this came out on a three tier platter.  It had Tiger Prawns, King Crab, Lobster Tail, Clams, and Oysters.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  There were about four dipping sauces to choose from.  \n\nMac & Cheese $12:  every famous chef, steakhouse, soul food restaurant, etc have their own version of this dish.  Gordon Ramsey has a good version.  Not the best but good nonetheless.  Interesting to me while in Vegas is that Mac & Cheese is close to $20 at many places.  But Gordon keeps it reasonable with his prices all around for the most part.\n\nBeef Wellington $52:  tender is the first word that comes to mind.  It\'s a nice amount of medium rare meat roasted in the pastry.  I\'d give it 4 stars.\n\nBone-in Ribeye $58:  this was the best part of our meal.  Tender, delicious, juicy 24 once steak.  I know the Beef Wellington is Gordon\'s specialty and its difficult to make yadda yadda, but the ribeye out shines the Wellington.  It\'s the Beyonce out shining the rest of Destinys Child.  Boootylicious.\n\nOne bad note is the restroom looks like I really was transported to a London Pub Restroom, dirty and yuck.  Just hold it till you get back to your suite.  \n\nTotal bill was around $216. It\'s pricey but less than many of the other steakhouses in Vegas.  Excellent service, good food, and worth trying.'

S"Can't tell you how much I was looking forward to the Dinner at GRS.  Now, let me let you know why it is a must avoid.\n\nSteak-  Ordered Mid-Rare and that is how it was cooked.  However, the steak was tougher than Chuck Norris on Steroids.  \nSides-  Roasted Fingerling Potatoes.  These were good, but the fingerling does not roast as well as others.  And I hate purple potato used for roasting.(they look aweful)\n              Mac and Cheese.   Not much flavor here.  Very bland.\n              Fried Green Beans.   Theses were tasty.  A bit salty, but I like that.\n              Onion Soup.   Tasty.  Too small of a portion.\n              Shrimp Cocktail.  This was possibly the worst i've ever had.  No flavor and  \n              completely over-cooked.\n\nDrink-  Rusty Nail.  Bartender nailed this.  Pun intended.\n\nSide Note:  My girlfriend's cousin ordered a Ribeye Mid-Rare WITHOUT char and it came out looking like mine.....COVERED IN CHAR...\n\nAll in all.... Not a good experience.  The steak should have shined and it was no where close.\n\nSide Note 2:  The designer of the restaurant should be commended.  The interior was great."

S"to help celebrate our one year wedding anniversary, the wife and i had to kick it off w/ a delicious meal.  the evening before, we stuffed ourselves at Batali's B&B, so Ramsay would have some big shoes to fill.  we also had to rush dinner just a tad in order to catch le reve later that evening.\n\nupon walking in, the decor was fresh, vibrant and just plain cool.  our server was great.  he asked if we had any time constraints and he said that we would have just enough time to enjoy our meal.\n\nwe started off w/ a couple glasses of wine and the super tasty pastry sampler they brought out.  wow, these little bites were phenomenal.  i especially liked the bonito flake infused pastry puff and the truffle pastry, served w/ rock salted butter.  hell yeah!\n\nalthough i was tempted to try the rib cap steak, i was dying to try the fish n chips.  i LOVE me some fried fish and french fries!  and when they're truffle fries, how can you go wrong?  the dish did not disappoint.  the white fish filets, w/ the tail still left on, were perfectly battered and cooked.  topped w/ what i think was a caper, olive tapenade, type relish and tartar sauce, smeared under the fish, it was absolutely perfect.  the tang, salty and slight sweetness of the condiments balanced well w/ the fried fish.  and the fries, c'mon, the truffle fries were absolutely divine.  just wish they gave a little more.\n\nthe wife had the prime beef filet topped w/ the peppercorn sauce.  we also had the butter sauteed spinach.  the steak was a little undercooked but still delish and was perfect when we ate the leftovers the next morning after nuking it!  (eaten w/ our bacon mac and cheese via room service!  but i digress...)\n\nservice was excellent.  the assistant wait staff were always around to refill our waters or to get us anything else we needed.  and of course our server was great, too.\n\nto finish the meal, we tried the peach medley dessert.  it's peaches done three ways; sorbetto, streusel, and these tasty ice cream sandwiches.  all super yums.  and guess what?  upon walking out the restaurant, we had made perfect time to go pick up our tickets.  couldn't have asked for more."

S"The Atmosphere:  5/5  A cool design with the chunnel bar separating the lounge from the two story dining room.  The open kitchen ads to the energy.  The servers & bar staff are all wearing classy dress shirts with suspenders and ties, (some of the guys could have their shirts tailored though to perfect the look).  The cutlery, plate-ware, linens and glassware were unique and classy. They looked and felt very expensive, these little touches add value for me.\n\nThe Food: 5/5  The shrimp cocktail was good, The Beef Wellington was incredible!  Probably the most flavorful piece of beef I've ever enjoyed. It's one of those types of dishes that many restaurants are scared to serve because it can taste pretty ordinary if it's not prepared correctly.  I won't be ordering it anywhere else because Gordon Ramsey's version has set the bar too high.   Also, get the sticky toffee dessert, our server suggested it and we really enjoyed that too.  I'll get the Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee dessert again but I'll try other apps and sides next time.\n\nThe Drinks:  5/5  Between my wife and I, we ordered the strawberry martini, two Drifters, HK Antioxidant, Pims Cup and a cappuccino with dessert.  We are normally wine drinkers but we saw a lot of value in their cocktails.  The Drifter was my favorite (I love a good whiskey) and my wife enjoyed the HK antioxidant the most.\n\nThe Service: 4/5  We arrived without a reservation and found two seats at the bar.  When we sat down, the bar staffed were getting crushed by the nonstop drink orders and all of the bar guests.  Their cocktails are pretty labor intensive, so they take awhile to make.  Once they caught up, all three of them were very attentive and personable.  We didn't have to wait long for the food at all.  The restaurant just opened three weeks ago and the staff is probably still working out a lot of kinks, hence a few poor yelp reviews about the pace of service.  We had very friendly service at the bar and we'll sit there again.\n\nSummary:  My wife and I own two restaurants and are big fans of eating at chef driven restaurants when we go out.  We've been to Vegas every year for the last five years and Gordon Ramsey's Steak was one of our fondest memories of any of our Las Vegas trips.  Can't wait to go back!"

Said they would be working as a team for us tonight.\n\nGuess someone's got to pay the bills lol.  And i haven't gotten into the decor, but it's what you expect from a high-end steakhouse.\n\nOrdered the Royal long bone ribeye, amazing tenderness & seasoning. For the sides, added the fingerling potatoes, bite-sized, felt a bit over-rated.  But the sauteed mushrooms were good, probably the only thing I'd order again.\n\nAnd yes, the sticky toffee pudding was deleesh.\n\nCustomer service superb.\n\nWorth going again but it's not something I'd wait for."

S'DATE/TIME: March 24, 2013 // 10:15pm\n\nPRICE: $50-$100/person\nVALUE:  The prices are pretty typical of a higher end steakhouse.\nAMBIANCE: Lots of reds, blacks, and grays. As mentioned by many other Yelpers, you enter through a "tube" (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6uhas67fyLO3rEi1f1VMNw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg) that "transports you from Paris to London." Sounded kitschy to me at first but is actually more tastefully done than I initially expected. The dining area itself is a huge two-story dining room with large red neon artwork (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XbS7ww57AwhWY9VhmdPCsw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg) at the center of the ceiling, which the hostess pointed out as she seated us. It is an artist\'s interpretation of Gordon Ramsay\'s hand movements while making his signature dish: the Beef Wellington of Hell\'s Kitchen fame. Ambient lights are attached to a wire that runs across the walls. Music is a bit on the louder side, definitely not the typical stuffy place designed for hushed tones and mousey eating.\nSERVICE: Our server checked up on us frequently and filled up our waters often, but rightfully seemed a bit like she was anxious to go home by the end of the night. (We were one of the last people to leave)\nCHANCE OF RETURNING: 60%\n___________________________________\n\n[ ACTUAL RATING: 3.5* ]\n\nThis place, like so many of Gordon Ramsay\'s newer restaurants since I last went to Maze in New York, is clearly catered towards his Hell\'s Kitchen fan base. They even have a "Hell\'s Kitchen Tasting Menu." Seriously. Kudos to the growing empire for capitalizing on the media-inspired fame as well as they have.\n\nThe meal was definitely good - not quite mind blowing (don\'t expect something comparable to a Michelin-starred restaurant) but definitely a decent steakhouse. If there weren\'t so many places still on my list of destinations in Vegas, my chances of returning might be closer to 70%.\n\nThe wine and cocktail menu is available on an iPad, like that at Charlie Palmer\'s Aureole.\n\nUnfortunately, by the end of our meal we had no space at all for dessert. I might be back sometime before the end of this trip to try the STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING at the bar, which consists of a sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, and brown butter ice cream.\n\nTIP: If you don\'t already have a Total Rewards card, get one. It only shaves $1-$3 per dish but that\'s money you can allocate towards a higher gratuity for your hard-working servers! ;-)\n\n___________________________________\n\n:::: [ THE FOOD ] ::::\n\n* BREAD TRAY\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Pvi2lZcSgkHc0gEiaEpw7w&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [4/5 - We were served with 6 kinds of room temperature bread including a pancetta brioche, black truffle brioche, and blue cheese and walnut bread. On the side was a somewhat cold imported butter. My favorite hands down was the black truffle brioche, though the blue cheese and walnut bread was also pretty good. I couldn\'t really taste the pancetta in the pancetta brioche, which I was actually most excited about when the tray arrived at our table.]\n* SEARED FOIE GRAS - $25 \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QytfTD2Hpp1yWcvuV30xiQ&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [3.75/5 - Perfectly seared creamy foie gras, delicious huckleberry, and marcona almonds. This is nowhere near the top 10 foie gras dishes I\'ve tried, but that\'s coming from someone who actively seeks both Michelin-starred as well as regular mid-range restaurants who fellow Yelpers claim serve great foie gras. Be sure to use every drop of the sauce on the plate or you will find your foie gras disappointingly bland.]\n* ROASTED BEEF WELLINGTON FOR 2 - $100\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7sjGYKbej_1IkprjvGR1Sw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [3.75/5 - Served with a red wine demi glace, potato puree, and glazed root vegetables. The pastry portion of the beef wellington seems to be where all of the sodium is allocated, so be sure to portion your bites of meat with enough of it or you won\'t have even distribution of seasoning. The glazed root vegetables seems like an afterthought. Coming from someone who loves purees and generally soft, creamy, foods - the potato puree is a bit more liquefied than I\'m used to - it could\'ve been slightly richer and just a tiiiiiiiiny bit better seasoned. While I prefer to include a bit of each ingredient on the plate with each bite, I also like to start my meal by trying everything on it\'s own and am especially pleased when every element manages to "carry their own weight."]\n* MAC & CHEESE - $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MjlAOhIvQrSWmo0YRi7dPw&userid=BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg\n              - [3/5 - A combination of blue, cheddar, and parmesan cheese with truffle. Mediocre mac & cheese. Not that well-flavored.]'

S"I was invited back by the manager Amanda about a year and a half ago. We saved her email and had a trip planned to take my sister n law and her fianc\xc3\xa9 to Vegas in December, They are both physicians visiting us from Europe. So Amanda made a reservation for us on Saturday 12/21 at 7 pm. She was very helpful with this process. \n\nWhen we arrived we had a seat in the bar and was taken to our table promptly. We were introduced to Amanda and our waiter. First we ordered wine (of course) two of us had The Prisoner. We got a couple appetizers Foie gras, onion soup, and the beet and goat cheese salad.  Everything was very good.\n\nFor dinner, two of us had the beef Wellington (very moist filet, melted in my mouth, perfect toasted phyllo dough and perfect taste). Kobe filet mignon was also ordered and that was very good, we got three sides, creamed spinach (very yummy), fingerling potatoes (delish! Omg yummy amount of salt and I believe Parmesan cheese), then I tried the mushrooms again and they were better than last time not too salty, my sis n law loved them.\n\nDessert!!!  Exquisite, Heavenly, sinful, we ordered the toffee pudding. It came with toffee butter ice cream. The presentation was fabulous, the ice cream was shaped like a stick of butter and the dessert was a great size but we definitely all wanted more it was sooooooooo good. That alone I would go back for. So don't miss out on that, please. \n\nHands down I have to say the service was phenomenal!

S"I went here on Friday night for my fancy birthday dinner with the BF. There were some definite highs and some lows. Let me start by saying this place was suuuuuper fancy. Like....they import their water in from Wales (I really don't understand that...seems extremely wasteful to me....), they present raw steaks on a special steak presenting thing with mirrors on it....whoa.... Also, they give you an ipad to look at the drink menu...this is kind of dumb because the real menu is not on an ipad, so it didn't really make sense. Anyway, on to the food! They start you out with 4 different types of bread...one more delicious than the next, with butter and volcanic sea salt or something fancy. One of the breads tasted like bacon....yum. I ordered the beef wellington and the BF ordered the short ribs and, at the waiter's recommendation, we got the mac and cheese. Well, the wellington was good, but it wasn't amazing. The beef was great, it was very soft, but the crust just didn't have much flavor. The potato puree was very very tasty and so were the roasted vegetables. The BF's short ribs were good, but not as soft as short ribs usually are. The sauce was very good though. The mac and cheese was too bleu chees -y (despite the waiter telling us you couldn't even taste the bleu cheese). Also, the portions were very large, especially for a fancy restaurant. I'm not sure why the waiter made it seem like we needed a side, we definitely did not. We ended up sending the mac and cheese back....it wasn't bad, but it wasn't to our tastes. We finished with the sticky toffee pudding which was ridiculously good. The caramel was rich and the butter ice cream was crazy good. The presentation was also cute. This place was overall good, but for the price, I didn't think it had enough 'yummyness.' I liked Spago better when I've gone in the past, but this place is definitely an experience and I'd recommend giving it a try."

S"Don't get me wrong- the steak was absolutely Sex on a plate!\n\nI am stopping short at 4 stars merely because the noise level and size of the small table we were seated at made the experience little uncomfortable. We were seated upstairs against the railing at a small round table. With bread, a bottle of wine, water and cocktails all at the same time there was so little space that I nearly killed a waiter below with a small plate that slid off the table and came crashing down to the kitchen below narrowly missing a waitstaff...\n\nService was spot-on, attentive without being overbearing. I tried to get our waiter to swear at me, asking him to tell me to F_CK OFF Ramsay style off with no avail...\n\nStarted with Onion soup while my girlfriend had a salad. Both excellent. Then onto the tortellini, delicious. Moving on I had the American Kobe Rib Cap - this is the fatty outer edge of a ribeye steak - it was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever ate. The absolute star of the show was my girlfriends American Kobe Filet Mignon. It melted in your mouth like butter and was actually larger than the 8oz promised, I guess it was 10oz. Steak will never be the same for me.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Sex on a plate. Not to be missed."

My friend and I bought the bone-in and ribeye and beef wellington and then split it.  They put each half of wellington over potato puree on its own plate, but the ribeye came on its own plate, and we had to divide it ourselves.

S"Love, Love, Love Gordon Ramsey! Ignore the TV personality and you've got a chef with high standards that loves to cook. That being said, I had to try this restaurant.\nHubby got us flights, I made the reservation and it was off to LV last Saturday evening for dinner after a family yard sale that didn't even pay for the cab ride!\nWe were seated in a booth that was cozy and gave us a view of the Union Jack and the red squiggly light thingy on the ceiling. We were told it was the knife cuts created while preparing the Beef Wellington. Interesting....\nCool iPad menu for the drinks! Too bad it didn't have pics of the food menu as well. But we got a good look at most of the dishes as they passed us by. I had to try the Beef Wellington since he seems to be such a stickler about the dish on Hell's Kitchen. I've prepared the version on his iPad app but never really had one before that.  The dish was on the Chef's tasting menu so we ordered that, mine with the wine and hubby without. \nThe Amuse was a Scotch Egg. I loved how the velvelty yolk calmed the acid in the red wine braised cabbage. Fantastic with the Champagne\nThe Heirloom Tomatoes were fresh and juicy. The basil crystals were delicious! Very ingenious!\nNext course was the asparagus soup. You know how veggie soups are always overcooked veggies blended with an overpowering amount of butter and cream to the point that the only thing about the soup that's remotely vegetable is the color? Wow! Delicious asparagus concoction surrounding a parmesan custard. The dungeness crab was just enough and the pickled white asparagus gave a bright acidity that matched the beauty of the plate!\nFinally! The Wellington! Cooked perfectly! The beef was so tender and the pastry was cook through. I could've licked my plate but I settled for using the different yummy breads we were given to wipe up the delicious red wine demi glace\nThe Melon Panna Cotta was a light refreshing end to a truly wonderful meal. But we kept seeing the other fantastic desserts pass by so we HAD to try them with coffee.\nFrench pressed coffee with chocolate liquor covered spoons: Amaretto, Baileys and Chambord! Yum Yum Yum! A plate of Bannoffee Tarts and another of Toffee Pudding were placed in front of us and we immediately fought over the Toffee Pudding. OOOhhh so wicked! The toffee that is. The Bannoffee was more of a deconstruction of the actual pie. I would've preferred the actual pie. The bananas were turning black and there was only a smear of the toffee on the plate. \nA truly wonderful dinner to celebrate my 41st!  Our waiter, Matthew, was very attentive and even brought the meat cart to show us what we had missed. So we HAVE to return so I can take a stab at that rib eye! And swim in another bowl of that lovely asparagus soup!"

Post-vacation, I still believe that our date night at Gordon Ramsay Steak was my favorite part of our weekend getaway!\n\nGR Steak is located inside the Paris Hotel, right in the middle of the casino at the front of the hotel. The seating hostesses/kiosk are actually right outside of the restaurant, and I don't think they let you in unless you have a reservation or they're ready to take you inside.\n\nWe had made a reservation several months in advance, although I don't think you need to wait THAT long to reserve ahead of time. When you first enter, you are in a cylindrical tunnel that serves as the restaurant bar. Apparently it is supposed to represent the London Tube, and represents you traveling from Paris (the hotel) into England, GR's homeland.\n\nWhile waiting for our table to be setup, they had seated us at the bar. After about a 5-10 minute wait, we were finally seated at our table, kind of off to the side near the kitchen/bathrooms.\n\nI was kind of surprised at how busy/noisy it was in the restaurant. I knew it would be popular with GR's name tacked onto it, but it was a lot bigger and noisier than I had expected. Not a super intimate, romantic date nice restaurant. More trendy and lively.\n\nService was EXCELLENT at GR Steak! Our waiter, Freddy, was awesome. He came out and introduced himself, and then provided us with an iPad 2 that had the entire drink menu on it. It was really awesome because it showed photos of each mixed drink, the list of ingredients, etc. Then it had the beer and wine list as well. The last tab consisted of a photo and biography of Gordon Ramsay.\n\nThey also had a tasting menu, complete with autographed keepsake photo of Gordon Ramsay, but it looked pretty heavy and was also very expensive so we opted out of it. Freddy wheeled around a cart to our table and explained all of the different cuts of meat. Very informative and I loved the visual display. Freddy's speech was a bit scripted, but he said it with a smile and was very polite and well-mannered, which I really enjoyed! The guy who brought out our food/bussed our table was also super friendly and very courteous! Excellent service as well.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n--BREAD--\nOk, I had to mention this because they give you four types of bread with this butter that supposedly has volcanic salt on it, and omg, this is probably some of the best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant. All 4 types were incredible and I felt like I almost got full just from the bread! AND when the guy packed our to-go boxes, he packed us a fresh batch of new bread and butter! SO AWESOME!\n\n--DRINKS--\nPIMMS CUP: \nWasn't a huge fan. I was interested because it had Pimms lemonade but it didn't taste that great. Also I felt like it had too much stuff added into it, like different slices of fruit and mint leaves.\n\nWYDERS PEAR CIDER:\nThe description literally said it would give a pleasant ticklish kick. Definitely did!\n\n--STEAKS--\nBEEF WELLINGTON:\nSo, I basically felt obligated to order this because I knew Beef Wellington is Chef Ramsay's signature dish. I've never had Beef Wellington before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I really loved the flakiness of the crust, and it blew my mind how it wasn't soggy at all! The meat was soft and delicious. I could also taste the lining of foie gras and that was pretty interesting. I didn't LOVE the foie gras but I thought it was good.\n\nKOBE FILET MIGNON:\nMy boyfriend decided to YOLO and go with the Kobe filet mignon. Pricey, but totally worth it! I had a piece and omg, that was some melt in your mouth steak! He could not get over how good it was and said it was the best steak he's ever had. Excellent!\n\n--SIDE DISH--\nTRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE:\nI LOVE me some truffles AND mac n cheese, so this was a winner! Super ooey gooey and cheesy, just the way I like it!\n\n--DESSERT--\nSTICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING WITH BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM: OMG, this was SO FREAKING GOOD! I was really sad that I didn't finish mine because I was already so full...but seriously, I was in love with this dessert. I would go back JUST for the dessert. Interestingly enough, I thought that the ice cream was much sweeter than the sticky toffee pudding. They complimented each other very well and it was great! Highly recommend!\n\nOverall I think my boyfriend spent around $250. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would come back again for sure! :) Great job, Chef Ramsay and staff!"

S"The hubs and I spent a week in Vegas in October 2012.  With so many options in LV, we were looking forward to some amazing food and a great time.  For the most part we were not disappointed, until we went to Gordon Ramsay Steak on our last evening in town.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes prior to our 9pm reservation (which we had made 2 months in advance).  The hostess didn't bother to look up from her book when we checked in with her.  She rudely pointed out that we were early and that we'd be seated at our reservation time.  We proceeded to the bar where we had a few beers.  Our bartender was very warm and attentive (the only good part of the visit).  While at the bar we watched many couples/groups come in after us that were seated after a minimal wait.  At 9:30 I checked in with the hostess again.  She once again did not look up from her book and simply told me we'd be seated once our table was ready.  At 9:45 we had still not been seated (again, our reservation was for 9pm).  I can certainly understand a wait at a restaurant, but I didn't appreciate that everyone around us was being seated and we were not.  We asked the bartender to close our tab and we were prepared to leave.  However, she went and spoke to the hostess and all of a sudden our table was ready.  We contemplated leaving anyway, but decided to stay.  We were seated upstairs and, to my surprise, there were many empty tables.  \n\nOnce seated it took our server another 20 minutes to show up.  Before placing our order my husband mentioned having a food allergy.  To be clear, he never asks for a plate to be modified, he simply asks if the dish he is ordering is safe for him to eat, so that otherwise he can order something else.  The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to deal with this.\n\nAt the end of the day my husband had a filet and i had the short ribs.  My husband was impressed with his meal, but my short ribs were very gristly.  Unfortunately though, it really wouldn't have mattered if the food had been mind-blowing.  Poor service is just unacceptable to me, especially at an expensive restaurant.  We just wanted to get out of there, so we finished our meals and left, no dessert.\n\nWe had been so excited to eat at Gordon Ramsay Steak, I wish it had been different.  We were treated like we should have been grateful to eat there.  We will not be going back.  Too many great options in LV to put up with this nonsense."

S"This place was truly delicious. Their ribeye probably ranks second on the list of steaks that I've tried behind Mastros in Beverly Hills. However, I tried a few bites of Ramsey's rib cap, and that, by far, is the best steak I've ever had. It's a shame they give you such a small cut for such a high price - I usually want to eat at least an 18oz steak if I'm paying more than $50 for it! But that aside, it was simply amazing. One of my favorite things this restaurant did was to present the uncooked steaks to us so we would know what we were ordering - the steaks they showed us were beautiful - I could stare at them forever!\n\nThe sides were also really good - the one that stood out to me was the bone marrow. Cooked to perfection. I tried the bone marrow at Wicked Spoon the day after and it was such a disappointment - could not compare. \n\nEverything that this restaurant served was delicious."

S"Gordan Ramsey Steak is a sexy, trendy dinning destination.  The music is loud, the hemlines are short, and the food is fantastic.\n\nThe cocktail menu is full of hand-crafted libations.  Both the South Side and English Garden were fresh, well balanced and delicious.\n\nFor appetizers, the Fried Blue Point Oysters had a light tempura batter and came with sea asparagus and creme fresh tartar sauce.\n\nThe seared Foie Gras was perfection with hazel nuts, gooseberry reduction and goat cheese popovers.  If you like foie gras, this is a must order.\n\nFor entrees, the Beef Wellington's 28-day dry aged fillet mignon was so tender and lovingly wrapped in layers of flavor. \n\nThe bone-in dry aged Ribeye was again very tender, had a deep beefy flavor, and a charred crust from the intense searing.\n\nFor sides, the Brussels Sprouts were charred and had the perfect acidic tang, and the Bone Marrow was silky and had rich flavor especially at the charred ends of the bone.\n\nAnd save room for coffee and dessert!  The Cappuccino is delicious and comes with 3 cordial spoons (Amaretto, Baileys, and Chambord) and the sweet Sticky Toffee Pudding with Browned Butter Ice Cream is worth over stuffing yourself for!\n\nGordon Ramsey Steak is a great place to celebrate with friends when you're partying in style.  Thank you to our server Anthony and runner Alexis for an epic meal!"

S'Superb restaurant.  Steak very very good almost perfect. Probably one of the best steaks ever ( and I have been to many).  And the sides are excellent. Definitely would go back again if I go to vegas. Service was very friendly and genuine unlike alot of american restaurants whos service is all about the tip/ gratuities.  Conclusion: excellent food and service but alittle noisy (but hey we are in vegas.......what the hell turn up the music).'

S"Awesome outfits. White collars blue shirts, burgundy ties and suspenders. Cufflinks. Elbow cuffs. Great team look, while still allowing for some individual personality.  Ultra professional.  Score.\n\nI am yet to understand how restaurants these days put so much attention to all of their liquid offerings, but completely skip beer. Not just with the diners pleasure in mind, but also in the purse of the restaurant owner.  We're both losers.  Blue Moon, Pacifico, and Newcastle for drafts? Yikes. Why do I want a top notch craft aged/butchered steak, paired with bargain basement produced for the masses beer?  Epic failure.\n\nThe restaurant was busy, and actually admiditaly got caught off guard by a very large party.  There was an exceptional wait for the dinner that I had ordered.  They did however keep me well lubricated.  They ended up comping me for 2 glasses of wine.  $28 each.  Very nice gesture.\n\nCaesar salad. Disassembled full length leaves of romaine. Oddly they looked completely un-dressed, but somehow they were.  Even though taste was good, major failure in that I had to cut my salad with a knife.  I am ok with that if it's a wedge salad, as it is quite manageable.  Loose full length leaves of romaine aren't quite as agreeable.  Especially after a pre-order cocktail, and a couple of glasses of wine.\n\nBig standout from the bread tray - fig/bacon mini cinnamon roll looking thing. Amazing.\n\nSteak was everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  Cooked and presented to perfection.  Absolutely delicious."

S'Gordon had me like Woah!\n\nWhile we waited for our party to arrive we had delicious drinks at the bar. The "drifter" and the "English garden," unique presentation was a nice touch. \n\nI was eager to try the beef Wellington after seeing him make it on TV.  That was my order and it was not a let down.  Other dishes worth a mention are: the bone in rib eye A+ sides of potatoes and asparagus also deserve an A rating. \n\nMust also give credit to the wait staff. They were very attentive and helpful.  Our waiter recommended getting the toffee pudding cake for dessert and it was the bomb diggity!\n\nThe only negatives are that the menu is a bit too pricey, and the atmosphere is a bit lackluster for Vegas.'

S"After watching a ton of his shows on TV, I've been wanting to try some of his signature items to see if he lives up to his reputation.\n\nThis is one of his Vegas flagships. It was my first time here but hubby had been here before and loved it. Trendy decor and cute story about going through the Chunnel from Paris to London when you're being seated.\n\nExcellent service at the table! The hostesses aren't the most consistent, but the table service is excellent. Nice explanation of the menu and steak cuts.\n\nThese are the highlights and what I would definitely recommend getting:\n- Beef Wellington - it's the signature item and sooo good. The layers are perfect and the meat inside is incredibly flavorful\n- Sticky toffee pudding - another classic dish that totally lived up to the hype. Definitely good for sharing after a big meal.\n\nBread service is lovely with a nice variety to choose from, and we also enjoyed the salad to start (not unique, but a nice starter if you need vegetables).  The Mac and cheese side is totally the way to go with your steak.  Rich and creamy with a good firmness to the pasta.\n\nSolid 4 stars and worth a stop if you're in Vegas!\n\nDinner runs about $100 pp without alcohol."

S'Everything I ordered are absolutely delicious from pork belly appetizer that just melts in your mouth, foie gras that is absolutely Devine! And the enormous wine selection.... If you like Rhone they have lots to choose from, I ordered beef Wellington, and this is actually the fort time I had it, I like my steak plane and simple and its actually not bad.... My husband had a fillet with foie gras and he really enjoy it!'

S'Steaks are awesome, but kinda expensive for the serving size. Las Vegas Strip pricing in effect, for sure. Weird red lighting everywhere. Like the uncomfortable red-lit scenes from the 1981 Disney bomb "The Devil and Max Devlin" starring Elliott Gould and Bill Cosby. Surprised that Gordon Ramsay approved of the lighting in here. They say that the color red makes you hungry...\n\nCap Of Ribeye ($60) a.k.a. Spinalis steak, is my favorite cut, even more so than Hanger Steak. Both are extremely hard to find, and special orders even at the best independent butcher shops. So maybe it\'s worth the splurge after all?\n\nThe English Chowder ($18) is pretty terrible. Don\'t even think of ordering it. Exactly one tiny scallop, one minuscule bit of fish, and 3 halves of a fingerling potato. Boring white chowder with a unnecessarily snazzy presentation - they pour the soup in front of you.\n\nBottom line: Gordon Ramsay Steak will do just fine, regardless of the lighting (or the crappy Chowder).'

S'Foremost, you may wish to consider requesting a booth upstairs. These over-sized, semi-circular areas allow for a much more intimate experience. It was the consensus of our party that it seemed to block noise ... and it also allowed for a nice overview of the vibrant, beautiful establishment.\n\nAdditionally, set aside about ninety-minutes for this experience (if you invest in multiple courses). And, let me assure you, it is well worth your time. (Seriously, relish this time away from the cheesy chaos of Vegas). \n\nNow, our server was the absolute best. (I wish I could remember his name!) He was charming, warm, knowledgeable, and attentive. (The "meat lecture," complete with rolling visual-aids, was fascinating ... trust me, you will enjoy it!) While everyone in my party ordered these lovely pieces of meat, I am a vegetarian (and did not want to spoil anyone\'s night out). When I told the server, he did not blink (or scoff), instead, he immediately accommodated me (he set me up with a beautiful beet salad and a variety of sides that were the equivalent of a hearty meal). This amazing man also assisted us in selecting the perfect beer to accompany our entrees (the Fin du Monde was simply spot-on). This culinary genius also selected the perfect sauce for each entree ... without hesitation or pretense. \n\nEach person raved about his/her experience. One person literally said it was the first time in months that someone genuinely got "medium rare" right. And, while no one was a bit hungry, we still had to try the sticky toffee pudding. Now, if you have had the push-up pops at BurGr and thought you experienced the "real deal," you have not. The push-up pops are fun (we enjoyed those), but this was AMAZING! The interplay of hot and cold is essential to the enjoyment of this dessert ... try it, you will agree.\n\nIn essence, the food was delicious. But, in complete honesty, it was this server that made our experience "five-stars." He was not pretentious (as we suspected may happen here and were entire wrong about), he was not "pushy," he was not dismissive ... he was a professional, super nice, sweetheart who literally made our night! (And, we are still talking about him two weeks later!)\n\nKnow that this is an experience, not just "a meal." Instead of throwing money into a slot machine, why not spend it here, bonding with family and friends. \n\nChef Ramsay has certainly created a bastion of sanity in an otherwise crazy place! Thank you so much for that! We will never forget our visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak.'

S'I have avoided writing this review for some time because I\'m worried it won\'t be good enough, perfect enough to explain just how good this restaurant is. I have to say up front that I an an unapologetic whore for Gordon Ramsay- I\'m one of those people you will overhear at a cocktail party saying "Oh no the BRITISH kitchen nightmares is so much better...", I make all my friends watch The F Word on youtube, and probably have some weird form of Stockholm Syndrome for him. It\'s a lot of pressure to live up to- but now it\'s time to face my demon. \n\nThis restaurant blew me away. BLOWN. I have been to super fancy expensive restaurants and I have been to high priced steak houses, but this is the first time at a steakhouse where they actually carried over all the snooty elements of fine dining and executed it perfectly with the steak theme. It\'s even inside the Paris- the most unjustifiable snooty casino on the strip!\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty cool inside- from the decor to the place-mats to the knives and forks- everything about it is sleek, fancy, and solid. This isn\'t an exaggeration, I actually considered purchasing the leather place mats they serve everything on (and it turns out they do in fact sell them). It\'s a little bit louder than you would expect at a rest of the world fine dining restaurant but actually quieter than the average Vegas restaurant full of wooo girls so try and control yourself while eating. \n\nThe Staff- so fancy. I was dressed nice but the waiter outfits actually made me feel like a bit of a slob. The staff is great- I am a bit of a stickler on drink refills and I don\'t think my water glass ever got more than 2 sips down before someone swooped in to refill it- that\'s quality service. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the different kinds of meat, what ingredients were in the side dishes, and didn\'t even get visibly annoyed at the barrage of questions he was faced with. \n\nOk onto the food. First of all- the bread is legit. They have a bacon/fig brioche that is preposterously good- make sure you order lots of extra as they may try and trick you by only bringing one for the table- everyone will want their own. \n\nThe cocktails- I have had a few... That may or may not have influenced my positive review (trixy hobits). My favorites are the Side Car and the Drifter (they change this sometimes but all the bourbon drinks have been good- and helloooooo giant ice ball I can swish around in my glass for an air of faux sophistication\n\nAs per steak list guidelines I always get bone in ribeye, potato side, mac and cheese- but there is a sub rule to this that many people don\'t know about and that is " if there is a pork belly appetizer- order it". \n\nPork belly- hot damn this was good. It comes with cheesy grits and a tomato jam which sounds like waffle house (covered with ketchup) but I apologized in my head for that comparison the second I tasted it- its good. \n\nRibeye- this was fantastic. It had an almost rock hard crust on the outside that was nice and salty. Despite this torched exterior the inside was a very dark pink/almost red color after being ordered medium rare. Even the outer edges /fat of the steak had been seared deliciously. It was incredible. And also it was served very hot, which is my preference. \n\nMac and Cheese- nailed it. A lot of truffle mac and cheeses are basically garbage- its some fancy cheese that doesn\'t melt well with random bread on top and then doused in truffle oil. Not so here- all the flavors went together perfectly, and the mac had clearly spent actual time in an oven as not only was the top crust crispy but many of the noodles on top were also crunchy- something I like. \n\nPuree- yes this has CRAAAAIM FRAIIIIIICHE in it- and it is amazing. It is so smooth it almost boggles the mind. It is almost like a sauce- and yes you can dip your steak in it and it\'s incredible. \n\nDessert\nThe first time I got a cheese cake and it was probably the best dessert I have ever had. Many cheese cakes come with a strawberry sauce on top of them- pretty standard. This one came with a strawberry sorbet on top - and the temperature and texture of that sorbet took cheese cake to a whole different level. \n\nThe coffee- ORDER IT. It comes with 3 spoons that are a combination of chocolate and liquor for you to mix in. \n\n\nIn closing, haters gonna hate- if you really didn\'t enjoy this restaurant I assume you are some sort of comedic foil who exists just to troll the rest of tasteful humanity.'

S"One of the best reasons I'm happy to be alive is STEAK.  Life would be oh so boring without it.  For date night, we couldn't figure out where we wanted to eat at since we weren't too hungry and it was already 9:30pm...most places were closing at 10pm but thankfully, Gordon Ramsay keeps his doors open until 10:30pm.\n\nThe restaurant, especially the entrance, reminds me of a club...a well-lit club.  We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar area and didn't have to wait to get a table.  We were given an amazing plate of different kinds of bread. 2 were aged parmesan, 1 bacon, 1 mushroom and 2 lemony breads. In a world full of free sourdough bread, complimentary bread got exciting again. We got the medium rare 24oz dry-aged bone-in rib eye, fingerling potatoes and mac n cheese.\n\nDRY-AGED BONE-IN RIBEYE: their medium rare is bloodier than usual but I'd rather eat a bloody steak than a hockey puck.  It was tender and no sauce was needed. Just pure meaty perfection. 5/5\n\nFINGERLING POTATOES: with parmesan and truffle...they were flavorful. The perfect side for a awesome piece of meat 5/5\n\nMAC N CHEESE: with peas, truffle and 3 different cheeses - blue, cheddar and parmesan.  It was tasty, rich and quite heavy. 4/5\n\nFor personal reasons, we skipped dessert. The service was alright. For the price and quality of meat we got, I may have found a new favorite steak place in Vegas.  But no, I still love Mario Batali."

S"A true Las Vegas classic and it took me about ten trips to Sin City to check this one off my list. Tucked away in the 'no man's land' north of Wynn/Encore and south of Riviera, this place is easy to miss unless you're up for a bit of a hike from mid-Strip or have a car at your disposal. My party started with the appetizer sampler platter which could've nearly stuffed the three of us in and of itself. Hand-dipped onion rings, bruschetta and fried mozzarella sticks that were obviously also hand-cut and hand-dipped. All with the requisite dipping accoutrements. So happy. Two of us had the giant pesto burger as an entree and as delicious as the medium-well (ordered medium so I'll order med-rare next time) beef patty on brioche was, I could only eat about half. Good thing I had a fridge in my hotel room as this made for a wonderful snack (even when cold) the next evening.\n\nThe atmosphere is as many others say. Like a fully-blown Vegased out version of an all-American diner. Think Denny's with a neon problem. Just lovely and fits the Strip to a tee. Service was great the night we were there and beverage refills were quick and without having to ask.\n\nWe stepped into the separate lounge next door to have a look before leaving and were simply awestruck. Why did we bother with the restaurant when we could have certainly ordered from a bar menu here and enjoyed giant frou-frou drinks while we waited. So that just whet my appetite for my next sojourn to Vegas.\n\nIt's a timeless classic in a town that insists on constantly reinventing itself. Just go. It probably won't change or close anytime soon, but don't take any chances!"

S"Remember those nights when you were absolutely gone and coming back from a club and needing some type of sustenance? Remember when you would hit up Denny's and wreak havoc on their menus, staff and bathrooms? Well, when you're in Vegas, fuck Denny's. Peppermill is here.\n\nI don't know what kind of theme this place is going for. Everything about it screams cum stained strip club from the velvet seats to the neon ceiling lighting. I mean everytime I come here I seriously am anticipating fog to come out of one of the planters and up comes up Trixie the Tranny to start dancing. It's just reaaallly weird to be in this place but it's so exciting! Like I said, the place itself looks like a strip club, but the menus and the theme are completely different. I guess it's just bad marketing ideas for whatever they're trying to pull off.\n\nAside from the decor, the food is fantastic. Big plates of just pure American feast. And if you didn't know already, when you order their omelettes or anything with eggs, they use 10 eggs. Yeah. TEN. The hash browns are perfection. I highly doubt you'll ever finish your food, but if you do, you should enter yourself in an Eating Competition. And when you do finish your food, make sure there's a bathroom nearby that you can destroy. On top of all this, the staff is really nice! Kick ass staff and kick ass food in a kick ass strip club!

S'I have been going to the Peppermill forever and throughout the years it has remained one of those Very-Vegas places to eat. Though the times and the menu have changed a bit over the years, the atmosphere of the place has remained pretty much the same. \n\nThe menu changing is actually a good thing. The portion of the food have diminished somewhat, which makes their meals much more manageable. They used to be so large that you were almost forced to eat too much. Now, they are just about right.\n\nThe place can get crowded at times and depending on who is taking care of you, the service can be touch and go. But, this restaurant remains a must go to on the Vegas strip. It is like stepping back by a decade or two.'

S'This is a great place to eat on The Strip.  You get big portions for cheap.  Most places on The Strip cost an arm and a leg for a good meal.  The menu is huge too.  You can get breakfast, lunch, or a dinner at just about any time of day.  However, be prepared to wait, whatever time of day it is, you will more than likely have to wait for a table.  And the service is ok.  But the food and prices are worth it.'

S'We wandered out of the glaring sunlight and retreated to the cavernous wonder that is the Fireside Lounge.  This is the home of fire leaping up out of bubbling water that gently cycles through the color spectrum, surrounded by plush purple couches, and music videos of live performances that span the generations (The Beach Boys, Paul Simon, Aretha, Hall and Oats, Coldplay, you get the idea).  There is plastic bougainvillea everywhere, creating little oases of privacy, despite the mirrored ceilings.  Purple, pink, and turquoise lights add to the "ambiance."  Nothing about this place is real.  It\'s Vegas, after all.  Get out of the hot Vegas sun and soak up some fireside kitsch.  This is the Vegas your parents remember.  And it\'s awesome.'

S'Not fantastic, not horrible.\n\nFirst of all, man! This place gets crowded. If you can, head straight for the counter for immediate seating. Otherwise, you may be doomed to a 20-30 minute wait, if not more (depending on what time of day/night you\'re trying to get your grub on.)\n\nMenu is nothing spectacular and is pretty standard. The Peppermill is really known for atmosphere and portion size. And the portions are pretty big. Hell, the cup of coffee was a thing of beauty for a coffee drinker like me.\n\nI opted for the eggs Benedict. My waitress uttered "good choice" when I ordered, so I expected something fabulous. What I got was .. eggs Benedict. Hey, poached eggs aren\'t exactly easy to get perfect, so I give them credit for perfectly cooked eggs with just the right amount of runny yolk. Other than that .. pretty standard. You do get 3 eggs instead of the usual 2, and a large portion of hash brown potatoes. Add your own salt and pepper and/or Tabasco, because the hollandaise sauce is pretty flavorless.\n\nOh, if you sit at the counter, watch your neighbors. The idiot that plopped down on the stool next to me decided he needed cream for his coffee and .. without a word to me .. reached across my plate to take cream out of the supply my waitress left for me. Didn\'t even apologize after he did it and realized that it wasn\'t "for everyone". D.B.'

The hashbrowns were great, crispy and seasoned well. \n\nI ordered the sausage scramble on top of hashbrowns with a cheese sauce.

S"This is an interesting place. Most of it is a large, eclectically decorated diner and there is also a decent sized lounge in the back. There is a large parking lot out front and even more space out back. This place gets crazy busy so plan ahead. There is a ton of seating, and they turn tables fairly quickly but there is often still a wait. If you come during any peak meal hours be prepared to wait.\n\nThe dining area is a series of large booths. There are neon lights all over and a mirrored tile ceiling, much like a disco ball. There are also a ton of plants scattered through out the diner.\n\nI ordered the Joe's San Francisco Special without spinach. It is a combination of scrambled eggs, pork sausage, ground beef and onion served on a bed of crispy hash browns with a cheese sauce. As with all of their meals you get a large portion. You will not leave hungry. The flavors all combined nicely as did the textures. I was quite happy with my choice.\n\nOverall the service was good, the food was good, the portions are larger and it is affordable. The only issue is the crowds.

What do I have to do to get a plain bun around here? Unfortunately I was too sleep deprived and too cranky to enjoy the food by then. It didn't help that my bf and I started arguing.

S"On our way out of Vegas on Monday morning, we decided to check out the Peppermill which some friends had told us about. For a Monday morning, it was pretty crowded when we arrived at 10:30 am. Wait time was about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table. We weren't in a huge rush, so it didn't bother us.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when we walked in was the large amount of neon pink throughout the restaurant. Not only that, but there are also lots of fake trees and plants. It totally gives it a kitschy diner feel and reminds me of why I love Vegas! The menu is large and you can get anything on it 24 hours a day. Feeling hungry for an omelet - check; feeling like a chicken caesar wrap - check; does shrimp scampi sound good - check; how about ribs - check. If you're craving it, I bet it's on the Peppermill menu.\n\nMy husband and I stuck with breakfast since it was mid-morning. I had the eggs and bacon and my husband had a belgian waffle. He liked the waffle well enough and it was quite large. My scrambled eggs were cooked well (not watery at all) and my bacon came out crispy as ordered. I hated the hash browns - not only were they not cooked all the way, but they lacked the crispiness that I prefer. It was basically just a pile of potato on the plate. For a soda, glass of orange juice and 2 breakfast entrees, our bill came to $29 before tip.\n\nWe were a tad disappointed in the food, but I guess if you go late at night after a full night of drinking, it probably is decent."

S"I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating.  First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.\n  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...\n    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  \n   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.\n  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.\n~G"

S"Walking into the Peppermill is a throwback to old vegas.  Its where you could invision Sammy Davis Jr or old Blue Eyes to be hanging out for breakfast or a late night snack.  Peppermill is away from the hussle and bussle of the mega resorts but sits conveniently next to the Riviera Hotel with its own easy access parking lot right off the strip.  I came here with a friend's suggestion for breakfast and it was a refreshing change from the overpriced, small portioned offerings in the touristy casinos.  \n\nPeppermill has HUGE portions, I ordered the pancake combo for $12.99 which consisted of 3 pancakes as large as a dinner plate, 3 eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage.  Not only is this a great value price wise, but the portions are probably double of what you would get elsewhere.  My friend got the chicken and spinach omlete made from 10 eggs!  It was a monster of a dish and delicious at that.  The customers seemed to be a mix of vegas locals and tourists but the vibe was comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent and attentive.  Would definitely come here again next time I'm in vegas.  Oh, forgot to mention they are 24 hours and offer a full bar, nice!"

The western fruit plate is big enough to feed the entire table.  My favorite breakfast is a tie between the Masserati omelette and Joe's San Francisco Breakfast Special.  The  Pork Sliders are also perfect and so are the huge Bloody Marys.  \n\nIf you have to wait for a table (and even if you don't), you should have a pre-meal Bloody Mary or Mimosa in the Fireside Lounge.   \n\nThe service is great and everyone is very friendly.  This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in Vegas.  Also my favorite breakfast Bloody Mary and Mimosa (fresh squeezed orange juice)."

S'Blah ... it is a Denny\'s with even bigger portions. Meaning you pay $13 for a pancake and you get a really big pancake. The food in general is no better than any other fast casual breakfast place just bigger portions. Our server, Cheyanne, we think forgot our order because when she started serving people around us, who sat down 45 minutes after our party of 6, she said the delay was "making a grilled cheese". Funny, the grilled cheese came out first! She also brought toast to one diner 30 minutes before their eggs arrived. When they asked for "hot toast" for their meal she seemed a little put out. BUT, the Peppermill is an establishment and part of the Vegas experience. Just don\'t think you are going to get anything special except for your Bloody Mary served by a woman in an evening gown.'

S"Peppermill, ah peppermill. Not quite sure what kind of a theme they were going for here, but it definitely screams tacky. \n\nThe menu is reminiscent of much pricier Denny's or Norm's, but the sizes are at least considerably larger.  \n\nService is just alright, nothing to write home about. In fact I think the waitress forgot my friend's eggs. Eggs, how do you forgot eggs when it's the most common denominator in each menu item. \n\nI ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and split that with my buddy who got ribs. Yep ribs. So many it isn't just a glorified denny's after all. \n\nOh and who needs alcohol when you can get a tall cup full of hot cocoa with a heaping shitton of whipped cream. Hmmmmmm whipped cream on top of more whipped cream.\n\nThe chicken fried steak was decent, eggs and taters were done well. The ribs were disappointing. Meat wasn't tender at all and it was swimming in bbq sauce. Probably to mask that concrete-textured meat. And it came with fried rice. Like chinese style fried rice. What the heck was going on with that?\n\nI was told the eggs benedict were good. I can't comment cause I'm generally not a fan, and therefore didn't bother to try it.  I also didn't get to check out the highly acclaimed club part of the diner. LOL. Firepits and loveseats.  Maybe I'd give it a higher rating if I had checked that area out.\n\nBottomline, not bad for late eats, but a bit heavy on the wallet."

S'First let me say this restaruant is all over the place. When you walk in and take a look at the decor you are immediately taken back to the 70s. \n\nThere\'s a separate bar area from the restaurant inside known as fireside which is right by the restroom area.  Inside you will find a fire pit within a jacuzzi, along with neon lights,  trees, and velvet chairs and couches.\n\nInside the main restaurant the theme continues from the waitresses outfits to the specialty drinks that are on the back of the menu. My mom was taken back by the drinks since she hasn\'t seen them being poured (made) in a while. Kudos for that!!\n\nAs for the food everything we had was really good. We enjoyed the French Toast combo and Munchs breakfast. The portions were large and filling and the price couldn\'t be beat.\n\nWhile at the restaurant we ran into a couple who stated they were told about this place by their limo driver. The couple had only heard of IHOP, and the driver told them that, "IHOP was like kissing your mother and this place was like kissing your lover." I thought that was a funny analogy.'

The coffee is drinkable, and the waitresses were the usual skimpy outfits, which can kinda suck when the waitress really shouldn't be wearing skimpy outfits.  Oh yeah, and it's got neon lights, to distract you from the fact that it's still not much better than Kady's, which I gave 2 stars.  \n\nThe portions here are massive, so if you need a good hangover cure after a night of heavy drinking, this will surely fill you up and grease you up.  \n\nHowever, if it is possible to venture out a little further, and wait for a good meal, the nicer hotels tend actually have decent breakfasts, so long as you avoid the buffets."

If I lived in Vegas I would be here probably too much for their larger than life plates, cheesy- tacky yet cool Paradise style Vegas decor and for the convenience of great service 24hrs a day. \n\nAfter the Yelpeasy party I was quite starving so we made a pit stop to the Peppermill for some late night grub. I was craving breakfast and I had a huge selection to choose from. After much convincing from our server Nick (who was quite awesome btw) I went for the Maserati Omelet. Filled with mozzarella cheese and sauteed mushrooms and then topped with an Italian sausage marinara sauce. This is totally not the type of thing I would order but I am so glad I did as it was pretty stellar. \n\nOur bfast portions were beyond huge. I think it was advertised as a 3 egg omelet but there had to be at least 5 eggs or they get their eggs from pretty large chickens if not. \n\nNick was our server and he was great!

I fill up fast, so I ended up taking more than half of my meal home. My aunt and I both ordered the Spinach and Feta omelette and I really enjoyed it. It had a good amount of feta cheese, which is a big deal to me. They serve it with potatoes and bread. I chose the blueberry muffin which was served warm. Yum!  \n\nMy mom ordered the fruit plate and it was enormous. It included strawberries, grapes, honeydew, banana, cantaloupe, pineapple and watermelon. They also give you a small banana nut loaf with marshmallow cream. It was so good!  \n\nMy grandma ordered the Pancake combo.

S'I waiver between 4 and 5 stars on this. I\'m at about a 3.5 to 4 for the Peppermill Restaurant and a solid 5 for the Fireside Lounge.\n\nLet\'s start with the Fireside Lounge. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I\'ve loved it since I first visited Vegas years and years ago. It\'s one of the first places that springs to mind when I think of "old Vegas". This little tucked away lounge is both classy and neon. It\'s both laid-back and fun. I can just picture any classic Vegas star sitting on a couch here.\n\nThe Fireside Lounge is pretty small. When you walk into the Peppermill, you\'ll see a small glass door off to your left labeled "Fireside Lounge". When you walk through it, you\'ll see lots of blues, pinks, and greens, bits of neon, mirrors, and plenty of fake plants and trees. But it so works, it feels classy - old Vegas classy.\n\nTo your right is a small, low bar with some video poker. To your left is a large indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing. Around the indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing is a huge circle couch. Around the rest of the room are smaller couches and some chairs - in an array of different sizes to accommodate just your size group. And the way it is all laid out, it is not too hard to find a private corner for some snuggling.\n\nOn corners around the room are TVs playing all sorts of music videos. Sometimes it 80s hair bands, sometimes it\'s a live Pearl Jam show. It\'s different just about every time I go. And it\'s never too loud. It\'s just there in the background, providing ambiance and conversation starters.\n\nThe best part is that the cocktail waitresses wear long, black evening gowns. It just adds to the whole environment and experience. There\'s a decent cocktail list and bar snack menu. Don\'t expect anything inventive here (though, they have been trying some new martinis). It\'s all classic and old-fashioned (and that is what is going to taste the best here). Think Mai Tai and shrimp cocktail.\n\nCombine all that with it being open-24 hours and you\'ve got a must-do. It can be a romantic spot for couples and a chill spot for a group of guys or gals. And I\'ve seen a few celebrities here too. Not the type that host at Pure, but the type that you might catch performing at The Joint.\n\nAnd I have to add that the staff at the Fireside are pretty open and willing to accommodate. My husband decided to surprise me with an Elvis impersonator for my birthday, and he set it all up with Fireside for this Elvis to come in and sing to me. So yeah, Fireside is totally a 5 star place.\n\nSo on to the Peppermill Restaurant. Sure, there are better 24 hour restaurants in Vegas, but almost none with this kind of atmosphere. And the food is well above average. I can\'t say I\'ve eaten here a lot, but the handful of times I have, I haven\'t had any complaints. \n\nThe portions are huge - so don\'t be afraid to share. My favorite menu items are actually the omelettes. They\'re huge and flavorful (no going stingy on the cheese and fillers here), and they just really hit the spot after a long night of drinking and gaming. 3.5 stars for the food, but add 1/2 a star for the ambiance.\n\nThe Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge are novelty Vegas places not to be missed.'

For some reason, even though I'm no one special, the shift supervisor waited on me personally and the service was excellent. \n\nI got the turkey burger with sweet potato fries, and it was both large and tasty. \n\nLove the ambiance and neon lighting. I'm Generation X-er, so anthing that reminds me of a Brat Pack movie is going to sit well with me. \n\nDon't forget to check out the Firepit Lounge, located just to your left as you walk in. Totally different atmosphere but just as positive. Perhaps a somewhat slower, more laid back pace. Enjoyed this place and will definitely be back."

There's even a cool bar inside the restaurant so you can have that extra cocktail while you wait for your grub.\n\nThe menu is huge and I believe you'll find something you'll like, I eye jacked other peoples plates as I walked in and everything looked good."

S"alcoholic milk shakes! This loud fun environment of fancy burgers and alcoholic milk shakes is a thumbs up for me. I ate here before going to the Marquee nightclub. It wasn't packed inside. Quickly seated in this fun decorated restaurant. Our server was very nice and attentive. \n\nI ordered the Drunken Munky shake that was a banana milkshake with peanut butter cups and malt. This was so so so so good. Oh yeah and alcohol! You couldn't even tell alcohol was in it. They gave me a ton of it. So good.\n\nGold Standard burger - The burger here was cooked well. I think the tomato aoili kind of took away from the burger. It had argula , cheese, and bacon on it as well. It was good but not amazing. \n\nRecommendation: Drunken munky alcoholic milkshake"

S"Holsteins was bustling with activity when I went on a recent Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant was brightly lit and loud.  There was a game on the televisions in the bar, and as a result, the bar was packed.  After waiting ten minutes for a table, we were seated at a comfortable table.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  She acknowledged us promptly and took our drink orders.  She provided several suggestions, and when I asked about the Nom Nom burger, she informed me that it was done as a charity promotion but was so popular, they kept it on the menu.  \n\nAfter serving us drinks, she provided us with a small bucket of popcorn.  Cute. And tasty.  I am sort of a popcorn kind of guy.  You probably didn't know that about me, and probably didn't want to know that about me. There are more things I can share, but I won't.  The popcorn was fresh and warm.  It also had a distinct flavor that was hard to place.  I thought it could have been a pickle flavor seasoning.  Hey, I am at a burger place, right?  It was salt and vinegar.  Tasty.\n\nThe burgers came out quickly, and cooked to specification.  I asked for a little bit of pink, and that is what I got.  I had the Nom Nom burger.  It was tasty.  It could have been better.  The menu billed it as Kobe Beef.  At $16.50 for an 8 ounce burger, I can assure you this is not authentic Kobe Beef.  The first Kobe Beef in the last two years in Vegas is at City Center.  They are charging $35 an ounce.  So, maybe they are billing the Wagyu as Kobe Beef.  Or maybe it is the Kobe style beef.  Who knows.  I just know it wasn't what was billed.  \n\nWe skipped the booze because we were trying to eat on the cheap.  A diet Coke, an iced tea, and two sandwiches came out to $42.  A little pricey in my opinion.  But, considering where I am, I don't mind paying for it.\n\nThe burger, as I mentioned was cooked perfectly.  The bun was firm, but a little on the plain and boring side.  The fries, I got the shoe string, my companion got the thick fries, were hot, salted and well seasoned.  I preferred the shoe string fries over the thick fries.  So did my friend.  The burger was topped with white cheddar, potato chips and Thousand Island.  There was barely any sauce.  The chips covered the perfectly melted cheese.  I was surprised that there was no additional garnish present.  No pickle, tomato, onion or lettuce on the plate.  Not even a sprig of parsley.  At these prices, surely they could toss something in.  Applebee's even garnishes their plates with a sprig of inedible, icky kale.\n\nI didn't get a chance to sample the liquor malts, but rest assured, next time I go, I won't be driving, so I will definitely take a taste."

S'My Yelp friend Vi Y. recommended the Watermelon Bubblegum Icee - and I\'m glad I listened!  It felt like that time when I needed to look over my shoulder before my dad or mom caught me spiking my drink!  It was such a fun drink with a great grown-up vodka twist - so sweet and refreshing, and definitely made me a happy girl.  Their other bamboozled shakes are just as intriguing and fun - how could you not want to try a grown up root beer float like a Brown Cow (Root Beer, Vanilla Ice Cream, Pop Rocks and Meyer\'s rum)?\n\nAs for the food we love to nosh on the small plates here.  There is a maply-sweetness to the batter in the Southern Fried Chicken Fingers-N-Waffles and comes with a small and cute waffle.  The buttermilk sauce definitely doesn\'t come from a bottle. Some might think this is a small serving but I think it\'s just right as I get to indulge on something like this without the 2000 calories a full order would have, and still have room to try other menu notables like:\n\nLobster/Truffled Mac and Cheese\nCrispy Pork Belly buns\nShoe string fries\nSweet Potato fries\nKorean "Bull"gogi burger  (soy marinated burger with fried egg, kimchee slaw)\n\nThe huzbeau and I have come here with just the two of us and another time with a party of four, and wait was minimal with no reservations.  But its always advisable to call if you plan on coming here during busy times like before a show (like a lot of people do)!\n\nService was attentive and its a great, casual atmosphere.  The graffiti artwork on the walls is amazing and very classy-urbanesque.  A great stop to make if you\'re in town - located right behind the beautiful Chandelier bar in the Cosmopolitan.'

S"(Review is for milkshakes only) came here because I've heard a lot about the milkshakes, after looking at the menus in the bar/lounge area we noticed the shakes weren't listed on there, we had to grab the hostess (who was facing the dining room and talking to the other servers) and ask if we can see a full menu.  After agreeing we wanted to try some shakes we asked the hostess if we had to order in the dining room or if we could go to lounge area, she said we can sit at the bar, order to go or order at the bar.  We sat in the lounge area and noticed we had to go back to the hostess stand to get a full menu.  The hostess was still facing the restaraunt talking to the servers so I just went to her stand and grabbed the menu myself.  By this point I was a little irritated but still wanted a milkshake.  We ordered the Fat Boy and the Vegan Maple Pecan, it took a while for 2 shakes but after trying it, it was worth the wait.  A few minutes later a runner came out and brought the leftover vegan maple shake, we were confused since we had our entire order, when we looked in what we thought was the vegan shake, it was actually a vanilla shake.  So pretty much they delivered the extra/leftover vanilla shake to a vegan...who drank it not realizing it was non vegan\n=(\nI understand there's a chance of getting non-vegan items at a Restaraunt that's not completely vegan but the entire experience was not worth it.  Good shakes though."

I'm often traveling alone so I love the availability to grab a seat at the bar even during hot hours as they have a good sized lounge area for groups to sit while awaiting tables or just having cocktails. The place does get loud often competing with the PA and the club across the floor in the evenings.\n\nShakes are rich and tasty whether you get boozed or not.

S'I was in town for a convention so I just grabbed a seat at the bar. It was pretty busy, but the bartenders were all pretty friendly. \n\nI started with the fried green tomato salad. I think it was my favorite part of the meal. It was 3 slices of tomato fried with some mixed greens. It was pretty tasty, though it was $14 for a smallish starter. \n\nThe hen house burger was good, but a bit messy. I am never a fan of a burger that is so juicy that it soaks through the bottom bun and makes the burger fall apart. Then it all goes to pieces and you end up being that guy eating a burger with a fork and knife. Never good. \n\nAnyway, the hen house was tasty. They seem to skimp on the fries though. They were tasty, but the cup of fries you get seems a little small. \n\nAs for drinks, they have quite a few wines and craft beers available, which was nice. \n\nTwo glasses of wine ($20), a salad and burger was $55.'

S"I've been in LA too long. I've missed gambling and people who smoke indoors. So, during a much-needed trip to Las Vegas, I decided to stop in to Holsteins to see how these alcohol-infused milkshakes and gourmet burgers compare to the ones in the City of Angels.\n\nAfter winding my way through the Cosmopolitan Hotel past the Chandelier Bar, I spotted the decorative pink-and-white plastic cow emblazoned with the Holsteins logo. At the restaurant, you have the option of sitting at the bar, in the dining area or in the lounge up front, which is composed of some low-riding couches and decorative cartoon tables. I opted to sit in the more traditional dining room because I felt like the seriousness with which I was ready to eat could not be done in a reclining position.\n\nThe cocktail menu is awfully impressive, but I knew that I wanted to try one of the alcoholic milkshakes because, obviously. I chose the Tiramisu Milkshake, and, my goodness, it was good. The milkshakes are all $11, but at least they give you the fancy glass as well as the tin container filled with the remaining shake. The tiramisu shake is made with mascarpone ice cream, ladyfinger cookie crumbs, Patron Caf\xc3\xa9, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder and espresso beans. The shake was thick, chocolatey, liquory and delicious. It was the perfect dessert.\n\nI also ordered a Gold Standard Burger ($17.50), which is a burger topped with smoked bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli. My main complaint about the menu is that half of the burgers listed aren't really burgers -- they're fish, fowl or veggie patties, which is totally uninteresting to me. So, as for actual beef patties, there aren't too many to choose from.\n\nThe burger I ordered was still great. It was cooked medium-rare when I requested medium, but I really don't care too much unless I catch salmonella and die. The patty was flavorful. The toppings were pretty good (especially the aioli and cheese), but were not anything that would be my first choice in burger toppers. I was delighted that the burger was so sizable and filling, and it even came with a side of delicious, crunchy, salty shoestring fries.\n\nThe waitress was fantastic. She helped us navigate the menu and was patient with our indecision, and she was also very friendly and stayed to shoot the breeze with us for a while, which made the whole experience a lot more fun and personable. Both the shakes and burgers were brought out quickly, which I appreciated very much because I could not wait another moment to dive into this restaurant's offerings.\n\nThe meal was expensive, but everything was delectable. You won't be hungry again for a good long while after dining at Holsteins.\n\nThey even let us take our alcohol in to-go cups so we could finish drinking while we walked around. I could have cried. Oh, how I've missed Nevada, the land free from open container laws."

S"I've walked past this place during my previous Vegas trips but never ate here because we somehow always end up getting food somewhere quick or at Earl's... But anyway. I bookmarked this place before my last Vegas trip because I'm a huge sucker for gourmet burgers and I really wanted to try this place. The opportunity finally came, so I came here for dinner.\n\nNot everyone in our group wanted burgers, so we got our food to go. You order and wait at the bar for to-go orders. After much contemplation, I decided to go with The Rising Sun (with shoestring fries) because there were a lot of good reviews for it and it was a unique combination of ingredients for a burger. Well, it was a good choice! It certainly was a unique combo of flavors, and it worked. I don't usually go for the Asian-themed item in a menu, but being a burger, it ended up being a good fusion item. The fries were alright. Not the best I've had.\n\nI would definitely come here again to try another one of their many unique offerings."

As a party of five we got drinks in the lounge while waiting for our table.  I had a cake martini and it was delicious.  Loved the sprinkles around the rim.  Once seated for dinner the waiter suggested the Gold Standard as it was fairly popular and it didn't disappoint.  One of the best burgers I've ever had, actually.  I split this with my boyfriend along with an order of sweet potato fries and onion rings.  Everything was good and service was friendly.  It is the Strip so the menu is priced accordingly."

A little trashy for the place. \n\nFirst off we got the Philly cheese steak egg rolls. Which sound DELICIOUS!!! BUT!  It wasn 15 bucks for 3 rolls with barely any cheesteak inside. It was hard to find any meat. And it was just super fried and bleh. No thanks. \n\n5/10\n\nNext up was the booze shakes!! This was a very clever idea! I like it a lot we got the oreo and bailey's. It tasted amazing. Makes you feel like a fatass but it was very very good!\n\n9/10\n\nNow onto the main attraction. The burrrrgerrr. We got the el machette. My thoughts? No. \nDidn't like it  won't eat it again. The bun was cold and that kinda ruined it for the start for me.... I did not love the meat but my girlfriend   did. It wasn't that good. I'm not a huge burger fan but I know when I taste a great burger. This wasn't it unfortunately. \n\nWell not all bad news! The onion rings are fantastic! Perfectly crispy! They are amazing. Get them with a drink and bounce hahah that's it. They charged an extra dollar for the Chipotle ranch. Il stick regular ranch.  Don't charge us a buck for Chipotle ranch....come on now.

S"Came here for lunch with a rather big group, the restaurant was pretty empty at the time.  I was very disappointed with the burgers, namely because the bun's were absolutely terrible!  I had the Gold Standard with Onion Rings.  The burger patty was cooked medium, and all the fix-ins complimented the burger well...but I can't get over the fact that the bun was so terrible.   The burger bun was dry, cold, and slightly stale...it was so terrible that I could not enjoy my burger.  I almost had to eat the burger patty by itself and toss the bun.   Everyone else in my group agreed, the burger bun was stale and dry.  If it wasn't for the dry bun, I might be able to give it 4-stars, but I just could not enjoy my burger on a stale dry bun!  The burger patty was good quality, but I can't enjoy a burger without a good bun!  The onion rings were okay, i've had better, I really wished they were beer battered.   For the price of the burgers, I really expected a more satisfying burger; the burgers were not that big to begin with.  I think I will stick to Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay.\n\nAs with everything else in Vegas, high prices don't always equate to high quality.   My meal came out to be $25 for a burger, onion rings, and water...for this price I expect a damn good burger, which Holsteins did not deliver.  Burger bar has much better burgers, and better prices!"

Didn't get a chance to try their shakes, but they have a pretty decent selection of beers and wine. \n\nThere was one red wine in particular, with a funky/artsy label from Italy, that i can't remember the name of, but it was very palatable.

S"It's almost hard to believe that Holstein's is run by the same people responsible for LBS at the Red Rock. I guess if I had to make an analogy, this place is like Michael Jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas LBS is LaToya (or maybe even Janet) and the LBS Patty Wagon is Tito.\n\nWhat that means, is this place rocks. The menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.\n\nThe Rising Sun ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, I had to look up furikake to know what it was... I'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. The ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. If I have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. The thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't Macauley Culkin say the same thing to MJ?).\n\nMy wife got the Gold Standard ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. She loved it and only let me have one bite. If you want a more traditional burger, go for this. But, I still thought the Rising Sun was better.\n\nEach burger came with an order of fries. So She got the regular fries and I got he steak cut fries. Both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.\n\nOur son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. That's always a winner with him. It came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.\n\nEven after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. Our choice... lollipops. The chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. The lemon meringue and red velvet cake were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.\n\nDespite the lackluster dessert, the burgers were so good I can overlook that misstep. We didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. I'm not sure if I'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed."

As I was lucky to get the chance to come back to Vegas recently with my younger daughter, I brought her here.  Again we had lunch and the food was great not to mention the shakes!

Then again, everything in Vegas is expensive, so it was one of our more reasonable dining options. The service was good but slow, but then again we were with a group of 10 people.

I overheard the table next to me going on about the ridiculousness of these horrid hostesses after being sat by one.  These girls had a "what are you doing here?" attitude. I imagine one of them answering the phone: "Holsteins, you\'re welcome."  Perhaps Smiling 101 could be a start?\n\nThat being said:  Server (Kyle) recommended the Rising Sun burger and it was THE best burger I\'ve had EVER.

S'The first time we tried to go the wait was too long, so it is a popular place. The second time was a less busy day and time so we got a table. The alcohol milkshakes were a fun treat for a weekend in vegas with many different selections like dark chocolate and cookies and cream. I also tried one of the mini-burgers but it was small and maybe difficult to make a patty that size very juicy, so I would go with the full sized burger next time. Most of the food on the menu was burgers and fries so go if that is what you are in the mood for and you want a lot of options in that category. The prices are steep, about $15 burgers and $10 alcoholic milkshakes, but that is nothing on the strip, and the location, decor, atmosphere, and service are great.'

Yes, the burgers are delicious, but no, I do not believe this place is the best.\n\nBeing a HUGE fan of burgers, I've been to many burger joints and restaurants, and have been searching for the perfect burger.

The alcohol in the shake was very subtle, and the shake was just.. perfect. no other words.\n\nThe lobster mac and cheese- pieces of lobster with mac and cheese and truffle oil. As a big fan of truffle oil, this dish was perfect for me. So far, so good.\n\nThen the burgers- the gold standard and the billionaire.\nI hate blue cheese, so had only regular cheddar cheese with the gold standard. It was a good burger, the ingredients were paired well and I was satisfied.\nThe billionaire burger- wgayu and foie gras- was ok. Because foie gras was banned in California, it was a must that we got that burger. However, the burger was a bit dry, and did not meet up to par. \n\nOn the other hand, service was up to par, the lady was very nice and came around to check up on us often. I would definitely come back for Holsteins for the shakes, that was the highlight of the meal. For Vegas standards, this place is decently good, although I expected something better."

S'So after all the hype about how great this place is, I finally tried it.\n\nThese type of restaurants are usually my favorite.  I love great burgers, and anything spun off in the form of an upscale burger joint.\n\nThe appetizer, which was chicken queso with chips that was pretty nice.\n\nThe burger I ordered was perfectly cooked and the beef was great, but the bun was a really weird consistency, not crispy/toasted, and not soft.  It was kinda like a soft bagel.  Too tough for a burger with a lot of toppings, and everything wanted to slide out of the burger.  \n\nThe lettuce on the burger was like butter lettuce or something really soft and not crisp, and had a bitterness not adding to the burger.\n\nAlso the steak fries are a misnomer, they are actually wedges, there is a big difference.\n\nNot a remarkable restaurant of this type, I would much rather go to le burger brasserie in the paris, BLT burgers in the mirage, or the burger bar in the mandalay shops.\n\nThe ambience was nothing special either.\n\nGo to the hidden/secret pizza place upstairs from this for a better meal in a cooler place.'

S"Good burgers. But just good. Not anything special. The price was too high for the burger. The shake was overly sweet. The fries were okay. The service was pushy. They really try to upsell you. Yeah I know, how do you upsell in a burger joint? Stop by and they will show you. Decor is fun though. I don't think I'll be coming back with all the other options on the strip."

S'We had sliders, sliders and more sliders. Loved the Lobster mac n cheese, they had the crispy outside that makes you want to eat EVERYTHING.  I had the slider with the foie gras on it and it was pretty well made.  I was totally eying the lobster roll which looked delicious as well.  Nom nom...would probably try again.'

S'Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, I brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  The restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  Music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it\'s not overwhelming where one can\'t enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.\n\nAs for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  My friend and I were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and I got the Drunken Monkey (with Reese\'s, banana, malt, and Frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the Creamsicle Float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  My biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one\'s enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark Asian flush go into effect).  Perhaps the Holstein\'s staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.\n\nAs for the burgers, we opted to split the crowd favorite Gold Standard and Steakhouse Burger.  The Gold Standard consists of dry aged sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in Charlie Brown\'s classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  The Steakhouse burger, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms,  and swiss cheese.  Taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to Marquee on this one.  For every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.  \n\nOverall, the burgers  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction,  "That\'s a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. I don\'t know if it\'s worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it\'s pretty f*cking good."'

S"Had a quick lunch here and it was good. The cosmo is really hip and this place follows that vibe. I almost  didn't feel cool enough to be there. Anyway, i had a s'mores shake (awesome!), and gold standard burger. It was a great burger BUT the 17.50 price tag is alittle much. For that price I expected more I guess. There are other things on the menu that sounded really good, so I'd probably go back. I'll just be prepared to spend $35 on lunch."

S"I'm not sure if I was just starving... but we came here for dinner before going out and we were seated right away which was kind of surprising. I got the Gold standard burger and man was it good. The waiter recommended the steakhouse or the gold standard saying that it was award winning and their most popular. I definitely, agree because I definitely scarfed down the burger. The cheese they used with the bacon and the arugula and their aioli. It was perfect together, nothing was too overpowering, which was nice. \nI would definitely come back here again to try out a different burger. I thought their prices were on the higher end but I guess you're in Vegas, so nothing you can do about that."

S'So, I trip into this spot...loved the theme/idea.  The affable 20-somethin hostess invited me in and I sat at the empty bar...starving.  Now, when I go into a burger/shake place, I DO NOT order Duck confit, lobster mac n chee or freekin popcorn...I order a burger and a shake - damnit!\nIn short order I received what looked like a machine-made patty a tad undone...OK, it was bleeding all over my plate. The "skinny fries" that came with my $13 burger were skinny, alright...in a faux "milk-house" bucket cept it was about the size of a Wisconsin thimball.  I ordered a chocolate milkshake $11 as well.  It was nice, unfortunately it was also about the size of a medium coke at McD\'s.  Service was OK.\nYou know, when I compare this place with any other burger-joint, it might fare pretty well...but my tab was nearly $35...and for that amount of dough I could\'ve eaten 10 HappyMeals and puked in the parking lot.'

S"I can honestly say that this place had some of the worst service I have ever had. Our server, Nicole/Nikki was absolutely awful. You know the service is bad when you see all their other tables looking around for their server and looking generally disgruntled. We asked several times for things that we ordered with our meal and didn't receive them. I literally filled my own water with the water bottle I had because no one would fill our waters. The other servers were hanging out by the computers and not helping anyone in the restaurant, which was super frustrating. My burger was alright. The bun was super hard (almost inedible) and I didn't get the mushrooms I ordered on it so it was really disappointing. The side salad I got, however, was really good. I'm not sure what kind of dressing it had but it was delicious. I'm not quite sure why but we were given popcorn at the beginning of the meal. I would give this place another chance because it did have some redeeming qualities, but I would hope to have a more friendly and competent server next time."

S"Came here on what seemed to be an uneventful and random Tuesday night with another guest. We luckily snagged a dining area right up front from the hostess stand while the other current diners were just leaving. Apparently the restaurant was packed and quite eventful despite our feelings otherwise.\n\nThe table was still full of food, given the fact we were offered the only available seating at the time, but service was very quick to remove and set up for us promptly. \n\nWe decided on the Fun-Ghi burger & the crispy pork belly buns. For desert, we were recommend the Tiramisu shake based on our preference of chocolate. We even got it to go and non-alcoholic. Everything came out surprisingly fast. *The menu is quite extensive so there are many choices for everything. Look online in advance or take a look on the menu outside.\n\nThe Fun-ghi was delicious, but I really was expecting more from a 17$ burger. Truffle marinated Portabella mushroom, caramelized onions, frisee, and mayo with a beef patty. Rich and pleasantly mild despite the idea of alluring funky-nees from the truffle and gruyere. Ordered with sweet potatoes fries that were executed perfectly, although they only came with your normal and boring grocery ketchup rather than a unique dipping sauce or aioli that most burger places in its caliber of category offer.\n\nThe Crispy Pork Belly buns were such a disappointment. So unpleasantly sweet, as if the pork itself were candied. And to add insult to the matter, the herbs or greens accompanied did not compliment the dish what so ever and gave it a medicinal and rather off putting taste. Terrible really.\n\nShake was great but not anything special, and again, for the price of 13+?\n\nThe service from our waitress could not have been any better. So polite and friendly and frequently checked back on us despite a full house; Impressive. I also believe the owner stopped by at one point and asked us how we were and carried on by removing some trash from our table.\n\nIt's the questionable prices and the food quality that contributed to the 3 stars. I understand the atmosphere is apart of the experience (beautiful artsy and urban decor, obviously located in the upscale  and modern cosmopolitan) and leads way into the pricing, but it's quite unnecessary and confusing when the food isn't as up to par. I will be back to try some other burgers, but not planning on it anytime soon."

My friend and I got the kobe beef burger and the steakhouse burger and split them. Just some excellent quality meat... The taste was great too, but it mostly comes from their meat quality, so my hat off to Holsteins. Oh, and let's not forget their crunchy shoe string fries! Yummm...

S"Kinda on the fence, but for now I will give 3 stars. Came here on a Saturday afternoon and the second floor was packed with people waiting to get in Marquee dayclub. So right away I was put off by the drunk and obnoxious, fist pumpers. Now I know that has nothing to do with the restaurant but I think the commotion rubbed off on our hostess because she had a slight attitude. We were seated fairly quickly, and I was hoping that it wouldn't be so loud inside the restaurant.....I was wrong. It was so loud I truly couldn't talk to people sitting next to me. Frustrating. Onto the food....for starters we ordered the lobster Mac & Cheese, pretty tasty, would order again, perfect amount of flavor and not too salty. Fried pickles, I liked the pickles themselves, but wasn't a fan of the herb-caper mayo, would've been better with ranch. I split the Gold Standard burger, ordered medium well, they actually got the medium well perfect which I appreciate, I couldn't decide if I loved the burger. I don't like meat on meat (i.e bacon on my burger) but the description of the burger sounded delicious, so I don't know if it was the goat cheese or the aioli dressing that threw me off. I was too full to try the milk shakes, unfortunately. \n\nDon't know if I would come back, I am still a Bachi Burger fan."

S"Located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, Holsteins has some amazing burgers. My friends and I ate here because we were gonna club at the Marquee next door and it had pink cow logo, which piqued my interest. It's a nicer burger place, so you should look presentable and not look hella grimey.\n\nFood:\n1) GOLD STANDARD - One of the best burgers I've had. Highly recommended. Aged beef sirloin with arugula, tomato, garlic-chive aioli. You can't go wrong with garlic aioli and goat cheese on a burger. I added a fried egg to it and it just made the burger so much more delicious.\n2) DUCK FAT FRIES - Fried in duck fat, but doesn't taste all that different from regular fries. What made it unique was that it came with fried peppers and onions on top, which gave it a slight kick of spicy.\n3) STEAK FRIES - the best steak fries I've ever had. I kept eating them even though i was stuffed. Well-seasoned and fried. I need to order more.. *drool\n\n$11 Alcoholic Shakes:\n1) FROZEN GRASSHOPPER - chocolate mint shake. It wasn't too minty and a little too sweet. Won't be ordering these overpriced shakes again.\n2) OREO SHAKE - Much better. Very smooth oreo shake with alcohol. yummm.\nOverall the shakes were good but way too overpriced. only half shot of alcohol.\n\nService: 5/5 stars\nServer was very friendly and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I find it annoying when servers don't know the menu well. We were strapped for time so he hurried everything for us, which was cool. awesome!"

S'So here\'s the thing: I love this place, but I\'m teetering on 3 stars. If there were 3.5, I\'d give it that. When we FIRST visited this place not long after it opened, we raved and told everyone how amazing it was.  And their burgers are very good. Very, very good.\n\nBut, we\'ve gone a handful of times now and the last few, I\'ve been kind of embarrassed that we raved so much about it to the guests we brought with us. Our server, the last two times, hasn\'t offered us our locals discount (even though we introduced ourselves as locals when we sat down). The first time, we didn\'t know and another server is the one who asked if we got our discount. The second time, we pointed it out on the bill and he went back and took it off.\n\nBut the guy who served us the last two times, while nice enough, was more interested in chatting with the hostesses than bringing us popcorn or refilling our water or pretty much anything. And we were seated in this corner so if we wanted to get anyone\'s attention, we\'d have to get up and poke our heads around the side to flag him down.\n\nHe (or the kitchen, can\'t be sure) slathered my turkey burger in Russian dressing, despite me asking for it on the side twice -- in fact, the server and I had a whole conversation that went something like this:\n\nMe: "Could I please have the Russian dressing on the side or not at all?"\n\nHim: "So, look, do you want it or not?"\n\nLook, FLO, I don\'t want it at all, I was just trying to be flexible. Instead, I had to wait while my friends ate so they could de-Russian my turkey burger, which if I\'m being honest, wasn\'t that great. (The turkey burger sliders are also a snooze, skip \'em.)\n\nMy other beef (no pun intended) with this place is the volume. I appreciate that it\'s Vegas and that people are there to par-tay, etc, but I\'d like to eat my dinner without having to scream across the table. And this is in the dining room, not even in the lounge area, where it\'s seriously hearing-damage territory and the bass rumbles under your ass while you\'re trying to enjoy your sliders. It\'s just not my jam, so to speak.\n\nI can highly recommend the Gold Standard and the Steakhouse burger, both of which are delectable and worth every penny. I like their wedge-cut fries, as well.  Two of my friends have told me the Captain Hook salmon burger is also really good.  \n\nOther high points: the decor is interesting and creative, and aside from this one lackluster server and the occasional snooty hostess, the staff is warm and welcoming. They menu has expanded as well and they\'ve got a lot of interesting choices. They\'re great at their social media, too. Love that.  \n\nOverall, I do really like Holstein\'s and am rather bummed to review it this way.A year ago, it would\'ve been at least 4.'

S'I had dinner here with 2 bodybuilders. ;)\n\nWe took our friend Seth out to dinner during the 2012 Olympia Expo weekend here in Vegas and boy did we pick the RIGHT spot to WOW our friend with a gourmet burger. Apparently where he\'s from, you have to drive miles and miles to get a decent "gourmet" meal.\n\nThe wait wasn\'t so bad either on a busy Saturday night during the dinner rush hour. We put our names down on the wait list and gave them one of our cell phone numbers.The wait was only 15-20 minutes and we were seated inside the dining area instead of the bar (which is good cuz apparently by 9:30pm, there\'s a DJ booth set up in the bar area and we prefer to have good convos during dinner and not have to yell or scream at each other).\n\nSince I had a burger in Vegas the previous 2 nights I opted to order something else off the menu while the boys both ordered themselves some burgers. I got the Surf & Turf Quesadilla. We also ordered onion rings to start and they sure were bomb diggity. Very crispy with huge ass oninos and I could bite through each one easily. Which is a major bonus for me since I have a horrible underbite. When my quesadilla came out, I dove right in and noticed how amazingly soft and flavorful the tortilla was. The quesadilla comes with Broiled Steak and Maine Lobster stuffed with Manchego Cheese and the avocado cream on top was seriously like the best creamy jizz shot you\'ve ever tasted. ;)\n\nFor dessert we got The Candy Store which came with 5 cute little cake-pop like delectables. They\'re a bit pricey, but you\'re in Vegas and since we don\'t drink I didn\'t mind gettin a nice sugar high for a hefty price.\n\nWe also got the homemade blueberry pop tart with red velvet popcorn and sweet corn ice cream that sat on top of the most decadent lemon tart reduction. OMG! Amazeballs!\n\nI definitely wanna come back here and have a burger next time and maybe even one of their crazy milkshakes if I decide to start drinking alcohol again.'

S'Burgers, shakes, and more burgers....\n\nFirst being a popcorn lover, you can only imagine my excitement when the waitress dropped off some complimentary cheddar popcorn to start our meal! \n\nBasically this place is the biz for its gourmet burgers and alcoholic shakes.  I went here twice in one day, that\'s how much I liked the burgers and shakes.  There\'s other stuff like truffle lobster mac n cheese and interesting snacks like pizza "twinkies", fried pickles, fried green tomatoes and kalbi beef with kimchee quesadillas.  They also have sliders as well.  I\'ll def. be back to try these.\n\nI had the campfire smores shake and a taste of my friend\'s drunken monkey shake....both sooooo gooooood!  \n\nRising sun- juicy meat and I surprisingly liked the combination.  \nKorean "bull"gogi- juicy meat, I liked the flavor of this.  If you like bulgogi, you\'ll love this.\nGold Standard- so I thought this was kinda dry, plus I"m not really into goat cheese so I didn\'t like it as much.  But my bro loved it.\nBurgers were pretty decent in size, I was stuffed after one and the guys were satisfied after theirs.  Burgers also come with a choice of shoestring fries or steak cut fries, both were deelish. \nThey also have a pretty decent stocked bar and a selection of beer that my fiance enjoyed.\n\nThese gourmet burgers are pricey, 13-17.5 bucks.  Shakes are around 11 bucks.  But it\'s Vegas and the food was great, so in that case I didn\'t mind!  I recommend checking this place out if you\'re in the mood for some tasty burgers and shakes...'

S'If your friends love burgers, like mine do, this is the perfect place to take them for any special event. A group of us came here for a birthday. We called ahead of time to make a reservation because it was a mid size group and around the holiday season. When we got there, the place was busy, but you could get away without making a reservation.\n\nThe decor is warm, well lit, with splashes of colorful art. \n\nThe server was friendly, attentive when we needed her, and kept her distance while we were celebrating. Orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.\n\nThe star of this place is the food. The ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. The alcohol milkshakes are amazing. They will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. We tried four different kind that day. The Framboise float was not well balanced. Although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. On the other hand, the campfire smores, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. They had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.\n\nStarting out with the artichoke "guac" was unimpressive. In fact, looking back, I cannot remember it as vividly as I do with everything else we ordered.\n\nNow the burgers are spectacular. If you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. My group had our burgers family style to share. We got two gold standards; aged beef, smoked bacon, goat cheese, greens and aioli. They were delicious. The meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with the burger. Next was the captain hook; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. The fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. Now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. The longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey BBQ sauce. This monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. Nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. The duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. When you bite into the succulent patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. The blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. If you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout. Top it all off with a few orders of duck fat fries and you might as well check into the hospital next.'

She was suggestive, but definitely not pushy.  Stangely, the hostesses -- yes the first people you come across when you approach a restaurant -- were slightly haughty, slightly bitchy, or at the very least ignored me pretty well. And that rarely ever happens at any restaurant.\n\nAnyway, got myself the Foie gras burger, sweet potato fries and a capn crunch (cereal bowl) shake.\n\nDevoured everything.

S"It's a gastropub style burger joint with Vegas strip pricing and fancier burgers.\n\nHeard a lot about their milkshakes, ordered a black and white.  Just like everyone says, it's a good milkshake.  So it's definitely worth coming here just for that.\n\nBlack truffle lobster mac 'n cheese: black truffle was too strong.  If the lobster didn't have a distinct color, you wouldn't have even noticed it was in there.  Sauce was underseasoned.  The chip garnish was interesting, but I don't see how that plays in with the dish.  Superfluous...but not a negative.\n\nKorean kimchi hot dogs: was very intrigued by this menu item, but it was underwhelming.  It tasted exactly like a hot dog with bbq sauce.  Didn't get the sour punch from the kimchi, nor did I even notice pork belly in it.  The bun was very soft and delicious though.  \n\nGold standard burger: goat cheese cheddar was wonderful, and my burger was cooked to medium rare which is a plus.  Overall, burger was good, but lacked seasoning.  Bun was nicely done.  \n\nService was spot-on.  We sat in the lounge so we didn't have to wait for a table, so I can't say much for the actual dining service.  \n\nFor what it is, and being in Vegas, I'd say it's a good spot to go for a burger fix.  Is it a top tier burger place?  Remains to be seen when I come back again, because there's a lot of stiff competition out there."

S'Frozen Grasshopper, my first shake EVER.  The presentation of it caught my eye first.  As a waiter who walked by had it on a tray, I just had to ask what it was called.  After contemplating, I order the grasshopper and enjoyed until it got to that melted consistency - then I just gave it to my b/f to finish.  For food, I was having a difficult time deciding (once again), but got the Gold Standard Burger w/ steak cut fries.  A pretty juicy burger that had good flavor.  I was so full when I left! ... full, but satisfied.'

S'First off, best burger I\'ve had in a long time. Yes I agree with the other reviews. The burger is great. However, expensive. We also ordered the lobster mac&  cheese which when brought to the table made us laugh because the serving was so tiny. I ordered a "specialty" cocktial, I don\'t remember the name but it was made with ginger ale. And all 5 sips were tasty. Just wish I had more sips for the price. I would have given this restaurant only 1 star but since the burger was so good I\'ll give it a solid two.\n\nPsst...if you want a good burger and better choices. I recommend the SkyBox Sports Grill & lounge located in Aria. For the same price they have a much larger portion. The burger is just as good and they have the BEST Philly Cheesesteak I\'ve ever had!'

S'Looks to be just your standard restaurant, but inside are things that make you go Mmm. \n\nHen House Burger is phenomenal. Simple concept of adding an egg to a burger, we\'ve seen it before but Holstein\'s does it right. Expect to make a mess with this one.\n\nThe Steakhouse Burger with a peppered patty, steak sauce - and other perfectly combined ingredients - was mind-blowing too.  I couldn\'t make a decision to which burger was best. Each time I had one bite of one and then the other, I said "this one is best!".  They were both that good. And the fries were equally as good - some crispy, some soft - great flavor. The boyfriend and I agree this place is on our list of Top 5 burgers (probably Top 3 for me!).  \n\nCaptain Crunch Shake with vodka ... if you like Captain Crunch you\'ll love this! I wanted to try it based on the waitress\'s recommendation. No regrets, but I\'ll go with something that has chocolate in it next time - and there WILL be a next time.\n\nAlcoholic beverages are stiff, service was quick (but also, I went pretty late), and the waitress was down to earth.'

S'Another featured burger in the "Vegas Seven" Magazine". Came here to have the obvious..\n\nAfter I ordered the Bartender replied: "that\'s what we\'re known for.. it was ranked top 5 in the nation.."\n\nGold Standard with steak cut fries: The burger came out perfectly constructed and everything looked proportioned from the top to bottom. Looked like a "Lbs Burger or Bachi Burger".. Well, come to find out this place was related to "Lbs", same chef.. It came with Dry Aged Beef Sirloin, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, garlic-chive aioli on a kinda sweet bun.. The medley of flavors worked pretty well but just like "lbs" and even Bachi burger, I was not blown away. Just merely satisfied.. The burger patty wasn\'t that flavorful but had a nice texture. It was all the supporting toppings that gave it some life. Overall, it just didn\'t do it for me..\n\nSteak cut fries: Awesome! Delicate light crunchy skin and inside had a crumbly fine mashed potato textured consistency. Loved it!\n\nService Outstanding, Atmosphere fun (probably would of been even more fun with one of their Insane alcohol shake blends!), Value was fair (pricey ingredients but the burger didn\'t deliver much flavor) But I liked the Fries! =/'

S'Whenever we go to the Cosmopolitan we try to stop in at Holsteins. The food is playful, but not ridiculously out there. We particularly enjoy trying the various "Tiny Buns" like the Crispy Pork Belly Buns and the Toscana. In fact, We\'ve come to the point where we usually end up ordering one or two snacks, and two orders of mini-buns, a few beer and that\'s dinner! \n\nI find their prices reasonable and our dinner for two with several beer generally comes in at about 75-80$\n\nThe ambiance at Holsteins is very casual and the bar fills up quite quickly come 7pm, before that, you can usually find a spot. The only time I really am not fond of Holsteins is when there is a sports game on and they charge a minimum for the seating in front of the bar. We are a couple and there is just no way we would consume 200$ worth of beer and food, and we\'re not big sports people.\n\n\n\nWe\'ve always received attentive service, good food and quality beer recommendations!'

S"Yes, this place is located in one of the hottest hotels on the strip, and yes, Holsteins atmosphere is equally as  hip. From the creatively named menu items, to the overly fake-eyelashed waitresses, Holsteins really tries to grab your attention.\n\nAs for the food and service at this place... Meh. I had ordered the turkey burger and a side salad with dressing on the side. When I started eating my burger, I noticed that there was a small white square on my lettuce. The little white square was an expiration sticker that the chef had forgotten to take-off my lettuce leaf before sending the food out. The waitress was unapologetic, but the manager did come over to say he was sorry. Once the food was re-prepared and delivered to my table, the chef had drenched my salad in dressing. I hate being 'one of those customers', but I had to send my salad back to the kitchen. Again, no apology from the waitress.\n\nThe burger itself was just okay. There was nothing to write home about on the flavor of the meat, bun, or side salad. I've had better elsewhere.\n\nWhile I don't expect my meal to be comped, I did expect something more once I informed the waitress that there was a sticker on my food. Nope, I paid full price for my disappointing meal.\n\nBeing a local in Vegas, I have my pick of the litter when it comes to burger joints. Holsteins is a place I don't believe I would visit again."

S"I am giving this place 3.5 stars. The service was weird from the start. We had a party of five, and they made us wait 10 minutes when the restaurant only had about 5 tables full. We sat down, were handed menus, and our waiter never came by for another 10 minutes. One of us had to ask someone for water, and ask for a waiter. The waiter also took forever to come back to take our orders.\n\nFrom there, it seemed like he tried to redeem himself the entire time. We finally ordered. I had the billionaire burger for $28. It was a kobe beef patty with foie gras, onions, frisee, and truffle mayo. The burger was really good and filling. I only ate half. It came with a  side of fries and I mistakenly chose the shoestring fries. The steak fries were much better. Oh yea, the waiter bought us buckets of fries while we waited for our food to try to suck up to us. It came with a house made ketchup that was really good. \n\nMy friend's burger was sent back to the kitchen twice. He asked for a well done patty, and it came out super rare that it bled all over the plate. Second, they forgot the grilled onions.\n\nLastly, the waiter called the manager over to give us free dessert of liquid nitrogen meringues. \n\nOverall, the burgers and fries were fine, but the service was weird."

S"Okay so once again I'm going to disagree with my fellow yelp reviewers and say that I was not wowed by my meal at Holsteins Shakes and Buns, and I think there are better burger places in Vegas. Holsteins is located at The Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino directly across the entrance to the Marquee Pool and Day club. Because of the location you will need to have a reservation or be prepared to wait with the diva's and meat sticks that frequent the place.  We did have a reservation and were seated on time. The decor at Holsteins is eighties cool. Cartoon Artwork dots the walls, boom boxes are painted in bright colors and a huge pink cow welcomes you in the bar area. After looking over the menu, my wife Simone ordered the Meatball Parm sliders and I ordered the Nom-Nom burger topped with melted cheese, Potato Chips and House made thousand Island dressing. The food came out fairly quickly, and on the side I had some tasty crunchy potato stick thin french fries. My burger however was overcooked ( ordered medium and got well done). An overcooked burger made with fresh ground meat ends up tasting like sawdust, and this was the case. The burger could have been saved by the dressing, but there was very little of the dressing on it. The Chips on top were the best part of the burger. Medium thin hand cut and fried perfectly, they stayed crispy on the sandwich and gave a nice contrast to the burger, but overall this burger sounded better then it tasted. Simone's sliders were the exact opposite of my burger. The meatballs had great garlicky flavor, they were moist, tender and tasted fresh. They were topped with a mixture of sweet marinara and basil pesto and lots of melted creamy mozzarella. I so wanted to steal them from her and I had total meat envy.  We finished off the meal with a Reese PB adult shake spiked with Frangelico called the Drunken Monkey.  Any monkey that could get drunk off this would have to be a lightweight because I could taste no alcohol in it whatsoever. It was still good, once again just not as good as advertised.  So in the end I would have given Holsteins a 2 star rating for my food however Simone's sliders choice saved the day...so overall Holsteins gets a three stars from me."

The Honey Brown beer was actually really good.  The bar tender was extremely nice and gave me samples of two different beers before I picked one.\n\nThen we sat down at the restaurant.  We were greeted with truffle butter popcorn courtesy of the chef and boy were they delicious.  Then I ordered the Kobe burger with fried avocado and yam with a spicy mayo sauce ($16).  This was a mighty juicy burger, but it's not as good as Burger Bar at the Mandalay Bay.  My friend ordered the duck fat fries and these were delicious with the aroma of the duck fat soaked into the fries.  My steak fries were not comparable.\n\nWe were too full to check the dessert out, but maybe next time.  Overall, a wonderful experience for a new burger joint and will return again if I visit the Cosmopolitan, although I will try out the other restaurants there before returning.  This is in between a 3-4 stars, but closer to 4 stars."

S'Holsteins is a good place to go when dining with people of varying dietary preferences, it seems as though there\'s something for everyone.  I ordered the vegan burger entitled "Urth Burger" which was made with their very own house made vegan patty, lettuce, tomato, onion, and avocado (additional).  I thought it was average, but I can\'t put my finger on what I thought it was lacking.  Maybe pickles?  Either way, given the quality of the burger this isn\'t a place I\'d go on my own, but a place I would go as a compromise to eat with my carnivorous counterparts.

S"We stopped by Holsteins for dinner hoping that it would be a more casual and faster dining experience than some of the other options in the area. Maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but there are very few fast casual dining options near the City Center that don't involve sandwiches or hot dogs. \n\nAnyway, it was a Tuesday night. Even though place was pretty dead, service was spotty. Our server wasn't super friendly, but she got the job done. Our food came out pretty quickly. \n\nI ordered the Urth Burger, which is their vegan burger. It was fine. The patty was thick and moist. My only complaint is that the burger itself was a bit dry. It was supposed to come with avocado, but there was only a light green schmear on one of the buns. \n\nThe boy ordered the traditional burger. He seemed to love it. He pretty much devoured the whole thing. \n\nBoth the orders came with fries. He got the natural cut fries and I ordered the sweet potato fries. When the fries first came out, there were cold and soggy. We sent them back to the kitchen and got a new batch. \n\nHis natural cut fries were way better than the sweet potato fries. My sweet potato fries were cut too thin, so most of the fries were overcooked and burnt. \n\nPrices are typical of places in Vegas. For our two burgers and a shake, we spent nearly $40, not including tip. \n\nIf this place were back in Austin, I'd probably never go again, but since it's Vegas, I guess it gets a pass."

Don't get me wrong, my dirty martini still cost $20, but it's a nice casual spot to grab a bite if you don't feel like having a waiter set the napkin on your lap and you want to be able to watch sports at the bar without feeling like a jerk towards your date.\n\nOur group of 7 showed up on a Saturday night, expecting a crazy house and a long wait because they don't take resos on the weekends, but surprisingly we were sat right away at a great table in the middle of the restaurant.  \n\nMy date and I split a classic burger with bacon and cheddar (Lame, I know, but neither of us were that hungry),  as well as the calamari and some sweet potato fries.  Everything was really good.  The burger and calamari were good but nothing special.  The sweet potato fries, on the other hand, were DELICIOUS!  Nothing fancy about them, just simple sweet potato fries that were perfectly crunchy on the outside and hot and yummy on the inside with a hint of saltiness to compliment it's natural sweet flavor.  MMmmmm!\n\nThis is a very fun and casual spot and you still feel like you're in the middle of all the excitement at Cosmo.  \n\nAnd though this is to be expected because it IS the Cosmo, our bill was was a LOT for what we ordered: $46 each, and we shared a burger.

We ordered our burgers on the med-well side, but were more well, but still good. Next time we'll order them medium instead, so they are more juicy.  I've never had goat cheese on my burger and it added a yummy creamy flavor.  My daughter and hubby had their milkshakes - one chocolate and the other strawberry - both without alchohol.

We opted to sit at the bar and try their happy hour specials along with a few things off their menu.\n\nI woud HIGHLY recommend the Miso Chilean sea bass, as it was once of the BEST I have ever had. The vegetables that came with it were so tender and delicious, even though I hate Brussels sprouts, the rest were quite good.\n\nThe Spicy tuna rolls were really good also, though small compared to other places I've had them.\n\nThe BEST vegetable dish I've had in a long time were the Collard Greens in an asian dressing. They were crunchy and filling enough for two. Though, next time I'm not sharing! \n\nAnother stand out to me were the Fried plantains. Normally, restaurants cut them thick and serve them with sides of beans and sour cream. I loved that these were cut thin and lightly breaded, deep fried and sprinkled only with some shavings of cheese. \n\nBesides the sea bass, the items we got were only $5-6 bucks a dish and easily can be split by two. This was probably my favorite place to dine while there and probably one of the better late night dining options you have if you don't feel like burgers or sandwiches.\n\nI would have loved to give them a full 5 stars but the bar people were much to slow in not only forgetting to ask our order but forgetting to bring us our drinks after having to ask  three times, while serving those who just sat down right away.

S'I want to like this place SO MUCH.  The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \n\nTo be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this \'tasting menu\' that would "incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn\'t eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue "fighting".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \n\nIf this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it\'s spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I\'m sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. \n\nIn short, come here if you\'re in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I\'m sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.'

Wouldn't suggest the lobster again but the hamachi was SOOOO yummy!\nFor dinner we did the Kobe on hot stone experience- while the meat lacked flavor it made up for it in texture- OMG.. \nHamachi Kama was Huge! And Sake was so Super Smooth.. Love me some Daiginjo! \nI'm a fan of the food.. Pricing well... It's Vegas- that's all there is to say about that' .."

S'I flipping LOVE SushiSamba. I\'ve been here 3 times and it\'s just been incredible. This most recent trip, we were a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party. We had lucked out by getting reservations the day of and they didn\'t make us wait. I thought they seated us in a weird spot...but no, our reservations were just so early, the place wasn\'t that full, but the table ended up being fine.\n\nWe decided to do the omakase style for around $50/person. They brought out the cocktail tree with 9 glasses of the Samba Juice which was incredible and such a great way for them to start wooing us, haha. \n- First course: fried green beans with truffle aioli (my fave!), grilled jalepenos (big hit!), and edamame.\n- Second course: Fish tacquitos (loved the shell, very crispy), a mushroom tacquito & large salad for the vegetarian, and pork pot stickers (good not great). \n- Third course: the famed Chilean Sea Bass skewers (melt.in.your.mouth), scallops with like a chimichurri sauce (delicious), and the Peruvian corn (so unique). \n- Fourth course: Meat/mushroom coconut milk "curry" (I hate coconut milk, and this was the one dish that we didn\'t make a considerable dent in...and they don\'t serve rice with this! Weird).\n- Fifth course: Sushi. There were 3 different fish sushi rolls (salmon, tuna, and something else) and then 3 vegetarian (avocado, cucumber, and sweet potato--sweet potato was my fave!). They then brought out the dessert for my friend, which was comp\'d which was nice.\n\nIn my opinion, I felt like the chef prepared way too many fish dishes for this particular group because we had a vegetarian, we had someone who was allergic to shellfish, and we had 3 people who didn\'t like fish...and yet, we got A LOT of fish. I think a lot of people go to SushiSamba and expect sushi...but it\'s fushion, it\'s not traditional sushi. I would definitely recommend doing the omakase style to start out--you can do it for $30-$75 per person and it\'s really fun. I rate it 4 stars because I think they should be more creative for vegetarians--vegetarians eat more than mushrooms :) But the service is GREAT and the food is amazing. Definitely one of my most consistent favorite places in Vegas.'

S"The place was packed, it was Friday night, and we did not have a reservation. I thought we were doomed, but we were able to be seated at the sushi bar in 5 minutes.\nI have some food allergies and told the waitress what I couldn't eat. Despite her being clearly busy and running her butt off, she took the time to help guide me through the menu. And if she didn't know, she was ready and willing to find out (despite clearly being hella busy!)\nMy cocktail was complex and intriguing (but supposedly spicy and it wasn't) and I'd love to try to figure out how to make it at home.\nThe plating was spectacular for all of the dishes. The standout was the shishito peppers (which I always love, but these were extra awesome.)\nThe foie gras on one of my sushi rolls was a really nice touch.\n\nI'd give 10 stars for service, if I could. But my 4-star rating is for food alone. That said, I'd still really recommend giving it a go."

S"Not a big fan of the name they have for this restaurant, but the rest of the experience was amazing.  The dining room is large and well designed (rumor has it the build-out cost $10M).  We had a large party of 12, which can always be a challenge for a packed restaurant, but not here.  Our waiter was terrific and recommended family style meal and provided two options - w/o Kobe would run around $60pp, and with Kobe would run around $80-90pp.  We opted to go without (which I suggest based on our experience).  Boom - out comes the food.  The meal was around 3-4 courses and included cooked appetizers, sushi rolls, and beef / pork proteins.  Each course was fresh - hot dishes hot, cold dishes cold and tasted great.  The ribeye was a bit overcooked, but given how many they crank out, it wasn't a huge disappointment.  The experience here was a thousand times better than Mastro's the night before in terms of level of service, food quality, and how fast the dishes came out.  Definitely recommend this place (especially for large parties).\n\nThey did have a nice cocktail and sake menu.  Their mixed drinks were pretty good, but not stellar.  If you order shots here, they offer a very generous pour (which is great)."

Get sushi somewhere else if that's what you're looking for. \n\nDid their sampler menu which includes sushi, seafood and Kobe beef. Nothing tasted bad....but it was $150 a person. One out of the 9 items brought to the table was memorable - the sea bass on a stick. Oh, and the $8 double shot of espresso that woke me up ;). \n\nCost our group of 7 over $1K. Not that much food. Outrageously priced and you can get WAY better (more interesting and flavorful) sushi for a fraction of the cost. Nice service and wait staff though. Unless you're rich don't waste your money. Nice of them to give us birthday shooters of a tasty pink lemonade shooter."

You can go as traditionally Japanese or Latin as you want with the assortment of sushi and churrascaria--but the best way to do it is with the fusion-y dishes that combine the best of both worlds.

S"My friend wanted to celebrate her tax return and take me to lunch (hooray for me!!) She wanted to have sushi on the Strip, well mostly all the sushi restaurants on the Strip don't open until dinner, except SUSHISAMBA, so that's where we landed.  While we waited for them to open, I was scoping yelp reviews to see what we should order. The Peruvian Corn seemed to be the #1 suggestion, so that's what we started out with.  Neither  one of us were impressed, sorry to say, but I felt like I was eating just a giant piece of corn kernal. But it was all uphill from there. \n\nOur server, Drago, was very attentive and full of suggestions, he had asked if we dined here before and I told him I had been to the one in Miami, then he said he would bring us something on the house for coming back. When I tell you, you MUST order these, I'm not exaggerating, they were excellent, not on the menu, Peruvian Bay Scallops, prepared differently than the one on the menu. They were so good we had to order another round. I am a huge fan of yellowtail, so we ordered the Yellowtail taquitos, so tasty, I loved the crunch that the mini taco shell added to the yellowtail flavor. Next up was a table favorite as well, Sea Bass Miso, it melted in your mouth.  I was skeptical at first, they are served on a skewer, so I wasn't expecting the amazing flavor I tasted when I took my first bite. Drago suggested the El Topo roll, both of us like hot,, super spicy food, this roll had a nice kick at the end, I normaily don't like any kind of dairy on my sushi rolls, i.e. cream cheese, etc....but this had melted mozzarella, it was excellent. Then came the grand finale, my friend is a HUGE Kobe beef fan so she wanted to try the Wagyu beef, excellent grade A5, Ishi Yaki hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables. presentation was so nice, lots of different sauces to try.  DESSERT, yes we still had room for dessert, we tried the Peruvian Hot Chocolate con Cr\xc3\xa8me served with traditional churros and the Coco Duo dark and white chocolate custard with praline. The second one was by far the best. A must. Also try the house made iced tea, they mix fresh orange juice, lime juice and lemon with black tea.....think I drank a pitcher of it.  Good food, service, ambiance!"

This time I had the tempura greenbeans with a truffle oil dipping sauce (Delicous!), Berkshire Pork Gyoza and Rock Shrimp Tempura (at the recommend of our server)  Everything was well prepared and efficiently served.

There are plenty of people running around taking empty plates from your table and refilling your water...which is super important considering you're in Las Vegas and are probably dehydrated from the night before or from moments before. \nI asked where the restroom was and I was escorted there and once I got to the restroom there was an attendant that escorted me to the correct stall. \n\nFood:\nThe miso cilantro soup is da bomb. Go ahead and try it would ya? \nI'm no sushi fan at all but my bf insisted on me trying his eel avocado roll AND salmon avocado roll...holy crap...I LIKE SUSHI!! These are probably the first sushi rolls I enjoyed. Total yum-sicles and magical unicorns to go along with it. \nI also had the fillet mignon which was flippin good. \n\nLong story short (too late), try this place. It's dope.

S"When we were in Vegas in November, we decided to dine at Sushi Samba one night since we were staying at the Palazzo. The restaurant is tucked away in the corner and has a dark sexy vibe to it. We had 6:30 pm reservations on a Friday night and since it was a little early, the restaurant was not overly busy which allowed us to receive a lot of attention from Mike, our waiter. He was one of the best waiters I have had in a restaurant in a long time...he was very helpful in helping us select a bottle of sake and made recommendations on the food and how many plates to order for our group of 5. Plus he checked on us often enough so we didn't sit with empty glasses, but not too much where it was annoying.\n\nThe food was amazing for the most part. The scallops and chicken robota were my two favorite things that we ordered that evening. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were not gritty at all. They didn't quite have that melt in my mouth feeling, but were some of the best I have had since moving to the Southwest. My husband sampled some of the sushi that our group ordered, and even as a sushi newcomer, he was not blown away by it. It was probably the most disappointing of the dishes that our group ordered. Our group received three complimentary desserts (we were celebrating 3 birthdays that evening) of which the chocolate hazelnut dish was my favorite. It was absolutely heavenly.\n\nOur group's bill came to approximately $200, which I thought was reasonable given the number of dishes we ordered, plus we also had a bottle of sake ($62 itself), and several other alcoholic beverages. Sushi Samba is definitely a great restaurant for those dining in a group because the circular booths are large and perfectly designed for chatting with the person next to you or across the table. I will definitely dine again at Sushi Samba on a future trip to Vegas."

S"A Japanese Brazilian Fusion Restaurant\n\nThis is a good place to show off to a date or people from another country, but other than that, it just becomes another fancy restaurant in Las Vegas. The service is excellent, but the I think the concept of this restaurant doesn't really attract me. There was nothing really special, it just seemed like a Brazilian BBQ restaurant with sushi.\n\nThe meats are really good, we had the 5 meat Churrasco ($46) and some Kobe beef sashmi ($12 per piece!). The Kobe beef sashmi is grilled on a cooking rock.\n\nThe selection of oysters was not that many, but the ones that did carry : Malpeque and Blue Point ($3-$4) were decent.\n\nOverall Sushi Samba is an very okay restaurant. It is quite expensive, although very exquisite. I can now say I have been here, but there are other places to try."

S"I'm not a sushi purist, I love the fusion crap :)  I would give them 4 stars but they ran out of King crab.  How do you run out of something that makes up the base for many different items/rolls u serve.  We ordered something called the Yamato roll which was pretty good except for the fact that it was $19 for 3 pieces.  It was the only roll that didn't have the standard 5-6 pieces.  For that much money I was expecting much more pop.  I love anything with Foie Gras so I may have liked the Yamato roll more than I should've.  However, if you don't like Foie Gras skip it and get something else.  The Miso Seabass was fantastic just like the waiter described.  What bothers me is that they keep telling you how little the portions are AFTER u order the dish which makes u order it twice or more  if you're with two plus people.  The Miso Seabass was like $16 for ONE skewer.  The food is good but be warned if you want to leave full you will spend a lot of money.  Good thing it was comped thanks to my buddy.\n\nPS  The Chef's Sushi/Sashime does not come with straight Sashime.  It was one sushi roll with some Nigiri."

It was so awesome! If coming here, I'd suggest making reservations because it is jam packed, but only because it is THAT good. The environment is bustling and vibrant. So. Much. Fun! \n\nWhen my friends showed up we got seated right away were introduced to the chef who told us he had many special dishes on their way. First off they presented us with a tower of drinks! All mini glasses of their specialty cocktails. So awesome! There were four of us and they brought us a total of 3 towers, so we each got to try 6 different flavors. Loved it so much. The variety was just amazing. I'd have to say my top 3 favorites were the Chu-cumber (cucumber flavored one), the lemon samurai, and pisco sour (I have visited Peru before so I've had the opportunity to try an authentic version of this before). So so great!\n\nAll the meals brought out for us to share were fantastic! The Peruvian corn was different a cool blend of flavors to add to our palette. The Alaskan king crab legs were perfection! And my other favorite dishes were the mini tacos and the shelled scallops. So amazing! Other fantastic dishes I got to try were the salt and pepper squid, rock shrimp tempura (amazing), miso marinated sea bass, chicken teriyaki-samba style... Like I said. One. Amazing. Experience!!!

S'Ever since I came here the first time I went to Vegas, I\'ve been DYING to come back.\n\nThe food is so good!  I thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we\'ve tried on the menu thus far is DELICIOUS.\n\nAmbiance is classy and cool.  It\'s a nice location within the Palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  Service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a Friday night at midnight.\n\nWe got:\n\nMOQUECA MISTA - shrimp, squid, sea bass, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA#T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA\n\nThis thing is the BEST EVER.  Creamy Thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  Rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel DIVINE.  I thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow I kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!\n\nEL TOPO SUSHI ROLL - salmon, jalape\xc3\xb1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the moqueca mista)\n\nVery unique roll with interesting flavors and textures = Delicious!\n\nCHICKEN TERIYAKI - Samba Style organic chicken, aji amarillo, purple potato mash, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)\n\nWhen I saw the huge price tag I thought "WTF?!", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so I had no control).  BUTTT I\'ll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken I\'ve ever had in my life!  Super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (I think) to a crisp.  The sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.\n\nAs with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the Las Vegas Strip, I did think the prices were a little inflated.  Hence the lack of that final star.  However, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in Vegas.  I\'ll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  They have a good happy hour too (both early evening and late night), so I\'ll have to take advantage of that next time! :)'

This is probably why my father who once detested it's clubby and loud environment is now willing to venture there all the time.  For the yellowfin collar.  Squeeze some lemon or lime on that and it's good.\n\nOtherwise the ramen doesn't taste like ramen, but like good noodle soup, and the gyoza is tempting but not actually better than the O'Tasty frozen variety.

I don't know what is all the hype about Sushisamba. There is one in Chicago and New York I believe, but I don't know why it's supposed to be so good or cool. \n\nOne of the roll my fiance and I got had charboiled steak on it, which made the whole roll taste like charcoal. I also wasn't impressed with their special sauces like key lime mayo on their other rolls, but I guess you need some kind of gimmick to make your products special. The overall look of the rolls were the best I've seen either. Come on, Sushisamba. You have to step it up. \n\nThe rolls were fine.

The side dishes were pretty good also. \n\nWorth mentioning also is the outstanding help we received from both the waitress and the sommelier when trying to select a good, but decently priced bottle of wine (under one hundy!!). We went with one of their recommendations: Veraison Synchrony 2004 (Napa Valley). It is mostly a Cab franc/sauvignon blend with a bit of malbec and merlot. It was very smooth and complemented the steak perfectly!! I looked at my local wine shop and they carry it at $60 a bottle. Considering we payed less than $100 for it, it wasn't too much of a mark up (and you know what I mean... Bottles that cost $10 at Ralphs are sometimes 6 or 7 times that at a restaurant!).\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that my boyfriend and I stayed at the MGM through the PRIMA deal. This deal entails that you are going to spend $500 through out the MGM Grand resorts and you get special deals like 2 for 1 entrees at the MGM restaurant, 2 for 1 drinks at the bars, free entrance at wet republic, etc. etc. Even though most of our group stayed at the MGM, my boyfriend and I were the only ones that got the PRIMA deal and thought that they would only give us our entrees at 2 for 1. However, they honored it for the WHOLE table (around 8 of us). We saved over $200!!  A GREAT deal!!"

S"Now this is eating.  American kobe steak.  The hands down greatest steak I have ever eaten.  American kobe (wagyu) beef is a cross between the full Japanese cow and Angus.  This was done because the wagyu beef is extremely marbled, almost white and thus not as appealing to Americans.  Plus American kobe is alot less expensive since you only need one kobe cow to tango.  That being said Craftsteak does actually have 100% wagyu but it is crazy expensive.  They also have non kobe steaks, which are damn good.  Have tried the new york and it was awesome.  But I am here for the kobe steak.\n\nSo back to the meal, Craftsteak is located in the MGM Grand hotel.  I've been here twice now.  You can either order a la carte.  Steak, appetizers, sides, deserts etc, similar to other places like Ruths Chris and Flemings.  Or you can get a one of their taster meals, the basic one being $130 a person.  Pretty damn expensive but wow, that is eating like a king.  I've tried it both ways and its great either way.\n\nAppetizers include kobe tartar which is awesome.  Sides like baby broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, and the spinach are good.  The potatoes are not as good as other steak places I've been to.  The deserts are pretty solid as well, ice creams, monkey bread, etc.  Most importantly though are the steaks.  The Flat iron is noticeably different from other steaks, but the kobe skirt steak, their signature steak, and kobe ribeye are awesome.  The ribeye is richer, almost too rich, than the skirt and is probably better but the skirt is definitely more manageable.  Both are great but if you are ordering a la carte and have to eat the whole steak yourself, get the skirt.  A la carte, the skirt is also 35 dollars cheaper as well.    \n\nThe various samplers are expensive and worth it if you are very hungry.  But most people will not finish their meals and to leave any kobe steak over would certainly be a sin.  Also remember that kobe steaks are more filling than regular steaks, so choose wisely.  I find that I am fine ordering the kobe skirt and 1 side.  This place is excellent."

S'WHO: Me and my boyfriend\nWHY: Our 4th year anniversary\n\nThis visit makes it our 3rd visit at Craftsteak and all I can say is I\'ve been consistently pleased with the food items I\'ve ordered and the service I\'ve had. \n\nMe and the bf were seated in a comfy booth, which I requested when I previously made our reservation online on MGM\'s website.  Our server introduced himself and also wished us a happy anniversary.  **On a sidenote, I mentioned this detail in my online reservation and so I\'m pretty sure he was aware of that detail since we didn\'t specifically tell him of our occasion.**  We placed our drink orders: my bf ordered a Martini and I ordered a Champagne Martini.  A lady carrying a large professional camera then came up to us and asked if we wanted our picture taken.  We said sure and for the next minute or so, I felt like we were at a photo studio with the poses she suggested we do and the bright flash going off every other second.  She told us she\'d bring the photos back later for us to look at and with that she left.  Our drinks came out along with the cute mini bread loaf and butter. By this time we already knew what to order: \n\n-No appetizer since 2 side dishes and our entrees would be more than enough for the both of us\n-2 Side Dishes: the Roasted Garlic and Leek Gratin & the Roasted Corn \n-Entrees: the 8oz Wagyu Beef (medium) for me & the 10oz Wagyu Beef (medium well) for the bf\n\nBy the time our order was brought out, we had also ordered a 2nd round of drinks.  The past 2 times we\'ve eaten here, we\'ve always ordered the Leek Gratin because of its creamy garlicky deliciousness.  We had never eaten leeks until Craftsteak, but the boatload of butter, cream and roasted garlic added to the dish and you might not realize you are eating leeks cuz its that damn good.   The past 2 times we\'ve been to Craftsteak we\'ve ordered the spinach which is good, but not great and so we settled on the Roasted Corn...it easily became our 2nd side dish for future visits. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, tasted lovely, as usual, and easily devoured. I was also completely surprised at how my champagne martini paired well with my meal.  The champagne\'s bubbliness cut through the heaviness of the rich gratin and meaty steak. At the end of our dinner, our server asked if we wanted any dessert.  When we said no, he kept jokingly asking us if we were really sure.  We told him we were happily stuffed and couldn\'t fit anything else in our bellies.  He left and a few minutes later he presented us with a small plate of bite-sized sweets and the words "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate on the plate.  OMG, super cute and super sweet!\n\nNo sooner had he left, when the lady who took our photos presented us with different photos and an option to purchase a (cheesy) pleather album containing our choice of any 2 photos.  Since the photos did come out cute, I picked the 2 photos while the bf handled the cost.  The grand total for this pleather album with 2 photos?????  $85. Yes, $85 for 2 pictures in a cheesy black pleather album.  However, given that we were in Vegas, on our anniversary, and presented with great looking photos of the both of us together we couldn\'t say no.  As a \'freebie\' the lady threw in 2 wallet sized pictures also in a cheesy pleather wallet carrier.  \n\nLong review short: I love the service. I love the drinks. I love the food.\nAnd apparently...I love their $85 photos!'

S'I wish that I could give this place more then 5 stars... and I don\'t believe I\'ve ever thought that way about a restaurant before.  It made me actually think about other places I gave 5 stars to, in order to down-grade them.  Everything here was absolutely amazing: service, food, wine, ambiance, and value.\n\nThis was another one of those restaurants that I had very high expectations for.  I mean, Tom Colicchio is like a God to me.  I\'m a huge Top Chef fan... since the very first season... so this was a must-visit restaurant for me on my trip to Vegas.  Not only did he meet my high expectations, but they were completely blown out of the water.\n\nOur server was so great... she was very knowledgeable about the food and wine, and was great about keeping our waters and bread plate full.  Towards the end of the meal, when we realized how late we were running, she brought our check with the desserts and was so prompt that we were able to make our VIP table reservation at Studio 54.\n\nI absolutely loved the ambiance here.  Very manly... dark wood and leather.  So gorgeous and classy, but also laid back and easy.  I thought the fact that the bread and steaks were served on cast-iron skillets, fit in perfectly.  And the bread was amazing: white dinner rolls with a salted crust on top.\n\nNow to the food... oh, the food.  I saw something about a summer tasting menu online beforehand, so I asked the waitress about it.  She said that they only do that during the week... but moments later she returned and said that it would be fine.  My girlfriends and I decided that at $60/person, it was a great idea.  One of my friends and I added the wine pairing for around $15, which was amazing... the 3 glasses of wine went perfectly with each course.\n\nFor our first course we had:  \nShaved Fennel Salad\nGrilled Quail, Vincotto\nBuffalo Mozzarella with Red Pepper Caponata\nPersian Cucumber Salad\n\nNow this was my first time tasting fennel and quail, and it was a great one!  Everything was amazing, and there was so much food for us 4 girls to eat!\n\nFor our main course we had:\nPrime Beef Flat Iron\nAngus Skirt Steak\nDiver Sea Scallops\n\nI\'m not a seafood fan, so I only had the steaks for this course.  Both of them were the BEST steaks I have EVER had.  Both perfectly cooked to medium... juicy, and delicious flavor.  They gave us 1 big flat iron steak, and 2 big skirt steaks.  We had so much food, that there were leftovers of the steak (which I was not too happy about, but so stuffed I couldn\'t eat another bite!).\n\nFor the side dishes we had:\nYukon Gold Potato Pur\xc3\xa9e\nSaut\xc3\xa9ed Snap Peas\nRoasted Shiitake Mushrooms\n\nI had the potato puree\' and snap peas, because I despise mushrooms... but both of those were delicious.  Not over-spiced... just simple and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Great compliment to the delicious flavorful steaks.  I liked that the side dishes didn\'t overpower the star of the meal: the steak.\n\nFor dessert, we had 4 different delectable plates.  I don\'t completely remember what they were, and our menu just said "Chef\'s Selection".  A couple of them were better then the rest, but they all were enjoyable.  Again, way too much food for us 4 girls.  \n\nThis was definitely one of the best dining experiences of my life, so far.  The food was divine and each course perfectly cooked.  Plus, the chef tasting menu was a great value and huge variety... so I recommend that to anyone trying this restaurant for a first time!'

S"Goooooood stuff.  Started off with the lobster bisque.  So creamy, so yummy - and fresh chunks of lobster.  Perfection.  Hubby had the frisee salad with bacon, blue cheese dressing, and an egg on top.  What a delicious combo.\n\nFor entrees, I had the braised short ribs and hubby had the rib eye steak. For our sides we chose the asparagus and the mushroom risotto.  My goodness, there was so much food, we couldn't finish it.  Oh we tried, but just couldn't.  My short ribs was about double the portion you would get anywhere else.  The rib eye was huge.  I'm guessing 16oz?  \n\nWe hate wasting food, but ultimately we had to throw in the towel.  We didn't have a fridge in our room, and didn't want to carry it on the plane home two days later.  \n\nIt was a wonderful meal in a beautiful restaurant.  Really friendly and attentive service.  Excellent food.  What more could you ask for?"

S"We were fresh off of a Kitchen Nightmare's marathon, so my roommates and I decided to go give Gordan Ramsay Steak a try, however, they were all booked up. Now with a steak craving that required immediately fulfillment, we headed to Craftsteak.\n\nI'll start by saying the two best things were by far the waitstaff and the break. The waiters were friendly, attentive, and everything came out with perfect timing. The bread was presented adorably and was ridiculously delicious, I knew I had to save room for a big meal coming up, but I legitimately couldn't stop throwing down bread, but it kinda worked out, because there's a reason bread ranks on my top 2 things about Craft.\n\nWe went with the Wagyu steak special w seafood for the 4 of us. The seafood dishes were okay, however I couldn't really get myself to eat them, just too odd for my taste(the oysters were ok, though). The steaks themselves were very average imo, and I found myself filling the remainder of my bread ridden belly with the mashed potatoes, which were also great. The other vegetables were pretty undercooked, but to be fair I typically like them extremely tender.\n\nFinally, dessert. This is something I have no complaints over. The monkey bread was literally the sweetest thing I have ever tasted, almost too rich to even keep eating(couldn't stop though, obviously). The chocolate souffle was very rich and delicious, however I only got a bite of that because of my chocolate crazy roommate who ate it within seconds. The blueberry cheesecake was probably near the best cheesecake's I've ever eaten, and the sorbets were very tasty as well. There was a 5th dessert but I'm blanking on what it was.\n\nIt was a bit pricey for what we got, however a few things redeem this place to a 3 star for me."

S'We came during restaurant week to try the $50 menu. While normally I\'d say this is no indication of their regular food.. these guys offer this menu quite frequently (the pre show dinner packages with Ka, the summer $60 menu promo they did, etc). So if you do this menu all the time, you should have it down to a science. Additionally, restaurant week is a great time to show off your restaurant.... apparently these guys didn\'t get the memo!\n\nOn to the review. We came in and they informed us they were out of the quail and the chicken and it would be subbed with proscuitto and skirt steak. BOO. Seriously, anticipate restaurant week and how busy you\'ll be.. don\'t run out of crap. That\'s BS. \n\nProscuitto, peppers, etc that came as the apps were all fine. Nothing special, just fine. Then, the "kobe" steak came. Wow I can\'t believe they served this dog food. Seriously this steak made the prime rib at Outback look amazing. Chewy texture, bad taste.. nothing redeeming. The skirt steak they subbed for the chicken wasn\'t good also. It was like fajita meat covered in rosemary. Seriously these were two of the worst steaks I\'ve had in a long time.. what a disappointment.\n\nNow the dessert story.. oh man. They brought us chocolate cake with "espresso" ice cream. The ice cream was surrounding the cake and it tasted awful. We couldn\'t figure out what made it taste so disgusting. We asked the waiter "are you sure this is espresso ice cream?" and he said "YES"... "are you really sure"... "umm ok I\'ll go check". Sure enough it was f-ing Earl Grey tea ice cream. How sick is that? Seriously if you are out of espresso put vanilla on the plate. Don\'t serve gross tea ice cream with a chocolate cake and call it espresso. \n\nA very disappointing evening. At least we got off cheap!'

S"Everyone deserves a second chance, despite my previous review/comment about second chances at such exorbitant prices.\n\nI get it...I really do. The fancy dining sofa's, ass kissing service and iron skillets. It's all good. But what's the use of iron skillets if they don't provide heat? My $60 filet was cold...once again. I hate sending food back. I won't do it. I shouldn't have to.\n\nSorry, I got ahead of myself. I jumped to the main course.\n\nThe bread is very good. That particular iron skillet delivered. I'm reluctant to Yelp anything is good in a sentence because that may become a YELP restaurant highlight.\n\nCraftSteak's beet salad is bland. I don't necessarily like salty food, so that says a lot. Maybe add a chunk of goat cheese. Not daring to be different, but it's a classic pairing. But hey, beets are good for me, so I'll move on...\n\nThe risotto was good, with all the tomatoes, bits and pieces, but was served CRUNCHY al dente. \n\nThe filet...well you know about my filet. Other than it being coldededed, it was, yes, under seasoned and BLAND. Try a Ruth's Chris steak, so hot, moist and buttery.\n\nOh, oh, oh....my Dark and Stormy, ginger and rum drink was great.\n\nThe service was very good, but I sat at the bar. That's my thing when I want great service. That's a no brainer.\n\nNo dessert tonight, even though the Monkey Bread is fan-fuckin-tastic! YELP highlight that!\n\nLucky to be alone tonight. Only $146 for one."

S"We were a party of 12 and we had the Chef's Beef Selection for 10 . It is served family style. We started with the shrimp cocktail for the table and several salads we enjoyed the Baby bibb buttermilk blue cheese with bacon. (reminded me of a wedge) and we loved the Italian buffalo mozzarella, wild arugula and roasted baby beets. Our meals had 24 hour short rib, rib eye, NY strip, flat iron , hangar and filet mignon. These were accompanied by asparagus, sweet corn, Japanese eggplant, mushroom assortment, potato puree, risotto (snap peas, prosciutto, scallions) and white corn grits. Just when you thought you were on food overload they brought out all the desert. cinnamon monkey bread, soft chooclate cake creme brulee tart and assorted sorbets.. The deserts were not as good as the meals. If you go as a group I would recommend the chef tasting vs a la carte we had plenty of food and were able to taste alot of different meals. Staff was attentive and had good suggestions."

S"Made a reservation on Open Table and got seated right away. We were staying at the MGM and decided to find a good dining establishment right here in the hotel for the convenience. CRAFTSTEAK did not disappoint!\n\nFood:\n\n1) Roasted Beet Salad $13: this dish was beautifully presented. My favorite part of this dish was the pickled egg that was dyed pink. The acid definitely brought out the sweetness in the beets.\n\n2) Butternut squash soup $16: They bring out a soup bowl with pancetta lining the bottom of the bowl. Then they pour your butternut squash soup into your bowl. The soup was creamy and delicious.\n\n3) Wagyu Skirt Steak $78: Heeding the recommendations of several Yelp reviews, I landed on the Wagyu Skirt steak. I love skirt steak because you can really taste the beefiness. What made this skirt steak so special was that not only was the flavor on point, it was SOOO tender! I usually have problems chewing on beef because of some dental issues but with this steak, there were no issues at all. I was able to savor every bite and enjoy it. This was the best skirt steak I have ever tried.\n\n4) Angus Rib Eye $55: a nice hunk of beef! I usually get rib eye whenever I can but I was happy that my partner ordered this. It was meaty and fatty, just how a rib eye should be.\n\n5) Our sides approx $13 each: maui onion, yukon gold puree, prosciutto butternut risotto: we enjoyed each of the sides that we ordered. \n\n6) Monkeybread with banana ice cream $15: It didn't take much convincing to order this dessert. Wish it came with more ice cream though!\n\nTotal cost of dinner came out to about $300 after tip. We definitely had food leftover and packaged it up to go. It was STILL very tasty the next day!!!"

S"Ok, so after loyally following Top Chef for years now, I have always been wanting to try out Craftsteak for some time.  And happy that I did. \n \nMy husband and I arrived to Vegas Saturday late afternoon and had not made any reservation.  We checked out MGM's restaurant row and stopped by to see if Craftsteak can accommodate us.  The greeter said we can get seated at the bar right away so we gladly accepted.  The restaurant is dark and was buzzing with happy eaters.\n\nNeither of us were that hungry, so we started out with frisee salad, shared 12 oz Wagyu skirt steak, sauteed spinach and french fries seasone with paprika.  \n\nBefore we were served our food, 6 fluffy,  just out of the oven bread rolls came out to us...and they were HEAVENLY!!!!  It may have been one of the best bread I had in restaurants.  \n\nI really liked frisee salad, compared to Comme Ca's because it had more dressing and less bacon to balance out the salad.  The Wagyu skirt steak came out already sliced and were DELICIOUS.  The only complaint I have is that they got cold fairly quickly.  Spinach was well seasoned and balanced our steak well, and fries, what can I say...were sooo tasty.  My husband usually needs cups of ketchup with his fries, but these fries were seasoned so well, he ate them just by itself!\n\nI will definitely come back here!  Go Tom Colicchio!!!"

S"Once again you did not disappoint CRAFTSTEAK. We were so excited to take our friends here but also concerned whether we had over-hyped our first experience here. \n\nWe did the 3 course wagyu tasting (grade 7 meats) for $140pp. However among us four, they allowed us to do 3 orders which was more than enough food. \n\nTo start off, they have these fresh mini sweet buns that are served fresh from the oven-melt in your mouth yummy.\n\nNext 4 appetizers were served: prawns, buffala mozzarella & hazelnut, frissee salad with blue cheese & bacon( delicious, one of our favorites), wagyu tar tare.\n\nNext came the wagyu filet mignon, rib-eye, and the New York strip. Of course, the best cut and most well prepared was the filet mignon, medium rare and melt in your mouth good. However, from our last trip, the skirt steak was our favorite and still is. It was prepared to perfection and it was infused with flavor in every bite despite its lower grade. Who would've thought. Our strip did come out overdone, but we sent it back and a medium rare piece came out quickly and perfectly.\n\nAs our sides, we got the mushroom assortment, Yukon gold mash, and the garlic spinach. The highlight was of course the Yukon gold mash potatoes- creamy, buttery goodness - which was raved by all other Yelpers. Among us four we couldn't finish our 3 cut of meats.\n\nLastly, we had 6 desserts that came out. It should've been 5 but our waiter forgot our request for monkey bread and brought out another dessert by mistake. Don't worry we don't mind the extras.;)\nWe tried a variety of sorbets, cheesecake, monkey bread, apple fritters, and their bread pudding. Surprisingly, the highlight for me was the cheesecake. It was extremely light, fluffy and creamy served with blood oranges. So yummy. My hubby liked the Apple fritters most this time compared to the monkey bread which was his favorite on the last visit.\n\nOverall, another pleasant and enjoyable dining experience with great company. This will probably continue to be our go-to restaurant for steak."

S"If you decide on eating at Craftsteak, I suggest you come prepared with two things: alot of cash and a huge appetite for meat. The cash, because even though the menu is extensive (items range from about $12 to $130, with most meats being $50 and up), you owe it to yourself to try the 3 course Kobe Tasting Menu at minumum. At $130 per person, it isn't cheap, but when you're done you'll realize that it was money well spent. The appetite, because assuming you've ordered the above, you will be rewarded with the most insanely good, heavenly Kobe steaks on earth along with impressive sides and desserts. \n\nOur party of four decided to go big (I don't believe in coming to these caliber restaurants and ordering small) and we were rewarded with Kobe filet mignon, Kobe ribeye, Kobe skirt steak, and Kobe sirloin. Being a chefs' tasting menu, we did not get to decide what starters/sides/cuts/desserts to order, but this made the experience that much more exciting. The entire meal was served family style, giving everyone an opportunity to try everything. The wine list was equally impressive, actually it was more like a book than a list. Apparently there were over 700 wines in it, with some bottles topping over $8000 (we did NOT go this big).\n\nEach cut of meat was presented in either a cast iron or stainless steel pan, complete with the most amazing steak sauce reductions. The filet, ribeye, and skirt steak easily could have been the best three cuts of steak I've ever had. The Kobe sirloin seemed pedestrian in comparison, but was easily up there with most cuts at any other top steakhouse. The starters and sides were also very good with the highlights being the Kobe beef tartare and the potato puree. The four desserts were also excellent but probably weren't enjoyed as much because all of us were in a Kobe-beef induced haze.\n\nThe service, decor and ambiance was excellent as expected, my only complaint being that the restaurant is super dim. Everyone in our party agreed that they'd definitely come back despite the bill, but probably would order a la carte since we knew what cuts of meat and sides we wanted, and we probably wouldn't order quite as much food. Thanks, Tom Colicchio!"

S"Food\n$23 diver sea scallops shaved fennel\nThree scallops, appeared to be fresh, slightly over cooked, mild flavor, nothing special. Just so so. \n\n$22 hand cut waygu tartare crostini\nThe texture was very soft and lacked something crispy or different to it.  They crack a raw egg into it and I think that gave it a slimey coating to the tartar. It has good flavor on its own but I wish that I hadn't ordered waygu in this tartare format.  It was difficult to tell if the meat was any good.  It didn't seem like but the egg and flavors covered it up pretty good. Good meat shouldn't be chopped up like this :(. The crostini is super salty but it was a nice size and good crunchy and fluffy texture.  \n\n$55 18 oz ribeye, dry aged angus, bone in, medium rare\nIt was served medium well :(\nFlavoring was amazing! It had a nicely grilled flavor that was a bit smokey, sweet, and salty.  Great dimension and balance.  The downside... The meat was tough and at first I thought it was because I had a dull knife. It took a lot of effort to cut through the chewy meat. It had a lot of connective tissue.  I was really surprised and asked if this was indeed dry aged.  The outer part of the steak had great flavors but the inner part was flavorless and bland. Sort of like a 20 minute aged steak where it didn't have enough time to soak into the main parts. I so wanted this to be good but it wasn't :(\n\n\n$15 baby spinach garlic oil\nFantastic!!! One of the best spinach side dishes I've ever had at a steak house.  Fresh, perfectly cooked, and flavorful. I highly recommend this.\n\n$15.00 Cinnamon Monkey Bread\nCinnamon brioche pecan toffee sauce, banana ice cream\nAmazing!! The flavors had a nice punch to the palate and the ice cream was over the top! Don't leave here without trying this.\n\nDecaf coffee\nCame in a French press. Very nice robust flavors for a decaf.  Excellent portion.\n\nService\nAttentive and friendly staff. Great service!\n\nOverall\nWould not recommend the beef here. \nCome here for coffee and dessert instead!"

Not a fan...\n\nMain Course:\nGrilled Angus Skirt Steak: Medium rare, juicy, and very tasty! 2 different cuts of beef and both were excellent. \nRoasted Flat Iron Steak: Medium rare, and also very juicy and tasty! \nDiver Sea Scallops: Huge pieces and delectable! \n\nSides:\nYukon Gold Potato Puree: Smooth and buttery\nBaby Shiitake Mushrooms: Great over the steaks, however, very scrumptious alone \nRoasted Brussels Sprouts: Could do without \n\nDessert:\nChocolate Souffl\xc3\xa9 Hot Fudge Sauce & Caramel Ice Cream: DELICIOUS!!! I was in chocolate heaven!!!\nVanilla Bean Cheesecake Blueberries & Lemon Poppy Seed Tuile: I'm a fan, although I loved the souffle the best!!!\n\nThe service was excellent, and everyone was very friendly, proper and helpful. I heard that this place gets packed, and for a week night, it was getting there. Enjoyed my experience, and hope to come back soon!"

S'If I didn\'t have a dress code at work I would probably fashion up myself a shirt that said "I heart Craftsteak" and paste in a picture of Tom Colicchio underneath it.  In fact, I may go so far as to put the number of the reservation line on my shirt as well.  \n\nCraftsteak offers great decor, amazing service, and 5-star food.  \n\nOn the plates: Salad, American Kobe Skirt Steak, Potato Gratin w/ Leeks, Duck Confit and Monkey Bread.\nWe ordered all the items separately and they still meshed very well; true testament to great menu planning.  The salad was very simple and had only 1 main green but the seasoning was off the charts.  I\'m sure it\'s just basic salt and pepper, but golly gee does Tom know salt and pepper!  The Skirt steak did not have the obvious problem that most skirt steaks have and was not at all chewy.  The steak had a great buttery consistency and in a very cliche way "melted in your mouth."  I never knew meat could do that, but apparently well trained chefs can finagle skirt steak to accomplish such a feat.   Since leeks are a favorite of Tom\'s, diners can rest assured knowing that he wouldn\'t have leeks any other way than perfect.  Lastly, the monkey bread was a great finale to dinner.  Perfectly crisp on the outside the bread is able to be pulled off from the rest of the pieces and maintains softness and airy-ness in the middle.  Frosting accompainment was not too sweet and the cinnamon was not at all overpowering.  A well made dessert.\n\nIf you go to one restaurant in Vegas to splurge it better be Craftsteak.  And who knows you too may be in the market for an "I heart Craftsteak" shirt.'

S'If you go to a steakhouse just for the meat (is there a better reason?), Craftsteak, run by James Beard awarded, Top Chef-winning Tom Collichio is hard to top. Their selections--some roasted, some grilled--of wet and dry aged Prime Angus beef (T-Bones, hangar steaks), as well as Wagyu (American Kobe) are expansive and show a true appreciation of beef. In particular, the wagyu flatiron and wagyu skirt steak are both loaded with flavor despite dense velvety texture (and the skirt steak held a beautiful char). Though their prime hangar steak was virtually as good, aged so thoroughly it had the distinct essence of blue cheese (undoubtedly the deal of the menu, if not the best meat for its price in the whole town). All meat is finished in a bordelaise reduction that makes the thought of any other sauce redundant. \n\nThere are of course oysters and several other shellfish options.\n\nTheir sides and options show an attention to fresh ingredients rather than tried-and-true recipes---market mushrooms, Jerusalem artichokes, a sweet corn dish with "cult status" (says the waiter), and a fine persian cucumber salad are among the must-haves. \n\nWine pairings were good, not great. They have a category-killing selection of well over 100 Scotch whiskeys, and plenty of big California Cult wines on their list, if money is burning a hole in your pocket.\n\nFor dessert, their exceptionally light bread pudding and seasonal fruit proved an excellent finish.\n\nComfortable, modern, neutral ambiance in a room that feels intimate despite its size. Service is family style.'

The meats were all soft and juicy. The vegetables sides were fresh and tasty. This was as perfect a place. The executive chef came from Wynn's Country Club, which is another awesome place to go as well if Craftsteak is booked."

S'Amazing grilled bison steak!  Blue cheese stuffed olives.  Prosciutto served with two tiny poached pear slices.  The kale was tasty but offered too much slab bacon and drippings for my taste - I was instantly transported to the south!  To be fair, everyone else in my group of 8 liked it.  \n\nThe focus in the restaurant was food expedition.  Everywhere, food was being served all around, and it took a long time to serve it all as it is all ala cart.  However they let us sit with our dirty dishes, empty glasses and without our bill for too long after the meal, while other tables were served endless plates of food.  Overall this was a very good experience.'

S"This was one of the BEST meals we have ever eaten in our 30 something years of marriage.  It is truly a place for meat lovers, so stay away if you want something else.  The server, David, and the entire staff were attentive, pacing our evening perfectly, as you cannot rush this eating process.  We chose the 3 course Chef's selection with red wine pairing.  The appetizer course had 4 different choices, with the frisse salad and pacific prawns being our favorite.  The Jordan Cab was the perfect pairing.  Main course provided 2 types of meat, Filet and Ribeye, melt in your mouth steaks, cooked perfectly.  Accompaniments of potatoes and asparagus rounded out the entrees. The wine a Pejuu CAB very dry and brought out the flavors of the meat.  Dessert, was seriously an OMG moment!  The monkey bread with cinnamon icecream made me not care how many miles I had to run on the treadmill the next day.  I don't know what is in this pastry, but it was truly the best ending to the evening.  We left full, happy, and a little credit card shocked, wine pairing was more than we thought, but well worth it.  YOU MUST try this place when in Vegas.  Take your time, do not rush through the evening, and you will be very happy!!"

S'It was the most amazing dinner I\'ve ever experienced! My parents, brother and I spent the weekend at MGM where everything was COMPED! \n\nWe decided to take advantage of this "free" weekend and make reservations at the renowned Craft Steak (my brother is obsessed with Top Chef). Our party of 4 ordered the Chef Tasting Menu- Kobe "Surf & Turf" (3 courses) at a whopping $155/person which is changed on a daily basis by the Chef.  We also ordered a bottle of $100 wine (you cant drink water with a meal like this). \n\n1st Course Appetizer: \n- Kobe Beef Tartar- amazing flavors, reminded me of ahi tuna. I loved the raw egg on top which gave it a nice rich flavor. \n- Roasted Red Peppers with olive oil\n- Grilled shrimp\n- Caesar salad\n\nEntree:\n-Kobe Steak  (3 types)- Rib eye, Sirloin, and Skirt Steak. All was perfectly cooked and incredibly tender. IT was my first experience with Kobe beef and I was very impressed with the quality of the meat. \n- 2 Lb. Lobster sitting in a bowl of butter sauce...mmmm...butteerrrr...\n\nSide Dishes:\nGrilled mushrooms, carrots (BEST EVER, perfectly cooked and sweet, this was my Mom\'s favorite dish), grilled asparagus, and Yukon mashed potatoes (melted in your mouth, very rich, mmm buttteerr). \n\nDessert:\n-Berry Crumble\n-6 diff ice creams and homemade sorbet - my dad\'s fave dish! He\'s still raving about the sorbet. \n-Chocolate cake with melted chocolate in the middle - my bro\'s fave.\n- Bread pudding- MY FAVE! Very rich and perfectly baked. \n- Blueberry tart\n \nAnyways, the bill came out to a total of $900 (including tip) and we were definitely more than satisfied with our meal. Even the espresso and coffee (french pressed at your table) was incredible. \n\nMy dad asked "So, would you come here again if we had to pay??"\n\nYES!'

S"I came here last Saturday, 2/18/2012, for dinner with a friend after we were told by a local that this was one of her favorite places to go for steak. We had a 5:45pm reservation and arrived on time but right at the entrance and there was already a line waiting outside. This made me even more excited to come here. The hostess was really friendly and our server was even better. He was friendly, funny, attentive, and offered amazing suggestions. Since it was our first time there, our server suggested us to go with the three course menu that came with the Maine lobster bisque for each person, 3 smaller salads of your choice to share, 3 side dishes of your choice, the main course of your choice, and 3 desserts. We decided to go with the domestic wagyu. Our server recommended us to get it medium rare because all of the fats would be nicely cooked and worked into the meat that way instead of rare so we decided to have it that way. We also ordered the Glenmorangie wood expressions (Highlands) flight for both of us to taste.\n\nThe Glenmorangie flight was delicious. You can taste the different oaks in each and it was a nice pour in each of the glasses. The Maine lobster bisque was served initially as an empty bowl so that you can see the herbs and large pieces of lobster and the server pours the hot lobster bisque soup right after. The soup was delicious, light, and creamy. Even better, I really enjoyed the parsley, chives, and large chunks of lobster in the soup which complemented the broth very well. The roasted red peppers salad had a nice soft roasted flavor to it without the char. The peppers were complimented perfectly by the chips of cooked garlic, minced basil, olive oil, pepper, and salt. The wild arugula salad was fresh and crisp and was complimented well by the large piece of shaved pecorino, pine nuts, cracked pepper, and citrus vinaigrette. The warm fris\xc3\xa9e was fresh and crisp and was complimented perfectly by the perfectly poached egg, deliciously smoked bacon, a strong cheese (not sure what it was exactly), and a mustard dressing. My friend and I shared the filet mignon and ribeye and surprisingly we found that we enjoyed the filet mignon more than the ribeye! Don't get me wrong, both were delicious, flavorful, juicy, and so tender that it could be cut with a butter knife. As recommended by our server, the must have out of the side dishes was the potato pur\xc3\xa9e. It had the texture was soft but with bits of harder chunks of potato and the flavor was so heavenly with the buttery roasted savory flavor. This was so delicious I hard time not eating it even though I was horribly full. The mushroom assortment side dish had a nice mix of different earthy tasting mushrooms which was complimented well by the subtle thyme flavor. The Maui onion was sweet and nicely roasted served in halves. It was so hard to eat dessert by then, but even that was amazing. The delicious fruit plate had 4 thin slices of sweet, crisp, and juicy Asian pear, 2 pieces of sweet and juicy Cara Cara orange, and 2 slices of sweet and sour kiwi. The flourless chocolate cake was thick and moist with a rich chocolate flavor. It was complimented by a cr\xc3\xa8me placed beautifully on top of the cake, a few slices of a tangerine, a citrus sauce, and a raspberry sorbet. We were also given two scoops of sorbet. One was blood orange and the other flavor I couldn't put my finger on. Another must have here was the cinnamon monkey bread that tasted like a heavenly cinnamon bun topped with pecans. It was perfectly complimented by a brown sugar sour cream ice cream. My friend and I were so full but we couldn't stop eating it. \n\nOverall our experience here was phenomenal! Everything here was amazing. The only complaint I have is that I wish I had a bigger stomach to enjoy all of the delicious food."

S"You don't get much better than Craftsteak.  Tucked in the back of MGM Grand, I feel like Craftsteak might be overlooked by a lot of people, even with Tom Colicchio's name plastered out front.  For everyone who has passed on Craftsteak, you missed out.  \n\nCraftsteak is simple, elegant, and executes everything perfectly.  There aren't a lot of frills, foams, or tacky decor - form follows function, and quality follows form.\n\nYou won't be overwhelmed by a large appetizer menu, which is perfectly fine with me - start with a seafood starter or a salad, I suggest the lobster bisque and the caesar, respectively, and you'll be happy.  The main focus are the steaks, which are fantastic - well portioned, perfectly cooked, and well presented.  If you have some extra money to blow, there are multiple steak menus available (Prime, Domestic Wagyu, and Australian Wagyu), along with a multiple person chef's selection beef menu that is meant for sharing and sampling.  The sides are fantastic as well, my favorites being the asparagus and the potato puree.  But, perhaps the best part of the meal...the bread.  I have never had bread simple melt in my mouth like the soft, warm pillows of heaven that are served in cast iron pans.  If I could eat their bread for every meal for the rest of my life, I would in a heartbeat, it's just that good.\n\nThe decor is modern, and the atmosphere is excellent - quiet and subdued, but still trendy and upscale.  The waitstaff is excellent, and each table is visited at least once by a sommelier.  \n\nAll things considered, Craftsteak is one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, and one of the best high-end restaurants in Vegas, period.  You will pay handsomely for your meal, but it is well worth the quality of the entire experience.  If you want a good hunk of beef, you will not be disappointed with Craftsteak, as it is consistently one of the best (and one of my favorite) restaurants on the strip."

Beet salad was tasty - tried the braised short ribs and skirt steak both fabulous.  Mushroom medly and jerusalem artichoke sides were my faves -  Ate at Craft Dallas earlier this month and thought their sides were better - nothing with Truffles on this menu which was a mini dissapoint...

S"My compliments to the chef at this place! When looking through the hundreds of restaurant choices in Vegas, we came across this spot in the MGM and with Tom's name on it from Top Chef fame we had to try it. We are so glad we did. \n\nFrom start to finish this was one of the best meals I have ever had traveling. Even the hot lightly salted rolls were delicious. The drinks, appetizers (seafood platter/carpaccio plate) to the main course surf and turf filet and lobster were to die for. The beef was so tender it cut like butter and you could slice it with your fork. The service treated you like a king and who the heck cares about price in a place like this, it was worth every penny and let me tell you there were a lot of them in this bill so bring your wallet or maybe two wallets. For four people this was like a small downpayment on a car. \n\nI will be sure to visit the other Craft steak locations as this blew away every type of chain steak restaurant out there including Capital Grill and Ruth Chris. They arent even in the same league! Do yourself a favor and make this first choice when in Vegas!"

S'So, get this, my friend and fellow Yelper Jen F., is a vegan, but one of the only things I HAD to do while in Vegas visiting Jen F. was eat at Craftsteak.\n\nVegan = Craftsteak = FALSE.\n\nOR SO I THOUGHT!\n\nBefore making reservations we called and asked Craftsteak if they could accommodate a vegan, and with a resounding, "yes," reservations were booked.\n\nAnd then we found ourselves at Craftsteak, ordering drinks and perusing the menu...\n\nFor me: Surf and Turf with the fillet and prawns and the Yukon gold potato puree. Monkey bread for dessert.\n\nFor Mike C: The porterhouse and the Brussels sprouts sauteed with bacon. Cheesecake for dessert.\n\nFor the vegan: An absolutely gorgeous vegan platter that included Jerusalem Artichokes, asparagus, mushrooms, broccolini and so many other things that Vegas\' Yardaritas have erased from my memory.... Chocolate sorbet for dessert.\n\n\nThe steaks were expertly cooked, exactly as a steak house should cook a steak. The sides were delicious, exactly as a 5-star restaurant should cook sides. The dessert was decadent and over indulgent, exactly as a restaurant in Vegas should make dessert. \n\nCraftsteak pleased the meat lovers in our group in every possible way.\n\nHowever, the real show stopper at the table was hands down the vegan platter that this steak house put together. I mean, my god. These vegetables were cooked so well that I, a carnivore through and through, could have had myself a vegan feast and been satisfied.\n\nThe other show stopper was definitely the service; Tom Colicchio\'s people know how to treat you well, that\'s for sure.\n\nEating a Craftsteak was definitely one of the highlights of Vegas for me! However, I have to admit, had Tom come over to my table and let me sit on his face, I would have enjoyed the experience SO MUCH MORE!'

S'yes that is correct three stars ... i had high hopes for craftsteak.  as a fan of top chef i thought it would be fun to try tom collichios food.  but tom collichio isnt even exec chef here.  hes just owner and chef.  exec chef is someone else\n\nwe made a reservation for 8pm.  we got there 10 minutes early and they notified us that they were 10-15 minutes behind on reservations.  they told us we could hang out at the bar.  when we went to the bar it was crowded and not an open seat in sight.  so why would they even tell us to go to the bar if we couldnt be served there?  i was starving so i waited at the bar for a seat then sat down and ordered lobster bisque.  it had generous chunks of lobster in it.  pretty good.  very creamy.\n\n8:30 we finally sit down.  good timing since if they had walked over a second later i wouldve stomped over there and asked why we had to wait 30 minutes for a reserved table.  some people walked up and had no such delay.  i have no idea why. \n\nthe sommelier came to help us with wine selection.  but never came back to ask us what we decided on.\n\nonto our wacko waiter.  we had questions about the menu especially the set dinners and he answered them.  to make a long story short.  he answered them wrong and confused the hell out of us.  he told us that not everyone had to get the same set meals.  he told us that the domestic wagyu surf and turf meals came with two lobsters. i was thinking o wow.  thats a lot of food.  when he came back to take our order, he told us we all had to get the surf and turf.  he also told us we could get crab legs instead of lobster.  \n\nanyways.  in the end two of us got the surf and turf that came with two salads, two desserts, one kobe style wagyu new york strip and one ribeye, and two sides.  the others got prime ribe and one got scallops.\n\nwe ended up with heirloom tomatoes, beets and pickled egg, grilled shrimp for appetizers.  then corn, sauteed spinach, japanese eggplant, baby brocoli or brocolini for sides.  the corn was super buttery.  spinach was good.  eggplant was over seasoned with pesto and undercooked a bit.\n\nthe meat of course was delicious.  the lobster and scallops were good too.  the ribeye was the best texture out of all the meats.  cooked to a perfect medium rare.  very tender.  the strip had a different flavor but still good.\n\nfor desserts we had chocolate lava cake, monkey bread, and fruit and sorbet.\n\nthe decor was rustic but modern.  there was actually a lot a lighting but it was done in a way that made the room still dark.  high ceilings.\n\ni think because of the service hiccups i would actually try other restaurants before coming back here.'

S'My friend who goes to Vegas all the time recommended this restaurant to me so I made a reservation.  We were a party of 7 and we went for the domestic wagyu surf and turf chef selection for 6.  We really could have gone for 5.  Our server, Kevin (I think that was his name), was absolutely the BEST!  He made the experience absolutely memorable!  After we had picked our sides, he mentioned to us that we had missed the top 2 selections and helped us by making 2 of our sides as half sides to add in the top 2.  I love it when I get suggestions from the staff because they always know best.  He was personable, very friendly, and he was a delight to be around.  You could tell that he really enjoyed being there and was sooooo welcoming.  Possibly  one of the best servers that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  The steak was absolutely delicious and all of the sides were delicious, especially the grilled corn.  A lot of steak places have okay sides, but Craftsteak was well balanced with everything tasting fabulous.  The assorted desserts were delicious as well.

S"I've eaten here at least twice now.  Once at the bar, and once at a table.  \n\nI will say at the bar you get better service.  Better in that they are faster, and more attentive.  At the table, it takes them a while to come back for your order, to get you bread, to even come back to ask how things are going.  \n\nAs for the food quality.  The steaks are good, I've had the Hanger, the Skirt, the Rib-eye, and the waygu style ribeye.  All cooked well, not the temp, but well as in cooked decently.  But nothing memorable.  \nI can remember the first time I had a Ruth Chris steak with it's butter topping sizzling on it, it tasted great.  Or at Delmonico's where there was this superb crust on their ribeye that I can still taste and dream that all future steaks I eat will be like that.  \n\nAs it stands, at over $100 a person, both times we've been there.  I've had better experiences at other steak houses for that price.\nSide note, the Craftsteak in Los Angeles was a better experience."

S"Wow! Food + Service + Atmosphere=The perfect night out!! I went here with a group of 10, and was surprised to get a reservation within a few hours on a holiday weekend! I had never been here before, but a friend suggested it would be the perfect place to get a nice meal. Boy, was he right (don't EVER tell him I said that)! We ordered the chef's special for the 10 of us. It started with salmon, scallops, and five different salads. Next was the wagyu steak...it included perfectly cooked ribeye, filet, strip and skirt steak. Yes, I said perfectly cooked skirt steak...it's possible! We also got perfectly cooked Japanese eggplant, risotto, fries, pur\xc3\xa9ed potatoes (server even provided extra...we will get to him in a little bit). We were stuffed, and still had dessert coming! Holy monkey bread!! It was covered in caramel,and baked to perfection. Also served, was fresh fruit, chocolate mouse, blueberry creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e (more like a tart if you ask me), and multiple scoops of sorbet (pistachio was my fav)! This place was to die for and definitely a win for any foodie.\n\nNow onto atmosphere and service. One thing I liked about Craftsteak was the variety of people. There were couple enjoying a romantic dinner, but still areas for big groups! Kevin was our server and he definitely is doing the business well. He immediately convinced all of us to order the special, was knowledgable about the menu, and let's be honest anyone that can deal with my group for a few hours is ok in my book!

S'If I could give this an infinity star rating I would.  We are definitely Tom Colicchio\'s fans, and were completely and utterly satisfied and impressed with the food, the service, and the ambiance.  We never had a want or need that wasn\'t satisfied before we could have thought it up.\n\nI\'m listing what we ate in case you encounter the same menu--they do print it daily as the ingredients will change depending on the season, etc.\n\nHere is what we were served with the $140 per person "Domestic Wagyu" dinner:\nFirst Course:\nShrimp Cocktail \nPersian Cucumber Salad\nPinkerton Avacado\nProsciutto San Daniele\nLet me start by saying OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The shrimp cocktail were quite scrumptious, although didn\'t hold a candle to the rest of the plates.  The Persian Cucumber salad was delightfully perfect, the pinkerton avacado was amazing! and the Prosciutto San Daniele was an unexpected surprise on the taste buds.  We were extremely happy with this course and couldn\'t imagine what the next course would bring.\n\nSecond Course: \nWe chose the Skirt Steak and the Ribeye, with our three sides as follows: \nPotato Puree\nAsparagus\nArtichoke Hearts\nThe skirt steak and ribeye were absolutely perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The ribeye was my favorite as it was a meaty party in my mouth, while my husband preferred the skirt steak (if we ABSOLUTELY had to choose one over the other, there\'s where it lies).  \nThe potato puree is something you have to order.  If you don\'t, you will have completely missed out on the best potato you have ever eaten.  Heaven on a spoon.\nThe Asparagus was the most under seasoned, but it seemed intentional as there were so many other flavors and salts going on, it was needed to balance the plate.  \nAnd the Artichoke hearts were definitely there to balance as well.  They packed a punch and were quite delicious with the meal.\n\nThird Course: \nAnd last, but definitely not least, DESSERT!\nWe were presented with a bowl of chocolate ice cream and raspberry sorbet, a fruit plate, chocolate souffle with mint chip ice cream, and from the staff since it was our wedding night, a complimentary monkey bread with caramel/walnut sauce with vanilla bean ice cream.  \nWe were really too stuffed to eat any dessert at all, but given the price you MUST! :)  they were TO DIE for.  We finished most of it and didn\'t regret a bite.  \n\nIf you are looking to celebrate something in Vegas and want to experience the best of the best, go to Craft Steak!!'
