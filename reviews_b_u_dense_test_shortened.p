S'Funky strip mall like location but great food. Got some free drinks, I was stoked. Great tapas to share, good for light eaters or to hold over a drunken hunger with out making you sick. Just say no to a buffet it will not be pretty, stick with FireFly for great tapas!'

S"One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!\n\nif i could have my way, i would always be able to order 50 small dishes and nibble on everything while sipping yummy white wine sangria.... i nibble and mix food all the time.  When it comes to food i like options and choices, so while buffets aren't my thing... tapas is always a good idea to me!\n\nThis place is always packed and I truly believe it's worth the wait.  The food is good and the service is speedy.  The environment is dark, perfect for hanging out with friends, a date... enjoying good spirits and great food.  There are two parts of this joint.  i think there was a bar or something that went out of business and Firefly bought the place out but never knocked down the wall.  Either side is great and both offer full service bars.\n\nThere's a lot of items to choose from on the menu and everything is delicious!\nSome of my favorite  items: \nsmoked salmon toast\ntuna tartare\nstuffed dates\nahi tuna skewers\nfirefy fries\nthe mac and cheese.... etc.,\n\nthere's so much more but.... i'll list the entire menu out if i keep going.\n\nthe best thing to do would be to go and try everythng!  bring friends, family, a date... and enjoy the red and white sangia too.... expect a wait!  its a very popular and hip place."

S'This place has really good food period. It is all well priced, quickly made and extremely satisfying. The tar tar was absolutely delicious I recommend that Item first and foremost. The sangria is also super tasty. When coming with a large group just order and bunch of plates and have at it. Everything that we ordered was really good and all the plates were cleaned and glasses empty. Satisfaction at a good price and only a 10$ cab ride off the strip!!'

Mussel were small too but they were fresh and prefectly cooked.\n\nTheir "full bar" wasn\'t full at all, they didn\'t have my favorite Macallan 12; their red wine selection seemed to be a lot more nicer though - one star off. \n\nA very nice place to go if you arriving Las Vegas late, they open till 2am.'

S'awesome little tapas joint off strip. i\'ll let the food speak for itself on this one. \n\nred sangria- even the boys liked it and you know how picky they can get when it comes to "fruity" drinks.  \n\n*tuna tartare - mango, doused in sauce...the tuna itself wasn\'t that fresh....but when there\'s that much sauce all you get its the chewy texture\n*eggplant cannelloni w/ goat cheese - there\'s a lot of cheese in this one w/ the egg plant, so if you\'re not a fan of goat cheese...pass\n*stuffed peppers- eaten w/ a crisp for a bit of a crunch. wasn\'t too memorable though\n*machengo mac and cheese- favorite of the night. loved how they used shells instead of the typical noodles...and the cheese had an awesome consistency. *heart*\n*chrispy duck roll- sauce was so overpowering i wouldn\'t have known there was duck in it\n*tomato basil soup with brue grilled cheese- the soup had a strange aftertaste...i couldn\'t get past one spoon full. the brie grilled cheese was good though. \n*paella- its awesome here. try it!\n\ndessert: \n*flan- more eggy than usual, but i love egg tarts so it was fine by me\n*bread pudding- delicious esp with the melting ice cream \n*mini passion fruit cheesecakes- it was a little on the dense, but not overly sweet.'

My fav was the filet mignon sliders.... yum. They have dessert too, but nothing too memorable.   The service was ok, the place gets pretty loud and crowded, but for a big party, it wasn't so bad."

Good SIGN!\n\nTheir specialty here is tapas/small plates so we ordered a bunch of different items recommended by the waitress and just shared everything.  They have so many different items to please any palette.  They also serve nice yummy mojitos by the pitcher. Needless to say that was a hit with the entire group!  \n\nItems ordered:  Ceviche Shrimp, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Empanadas, Tuna Tartar, Mac & Cheese, Chicken & Chorizo Mushrooms and a few other items.

S"TAPAS! I used to go to Vegas every year for New Year's, and we would inevitably end up here. Why? Because it's gooooooooood!!\n\nI'll be honest, it's been a few years and my memory is hazy on all the details and what is good and not good, but I do recall with perfect clarity how much I loved the croquettes here.  Every where I eat now and see croquettes on the menu, I order them in hopes that they will match the sublime satisfaction I always encounter with Firefly's, but alas, I have yet to find ones that match.  \n\nThe staff is also always accommodating  to our ridiculous needs to have a large 20+ party (ha, I guess they know we'll spend lots of monies on the booze). Firefly's is great for food and for large groups to convene.  You can never go wrong with a group of friends and several pitchers of delicious sangria... or can you??"

S"We ate at ramseys steak the night before - here is my 2 star review of that place which i will never eat at again.  The wine list is a bit overpriced - many of our local wines were nearly double in price.  Food service was slow - quoted 45 minutes for meal to be ready (beef Wellington) took close to an hour (we had a show to see -which we informed server - that was 2.5 hours after our reservation time) - don't order Wellington if you have time constraints.  Wellington was nothing special.  Food was good but nothing spectacular.  The price points were high - we had an inexpensive bottle of red and total for 4 was over $400.  The next night we ate at firefly - for 10 people it was nearly $100 cheaper - the food was 10 times better, better service, more variety, better ambiance and overall much better dining experience.  Will never go back to Ramsey's.\n\nDid you catch the point where I compared firefly to Ramsey's?  No comparison - firefly is in our top five favorite places we have eaten.  Our entire group had a wonderful dinner - everything was great - from the rod to service.  We showed up at 630 on a Saturday and were seated right away - and everything was wonderful from there on - our favorite was the scallop escargot - but everything had wonderful flavors - will definitely be stopping here on our next trip to Vegas."

S"Visiting from Chicago, I was excited to give this tapas place a try. I came in with a party of 12 or so not too long ago and was pleasantly surprised at the array of choices of their tapas menu along with the option of choosing entrees instead if tapas is not your thing.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our large group-  points for that! \n\nFor drinks I tried a blood orange mojito- very good and strong- another plus. Tried their sangria, equally good.\n\nFor food, I opted to share the shrimp ceviche with a friend and ordered the machengo mac n' cheese and filet mignon sliders for myself. Out of the three I would have to say I enjoyed the ceviche the most. The sliders were a bit over cooked and although my friends all raved about the mac and cheese, mine failed to impress. It seemed as though the cheese in mine had coagulated while I was working on my sliders- bummer.\n\nOne thing I found funny and a bit creepy (non related to their services/food) was a customer coming out of the bathroom and then sneaking a picture of us has he walked by. Awkward!\n\nOverall I would recommend firefly as a great place for drinks after work, not sure if they offer happy hour or not but this would be a decent place to go. Given the opportunity to go again I would be okay with giving the food a second try- perhaps  trying an entree next time..."

You can't go wrong with these bad boys. \nHam & Cheese Croquetas-just your basic ham and cheese popper, right? I think not.  I loved these.\nPulpo Asado-pretty good. Not great. Perhaps a tad bit overdone, not sure.  \nRoasted eggplant cannelloni-light and fresh. \nFilet mignon sliders-tasty and substantial. \n\nService: \nGreat. No wait on a Friday night, but then again, it was around midnight.\nAttentive waiters, quick food turnaround.  \n\nPrice: \nEach dish can run anywhere from $4 to $10 for the tapas and since you'll be ordering quite a few, it can get a bit pricey.

S"I was brought here by my friends who are locals. This is hands down some of the best food I've ever had! Everyone must try this place. It's about one mile off the strip, so everyone should be able to reach it.\n\nI have traveled around Spain and also regularly eat at Spanish restaurants across Southern California, and I have to say, I expected to find the typically understated and demure, simple and clean tapas I'm used to. Not So! This is bold and flavorful. It's Innovative, it's creative, it's Spanish fusion.\n\nThe Food Style:\nThis is gourmet at at an affordable price. IMHO the chef is a genius. Each small tapas plate is unique and individual, no two dishes are the same. Again, they are flavorful and bold, never bland. They display complex and contrasting flavors that are complimentary and blend seamlessly together to form a cohesive unit. Because each tapas plate is a small bite, the three of us were able to try 9 plates + 3 free bread and olive plates (The honey-almond-butter is amazing). This meal was like an amusement park for the taste buds.\n\nI don't eat much meat, so we stuck to seafood and vegetable dishes. It's great for vegetarians.\n\nMy Favs (all 5 stars): The stuffed peppers, the roasted eggplant cannelloni, the manchego mac 'n' cheese, grilled scallops with saffron potato puree, and steamed mussels (incredible sauce). They give you as much free bread with honey-almond-butter and olives as you want. My friends raved about the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, which are arguably the most popular item on the menu (I don't eat bacon).\n\nOthers (4 stars): Tortilla espaniola, patatas bravas (great brava sauce).\n\n\nTo Drink: A pitcher of Red Sangria. This is the real deal and very very tasty. It tastes like a fruity Merlot, not like some frou-frou fake sangria cocktail you get at chain restaurant.\n\nNOTE: some tapas are better than others, but you have to be adventurous and start trying. Use the tips above. The only one I wouldn't order again was the seared ahi tuna skewers. They didn't have much flavor and the texture a little too tough to chew.\n\nAmbience: somewhat dark and intimate, warm decor, comfy booths. \n\nService: Excellent. very friendly and attentive. They easily accommodate special requests.\n\nPrices: $35 per person after tip per person for 9 plates and a big pitcher of sangria, and we were all STUFFED. \n\nPROS: The Amazing Gourmet Food; great for vegetarians; affordable prices; delicious sangria; comfy booths;  great service too; close to the Strip (about 1 mile)\n\nCONS: NONE\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Come here, or you're missing out! I would consider driving back to Vegas from LA to eat here."

S"I do love Firefly and although this past event was for a big group I was slightly disappointed thus the four star rating.  \n\nAlthough I received lots of attention and great service, it turns out the far end of my table was and felt a little neglected.  While I was getting ample bread, plenty of refills and attentive answers to my requests for more dishes the rest of the table was struggling for attention.  \n\nAs for the food I do have a favorite new dish in Pulpo Asado which was a grilled version of octopus that came with lentils and an excellent choice for my diet.  The splurge I had was the Epanadas that were slightly dry but still flavorful and well accompanied by the aioli sauce on top.  \n\nOverall my glass was full and my stomach was satisfied but for a big group things could've been managed far better.  I won't stop coming here but I certainly will limit the size of my party in the future."

S"Mmmm . . .  I gotta say, this is good tapas and the pitcher of mojitos hit the spot. In fact, it hit the spot so well, I can't remember everything I ordered. \n\nThe bacon wrapped dates are not to be missed. I also loved the mac n cheese (tasty, slightly crunchy). The pork empanadas were good too.  The duck rolls, however, were gamey (hey, it was duck), and as others noted below, the mushroom puffs were underwhelming.\n\nWe ate way too many (tapas creep up on you like that). \n\nWe got there around 4 pm on a Friday and there was still room at the bar (though we didn't sit at the bar). I would go for the patio since the restaurant itself is so unassuming. \n\nThis is no Lotus of Siam (as a Vegas culinary experience, LOS sets the standard for me), but it's great at what it does and tasty as hell. Servers and service were excellent. \n\nAnd if you want to keep the fun going, and walk off those mojitos, you can walk around the corner on Twain to the friendly gay bar, the Funhog Ranch!!! I'm just saying . .."

S"I've heard so much about Firefly from some locals, so I FINALLY had the opportunity to check this AAAMMAZZING place out. It definitely lives up to the hype and everyone's raving recommendations. I'm starting to think that I need to venture off the strip for better tasting food for cheaper prices.\n\nAmbiance:\nFirefly has an amazing vibe. It's dimly lit, quiet, and chill. I like how you can sit on couches as opposed to chairs. You can sit comfortably on the couches while you sip on some delicious sangrias.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?userid=0f_0XfO2qcgNwSJAHwfR9g\n\nFood:\n1) Filet Mignon Sliders - Sliders are always a safe bet. SOOOO GOOOOOOOODDD. The meat was tender and the caramelized onions, of course, are always welcome on a burger\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=qUWwQJqRjOxq2kpOnK43hA\n\n2) Smoked Salmon Toasts - if you like the fresh salmon taste, this is definitely a must! capers, pickled red onions and dill sour cream were great on the smoked salmon. yummmm\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=WCj5SXOvDukxgxMhv4lLVw\n\n3) Shrimp Ceviche - very fresh.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=Da3M9N2PDmtRd6QiH9azrQ\n\n4) Tuna Tartare - Didn't taste as fresh as the shrimp ceviche or the salmon, but it was still pretty dang good.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=UlE5AF8h0VoL7UxC8CO8JQ\n\n5) STUFFED DATES were PERFECT! Even after reading all the reviews, I was still skeptical since I hate dates. However, I will ALWAYS order the dates here because they were bacon-wrapped and contained smoked almond, red wine reduction and blue cheese. The bacon combined with the almond, reduction, and reduction masked the flavor of the dates. Whatever they did, it WORKS.\n\n6) Firefly Fries - can't go wrong with parmesan, herbs, and garlic aioli on fries. Not too salty, but enough flavor and perfectly fried.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=WLctqbU82YT1yw6nSKfLBQ\n\n7) Manchego Mac n' Cheese - I love mac n' cheese and it didn't disappoint here.\n\n8) Grilled octopus - FAIL. Overcooked and too chewy.\n\nParking:\nPlenty of free parking in the strip mall parking lot. Not crazy like the strip."

S'GUSH GUSH GUSH I LOVE THIS PLACE.\n\nThe atmosphere: Art Deco paintings hang in a red and black theme with a flamenco/latin flair.  Also has an outdoor patio out front.  \n\nThe people: Locals, "alternative" scene, and performers/show people late night.\n\nThe food: Tapas, obviously.  Many different things to choose from.  My last visit was with an old friend with a... limited palate, (let\'s say meat and potatoes kind of person), and it even worked with him.  Even if you\'re the type who\'s like, "Uh, sauce reductions?  Tartar?? Gimme a steak!" this place WILL work.  \n\nMy particular favorites are the tuna tartar (just ask for additional crackers as they give you too few usually), crispy duck wonton, the ceviche, and the roasted eggplant cannelloni stuffed with goat cheese.  \n\nA note about their calamari: There\'s a mountain of it, so be prepared.\n\nThe service is pretty prompt, the lighting is atmospheric, and the DRINKS:  Heck yeah.  Best Sangria in Vegas.  The Sangria served there is prepared a day or two in advance and the taste is fruity and well-rounded without tasting overly sweetened or artificial.   They come in red, white, and sparkling.  A pitcher is more than two drinks for two people, btw, so be prepared.  \n\nAlso spazz-worthy are the infused mojitos, which includes my favorite, dragonfruit.  \n\nOpen late and has something for everyone.  For a snack or for a fun, romantic evening, it\'s an excellent choice.'

We come to Firefly at least once a month for tapas and drinks. \n\nFirefly is a great spot for HH or a quick glass of sangria as a pre-game before heading out for the night. The food is consistently delicious and the white sangria is my favorite. And if you're craving something sweet the banana and nutella sandwiches hit the spot. Some of my favorite tapas are:\n\n-thai beef salad\n-shrimp diablo\n-stuffed dates with bacon\n-lamb skewers\n-mussels\n\nThe paradise location can get super packed and I think I actually prefer the lay out of the bar area of the Sahara location.

Among the things I've tried are: the baked brie, duck spring rolls, veggie empanadas, french fries (with a delicious dipping sauce), chicken skewers, and many others I can't remember! The prices are pretty affordable too...the only thing that is semi-pricey is the sangria, but that's a small price to pay for your meal. The desserts are also really good. I've had their banana nutella sandwiches and the chocolate cake thingie...both delicious. The only downside to this place is the CRAMPED parking area...most times if you're going at a peak hour (Fri or Sat nights), you'll have to park in the back...but it's not that big of a deal. Try to sit outside if you can during the spring/summer weather, it makes the meal even better. I've had a party of 10 inside for my bday, and that worked out well, too."

S"My overall experience here was a pleasant one! Service was exceptional (THANKS JESUS!), food was excellent & the atmosphere was far from the norm. Upon arrival, they start you off with a mini loaf of toasted sliced bread, a little bit of almond butter, & green olives. DELICIOUS! I didn't want to completely fill up on bread, but I was easily tempted. My favorite dish was the Veggie Empanadas! Absolutely the most hearty & savory out of all the plates we tried. Each bite was flaky, creamy & warm. In nature, I barely like any of the veggies that are apart of the stuffing. Thanks to these empanadas, I'll be giving mushrooms another chance! The Passion Fruit Mini Cheesecakes came in at a very close second place. The thickness of each little bite threw my taste buds for a loop- the exciting kind, like on rollercoasters! My only complaint is that some the portions could have been a little more robust. I'm well versed on the whole concept of tapas being small plates, but I feel like the big & thick flavors of a dish should make up for that. With only 1 drawback, I think my lunch at FIREFLY* was a success! I can't wait to go back & try more things!!!"

S"Whenever I come to Vegas, I always look for good food. Unfortunately, a lot of the food in Vegas are over priced and honestly not worth it at the inflated prices. Fortunately, the food off strip are super affordable and really good. And more and more, I find myself going off the strip for good food. \n\nOur weekend Vegas trip was coming to an end and our group wanted some good food but not too much since some of us were still hungover from the night before. We concluded that tapas was a great choice since we can order a lot of them and it came in small portions. \n\nAnother good thing about eating at these places off the strip is that they aren't full of tourists so there's no hour waits. When we got here during lunch time, we had no line, no nothing. We were immediately seated and started ordering. My friends ordered a pitcher of red sangria which was a cure all for those with a hangover. Overly ambitious, we started ordering the tapas. The price ranged from 6-10$ and the servings for each dish served for 2-3 people. We ordered everything from the shrimp ceviche, firefly fries, filet sliders, grilled octopus, steamed mussels, steak & mushroom skewers and the bacon wrapped dates. Everything was delicious! The shrimp ceviche had the right amount of acid and freshness and the shrimps weren't over cooked. The fries were great and the garlic aioli was PERFECT. And thanks to the other yelper's recommendation of the bacon wrapped dates, those were to die for. The only complaint that I actually had were the grilled octopus. They were kind of overcooked so they were a lot chewier than I would prefer them to be. \n\nOverall, the service of this place is great and the setting is perfect for a tapas bar. If you want good, affordable food (especially after a weekend of gambling), you should really check out this local's joint for some GOOD with no wait."

S'Overall the tapas plates we tried were okay.  We got a table in less than 15 min on a Friday which was nice, but that was because we were there around 5:30pm.  \n\nWe ordered the curry mussels because this was my favorite thing I tried on the east coast and I have been determined to find a suitable replacement on the west coast.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the sauce was a little more coconut, and a lot less curry than what I have been craving.  \n\nThe patatas bravas were good, I loved the spicy aioli, but I would have preferred a crispier outer layer on the potatoes.  Some of them had it, but most did not.\n\nMy favorite tapas was the tuna peppers, which was surprising because this was not my pick but I am so happy that we ordered it because the dish is delicious, and they have a perfect little kick to them.\n\nAnd finally, I ordered the tortilla de espanola.  I could eat this all day.  While my husband loved the bell pepper vinaigrette, I was not a fan.'

I can't wait to go back and try some more tapas.  This would be the perfect place to impress a date and set the right mood, without going broke!  The tapas range in price between $3-$8, so you can afford to experiment...have fun!!!"

S"Great experience.  I recommend anyone in Vegas make this one of the places you stop to eat.  It is great food, great service and great atmosphere.  I would consider this one of the places locals would go to eat.  There isn't any inflated prices you see on the strip so if you want a great time without the typical inflated costs so many good restaurants in Las Vegas have, this will be a nice surprise for you too."

S'First coming here was such an amazing experience.  \nFrom the stuffed dates, mango spare ribs, thai beef salad, and the mussels, man! what amazing food.  \nThe service is always on the top of their toes, i hardly ever have to ask them to refill my drink or have to call them to come to the table.  They always check up on you whether if it is busy or not.  \n\nMy personal favorites are:\nstuffed dates (i always order at least 2)\ntres leches (dessert)\nthai beef salad\nmac & cheese\nmango spare ribs\njust recently lobster escargot\n\nI love this spot and my favorite firefly location :) cant go wrong with this place.'

S'One of those spots that have been there forever and you still don\'t get tired of it. Pretty much having the same same menu for years but that\'s what makes it awesome. Why fix what is not broken right? that principle works like a charm with this fellas\n\nMost plates are tapas style which means they are small, however its a good thing that they are because you can start exploring the menu. The paella however, is big enough to share.\n\nTry the pulpo asado if you feel a little risky and willing to experience its amazing flavor. Tetilla cheese for the cheese lovers or camaron a la diabla for those who like  it hot.A must try is their filet Mignon sliders with cheese and the garlic fries Don\'t kiss a vampire after them fries though. Actually don\'t kiss anything .and not because your newly uber stinky breath ..but because you don\'t want to share all that awesome garlic flavor left inside your mouth\n\nWaiting time can get crazy. specially on the weekends this place tends to get packed and loud..not because of the music but the people around you. The decor is great and the music is very good and goes perfect with the ambiance. Red is a predominant color so if you are a bull please dont be hitting the walls.\n\nBefore leaving try their well known signature drinks. Their mojitos are delicious!! And the sangria is refreshing and super tasty. A whole pitcher of the sangria and 3 mojitos might make you stand up on a table..get a red napkin and cry to the Madrid and Barcelona gods as loud as you can : "OLE OLE!!!..Yes it was fun..dont judge me..well at least until security came in...Viva espana y hasta manana!!'

S"This was probably the best food I had over my 4 day stay in Vegas. We eat on the strip and off. \n\nWe ordered 6 different dishes and only one did not impress us. That was the Papatas Bravas (roasted potatoes). They were bland and needed some kind of sauce. \n\nAs a vegetarian my favorite dish was the Veggies and Lentils while my boy's favorite dish was a tie between the ribs and the bacon wrapped dates. We will definitely be back to explore more of the menu! \n\nPs... sit on the patio!"

S"I think I've eaten at Firefly one too many times to give it an objective review, but here goes.\n\nAs far as solid tapas and group dining goes, you'll have a pretty good experience at Firefly. Some of my favorites are the perennial staple: the bacon wrapped dates, boquerones, artichoke toasts and tomato soup (w/brie grilled cheese). The menu has changed minimally since I first visited about 6 years ago and I wish they'd give some thought to additions. Yes, they have a lot on the menu, but like I said I've eaten there so much that it's a little difficult to give an objective review.\n\nI haven't been able to find sangria as good as Firefly's anywhere. I don't know what their secret is, but they better not let it out. You can get it by the glass or by the pitcher and if you drink like me, the pitcher isn't a bad deal.\n\nThe service can be apathetic and awkward at best and negligent at worst. Several times I've dined there and have been tempted to not leave a tip because service is SO bad. I get that they are busy, but it's time to figure out a new strategy, hire people who care and give that service experience the attention it needs.\n\nThis is a good place for a date (not a first date because it's so damn loud in there), a group dinner (although they hate those and it's so obvious) or to take someone who's never had tapas before. I know I'll be back and my expectations will be managed."

S'This place is pretty cool for tapas. They have A LOT of small dishes and I liked how they make their own sangria, and on the menu it says they marinate it for 3 days. it was pretty refreshing and delicious. I came with a large party so it was a little difficult to get full since everything is small plates. Some of my favorites were the tuna tartare, thai beef salad, skewers, and the big bowl of chicken salad. Also since we were still hungry we ordered the herb roasted chicken which came with fries and devoured it.'

I've been here for business meetings, been here dressed up for pre and post nite-out bites, and been here in sweatpants. Never any judgement.\nFull bar, and prices are reasonable too. I've been to 3 of their locations, but the one on Paradise is my favorite. \nJust a comfortable spot to enjoy good food."

S'Food - 4 stars\nAmbiance - 4 stars\nService - 2 stars\n\nThe good news - Firefly offers very tasty food at extremely reasonable prices and pretty big portions (way too big to be classified as actual tapas, but this is a good thing if you feel like tapas are too small, or if you have more than 2-3 people, which we did).  They have an excellent sparkling sangria (they have red & white too) which is also reasonably priced. The patio has a nice, relaxing vibe and the inside looked pretty cute too. \n\nStandouts:\nBacon wrapped stuffed dates- \nMachengo mac & cheese\nFirefly fries\nThat almond butter that comes with the bread \n\nGood:\nPaella\nTuna Tartare (I like that they use taro chips)\nMeatballs\nSausage plate\n\nOK:\nSardine toasts\nBread with tomatoes\nClams and chorizo\noctopus salad\n\n\nIf the service wasn\'t so lackluster I would have given them 4 stars. Our waiter must have taken too many bong hits before his shift, because he was spacey as hell. He wasn\'t forthcoming with suggestions even though I asked him for some. And he must have been too high to realize, when we ordered all of our food, and I mean all of it, (do you see the list above?!) , that we didn\'t want all of it at one time.  He went away, I lit a cigarette, and one puff later, all of the dishes came out. My eyes made my stomach full pretty much instantly. The table groaned under the weight of our food. It didn\'t help when the rest of our party showed up and they had no room for plates- and then they told us that waiters ALWAYS tell them in the beginning to order a little at a time because it comes out very, very fast.\n\nThen, as we worked furiously to eat so we could clear  some plates away....he never came to check on us and clear our plates. We had to flag the busboys down to make room, which I hate doing. He never brought out our stuffed mushrooms, but after trying to eat all of the food up above, I could care less. He came to check on us once, asked if we wanted a sangria pitcher, and then when we said we would wait until he had more room, he finally looked at the table and realized we had been there for 15 minutes and had dishes almost hanging off. "Oh...I\'ll see if anything is left and if it is I\'ll tell them to wait a bit". Um, thanks asshole. A little too late.\n\nThe chocolate tres leches cake was ok, but it was more like chocolate cake with some condensed milk thrown on top. There was no distinct layers of milk. My friend asked for cream for her coffee and he thought she wanted another cup and it took her 4 tries of saying cream before he got it. \n\nSeriously Firefly - you can feed me anyday. But start making sure your servers aren\'t stoned first.'

S"This place is pretty awesome!  It was my first Tapas experience as well as having Sangria throughout my dinner.  We stayed there for a good 2.5 hours!\n\nWhat we ordered:\n-Pomegranate Mojito: strong....but good!\n-PitcherSangria ;) - super yummy and good buzz!\n-Firefly flies - yummers..keeps the buzz at bay. haha\n-Steak and mushroom skewers - delish! not too well done..just right!\n-Stuffed Dates - kind of different...sweet and salty!\n-Banana Nutella sandwiches - YUMMY!  I love nutella and I love bananas...great combination!\n-Tuna tartare...I've had way better.  Good, but could taste more fresh\n\nI think this is a great interactive restaurant where you can share tapas with everyone at your table.  Kind of like Chinese dim sum, but the plates are much larger with a much bigger serving.  And Tapas is spanish. LOL\n\nI thought it would be quite expensive, but the price was just right and well worth it.  Great atmosphere, great strong drinks, and fantastic food to tantalize your palate!\n\nGo now, with great people, and have a great time!"

S"Ay Caramba!!!!\n\nI Love This Place!!!!\n\nOn our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!\n\nWell, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!\n\nUpon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!\n\nWe were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! \n\nThen came our drinks and tapas!\n\nI must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.\n\nNow onto the tapas...\n\nBacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!\n\nTuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!\n\nTierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! \n\nDuck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.\n\nFilet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful \n\nCamarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!\n\nCeviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.\n\nFor dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!\n\nOur server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!\n\nI highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!\n\nHappy Eats!"

S'Had a lot of delicious food here.  We had the sliders (the petite filet, I think), tuna tartare, ceviche,  albondigas, lamb chops, stuffed peppers, and some other stuff.\n\nI really enjoyed the ceviche.  The lambchops were tender and flavorful.  I also liked the texture and flavor of the tuna tartare, although my boyfriend thought it reminded him a little of cat food.  My boyfriend said the petite filet sliders were the best burgers he had ever had.\n\nWe also ordered a pitcher of red wine sangria.  We were starting to get drunk by this time, so maybe that has affected my review, but I thought everything was delicious, including the sangria.  I particularly liked the lambchops and ceviche.'

S'Firefly is the kind of place we usually like to take visitors from out of town when they want something cool and hip, but without the chaos of the strip (nor the exuberant prices).\n\nThey started us off with a plate of bread, buttery good stuff, and green olives as we checked out the menu.  To get things started for our party of five, we ordered a pitcher of sparkling sangria ($24).  \n\nTo grub on...\n* Stuffed dates "bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese" ($4) - Everyone always loves these.  It\'s just a bite of intense flavor and goodness, and there\'s bacon!  About four to an order. \n\n* Terra y Mare skewers "grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde" ($10) - Came with three skewers, it was good, not great, but okay.\n\n* Firefly" fish sticks "fillets of grouper, Japanese breadcrumbs, spicy tartar sauce" ($6) - Arrived with two sticks per order.\n\n* Merguez "spicy lamb sausage, tomato-pepper confit, grilled bread" ($8) - A strong taste that gets some getting used to. The Husband was loving this stuff.\n\n* Pulpo asado "marinated and grilled octopus, potato, tomato" ($7.50) - The octopus was bit overcooked, not quite what I expected.  But then again, it probably was frozen and that altered the texture a bit.\n\n* Steamed mussels "red curry, white wine and coconut cream" ($8) - My favorite of the bunch, full of flavor in this red curry with two slices of toasted cheese bread for dipping.  I saved the sauce for my paella and bread.\n\n* Ahi tuna skewer "mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze" ($10) - Cooked tuna, which I don\'t care for too much.  Our friend got lured into ordering this by the waitress he thought was cute.\n\n* Paella "saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage" ($15) - Good stuff with lots of good stuff in it.  Tasty, and of course, even better with the red curry sauce from the Steamed Mussels dish.\n\n* Sparkling Sangria ($24 pitcher) - Enough to fill at least five glasses and really tasty too.  It\'s a light drink, with only a bit of fruit bits in it.  But definitely enjoyable by guys and girls.  We ordered another pitcher during our visit.\n\nOverall, some food times are good and standout-worthy while others can remain unseen.  The sangria is perfect for sharing and has enough alcohol in it for you to be feeling pretty good.  Service was better in the beginning with our waitress checking up on us and our dirty plates disappearing in a timely manner.  It slacked off a bit when our waitress didn\'t come around anymore and when the busboys were a bit overanxious in trying to clear plates that weren\'t empty yet.\n\n3.5 stars\n\nHappy Hour: Mondays through Thursdays: 3 pm to 6 pm\nFridays: 3 pm to 5 pm (1/2 off all drinks)\n\nTuesdays: Latin Night, from 10 pm to 2 am (salsa, meringue, cumbia, rock, no cover)'

You make yourself a total mess, but it's totally worth it.\n\nPulpo Asado: the octopus was cooked VERY nicely.  Not rubbery at all and the seasoning on the dish was beautiful.\n\nAhi Tuna Skewer: just as great as the rest of them.  Tuna was cooked well done, and the mango next to them definitely added a tart.\n\nTips:\n\nIt is super duper busy... even on a Sunday night at 10pm.

Despite the same ambiance, interior decoration, to-go bag color schemes, and menus, the food was a bit more tasteful than cheesecake factory.  \n \nI ordered the pork chops and I was very satisfied with my choice. When there is a mixture of apples with pork chops and mash potatoes and brussel sprouts- I'm in! The pork chops was perfect- not over cooked, not under cooked near the bone. I enjoyed every morsel that was left to the bone. My friends had a bite of my dish and agreed that they liked my dish.   \n\nThe service was tentative. They were concerned with our experience which is surprising for our group of 13. Other places tend to neglect you knowing that they have a guaranteed 18-20% tip.

We ate there for lunch one day and as an early dinner before our flight back to NY. \n\nI ordered the regular portion Cobb salad for lunch. It was HUGE!!! One word of advice, they salt and pepper their salads in addition to pre-tossing your salad with dressing before severing it. Therefore, it was very salty. I would advise you to ask that they not top off the salad with salt and if you also prefer, dressing on the side. I found this out wehn the manager came by to apologize after I asked if they could make me another salad with less dressing. The dressing was fine it was the extra salt. I wouldn't image why they would do that. Isn't that was the salt dispenser on your table is for? \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Chicken pot pie and beware..that thing can serve (2) people so don't order it if you don't have someone to share with.

When we finally sat, I was already regretting picking food over sleep. When in doubt pick sleep always - just a tip. Haha. Anyways I wanted something light to settle my alcohol ridden stomach so I ended up getting the Zen noodles. Worse thing to get. Wow, I was hoping for halfway decent noodles but these were dreadful. The broth was thin and too lemongrass-y. The noodles were short and rough and the texture was almost too al dente. They put chicken in there and it's a bit rough and overcooked. At least they had the soy bean sprouts and lime and cilantro and all the other herbs on the side for me to add. I would day that was the most authentic part of my dish. And so overpriced at like $13. Crazy. I left unsatisfied and looking forward to just crashing. Other dishes looked ok like the flatbread pizza, sandwiches and breakfast.

On our way to the table he found out we were from the Bay Area and actually from the same home town - small world! I mentioned to a friend how bad my heartburn was and how I was dying for a glass of milk. Literally, within a mintue of being seated, Matt was back with a tall glass of milk for me, and I hadn't even asked for it! Awesome service! I let him know I actually prefer Non-Fat but I was so thankful I would drink whatever, he insisted on bringing me the non-fat. That pretty much set the pace for the rest of the visit.\n\nWe had the warm bread - Nom. The menu selection is so vast we each had something totally diff. I went for the Pasta Telephono = GREAT success. I was glad my friends weren't flying home so that they could bring my leftovers back, way too good to let go to waste.

I love the food here and I love that it\'s open 24 hours!\n\nThis restaurant is located on the bottom level of The Venetian.  My friends and I were starving and got here around 1am to a short line.  Their menu consists of a section for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night.  Dinner lasts until midnight and late night is from midnight to 6am.  Lucky for us, they said they were still serving up dishes from the dinner menu when we got there so we had a wide array of options to choose from.\n\nMy friend and I both ordered an "appetizer salad".  I got the Greek Salad and added chicken.  My friend got their spicy calamari salad.  When we got our plates we were shocked because it was still a huge portion!  I added chicken to my salad because I didn\'t think I\'d be full off just greens, oh how wrong I was!  Neither of us were able to finish it.  \n\nMy two other friends split an entree salad called the "Sheila\'s Dream" and it was sooo good!  Seriously, a party in your mouth.  It had an eclectic blend of ingredients and the dressing was top notch, I\'m gonna get that the next time I come.  So worth the $12!\n\nEven though everything on the menu here is delish, I\'d strongly recommend the Miso Glazed Salmon - best dish on the menu!!\n\nAs far as desserts go, their strawberry shortcake dessert here is excellent!  I\'m inclined to say it is the best ever - it\'s fresh strawberries, shortbread, and cream all thrown onto a plate together so it isn\'t a sliced piece of cake like you\'d find at other restaurants.  You just have to try it for yourself.  Drooool...'

S"Owned by Cheesecake Factory, we figured it was sketchy at best. \n\nBut decent for a quick lunch before an afternoon of shopping. Surprise! It was actually quite good. Ahi tuna burger, rare the way I asked, and quality tuna. Wasabi cream on the side. Side salad sub'd instead of fries, and it had amazing yummy bleu cheese on it...and a light dressing.\n\nBread...ooohhh try the wheat, delivered warm to your table, you slather on the butter and think you're in heaven. Okay service. Lots of iced tea refills and fab girlie convo...welcome to Vegas."

S"since everyone else mentioned it, i guess i will too......\n\ni went to the one at Venetian....\n\nafter a night of drinking and partying up at Tryst, we were all craving for some Pho....yes....PHO! and knowing there probably isnt a vietnamese restaurant open at 4am, we decided to come here becuz we knew they had a dish that was similar to pho. its called Zen Noodles. it was actually pretty good. although they didnt give us enough broth, more noodles and chicken which i thought was quite strange. and when we asked our server to give us more broth, she said she will see if anyone else ordered the same dish and if the chef has extras. i guess they dont just have a big pot of broth in the back ready for the next order. but luckily they did have more for us.\n\nwe also had the vietnamese spring rolls which were absolutely delish!!! and we totally killed the basket of warm sourdough bread they gave us too! the only gripe i have is that the bowl of noodle soup cost $13! oh well! i guess when youre drunk and hungry, you'll pay just about any amount to satisfy your cravings!"

S"When I lived in Vegas, I heard a story about the owner of the Venetian wanting a Cheesecake Factory in his hotel, but because there was already a Cheesecake Factory located across the street at Caesars Palace, it was a no-go. Instead, they came up with a concept for a new restaurant, and bam, you've got Grand Lux Cafe.\n\nThe menu is similar to Cheesecake Factory's, better actually, so if you like CF, you'll love Grand Lux Cafe. I've never ordered anything here that I've disliked. It's definitely the best 24 hour restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nThe food is delicious, the prices are right, the service is always great, and I love the ambiance. Take my advice, if you're going to eat at a hotel and you're on a budget, eat here! Our group ate at the Caesars Palace food court (Cypress Street, check out my review), and we ended up paying the same, if not more than Grand Lux Cafe, and the food at GLC, is 10 times better!"

S'Did I miss something here?  I\'ve been to the Grand Lux Cafe in Chicago along time ago, but I remembered that I absolutely loved it.  I have also never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  I went to the Grand Lux twice during my stay at the Venetian.  The first time was for the breakfast where I got the breakfast buffet option.  The orange juice was really good and it tasted like it was freshly squeezed.  The fruit offered at the buffet line also tasted fresh and there were a decent selection.  The other buffet offering were pretty standard.  They offered hash browns, scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon that was way too oily.  There was also an omelet station, but I did not get to have one made because the line was too long and I was hungry!  They also had an assortment of pastries, but I would have rather seen pancakes and waffles instead.  I was also disappointed to see that they did not have cottage cheese, which I thought was a breakfast buffet staple.  Everything cost $20 including tax and tip, but for that amount of money I would like to see more buffet options.\n\nThe second time I went was for late night dining.  I started with the broccoli cheddar soup which was RUNNY and BLAND and did not come with crackers or bread until I requested it.  I got the chicken and waffles as my main dish.  The waffle itself was pretty good.  It had good crunchy texture and buttery taste.  The chicken was also decent, but I should point out that these were chicken tenders and not fried chicken with the bone.  It was served with a pecan maple syrup.  I\'ve never had authentic chicken and waffles, but I have a feeling that the original would have been a lot better than GLC"s upscale version.'

S"As a sister restaurant to Cheesecake, it has a very similar (giant) menu and ambiance.  The portions are similarly big.  The place is huge so can accommodate many people, especially large parties.  The menu has a large variety- burgers, salads, pasta, steak, Chinese, Mexican etc.- it would be a safe bet for diverse palates. The prices are medium, what you would expect at a diner-ish restaurant at Vegas.  The service is pretty decent too, but it's definitely a hit or miss.  I've came here at 3am before and my server took FOREVER doing everything or is no where to be found.  I've also came here at 8pm and they were fully staffed with multiple people attending to us and filling out water.\n\nPro:\nOpened 24 hours! \n\nCon:\nAlways have at least 15 min wait to be seated"

This is a sister restaurant to the cheesecake factory, so some of the menu items are the same. The decor looks almost exactly the same as the cheesecake restaurant as well. Very clean and quick service too. \n\nI always order the chicken pot pie. I always have to get this because it's really good! Lots of big chunks of chicken breast and veggies with a flaky pastry crust. There are also a variety of other things like pasta, burgers, salads, soups, sandwiches, etc. There's basically something for everyone. Portions here are huge, def. enough to share with someone. \n\nService here is great...esp the waiters at night. We had came back here after a night of drinking and the waiter was very patient with us and we were able to get some food in our tummys! Just a warning though, the late night menu is not the same full menu that they serve during the day time. Still plenty of delicious choices!"

I actually picked up a brownie too, but after attempting to finish my creme brulee, I wound up only eating half of that (i felt guilty because i made a point of eating healthy during my whole trip....damnit), and saved my brownie (it was nicely wrapped with a ribbon and everything) for my boyfriend when he picked me up at the airport the next morning. he loved it, btw. \n\ni'll have to eat there next time, but probably late at night, since the menu looks so much more appealing after drinking."

S'Never have I eaten at Grand Lux Cafe so many times in one weekend, but there\'s a reason why and it\'s because it\'s so good and convenient. We stayed at the Venetian hotel and this was the only place that was open 24/7 with great late night eats. The food court got tiring after so many visits. The menu is here is so extensive that you can try something new every time. We came in for lunch one day and many of us ordered their lunch special, such a great deal. For $10 bucks you can get a cup of soup, side salad, and half a sandwich. All my friends said they enjoyed what they ordered. I opted to pay $2 more for the side salad and half pasta combo. Even half of a regular pasta entr\xc3\xa9e was a lot for me to eat for lunch and I even had to take it to go. The Cabonara pasta is so tasty! Loaded with cream sauce, which I love, I hate dry pastas, it got a boost of flavor from the bits of bacon and green peas. Because it is Vegas, top off your meal with a cocktail! The Blood Orange Mojito is an excellent choice! The fries there are to die for. It seems so simple and so common a thing, but the fires there keep me coming back. Maybe there\'s a special oil that they cook them in because they have a richer and sweeter after taste. They\'re just ordinary fries, but dip it in a bit of ranch or ketchup and you\'ll be chomping away the whole plate of fries before you know it! Service here also never fails, always friendly and quick, despite it being super crowded all the time. I came back so many times the manager even remembered me. He called me "Sloppy Joe Girl" because one night I ordered it and he was happy I came back for more food. He even kept going back to the kitchen to check up on our take out order so we wouldn\'t be waiting so long. This makes up for the crappy cashier. He did however apologize to us and said that he was just having a bad day, but still, don\'t take it out on your customers, that\'s very unprofessional. One night we ordered a sloppy joe and the other night we ordered the chicken cream pasta with sun dried tomatoes for take out. The sloppy joe was nice and tangy with a sprinkle of chopped onions, so good! The meat was loaded with flavor, probably too salty alone, but when paired up with the long sandwich buns, it was a perfect balance. It also came with a side sauce of some orange tangy nature which I didn\'t care too much for. The chicken pasta was good, but probably not my favorite dish there so far. It didn\'t have as much cream sauce compared to the Cabonara that I liked and the grilled chicken was dry. It was a little hard to eat. It was a huge portion though, it fed like three of us girls! Till next time Grand Lux, I will be back for you!'

S"My parents have been talking about the ribs and ahi salad they got at the Venetian the last time they were there.  So last weekend, we do the walk from the Aria to the Venetian (really long walk) in search of this restaurant. It seems counterintuitive that this great food comes out of this normal looking casino restaurant, but it really was good. \n\nI've been on a pasta carbonara fix (trying to relive my amazing Rome dining experience), so I ordered it with low expectations since every other place has been terrible. I have to say that this was the best pasta carbonara that I've had outside of Rome. It was a very cheesy cream sauce and with actual thick cut bacon. The whole meal tasted like smoked bacon. The lunch portion was huge and since it was very rich, I couldn't finish it. My husband ordered the short rib burger (short ribs are a topping on the burger) and he liked it a lot. Dad ordered the ribs and mom the ahi salad, which they both loved just as much the first time. \n\nUnfortunately, there were some cons. My husband's burger came without any dressings/sauces, which is a little strange. He had to ask for mayo and our server said he'd have to go to the kitchen to get it. My mom asked for soy sauce and wasabi. Our server told us they only had soy sauce, which was a lie because they had a wasabi dressing for the ahi appetizer. I suspect the wasabi dressing was in the kitchen and our server didn't want to go back after retrieving the mayo.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely go back and I'd order the pasta carbonara (maybe to share next time) in a heart beat."

Fortunately, I was. It was delicious. The waitress said that fans of spicy dishes loved this; therefore, I was reluctant to order it but I'm glad I did. However, there was waaay to much rice. \n\nMy brother ordered the Margherita Pizza. I tried a small slice and it was very good. \n\nDad had one of their burgers, I forgot which one. It was HUGE.

We saw the good reviews and though we'd give it a try. We ordered the jambalaya and ahi tuna tartare. The food fell below my expectations. I thought it would be similar to cheesecake factory, but the food was worse than than cheesecake factory for sure. \n\nFood: \nChicken jambalaya: pretty weird, but okay in taste. The chicken was separated from the rice, which isn't traditional of jambalaya. it was more of a stir fry spicy chicken with the rice on the side. \nAhi tuna tartare- Not the best. Didn't stand out and not particularly appetizing for me, but I'm a raw fish/sushi snob. \n\nPrice: pretty expensive for the quality. Similar to the cheesecake factory price wise.\n\nOverall, if your desperate and hungry and don't want to go off the strip maybe consider eating here, otherwise take your money and appetite off the strip. Some of the restaurants in the asian town are open pretty late."

My pizza was perfect!\n\nWe were definitely well taken care of here and we both enjoyed ourselves.\n\nI paid about $15 for my lunch, this is definitely not bad considering it's Vegas and everything is usually expensive.

Frozen cream cheese next to the strawberries (thinking it's whipped cream).....was so stuck to the serving spoon, that people were using their fingers to get it off on to their plates.  Bacon did not have tongs, and people were using their fingers instead. Tasteless food and chef burning cooked to order eggs was a turn off.\n\nMy husband was so dissatisfied with the buffet, that he ordered eggs Benedict off the menu. That was actually better. Hash browns tasted like they came out of a box, but the eggs were fresh and hot and the hollandaise sauce was very good.\n\nWhen we spoke to the manager, he was hearing me, but not really listening.

The braised beef chunks are tender and tasty, the meat sauce is perfect (not too overwhelming), and the spaghetti noodles are nice and buttery. This dish is neither too heavy nor too light, and the portions are generous, enough for two people. I highly recommend this dish, and I would be willing to go back and try other things.

It's a branch of Cheesecake Factory, and I really enjoy Cheesecake Factory because of it's wide selection of difference foods on the menu. Grand Lux Caf\xc3\xa9 is about the same. It has a similar menu and prices.  At the Venetian, I believe it's opened 24-hours as well, and the wait was pretty short both times. Service is decent. The first time I had The Max Burger (Our Greatest Hamburger Creation! Certified Angus Beef Topped with Cheddar Cheese, Crisp Applewood Smoked Bacon, Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Roasted Short Ribs. Served with Fries), which had angus beef and short rib with cheese. You can't really taste the short rib, so it doesn't add much to the dish, but the overall the burger was satisfying and hit the spot! The fries were however a totally different story. It wasn't good at all, it didn't feel fresh, the tasted as though they didn't use fresh oil, and the frying was off. The second day I had the lunch plate jambalaya. I was kind of craving it. Not a good idea when you're eating at 3 and going to eat at a buffet at 7. Well the lunch is a decent size. The chicken isn't so good for jambalaya, but that's a given, it doesn't give meaty flavors to the dish. It also lacked sausages! Anyways, the dish was okay, not great, the burger was still fresh in my mind. Actually come to think of it, I'd more so give this place a 3.6, maybe given I was in Vegas made the food taste better and overlook the blunders of the food."

I don\'t know...but I would stick with the burgers at those times.\n\nI even had breakfast and was happy to see that their food was consistently good overall and went back to have another burger the next day.\n\nAt a casino cafe, don\'t expect great service nor fast.  However, the staff at this location was efficient, quick, and tried to get to all customers as quick as possible.\n\nThis location has a better setup than the Palazzo so if you were like me and stayed at the Palazzo, perhaps stay at the Venetian (shorter walk) and open 24/7.  \n\nI ate at the Palazzo location and the mushroom burger is the same at both but as for the rest of the food, you\'ll have to be the judge.\n\nI plan to try the LA location of this establishment.

S'Grand Lux is located at The Venetian hotel and is open 24 hours!  it\'s obviously very convenient if you stay at the Venetian and also after a club, this is a great place to go.  Ok, I pretty much get the same thing when I come here - the Zen Noodles.  It\'s sort of like Pho, it\'s what I call "American Pho."  lol.  I also got the Duck Potstickers, which is really good!  Although, for the price of that appetizer, I wish we would\'ve gotten more than 5 pieces.  Another good thing is that this place has a wide selection on their menu.  Maybe one day I\'ll think of getting something else rather than my noodles! ;)'

S'Ahhhh, the last morning in Vegas. Why not a nice breakfast, eh? \n\nThe fantastic coffee is served with fresh cream. The benedict was the best I had ever had. The fruit is fresh and the pancakes fluffy. Modestly priced from items off the menu, and the buffet they offer for those on the run was about 15 dollars. It included breakfast meats, fruit, hash, even an omelette station.\n\nWe sat out on the terrace....Well, inside the casino, but outside the restaurant, It was nice, romantic.'

S"One of my favorite late night food place.  At the north end of the strip so its perfect after going out to a club as its open 24 hours a day!  The double stuffed mashed potato spring rolls are my go to dish and I don't think I could ever get enough!  It also soaks up the alcohol so less of a hangover the next day, and lets face it in vegas the sooner the hangover is relieved the sooner the next party begins!  (or you could just drink through the hangover...but that's usually for vacation, and its tough being a local!)\n\nOne star deducted cause the wait staff isn't quite the friendliest, but then again i guess i probably wouldn't be all smiles if i was dealing with drunken vacationers all night long.  Despite that it is still always worth a trip after a night at TAO nightclub!"

S"I have to admit, I am impressed with the Grand Lux Cafe.  When you're in the Venetian and looking for a place to eat, you got high-end, food court, and their Grand Lux Cafe.  Just from the gold decor, attentive well-dressed attentive servers, and the ambiance, you'll start thinking this is a pricey restaurant to eat at.  Nope...the Grand Lux Cafe is very affordable and the prices for their cafe/grill food mimics a local Denny's or IHOP.  But that's the just the prices that mimics these chain branded restaurants.  Food quality, presentation, service, and selection is all top notch here at the Grand Lux Cafe.  In other words, you cannot go wrong here.\n\nGrand Lux Cafe serves everything from breakfast to high quality meals like Filet Mignon.  Such a huge selection, I had to ask the waiter to give us extra time to decide.  In the meantime, we got our bread served and it was killed in minutes. For dinner, we shared the calamari which is also served with fried vegetables and fried shrimp.  I don't eat vegetables, but there's something about fried vegetables that makes it go down better.  The calamari was delicious, lightly breaded, and wasn't rubbery.  Yes..I've had overly chewy and rubbery calamari, but not here.  Cristina P. had a salad and I got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with a bowl of soup.  Let me add that there isn't a Crispy Chicken Sandwich on the menu, but all you have to do is ask and sometimes you shall receive.  My chicken sandwich was exactly how I expected it to taste...chicken breast that's golden fried, crunchy, tasty, and perfectly sandwiched in a hamburger type bun. \n\nIn all, I have to say that the Grand Lux Cafe is an easy stop if you're hungry, undecided, and in the Venetian.  There's plenty for everyone here and the price is better than most."

S'This a great place to have a meal in vegas if you are not looking for a high dollar adventure meal and want to stay in the $15-30/person range but still get good food and full tablecloth service with something for everyone. Grand Lux is a small chain with restaurants in places like Miami and Houston, a deluxe version of the Cheesecake Factory with a giant menu including European, American, and International Fare. The smoothies are good. They have lots of sandwiches and pasta and breakfast all day and mexican and practically everything else. This place is giant and actually has two locations in this casino. The location is nice. I think it may be the original for the chain. You will have a more unique experience perhaps if you spend $60/person at a fine dining place on the strip but you cannot do that every night and Grand Luxe is great food for the price (especially for the strip) and everything will be quite good. For a similar price you can visit one of the many trendy diners in the strip casinos but not get the whole tablecloth experience and you will end up with more fried food and less sides and variety. You can also go to a buffet but that will be a bad move, as the food quality will be lower than Grand Luxe, and you will end up too full when Grand Luxe would definitely have offered more than enough food anyway without the temptation to eat 3 plates of low quality food to get your value.'

S"Lots of food for a decent price.  It's not the healthiest restaurant choice, but damn is their food good....\n\nI've always like the Cheesecake Factory for really one dish (Shrimp Scampi yay!) and one dish alone, and my initial impression of the Grand Lux Cafe was that they were a bit similar to Cheesecake Factory.  I didn't realize then, that they are owned by the same company...but I digress....\n\nAt the Grand Lux though, I found more dishes that I like (Ahi Tuna burger, Double Stuff Potato Spring Rolls, to name a few).\n\nThis particular location was located right at the base of the set of elevators to the Venetian hotel rooms.  And at the time, being a Venetian guest, it was just way too easy to keep coming back.  Was I mad about that?  Of course not, how can you be mad at good food within walking distance to your elevator bank?\n\nI also appreciated their long hours.  I guess being a Vegas location and all, it was easy for them to open early (early enough for me) and stay open later.\n\nBut I guess do to the close proximity to the elevators and their long hours, they do get full fast.  Full enough to cause 2 long lines...which I never quite understood why there were 2 lines to begin with.  If you don't mind taking the food to go (which is the easiest thing to do when the line is too long) head over to the left area which kind of looks like a cafe.  You can order Grand Lux takeout from there."

So when I found out they owned this I was all over it. Got here, got seated quickly and got a basket of sourdough bread. Then I ordered the fish and chips which were melt in your mouth crispy deliciousness on a plate. :) I don't even remember what my boyfriend got, I was too busy savoring the fish and their homemade tartar sauce. The service was ok, we had two different servers. A must go if in Vegas."

S'This is my rant and is as accurate as possible.  Times are approximate.  What you are about to read is detailed.  You may want to turn away now especially if you absolutely love Grand Lux.  My friend Yin was set on going to the Grand Lux location at the Venetian.  We probably should\'ve gone to a buffet instead.\n\nA haggard server took our orders and pleasantly answered our questions.  She suggested a vinagerette on the side since I wasn\'t sure about whether I would like it or not.  Omelette and Hash Browns, two Pasta Carbonaras, Fried Chicken and Waffles (Boneless fried chicken and one Belgian Waffle - why it\'s plural on the menu is misleading) and Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya.  She even recommended lunch portions of our Carbonaras because they serve HUGE portions.\n\nThey switched servers to a perky young lady who seemed eager to take our order.  Sharida was her name, I believe, and she had curly hair.  She was taking over for the previous lady.  We were glad to have her.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes, the first server surprisingly came back with the duck potstickers (delicious by the way) and a boat of my salad dressing.  In addition, a scalding hot loaf of sliced sourdough bread came a few minutes later.  Within this time, Grand Lux Cafe seats about six guys with luggages by their side to my right.  Soon thereafter, a family of five sits to my left.\n\n15 minutes after getting our appetizers and bread...\n\nThe table of six guys gets their order of cold sandwiches and other quick-fix dishes.  "Hmmm..." we think to ourselves.  "They get their order before us but they sat later.  At least we got our potstickers and bread to tide us over.  Besides, it probably takes quicker to fix their lunch than ours does.  What am I going to do with this salad dressing without salad though?"  They take our appetizer plate and small dishes away.  \n\n20-minute mark from the time they delivered our appetizers...\n\n25-minute mark...\n\nThe family to my left gets their orders.  I noticed some had fried chicken, others pasta, still others, hot and tasty dishes.  Okay, something was seriously wrong.\n\n30-minute mark..\n\n35-minute mark..\n\nI try to flag down our waitress who went from one of the bar tables and goes to six-guy table to my right and asks if everything came out alright.  I try to catch her attention through her peripheral vision, but she clearly makes her way to the kitchen.  \n\n40-minute mark..\n\nMy cousin gets up and seeks out our waitress.  He follows her, calls out, but according to him she ignored him and bolted for the kitchen.  The two ladies at the end of the bar simply tell him, "You don\'t look so happy."\n\n"I\'m not," he says, but with a smile because they\'re girls.  He was hiding his frustration.  He sits back down with us.\n\n45 minutes after getting our appetizers...\n\nAll of us are so hungry and waiting there.  I lost my appetite.  Our drinks aren\'t even filled.  My cousin says, "Let\'s get out of here."  I on the other hand didn\'t want to leave without at least paying for the potstickers.\n\n"Let\'s just leave," he repeats standing up.  "I don\'t need this.  We should just go somewhere else.  Clearly the other tables got their food and we didn\'t."  He pointed out the bar area also got their food right away.  I was beginning to suspect a number of different factors as to why we didn\'t get ours, but I had enough of it too.  I stood up too looking around for any server.  Yin makes her way to the hostess to try and flag a manager.  My brother stands up. Our table is empty.  Just as the last of our friends agrees and stands up ready to leave, several food servers come out with our dishes.\n\nThe cheese on our carbonara was dried and hard from the prolonged heat.  The fried chicken wasn\'t fresh.  The waffle was on the verge of being burnt.  The omelette looked rubbery.  In spite of it all, I liked my creamy pasta and I think the bacon saved it.  I just had to move the cheese.  I was so upset I only ate half of it and didn\'t enjoy it as much as I could\'ve had it been fresher earlier.  You can *definitely* tell all of our food had been sitting out for a while.  Salad greens were wilted and had dark spots and tomatoes were mushy.\n\nThe manager, Marty, kept asking how she could make it up to us...crap 5000 word limit-\n\nWe understand restaurants tend to get busy especially during Sunday mornings and afternoons in Vegas, but clearly, there was some miscommunication between servers and the kitchen.  Maybe it was Sharida\'s first day.  There are legitimate reasons as to why service (albeit friendly) was abhorrent.  Our server could\'ve at LEAST periodically come by with a status.\n\nI\'ve never ever come across service like this.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I\'d go back to Grand Lux Cafe out of mercy, but never will I set foot at this location again.  \n\nWe had as much fun on our dining experience as you had reading my rant.'

Another friend ordered a shrimp scampi with scarily large shrimp and my omelet had a 10-inch diameter...and we ate it all.\n\nDelicious but the wait during such a crucial time of need resulted in the docking off of 2 stars. Oh and it's pretty expensive for drunk munchies. \n\nPro tip: The premade sandwiches are freaking DELICIOUS and only about $7, which is the best deal on their menu."

Came here before when staying at the Venetian, as it's open 24 hours (or until the wee hours) so always a place to dine whenever you're hungry in Vegas.\n\nWe came here for lunch on our first day, and I just wanted a small meal since we were eating dinner in a few hours. The lunch special of half a sandwich, soup, and salad stood out to me and was a reasonable $9. Their complimentary bread was not my cup of tea since it's not very soft, but that was better for me so I could save my appetite for my lunch. The butter here is really tasty though!\n\nAlthough the restaurant was not busy, our food took forever and a day to come out. When it finally did I was pleased with my dish, as it was a good amount of food for the price. The salad was tasty, and they brought my blue cheese dressing on the side. The chicken mushroom soup was pretty tasty, and they give you a huge cup of it! My BLT however...the bread was so badly burnt, I didn't eat any of the bread. Also, I like my bacon chewy, but these were burnt to a crisp. Stole some of my friends' fries and dipped it in their yummy ranch so I got my fill of carbs.\n\nThey also brought out a complimentary birthday treat for my friend, and their whipped cream was light and yummy, and the crisp that came with it was also light and tasty as well.\n\nOverall, we all enjoyed our meals, but just wished service was quicker."

I would normally expect the opposite since it normally seems that food is that much better after you've been drinking all night long.  Fries were, chewy, not sure if that is the right word but definitely looked like they just came right out of the fryer.  So maybe old, not sure.  Burgers were good but once again nothing special.

Yes, it's expensive but it's also enough to feed 6 people and it is actually moist and delicious without being too cloying.  The cream cheese frosting was also fantastic!  I wish I knew the recipe because it would go so well with red velvet cupcakes!\n\nSo while I'd give the carrot cake 4 or 5 stars and the frozen hot chocolate about 3, the service is a 1.  The waiter we had was so rude.  My boyfriend and I wanted to share the small 10 oz frozen hot chocolate and the waiter would not stop insisting that we order the larger one.

For those who didn't want to wait for a table there is an outdoor 'to go' window althought I suspect some of them had to wait almost as long for their food, and by that time their frozen hot chocolates were probably halfway melted (more on that later).\n\nWhat can I say, aside from the glaringly obvious presence of a fully lit LA style martini bar in the corner of the dining area (for the men who are desperately trying to salvage the last shreds of their masculinity) with sports on the plasma tvs, the decor is as cute and pink as one would expect.  And the dining crowd by my visual estimate was at least 70-80% female, complete with GFs, wives, kids, grandmas, all in all and very kid friendly place.\n\nAll 3 of us decided to go for their brunch menu items, altho the burgers and other non breakfast items looked equally mouth watering, but I wanted to save my stomach for another burger place.  I opted for the Hangover's Omelette which was a light and fluffy yet massive mega-omelette complete with cheese, sausage, bacon and french fries INSIDE the egg wrap.  Other items on the table included eggs benedict which I thought was quite good and the monster sized 'french toast log' complete with breakfast potatos, ice cream, fruit and bacon on the side.  The log was big enough to feed all of us, to be honest.\n\nNow the frozen hot chocolate, yes I've heard all about it and no, I never paid attn to the yelp photos.  I was expecting something the size of a Starbucks frappucino but my god this was huge.  They come in 2 sizes and while my friends got the classic hot choc, I wanted to try the white chocolate version to change things up.  Coming in 2 sizes I wisely chose the 'one man' size and when I got it....it looked no smaller than the portion for 2, and while normally I wouldn't complain about getting more for my money, this was too much for me and I couldnt even finish what I took to go.  Honestly, there should be a 'baby bear' size to go with the momma and poppa bear sizes.  I know I'm in the minority in this, but that's ok.\n\nFor those who try to get into the famed flagship NY store with their supposed 3 hr waits, you honestly might save a little time flying into vegas hop over to the Vegas one and fly back.  No i'm not serious but if you happen to be in LV, definitely try it out."

S"One of the main reasons I wanted to try Serendipity was for their cold hot chocolate. I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I thought that it would be tastier than it was, but I felt like it was something that I would be able to make myself. In addition, it was a bit on the pricey side. The food that I ordered the Fully Monty Sandwich (I believe that's what it's called) which was realllyy goood. The proportions were really large as well, so I had enough for two meals. My order also came with the option of sweet potato fries or steak fries. My sweet potato fries were nothing out of the ordinary, but my friend's steak fries were pretty tasty. The inside of the restaurant is very nicely decorated.\n\nSome of the downsides are that the prices are a bit expensive, especially for the cold hot chocolate. Also, while I was there with my friends the waiter was not very professional, and would say inappropriate to my friends and I while we were eating and ordering."

The wait can be long for a table, but in my opinion definitely worth it.'

S"The last time I came here was about a year ago since we come to Vegas every August.  Last year I remember when we went to the express window, they had two sizes of the frozen hot chocolates; regular and large.  I think the regular was around $8 maybe and when I went recently, I couldn't believe how expensive they've gotten!  Now at the express window they charge $11 for the smaller size!!  They don't have large anymore; just one tiny cup of frozen hot chocolate at a ridiculous price.  I don't remember ever buying a single serving size drink for $11 before...just CRAZY.  \n\nAnyways we've eaten here before too and food is nothing special but I do admit, the frozen hot chocolate is really good.  We tried the strawberry this year and I think that one's my new favorite....SO GOOD.  We usually just do the express window because dining in takes so long.  I don't know why the wait is always forever and the hostesses are all grumpy from being constantly busy.  I also came in to buy a package of the frozen hot chocolate mix for $6...and really, I'm pretty sure the mix is just your typical hot chocolate powder.  I'm gonna try making this frozen hot chocolate with just regular hot chocolate mix and see how it goes.  \n\nBottom Line: Love the frozen hot chocolate, hate the price."

S'My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and waited for about 45 minutes before being seated. The wait was definitely doable, especially since the hostess takes your phone number and online updates are texted to you informing you how many parties are ahead of you. Once we were seated, our server was quick to take our orders and make us feel welcome. I ordered the LV burger and my boyfriend ordered the ABC burger - both were delicious. Finally, we had our frozen hot chocolate, and this treat alone made the high prices tolerable. This was definitely an awesome experience and is a must-do for people visiting Vegas.'

S'Lets start with the "ambiance". I would imagine dining on the outdoor patio as the weather continues to improve would make your dining experience here at Serendipity much more enjoyable. Alas, my dining experience(s) have been indoors. \n\nThe restaurant is centrally located on the infamous LVBLVD, and by central I mean central for passing tourists, not for those who have made a special trip just to dine at this fine establishment. You must park at Cesar\'s Palace, pack a canteen, and hike to your dining destination. WEAR COMFY SHOES! \n\nOnce you arrive (and find the front door, or side door, or??) you are dumped into the middle of the "dining commons" as I like to think of it. It reminds me of a lunch room cafeteria minus the buffet style and mean lunch ladies. \n\nOK, so this place isn\'t all bad, I promise. The staff has been generally friendly and I\'ll get to the food in a minute... \n\nIt\'s been a minute..If you can get past the wacky setup (and the fact you have to walk outside, around the building and through a deserted hallway to use the restroom), you have your pick of enormous eats on this joint\'s menu! \n\nTHE NACHOS ARE OUTSTANDING! I did venture away from my nacho comfort zone and ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza but...stick to CPK for that little diddy. The pizza was ALL crust, little cheese & toppings..nuff said. \n\nDesert. If you are looking to live on the edge and you want to partake in a desert for dinner evening, this would be your place! DELICIOUS, FATTENING, and FANTASTIC!!! \n\nSo, I give this place 3 stars mainly for their bangin nachos, and decent staff, but it loses the last two stars for layout, location, and well, everything except the food, drinks and staff, haha!'

S"Since Caesar's is one of my favorite casinos, I love coming here to eat.\n\nThe food here is amazing. The ahi tuna salad knocked my socks off (I was actually shocked how fresh the ahi was) and their desserts are heavenly. The frozen hot chocolate is definitely one for your bucket list!\n\nOur waiter, Brian, was super friendly, entertaining and funny and made great suggestions on the menu. \n\nLike any restaurant on the strip, it's always a bit crowded, so if you plan on a sit down, plan ahead. Expect the service to be a bit slow because of the heavy traffic.\n\nMy main complaint is about the seating inside. The chairs were sooooooo uncomfortable. I found myself shifting around just to try to enjoy my meal. They seriously look and feel like they came out of a McDonald's. My ass hurt at the end of our dinner. Next time I'm opting for ordering at the window and sitting on the concrete benches outside, which is a shame cause the wall decor inside was cool. Dear manager: for the love of god please change these!!!!!!!"

S"I went New Years Day in a party of four, and signed in for an hour wait (11 parties ahead of me.  Awesome.).  We thought we'd grow old and die before being seated, so we checked out their other options: 1) the to-go line outside of the restaurant and 2) order to-go at the bar.\n\nIf you order to-go outside, you use a menu with limited options (but some of the same items are slightly cheaper than on the regular menu).  We don't go to Vegas often, so we decided to order at the bar and to just take our food to the tables outside of the hotel.  It was a nice option since the line was considerably shorter.\n\nWe ordered the black and white sundae ($15ish), a frozen hot chocolate ($9ish), and a grilled cheese sandwich ($15ish).  The prices were a bit of a kick in the pocketbook, but it all tasted great.  The grilled cheese sandwich had swiss, american, cheddar (I think?), and brie, and it was AMAZING.  It also came with yummy tomato soup.  I know they're famous for their frozen hot chocolate (which tastes exactly like how it sounds), but I actually enjoyed the black and white sundae more.\n\nThe seating sucked though. I know the area doesn't belong specifically to Serendipity 3, but c'mon, Ceasar's Palace!  Invest in a bus boy to clean up the tables at least once a century!  Especially if those tables sit right between your glitzy hotel and an expensive eatery!  It kind of ruined the ambiance eating our expensive, delicious food while sitting at sticky, filthy tables.  Gross."

S'My buddies always rave about this place. This weekend I finally got the chance to see what all the hype was about. I was crunched for time, so I didn\'t dine in but opted to go to their "express" window, which was still a pretty long wait. I guess this place is popular, indoors and out.\n\nDuring the long wait, I started getting hungry--and their snacks started to seem more and more appetizing. After careful scrutiny, I decided to order the Frozen Hot Chocolate (their signature beverage) and a Jalapeno Cheddar Bacon Pretzel.\n\nOne was awesome, the other was not. The Frozen Hot Chocolate was very sweet and definitely refreshing, a nice way to cool off from the scorching Vegas heat.  Don\'t expect it to quench your thirst though, because it\'s more of a cool dessert than it is a drink.\n\nJalapeno Cheddar Bacon Pretzel was entirely forgettable. This thing was humungous--over 1 foot in length, curved into an "S" shape. But it was not fresh, not hot, not tasty, and extremely salty. Overall just a bad pretzel.\n\nBut a bad pretzel is not enough to make me completely avoid this place forever--I\'ll give this joint another chance. Maybe next time I\'ll actually dine in: their list of desserts sure did look appetizing...'

S"I've been to Serendipity several times during my various trips to Vegas. Its a great casual restaurant located right on the strip. It has a cute little whimsical vibe that simply makes me happy every time I come here. \n\nSerendipity is known for desserts, including frozen hot chocolate and the $1,000 golden opulence sundae. (Yes, $1,000... don't think I'll ever try that one unless I hit it big in the casino.) The frozen hot chocolate is very rich and tasty, and definitely a good thing to try while in the hot desert. During my most recent trip, my husband and I spilt the cookie sundae. The two of us together couldn't even finish it! Cookie dough ice cream mixed with three fresh baked cookies and topped with whipped cream and hot fudge... yum!\n\nAll of the food I've ever had here has been pretty solid as well. The triple decker grilled cheese is my favorite. It's so flippin' cheesy and gooey! I love it! The portions are all very large and can easily be split between two... especially if you're planning on dessert. \n\nI always look forward to my next trip to Vegas, and Serendipity has become one of those staples for me that make the trip so great and fun."

S'Our waitress told us, "I make things happen."\n\nUnfortunately, someone lied to her.\n\nDO NOT go here if you are in a HURRY! DO NOT go here if you are HUNGOVER and need food ASAP!!!!\n\nWe went on the Sunday after Halloween, not many people were on the strip. It was about 11.  The wait was about 40 minutes, which I didn\'t think was too bad.\n\nWe were literally had a 2 1/2 hour LUNCH!!!! Thank God we didn\'t have a plane to catch.  It took our server FOREVER to get us anything --water, diet coke, FOOD, dessert. We had to ask for the check when our entrees came because we were so nervous she would never come back to our table.  She (and all the other servers) kept disappearing to some room behind the bar and they seemed to never come out.\n\nThe food was good -- the nachos were amazing, obvi the frozen hot chocolate was good...sweet potato fries were amazing...but the service/wait was AWFUL.\n\nI will not be going back there (and I go to Vegas a lot). I was so excited that Serendipity came to LV, but so disappointed in the service. \n\nAlso, it is EXTREMELY COLD if you sit inside...so bring a sweater (even if it is like 90 degrees outside).\n\nAlso, one more tip. If you go during brunch time make sure NOT to look at the menu they have posted on the building while you wait...ask the hostess for the brunch menu because that menu is MUCH more limited.  We got all excited when we looked at the full menu vs. the brunch menu. Just a little tip.'

S"We came to Serendipity to get some hangover relief and one final epic meal before leaving Vegas. To this day, I'm still a bit puzzled why this place is so raved about...\n\nOn a typical summer Sunday, your wait will be pretty long for a large group. The restaurant itself is fairly small in Vegas standards, so be prepared. We were seated on the outside patio, because that's the only place that could accommodate a group of 12. Even though it was in the shade, it was HOT. Blazing Vegas hot. For some odd reason, the mist fans don't come on until noon, so we were left there sitting for an hour without any relief but our water. It's really not that hard to turn off the timers, guys...\n\nThe meal itself was nothing special. I ordered the Fried Chicken & Waffles, which came with 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, one bacon waffle, potatoes, honey mustard and ketchup. The chicken was heavily breaded and was pretty dried out and flavorless. The only thing that added taste to it was the honey mustard. The bacon waffles were alright initially, but they get pretty unbearable after 1/4 of a waffle. The entire dish is just bland and flavorless. I understand they're trying to be unique here with the bacon waffles, but it's definitely not worth $22. \n\nFor the finale, all of us got the famed highly spoken of frozen hot chocolate. This was the biggest disappointment of the day. For $11, you're basically paying for a huge watered down chocolate milk with some whipped cream on top. That's exactly how it tastes. I experienced no wow factor and I seriously don't see what all the hype is about. It cools you down, but other than that, it's not that great."

We had the original flavor, oreo, and strawberry. I have to say the original frozen hot chocolate tasted the best!\n\nIt's 10$ for a small cup which is pretty pricy but it was alright for the novlety of it. They have outdoor seating and everything is sherbet  colored so it was a nice place to chill and rest. \n\nI'd say the frozen hot chocolate tastes like a hot chocolate powder milkshake. The oreo flavor tastes more like the creme insides than the cookie and the strawberry tastes kind of like a powdery strawberry milkshake. \n\nBeing a girl, I'm a sucker for cute things. : )"

S"So my boyfriend and I decided to try this place on Saturday and we are glad we did! We had to wait for about 20 minutes to be seated, but it made sense. Saturday night in Vegas, what good restaurant wouldn't be packed at 7pm? Once seated my boyfriend and I decided to order from their monster meal deal menu. Basically, they have a list of appetizers and entrees that you can choose from for $20. He ordered the spaghetti and kobe beef sliders for both of us. When the food came out, we noticed that only one order was brought out. The waiter had misunderstood and thought we wanted one order to share. Even though it was our fault, he gave us a free frozen hot chocolate for two for having to wait!!\n\n- The Kobe Beef Sliders were deeelicious. The sauce that they have inside of the sliders and on the place is perfect. It added the right amount of flavor to an already flavorful patty.\n\n- The spaghetti was very flavorful. The monster meatballs were a PERFECT combination of veal, pork, and beef (the meat lover's dream!). They were extremely flavorful. The noodles were thicker than most spaghetti noodles, but cooked perfectly making the dish very filling.\n\n- The frozen hot chocolate is definitely a must try. The frozen chocolatey goodness was topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. We ate/drank the whole thing!\n\n- The root beer! The root beer was different from most root beers I've had at restaurants. It was very soft and had a slight creamy taste to it. It was very good.\n\nI would definitely come back here again to eat, but I would make a reservation next time I plan on doing so."

S'I\'ve worked at Caesars Palace for 18 months but I am not biased.  Let me just set the record straight.  I had ABSOLUTELY NO, ZERO, ZIP, NADA interest in eating here due to my total reliance upon my fellow Yelpers POV...until my Boss, who is a Foodie, invited me to have lunch with him.  \n\nHonestly, when he asked, I had thoughts of Bobby Flay\'s Mesa Grill, Bradley Ogden, or even the Munch Bar, but he said "Trip S".  Out of respect for those readers with more conservative morals, I will refrain from what truly emanated from my under my breath, but let\'s just say I would not normally use this kind of language but sometimes the autonomic response elicits more idiomatic expressions you would typically follow up with an immediate "Sorry!"\n\nOkay, with that loquacious preamble let me speak to the BEST !$#@%!$^%$# thing I\'ve ate so far in 2011!!!  Whoa man!  I ordered the Las Vegas Strip Sandwich (pics 9 and 11).  10 ounces of prime medium rare NY Strip beef on a toasted French roll around 18 inches long; slathered with garlic butter, covered with three over easy eggs and six crisscrossed thick cut smoky, sweet, salty, crispy bacon.  BACON!!! \n\nLet\'s back up minute.  When we arrived at "Trip S" it was packed. The very nice hostess with the great smile sat us at the one of the two available seats.  Our Server, another lady with an easy manner and great smile, got us drinks immediately...well, within 2 minutes anyway and she followed up with us a few minutes later to let us know that our food was coming eminently.  I noticed other guests were signaling for her attention and she seemed to have a very good awareness of her area and appeared to notice the polite hand waving in her periphery without losing connection with us.  Once she was done with us, she moved on to the neighboring guests, flashed her award winning great smile and they were putty in her hands.  Actually, she had me at "Hello".\n\nThe food arrives!!!  First my Boss\'s Ruben arrives.  I love a good Ruben and when I saw his, I thought I should have ordered one, but didn\'t want to make anyone uncomfortable.  You know what I mean...next, my Las Vegas Strip Sandwich arrives and WHOA MAN, I am so glad I didn\'t get the Ruben now...next visit.   This is a hefty piece of carnivores delight.   If I were at home I would have thrown it on a plate, plop down on the couch, put on some football and gone to town, but being in coat and tie and in public that whole egg yolk dribbling down the chin would not fly so I did the right thing and cut it into thirds.  About a pound each I swear to goodness.  I took the first bite...how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...It was almost as good a lingering first kiss.  Hot, salty, crunchy, savory, smoky, my ...WAIT! BACK THE TRUCK UP!!!!...that is not a good example of a great lingering first kiss, but just work with me.  The synchronization of flavors, textures, body responses, was almost overwhelming.  Yes, I was totally satisfied.  \n\nPlease note that this sandwich is not for the faint of heart.  You need to get your grub on to finish it but alas, that how I roll.  It\'s just one of those things you want to continue masticating until it\'s no more no matter how full the hypothalamus screams. \n\nBon appetite!'

I would love to have been able to try the food and write a review based on that, but unfortunately I didn't even have the opportunity to try their food so my review is solely based on SERVICE.\n\nI came in on a Monday morning which meant that it was fairly slow. We had to walk around asking the waiters if we sit anywhere or if there was someone to seat us, in which they just pointed to one direction and told me to speak with the hostess. Not a big deal. After we spoke to the hostess, she was able to seat us down promptly and gave us menus. The waitress came by with waters for us and told us she'd be back shortly to take our order. 15 minutes later, she came to take our drink order. A friend of mine ordered a coke and the rest of us was content with our water. She came back with the coke and left sooner than we could ask to put our order in. So we sat there patiently and waited for her. 15 minutes later, we see her walking around and talking to customers and still have not come back to simply take our order. At this point, we ran out of patience and decided to leave. Right when we were about to leave, she came back and asked if we were ready. I told her that we decided to leave instead and she had the nerve to charge my friend for her UNTOUCHED coke. We were so furious that we just gave her the EXACT cash and left. Didn't take her name or collect the reciept which I wish I would have so I could include it this review.\n\nI am very big on service, but I am understanding in certain scenarios. But 30 mins of waiting on a slow day to simply take our order is definitely unacceptable. I don't even care to try their food anymore. It seemed overpriced and nothing special. Instead, I walked across the street to The Quad and had Hash House instead; for half the price, the service was top knotch and it was extremely busy there. You can read my review for that location because I will definitely be giving them a five star after compared to this horrible experience with Serendipity 3."

S"A hot day with a group of girls craving for some chocolate led us to Serendipity. We just wanted dessert so we ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate - one regular and one with a Mint Chip flavor.\n\nWe also ordered a slice of the cheesecake creme de la creme.\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate was good - it didn't blow my mind but it was packed with chocolate flavor and had a slushy milk chocolate feel. The four of us shared one and that was enough for all of us. Four huge straws and a mound of whipped cream and chocolate chips on top. Nothing fancy, just a large quantity.\n\nThe slice of Cheesecake was HUGE. The cake wasn't overly sweet and had a wonderful cream cheese whipped cream on top that complimented everything pretty well. We worked our way eating around the cheesecake but could hardly make a dent in it! There is a raspberry jam at the bottom tjat also gave you a different take on the flavors. The cheesecake was my favorite.\n\nI'm docking off a star because of the price. It came out to be a nearly $50 check for hot chcocolate and cheesecake....the food was good but not that good. You could be paying for the ambiance, but it isn't to the level of 4 Stars like some other dessert places on the strip.\n\nBottom line: you can do it for the experience, but I'm sure there are better dessert places. What does the word serendipity mean anyway???"

S"one star... why? Here it goes: \nTIME \n30 minutes for me to interrupt a random hostess to request a waiter... another 7 just to get water and another 20 to get our food out to us. Last I checked it takes less than a minute to scoop ice cream right? \nTASTE: \n-Chicken Strips..... forget it! that horrible Tabasco sauce that Hooters use is also used here....go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead or get the Spicy wings at the Albertsons deli...(amazing) \n-Nachos: I didn't know it was possible to ruin Nachos until now, the canned black beans and dehydrated ground beef makes Taco Bell a 5 star restaurant....skip them and go to the Yard House for Nachos...best in Vegas (I'm not kidding) \n-Oreo frozen hot chocolate.....I know my junk food and let me tell you something...those are not oreos, they are some cheap version of oreos because it has that medicine after taste. \n-Carrot cake ice cream...Semi good, You could actually build a better one at home, the cake tasted frozen old and the ice cream was substandard, Cold Stone has better quality than this 14 dlls overpriced thing oh and the nuts on top were also old. \nCLEANLINESS: \nDirty, there are heavy traffic restaurants in Vegas just like this one and they are clean. \n\nThe run down...If you have time to waste and want to people watch this is ok, It has a great location outdoor and indoor tables but the food is substandard including the service, I believe that the only reason they are still in business its because of the location and they get tourists that eat there once then leave the city just like airport food. \n\nBTW, I come from a family of accomplished chefs. \navoid this place."

Unless you're dying of starvation, just split a meal. It will save you a lot of money. \n\nThere was only one positive and that was the frozen hot chocolate. We had it with pinnacle vodka. It was very good. Again, this is something you should share. It was very big.\n\nPrices are ridiculous.

S"***Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is pretty good (and is topped off with some nice whipped cream), but it is quite overpriced at $11***\n\nI have always wanted to try Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.  Serendipity has a takeout booth where you can get many drinks and such to go or a sit-down restaurant where you can get a full menu of food options as well as the frozen hot chocolate in a much nicer presentation.  I opted for the takeout booth.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate is a good portion size and features a frozen chocolate concoction, which is similar to a milkshake though it really is an iced chocolate drink.  The chocolate drink is good.  It is cool and refreshing and has a good chocolate flavor.  I wouldn't say that it is any more memorable than any other good frozen chocolate drink out there, but it is satisfying enough.\n\nThey top the drink off with whipped cream and the whipped cream is good.  It is a little thicker than a lot of whipped creams out there and it has a pretty good vanilla flavor.\n\nService was quick on my one visit.\n\nPrices were high--probably too high (maybe even too high for Las Vegas).  The frozen hot chocolate runs $11.  I think outside of Vegas, a drink like this one would most likely go for $6 and would probably not exceed $8.\n\nSerendipity's frozen hot chocolate is a good but not special drink even though you are definitely paying a special, premium price.  I think it is good for at least one try, but I think the flavor does not really stand out that much.  There is a Vosges boutique in the Forum Shops and that chocolates boutiques used to serve milkshakes--they were far better in terms of flavor and even a little cheaper than Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.\n\nNow that Vosges no longer offers those milkshakes, I'm not sure where you can find a great frozen chocolate drink in Vegas, but a less expensive Haagen-Dazs milkshake would probably provide just as satisfying flavor and experience as what you can have at Serendipity (with the exception of the whipped cream).\n\nSerendipity is located in the outside dining area at the front of Caesars Palace.  Caesars Palace offers both complimentary valet and self parking."

S"Good desserts and other food too! \n\nAtmosphere/cleanliness: Clean, well-lit, slightly retro inside with ornate details everywhere, and loud inside. Warning: reliving Fear & Loathing here could get you arrested or you will never leave! \n\nService: Friendly and helpful, a little overzealous with table cleanup. Where'd my napkin go? \n\nFood: Serendipity 3 is a great dessert stop without a doubt, and with the new location next to Caesar's in the prime crossroads where Paris is just across the street, the location couldn't be better. Hit it big at the craps table? Reward yourself with the $1000 Golden Opulence Sundae, then drive away in a new Ferrari! \n\nOkay, reality time, the dice game just wasn't in my favor, but I did enjoy my meal here. We got seated immediately with a party of 8 on a Thursday night. First course: Spinny Dippin' spinach artichoke dip with freshly-made tortilla chips and real bits of good-quality Reggiano cheese that melted before your eyes, so tasty! I also got to sample the Madras Mojito with cranberries muddled within the mint, it was very flavorful and went down smoothly. Dinner course consisted of an ABC Burger: avocado, brie, and caramelized onions all combined within a single bite that harmonizes the sweetness of the perfectly-cooked, golden-brown onions, blended with the tang of the brie, and mildness of the avocado performed a symphony of Beethoven-like proportions and encored perfectly with sweet potato fries. Excellent indeed! Finally dessert was served, a Peanut Butter Frrrrrrozen Hot Chocolate finished off a perfect meal. Sure there are more dressy establishments with big name chefs to be found on The Strip, but Serendipity 3 delivers not only for your sweet cravings, but a main course too. As always, leave room for dessert!"

S"I wanted my first time to be in NYC, but I still had a great time at Serendipity 3 in LV.  I guess there's always a wait no matter what city you're in.  They only take RSVP 2 hrs. in advance at the earliest.  It was very windy the day my group and I went & everyone who waits, has to wait outside.  There was only 1 heat lamp next to the outdoor hostess (which you're not able to stand next to, but that doesn't matter b/c you can barely feel the heat since there is a tube around the stream of fire - probably for the drunkards who might decide to actually touch the flame).  \n\nANYWAYS,  once we got seated indoors, the atmosphere seemed very open and whimsical-like.  The menus were HUGE & I was having a hard time trying to decide on what to chow down on.  Our waiter helped me with that and I went with the Crab Cake Burger.  Once it arrived it looked AMAZING and it tasted just that.  It came with a side of fries (I ordered steak) & a really yummy dipping sauce.  The burger came with arugula and bacon, too!  YUM!  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough room for the Frozen Hot Chocolate :/  But I did manage to try a spoonful from my friend and it just reminded me of chocolate ice cream or chocolate ensure.  EH.  However, I'm willing to give the frozen hot chocolate another try... one day.  I would definitely come back for their Crab Cake Burger though!  \n\nFood my friends ordered - The Hangover Omelet (HUGE), The Sliders (comes w/ 3 of them & they look like nothing, but they apparently filled her up, but she had to order a side of fries), The Grilled Cheese which came with a side of tomato soup w/ goldfish sprinkled on top - cute (she said the sandwich was REALLY GOOD), and The Chicken Strips (comes w/ 3 dipping sauces).\n\nThe food IS on the pricey side, but the portions are huge."

Very pink, very open, lots of colors and loud  music that makes you feel like you're in a club already.\n\nWe called ahead and made a reservation for lunch, which turned out to be a brilliant idea because it was super crowded and the wait was long. We also opted to sit indoors, because despite their fans outside, I was not about to sit in the 105 degree weather.\n\nTheir brunch menu looked pretty amazing.. super tasty breakfast items, and some super tasty lunch items. We decided to mix a little of both and ordered the french toast log and a cheeseburger to share among the 3 of us. When the french toast arrived, we were in awe. It was definitely a LOG, and it was huge! On one end were some breakfast potatoes and 2 sunny side eggs with bacon, and on the other end were some fresh berries with whipped cream. It was definitely a true breakfast meal! The cheeseburger was very good too. Everything was super tasty, but we were really waiting for the frrrrozen hot chocolate at the end! We got a coupon for a free one with our stay at Paris, so that just made it extra delicous. Nothing beats that cool dessert on a hot Vegas day! The bill only came out to $32!!"

I don\'t care for chocolate donuts much but this one was good. $5 ($4 for me since I have a Total Rewards card) but well worth it, which is a surprise since every thing\'s grossly overpriced on the Strip anyway.  We did a midnight run 2 days later - he had glazed this time. My nephew\'s motto is "Donuts make me happy" -  I had to agree this time.  So if you like donuts - check this place out.'

It was quite tasty and I feel guilty admitting it, but the marshmallow was my favorite part of the whole thing.  I'm certainly glad that we split it because it was HUGE (no complaints here!).\n\nThis location is not nearly as charming as the location in NYC, but we did not have high expectations of that since this is a second location, aimed at tourists on the stip.  \n\nWe showed up around 4 pm on Saturday, thinking we would be seated quickly since it wasn't a prime dining hour.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Not bad, but there were plenty of empty tables around.  Perhaps they were short staffed.  We did find it strange that the hostess did not give us the option to sit inside or outside.  They just give you  the first table that is ready.  We would have waited longer if we ould have been on the patio.  Oh well!"

I ordered the Cheese Ravioli and the bf ordered Chicken Pot Pie. My ravioli was nothing special. I liked the thin slices of Parmesan cheese on top but that was about it. The bf's Pot Pie was also mediocre. \n\nNow on to the Frozen Hot Chocolate........ It was good. Think melted Haagen Dazs chocolate ice cream.

OK give my cell phone number to the hostess who puts it into her snazzy iPad then we go sit.  \n\nWe wait, we wait, we wait some more. Finally I get a text message our table is ready. While this feature is really cool here's where it goes all wrong.  Only one hostess behind the stand [not good].

Guy in line starts yelling out us for cutting the line!!!  So it sure does appear we were doing that, how would he know that the table is on my phone and it's indeed our turn to sit, not a good way to start the meal after long wait time already.\n\nWe sit down. We ask for the Las Vegas Dining Menu.  Which is difft from what's on the site, but OK no biggie.  It also wasn't offered to us???  boooooo   PS- We are spending a fixed cost of $30.12 for lunch that's how this deal works so we aren't expecting to have a 'cheap meal' here.  \n\nThey mess this all up from there on out.  Meals came out before apps, apps came out 1.5 mins before meals, there wasn't enough room on the table, the place is cramped so people keep knocking into our chairs, purses are falling on floor, waitress is blaming kitchen b/c this promo just started [which she thinks we are dumb b/c it hadn't just started], too much food on the table, blah blah blah. This list goes on and on and on.\n\nAppies were fine, nothing exciting.  Tomato & Mozz salad had the blandest dang dressing I've ever tasted and HELLO this type of salad needs kick b/c it's very bland to begin with.  Chicken Sandwich was soggie and the bread was ALL wrong. I dissected it like my science project frog and ate parts of it somehow.  Chicken Salad Sandwich got the 'wouldn't order it again' from my boss.  \n\nThe best part of the meal was ---Ding Ding--Dessert!  it was by and LARGE the best part of our experience.

Good but I would prefer a better cut of steak... eh anyways moving along it was all good but a little overpriced. \n \nIf weather permitted would have preferred outside seating and dessert but I was too full and it was too hot to try either.. However I did come back the next day and I tried the frozen hot chocolate and the oreo frozen hot chocolate but this time I went to the walk-up, to-go window...super convenient and fast by the way.\n\nBoth were good but oreo one was better. Had a richer taste to it. The plain one was somewhat iced down.. I\'m a chocolate lover so.... they also weren\'t as big as the ones I seen inside. not sure what difference was..

The sundaes they were bringing out to other customers looked awesome.

The decor is huge with towering ceilings and clocks along with pastel colors and a ton of pink. \n\nThe menu is like a diner style menu, but I didn't wanna go there just for food; I went for dessert.  The chocolate sundae we got was enormous and tasted fantastic.  Definitely worth the $14 price tag, I really enjoyed Serendipity 3 and recommend it to everyone."

S"Okay, so I have heard really great and raging reviews of this place and was really hyped to check it out for the first time! I came here with a friend who's been here a numerous amounts of times.  The decor and ambiance of this place was actually fantastic. It reminded me of the bubblegum candy land and a little bit of sexy hip at the same time. \n\nThe wait was about 25minutes, not bad for dinner on a weekday, and we were seated promptly inside with a view of the strip. That night we saw Penn & Teller eating dinner on the outside balcony, poor guys couldn't even enjoy their night being bothered by tourists and fans, let the men eat!! **My little highlight for the night!**\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad with homemade Garlic Parmesan Croutons that cost almost close to $20 (but it was a huge mixing  bowl portion) While the size might have given you your money's worth, the fish was too fishy and half cooked, the lettuce was drowning in a mayonnaise based Caesar dressing so It was soggy. The only good thing was the Garlic bread/over sized croutons. The disappointment of my night. \n\nAfter my not-so-appetizing dinner, i was sort of looking forward to a dessert called the Frozen Hot Chocolate, but didn't get the chance to because they ran out of ingredients, so they suggested the hot chocolate sundae. What? isn't it chocolate and ice that you need to make this dessert? Ugh So we opted for the Strawberry Fields Sundae, cheesecake, strawberry ice cream, strawberry topping with whipped cream all for $15.00!!! SERIOUSLY? There was two scoops of ice cream on the bottom of a goblet topped with strawberry compote and LOADS of whip cream. Really is that necessary? \n\nIn the end, I made a note to myself that I will never come here again, nor will I suggest this place to anybody. Chili's or Apple-bees in my opinion makes better quality foods at a decent-not-so-overrated price! \n\nNever again."

S'Was excited to dine here because I missed the opportunity to visit the NY spot. Arrived at 9:30 pm and asked for a patio table, which we waited about 15 min for. Noticed there were many open tables and numerous servers working the patio . . . After we were seated, we waited almost 15 minutes to be greeted / acknowledged, We noticed that the two tables that were sat after us already had drinks and their order being taken.  When our server arrived his first words spoken " Are you ready to order?" Huh? I said to myself and the confused look on my friend\'s face she expressed. My friend ordered the Cotton Candy Martini and his reply was "That\'s gonna be a very sweet drink and I got the impression that he really didn\'t want to serve this drink, but she said yes she would like this drink and noticed a reluctant expression on his face. When receiving our drinks, you could tell this "presentation" drink wasn\'t high on his list.  While he shook this drink, some sprayed on us and he did a poor pour over the cotton candy.  Cut to the food - very good Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Crab Cake Sandwich. The wraps were very moist and flavorful, the crab cake had very little filler and so much crab - 5 stars for food and  her drink. But back to the service, while we were dining,  he was doing his side work, refilling salt and pepper shakers without excusing himself as he reached over us. And even though we were not quite down dining he tried to clear our plates - twice! Wanted to order dessert, but why bother him, he was at the railing gazing at The Strip. I\'m kinda sorry we left a 10% tip, should of left 5%.'

S"On a recent trip to Sin City, a visit to Serendipity was on the top of my list. I've been to the original NYC location several times, and looked forward to seeing how this west coast location compared to the east coast OG one. My partner in crime for the weekend, Li, had never been to either location, so was more than happy to accompany her. \n\nSlightly hungover, we needed sustenance before diving into the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. I was shocked to find out that the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior doesn't quite have the charm and coziness of the NYC location, but is open and spacious. There is also outdoor seating available. The music was an eclectic mix of 80s, 90s, and current tunes, which I appreciate, but the volume was a bit loud for my liking. \n\nSo, we ordered: \n- Cup of Tomato Soup: The flavor and texture were perfect, and one of my best I've ever had. I loved how it was accented with goldfish crackers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=Hni3DAqO9NXPth8mNsK5eA \n\n- ABC Burger: Avocado, Brie Cheese burger. Li and I were intrigued with this unique combo, and decided to split this and it was wonderful. Juicy burger and toasty buns, and ginormous portions of avo and brie. This was accompanied by crisp, sweet potato fries. \n\n- Frozen Hot Chocolate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=85Ev04Z-UaQksArEs2ZVNg The grand finale! It didn't disappoint and was super thick and chocolatey. It's better than a chocolate malt/milkshake, as the consistency is icy, yet creamy. This was topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Talk about choco heaven! Oh Mylanta! We sipped and slurped as much as our stomachs could handle, but failed to finish it. \n\nOverall, a decent Serendipity experience. Our server wasn't the friendliest nor super attentive. It took some time for my Diet Coke refills, food, and bill  to arrive at our table. Ambiance isn't as quaint and lovely as the NYC location, but it's still fun place to bring your friends and family. Be warned that the prices are a bit high, food portions are large, music is loud, and service can be spotty. There's a lil' retail area for the t-shirts, frozen hot choco packets, etc., Also, unlike the NYC location, there is a take-out window where you can order from a limited menu (some snacks like pretzels, donuts, etc.,as well as frozen hot chocolate) to enjoy in front of the patio tables in front of Caesar's Hotel or to take along while you walk the strip."

S"WARNING: The portions are ginormous, do not combine with alcohol as it will be serendipitous that you enter food coma upon exiting the eatery. \n\nI have yet to visit the original location in NYC, but I've been told that you should avoid the food at all cost and only come for the desserts - even then be prepared to bring seven of your closest friends in order to comfortably share and completely finish ONE slice of cake and frozen hot chocolate. \n\nI had the mistake of having eyes bigger than my appetite. I got greedy after looking over the menu and instead of just order ONE frozen hot chocolate, I ordered the CHOCOLATE BLACK OUT CAKE to accompany it to share with two others. \n\n* Frozen Hot Chocolate \nFor the non-chocoholics: don't waste your money on this confection as it will probably taste like any old frozen blended chocolate concoction to you. However, if you dream/breathe in chocolate I highly recommend it as you can taste a slice of specialness at the end of each sip. I don't know if its a hint of nutmeg, a smidge of some unique cocoa, or even just cinnamon - but its pretty delicious! \n\n*Chocolate Black Out Cake\nI ordered this cake under pressure/pure excitement for just being at Serendipity. I was reading the anecdote on the front of how the three came to be and create Serendipity when it mentioned the cake. Seeing that it was spotlighted, I figured that I just HAD to have it. \n\nWARNING: DO NOT COMBINE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE W/ CHOCOLATE BLACKOUT CAKE, no really, I don't care how much you believe that you love chocolate...because honestly, your insides are going to taste of chocolate for the next 24 hours because of the overdose of chocolate. \n\nNonetheless, this is MY FAVORITE way to eat chocolate cake - SUPER rich and dense, dredged in chocolate ganache and piled high. Sadly, as ambitious and driven as my guests and I were we did not finish the tower of chocolate - one slice would have easily fed a 10 year old's birthday party. \n\nPrice: you get what you pay for - order a few items, but bring a crowd, you'll need the back-up \nAtmosphere: whimsical and fun\nOverall: Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stop in the first night of the weekend, that way I'll have three days to finish the cake!"

Secondly, everything on the menu is ridiculously overpriced and not worth it. It is like overpriced diner food.\n\nHOWEVER, my friend and I did rather enjoy the frozzzen hot chocolate. We've tried to make it at home before and it was not as rich as this one. \n\nAll in all, I would pay for the drink, not for everything else."

S'We were forewarned and made reservations ahead of time. So that wasnt the problem. \n\nI have been looking forward to Frozen Hot Chocolate ever since I was in NYC and couldnt get my foot in the door due to the 2004 eastern seaboard blackout (yes, I am that just lucky!)...\n\nWell, when u cant get to NYC we come to vegas. And Serendipity was going to be had no matter what!!!!! \n\nThe lines were huge, the crowd was annoyed, and it was HOT HOT HOT outside. We were seated immediately. By some lucky chance we got a buy $10 bucks worth of food and get one free coupon for the frozen treat and presented it to out server. He was not too pleased. I ordered a Caesar salad and got leaves (literally) drizzled with a some dressing. Oh, and a giant mushy crouton- $15 bucks later I was full off of my leaves, and it was time to get what we came for!!!! \n\nOHHHHHH the disappointment. Maybe b/c we arent in NYC, maybe b/c this place is just crazy packed, or maybe b/c our server hated us. But what we got tasted like Swiss Miss packet hot chocolate cooled down in the fridge and dolloped with less than yummy whipped cream (cool whip?). \n\nTo say the least. Total debbie downer. Will I try it out while in NYC next time. I might. Because I know it has to be better than this. It just has to. My fat kid dreams cannot be crushed!'

S'I made a good decision had not yelped this before stopping in, I myself felt drawn to the Frozen Hot Chocolate while vacationing in Vegas a week ago.\n\nWhat an amazing concept, using hot cocoa mix as the "chocolate" instead of a syrup! I think its not as overpoweringly sweet using this concoction, and has just the right thickness, where you aren\'t sitting there suffering from loss of air trying to force the drink through the straw. \n\nLarge (for two) $16. I\'m thinking that the small would have done just fine, cause the large was well large, ha! \n\nI\'m a fan!'

S"We came here for lunch on Halloween day and there was only 5 minutes wait. All servers dressed up in costumes which I thought was very fun. We came mainly for the Frozen hot Chocolate, but decided on having lunch here as well.\n\nWe asked about the Pizza and our server said it was only enough for one person, so we also ordered a side of Garlic Bread. When we got our food, turned out to be the portion was enough to feed both of us. It was the Meatball Pizza and was delicious.  The Garlic Bread was just ok.\n\nNow, the Frozen Hot Chocolate comes in two sizes. For one and for sharing. We decided on the basic Frozen Hot Chocolate for one. The size of this drink was hugeeeeeee. I don't think I can ever drink the whole thing by myself and if I ever did, please slap me in the face. \n\nThat frozen hot chocolate was everything what people said. It was sweet, delicious, refreshing, gave me brain freeze, and I want more. I think, a trip to Serendipity 3 will be a must do for us for our future Vegas trips.

S'There is a lot of hype about their famous "Frozen Hot Chocolate." I ordered one because I just had to see what everyone was raving about. For about $12 after tax, I got a Starbucks grande-sized drink that appeared to be Frozen Hot Chocolate. When I took the first sip, I thought, kind of watery but it was not bad. My friends got the original and mint ones which were a lot thicker in  consistency and stronger in taste. I liked the mint one personally because it had little bits of mint that tasted like Andes mints. What makes these drinks different was the consistency of the drink, it had a more creamy taste rather than a Starbucks Frappuchino. I think the original was a little bit too sweet for my personal tastebuds. I think this drink is made for two people because it comes with two straws in each drink. One person can easily down the thing though. I do not think I would buy another one because it is kind of expensive for what it really is. A creamier chocolate milkshake.'

S'i was recently in las vegas for a conference for work. to kill some time before picking up the bf from the airport, my friend, her bf and i went to serendipity. it was probably about 7PM and only one party ahead of us waiting to be seated. we probably waited about 10 or 15 minutes and were sat inside. the inside decor is pink and gaudy. \n\ni only ordered the small frozzzen mochaccino. it was still a pretty big size if i were to get it as a dessert after eating. it was like a melted watery chocolate shake that you eat with a spoon. \n\nmy friend and her bf ordered the large frozzzen strawberry surpreme which was like a melted watery nesquick shake. it was a little bit bigger than the small size. i probably could have just shared the small size with another person. \n\nthey also ordered nachos with chicken added. it came with small dishes of salsa, sour cream and guacamole on the side. it was bit oily from the cheese and i think they used sharp cheddar because it was kind of bitter. \n\noverall, i think serendipity is overrated. i mean, it was okay, but its not a place where im dying to go back. maybe once just to say i went and tried the "frozen hot chocolate".'

It has proschiutto, arugula, spicy mayo, tomato, and buffalo mozzarela.

Well.. after trying it out first hand, I conclude that it was a total waste of my $12 (for just a to go cup size)! It was simply a thick powdery super sweet cold chocolate drink! I rather have a glass of chocolate milk ):\n\nI later found out that this other place called sugar factory also has frozen hot chocolate on their menu- for just $6-7. If any of my friends insist on trying it in the future, I would take them to this place instead. I wonder what big of a diff it will be.'

We were told that it would be a 30-40 minute wait, and when I did a double-take at all the empty tables behind me, the hostess said, "Those tables are being held for reservations."

S'Came here with 8 girls last weekend as part of a bachelorette party.  Unfortunately, turned out to be a very disappointing meal for me.  \n\nFirst of all, $11 for the "frozen hot chocolate"?? This can\'t be the same treat that the whole world raves about.  It was too icy, WAY too sweet, and tasted like a concoction I could whip up at home with some instant nestle powder.  I was not alone on this boat, many of my fellow diners agreed with me.  Even my friend from New York who regularly frequents the original manhattan serendipity- she thought the one served here was of inferior quality.  If you must order one of these tourist trap treats, I suggest the Amaretto flavor- much better tasting than the regular one.  \n\nBreakfast did not fare much better.  I wanted to order the egg white shrimp frittata-  but the waitress told me they ran out (really? at 10:30am??)  Instead, I ordered the fried eggs benedict (Corn Meal Crusted Fried Poached Eggs, Classic Hollandaise & Canadian Bacon atop Sausage Gravy & House Made Biscuit). When the dish arrived, it certainly looked pretty enough!  But alas, it did not taste as good as it looked.  I hoped that despite the egg being fried, the yolk would still be relatively runny.  My hopes were quickly dashed. The lack of creamy yolkiness took all the fun away from eating an eggs benedict :( The hollandaise sauce was too sparse and the biscuit was too dry and tough to cut- not flaky at all.  All in all, probably the worst eggs benedict I\'ve had.  \n\nThe other girls ordered the staple brunch dishes (french toast, chicken&waffles, omelet).  Portions were massive and it made for great photo-ops.  But in the end, nobody raved about their food, and we took back ~70% of it in doggie bags.  On a brighter note, our leftovers were put to good use later that evening as a drunken midnight snack.  I guess beer-goggles can apply to tastebuds as well!'

S'Went here for desert only, and Serendipity 3 did not disappoint. \n\nI walked in thinking I wanted a cookies and cream milkshake, which they did have on the menu. However, the ice cream sundaes looked so good, I had to reconsider my choice. \n\nI ended up ordering the deep-friend Oreo extravaganza, which included cookies and cream ice cream, whip cream, and that marshmelo sauce. My server wisely advised me to order the marshmello sauce on the side, because it is way to sweet in any sort of normal dose. The deep-friend Oreos were awesome, the seemed to be breaded in corn flakes. Seriously, it put the OC Fair to shame, and that is not easy to do in the deep frying department. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the "Can\'t Say No" sundae, which included humble pie (peanut butter on a graham cracker crust), peanut butter ice cream, coffee ice cream, and a banana. It was freaking awesome, and that humble pie stuff was great. \n\nI must say, the decor was a bit weird. It had sort of an Alice In Wonderland thing going on, including a clock painted on the wall the showed three-o-clock at all times. I suppose that is because this is Serendipity "3," but I am such a stickler about time that it annoyed me. They also had like signs on the wall from old gas stations and stuff. It just didn\'t match, and it didn\'t work. Maybe there was a point to it all, but if there was I missed it. \n\nSo, this place is close to five stars (for desert anyway, we didn\'t order any other food) but not quite there. I would go back though.'

S"If I was reviewing ONLY the Frozen Hot Chocolate (Fro Ho), then it would be a 5 Star review all the way!  However, since I am doing the whole Serendipity experience I have to knock off a few stars.  \n\nThis location sits in front of Caesar's right off the Strip.  It is not very big inside and there are limited seats (inside and out) and that translates to long lines.  It is cute - all white with pink and orange accents.  However, the way around the lines are just heading to the window outside the sit down restaurant to get your sweet treats.  This too can result in a long line, but it moves!  \n\nMy hubby and I ordered a couple 16oz Fro Ho's and found a ledge to sit to drink them, since the limited outside seating was all full!  It is a huge outside space and they fill less than half of it with seating, which results in people plunking themselves everywhere!?  Duh, put out more seats!  You have the room!!!  Anyways, we sampled out Fro Hos and enjoyed the people watching opportunity that this section of Caesar's gives us.  \n\nThe Fro Ho tasted exactly how you would expect - an icy version of the winter treat.  It was yummy and just as good in the sun on a ledge as it would be inside - maybe not as pretty, but I loved it all the same.  \n\nIt is a fun stop.  Next time I am getting the donut that is as big as my head.  It is calling to me!!!"

The bowl of chili is DELICIOUS! it has bits of filet mignon and is satisfying. The frrrozen hot chocolate is pretty good, but THICK. It's good, but overpriced. \n\nOnto the place itself... It is cute and spacious, but there isn't much to look at... But you're in Vegas and there's always people that make up for that.\n\n**Updated portion:\nAfter the LAST visit, I don't think I will be going back.

Went here recently back to back days on my last trip to Vegas.  What can I say other than it was sooo good.  Everything we ordered was good but the shining stars were definitely the frrrozen hot chocolate and the french toast sticks.  I would highly recommend just being patient and waiting out the 45-60 minute wait.  Use that time wisely to do some jumping jacks and push-ups to burn a few calories you'll definitely pack on while enjoying what they have to offer."

About 1 1/2 hours in, we checked in and were seated due to a party that didn't show up (so check in often!).\n\nThe place was busy and it was hard to get a hold of our waitress, though she was very nice. When ready to pay, we were confused and thought we had to go up to the counter, I saw a few people do this, but she did come by and get the check from me, I'm not sure if people were just going up because the wait was so long/ it was so hard to get your waiter's attention or what.\n\nExpensive? yes. But the sundaes my friends got were huge, with entire slices of Red Velvet cake, cheesecake, or giant cookies depending on which one they got. I got the sliders, and they looked tiny, but they were filling. The bacon aoili was yummy! My bf's triple decker grilled cheese was an overload, but he was in heaven, and it came with a little bowl of tomato soup with cute little goldfish crackers floating in it!\n\nThe oreo frozen hot chocolate was yummy, but get the regular (the smallest size) FOR TWO.

S"Visited recently for a late night dessert while in Vegas for a work conference.  As a result of a bad stand by wait during a previous visit, I made sure to make a reservation weeks ahead of time and it sure paid off.  My friend and I arrived at 9:50pm for our 10:00pm Saturday night reservation and were immediately seated.  Our waitress arrived at our table promptly and had large glasses of ice water to us almost immediately!  Knowing what we wanted ahead of time...frozen hot chocolates...we ordered quickly.  The waitress forewarned us that the kitchen was a bit backed up, but managed to get us our orders within 5 minutes.  Well, mostly...she accidentally picked up a mint frozen hot chocolate instead of the traditional one that I ordered.  Quickly resolved, I had a new, fresh frozen hot chocolate in front of me!  As usual, it was amazing and perfect for a hot evening in Las Vegas!  This is one of those Vegas must-do's!!"

Geez maybe I\'m unfairly reviewing this place since it is now considered a chain & I\'m not a huge fan of "chains".  I was so not impressed WHAT SO EVER.  Our waitress was nice but slow.  The food was not good.  Not good is an understatement.  My Flintstone size ribs were dry and lacked any flavor of BBQ sauce.  I had to ask for an additional side and that wasn\'t good either.  I would have preferred Heinz in a cup.  I barely touched anything, but the cole slaw.  The beef in the sliders were overcooked and dry.  The frozen hot chocolate was enormous.  I took one sip but that\'s about all I could tolerate.  \n\nNo restroom in the restaurant.  You have to walk outside and down a ways to the left under the stairs where you will find restrooms that are equivalent to a rest stop bathroom.\n\nPositive:  Cool menu and cool space.

S"Fail. After having walked by this place a bunch of times as a local, a buddy and I decided to give it a try. We were looking for a quick bite and regular food at regular prices. Prices are a bit high but it is the Strip so we ducked in to see it.\n\nWe were seated quickly but the music was so loud inside we couldn't hear each other or the waiter (and no we are not old and we regularly attend rock concerts). So we moved outside. Same thing. Terribly loud. You had to shout at each other. We didn't even make it to the food. Had a $4 iced tea and left. Didn't enjoy the atmosphere at all.

It looks nothing like the original.  It's all very fancy and modern now.  We stopped by at 4pm on a weekday and there were no free tables cause somebody booked a party here.   We ended up sitting at the bar.  \n\nI ordered the frozen hot chocolate, which is exactly what it sounds like.  It's huuuge and needs to be shared.  It's like an icy chocolate milkshake that has that hot cocoa taste and it's covered with a mound of whipped cream.  A couple of sips and I was done.  Whew.  \n\nI don't see how this is different from any other  ice cream shoppe anywhere else.  \n\nPros: if you have to have ice cream on the Strip, this is a good choice\n\nCons: expensive, the ice cream is just ice cream, lots of noisy kids, no charm"

However, the long waits and slow service was not worth it.\n\nCame back a second time to again enjoy their frozen hot chocolate, and sat at the bar. We got the oreo, and it was okay this time.. It came almost right away which we found kind of odd, and it seems like someone's old order they returned and they left it in the fridge. It was kind of melty and we got our frozen hot chocolate with a pool of hot chocolate on the plate that it came with.. so messy and dirty. $12 for one but if you share with some theres a $4 extra charge..

Line takes 20 minutes more or less, pray to the desert gods that you're in the shade if it's the summer. I absolutely loved their double frozen hot chocolate, I loved it the first, second, and third time. The flavor and refreshing chills never disappoints. I decided to spice it up and get the green tea frozen hot chocolate, because, you know, we asian and we like our green tea. Boy was I wrong, it was like drinking a watered-down, non-fat, anorexic-slim milk, with matcha powder. It was literally a diet milk.

S'I\'m kind of an idiot and went here for the dessert and then I didn\'t have any. Soooo yeah. \n\nWe showed up to wait for a table (mind you there are about 45 tables open outside and we were okay with eating outside). The hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait anyway (why? I don\'t know). So we\'re sitting outside by the door and near a fan. We\'ve been waiting for a while and I get up to go check to see if they called our name. Apparently the hostess did (inside? she knew we were outside) and since we weren\'t there crossed us off the list and moved us to the bottom. She was also very rude to us about it. \n\nWhatever, no big deal. I\'ll take your attitude, just seat me, I\'m starving. \n\nFinally after waiting for a few minutes (this time I stood near their hostess station so they knew I was in existence) and my party was seated. Naturally it was uncomfortably hot but we were seated in probably the worst area. It was so hot, I was disgustingly (and embarrassingly) taking ice out of my drink and letting it melt on my legs. :hangs head in shame:\n\nOur waiter was very nice and made up for the hostess. I wanted lunch and asked for something "small." Apparently their tuna salad was the smallest salad but this thing was massive!!! It was very good, but I\'m still cautious about getting fish in the middle of the desert. \n\nAnyway, no dessert. I think if I was back in Vegas and wasty face, I\'d make a stop to try the dessert.

S"This place will likely never recieve my business again. Seating and hostesses are critical to the first impression of an establishment and this place was subpar in that aspect. Our experience started off on the wrong foot when we were seated outside in a corner in the blazing sun when there was plenty of seating inside and outside that weren't in the sun. I asked if we can move to a table at least out of the sub and the hostess told us the rest of the tables were for bigger parties than 2.....shortly after we sat down the hostess brought parties of 2 to those tables that I asked about. I was disgusted at this type of treatment and after my meal I went to ask her.  She said that those tables had been reserved. I can definitely understand that but why didn't she say that in the beginning rather than say it's for bigger parties? She also had an aloof attitude that I didn't appreciate. I asked to speak to the manager and she offered to take 20% off the bill AFTER I had to ask for it some sort of rectification. I've always been impressed with the establishments on the Caesars property so I was surprised I was treated that way here. \n\nAs for the food it was decent but really overpriced.

I had the vegan pho which was super flavorful and full of veggies and noodles. I also ordered the tofu nuggets because I wanted to be able to say that I ordered tofu nuggets with a straight face. They were actually pretty good, as was the sauce they came with. My friend ordered crab rangoon. It was the same old crab rangoon you get anywhere, but they charged $8 for it. Seriously?\n\nThe service was very hurried, and the waiter never actually took a drink order. He just brought us all water and that was that; we hadn't even realized until he left with the food order. Hurried service also meant the food came quickly, and you can't complain about that. No asking for dessert either. The check just came when he decided to bring it. So it goes.\n\nAlso, for some reason that we couldn't figure out, there was house music playing in the background the whole time. It wasn't annoying. Just confusing.

S'The joys of Pho (pronounced "ph-uh") are fairly straightforward.  Take a tasty broth, add some expertly-sliced thin meat, scallions and rice noodles are offer the ingredients in a bowl.  Add some basil, bean sprouts and spicy peppers on the side (with an optional side of rooster sauce and other spicy, sweet and/or sour sauces).\n\nSimple enough, but get the right bowl of pho and your view of the world drastically improves.  Call it stomach psychiatry--a really tasty bowl of pho can directly stimulate serotonin levels in the brain (more serotonin = more happy).  \n\nBut all of that just speaks to the genius that is pho.  Here\'s why you should head to Pho Kim Long for your pho fix.  When I was there, I ordered the rare steak and brisket pho.  The beef broth was well-prepared and pretty rich.  Other reviewers seem to have complained about the quality of the broth, but during my lunch there it was spot on.  It was a very solid offering.  The side veggies were crisp and fresh and delicious.  \n\nAnd Pho Kim Long offers a well-stocked selection of sauces if you like to tinker with your food--making it spicier, sweeter, a dash of sour, etc.  It all made for the perfect pho lunch.  The other folks at my table had the beef vermicelli ("bun" in Vietnamese) and were very pleased, reporting that the bun was better than most.  All of which earns it about 3.5 stars (rounded up because of how popular the place seemed--gotta give some credence to the will of the people).\n\nGood enough that Pho Kim Long has become a standard in my list of Vietnamese places in town.  And the crowd there at lunch suggests that this place has become a go to lunch destination in Chinatown.  It has a big dining space and every table was packed when we were there.  That might explain why service was a little slow when we were there.  But, to the wait staff\'s credit, they didn\'t seem to mind when we stepped over to the cashier without a bill in order to settle up.  \n\nI haven\'t tried it late night, but the place is open 24 hrs so it might be worth a visit after a night out on the strip (put down the Jack in the Box, pick up the chopsticks).'

However, I think everyone else knows this too, so those days after clubbing when you're finally able to roll out of bed and your hunger finally outweighs your need to lay in bed and you think man I need some pho, best of luck to you on the wait situation. If you're lucky and it happens to be short, you are in luck! But I've seen the wait be up through 45 minutes before as well. Longest 45 minutes if you are already barely at the state of crawling out of bed. The restaurant is pretty big and has lots of tables and service is fast, it's just THAT many ppl want to get some. \n\nPHO: The broth is very well made, this is pretty much the defining difference between pho restaurants and pho kim long is near the top of the list. I don't like it when place don't rinse the starch off their noodles and makes the broth cloudy, none of that here. Good portions of noodle and meat, yes! Also, no crazy obvious msg taste, here we go baby! Path to recovering so you can go hard again!\n\nI used to take good pho for granted, but having experienced some bad ones lately, I really appreciate those that stay true to the craft! \n\nLOCATION: If you are staying around the wynn/venetian side of the strip, you just go right across spring mountain a few blocks and you are in chinatown, not too far of a drive to get some tasty vietnamese beef broth in your system."

And 24 hours?!!\n\nComing off of the best pho I've ever had at Vietnamese Central in Westminster, Orange County, CA...  this place was flavorful, but not AMAZING.\n\n[=THE 411=]\nI'm assuming if you're a visitor, you'll come here either for cheap lunch or for a late-night, post-clubbing chow-down.  I think this place will do it for either one -- as long as you're craving pho.\n\n[=SERVICE/WAIT=]\nWe came in with a group of 10 for a late-ish lunch.  Parking wasn't too hard, even though the lot was pretty full.  They seemed pretty busy too, but we only had to wait 5 minutes or so to get seated, so that was surprising.  Waters came out quickly, so OK on the service.\n\n[=THE FOOD: PHO=]\nPho is definitely the thing to get -- cheapest for the most food.  I had one of the pho with three cuts of meat.  It was a little salty and I wish they had more noodles, but no other complaints.  I wish they had given more bean sprouts and basil for our large group, but I'm sure we could have asked and they would have gladly obliged.\n\n[=VERDICT=]\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here next time I visit Vegas unless I was specifically craving pho -- but chances are, I'll get something better/more expensive, or cheaper/closer.  If you're only visiting Vegas for a few days...  why get something you can get anywhere else?"

S"Honestly, I LOVE eating here. I go here very often. But the last HANDFUL of times make me NOT want to come back EVER. On Mother's day I went there with 10 friends at night and, mind you, the servers and all were great.. when we went to pay for our checks, they let us split our check! They ALWAYS let us split our checks EVERYTIME I GO. \n\nThe first time they didn't split my check was a couple months ago, it was my friend and her boyfriend, myself, and my boyfriend. We wanted to split the check in two. The man wouldn't let us do it! He said they never do which is an outright LIE. He kept walking around in his register area not listening to me so I got mad, but my friend paid for us all. \n\nThe next time we went, it was myself and another two people, again, they let us split our checks.\n\nThe time after that, it was myself, and four other people, and again they WOULD NOT split our checks. SAME GUY. Wish I remembered his name.. He just told us to pay some amount on our cards and pay that way but that he wouldn't ever split our checks.\n\nPersonally, I love eating there, the servers are nice. But that ONE ASSHOLE at the register is so RUDE and refuses to even LISTEN to me when I try and speak calmly."

S"Fine stir-fry dishes can be found in this IT spot. I vaguely remember the pho, but people love them and they are served generously. \n \nItem #122: Chicken with seasonal greens is delicious plate of sliced tender chicken, brocolli, Chinese brocolli, baby bok choy, carrots, bean sprouts, and ginger in a salacious opaque sauce is almost perfect. Probably loaded with MSG...but delicious. The calamari is a guilty pleasure for me. It's greasy, heavy breaded and sprinkled with a fried I'm-not-sure-what-to-call-it, but it resembles hair dandruff on steroids. I will eat it anytime.\n\nParking is baffling and amusing. The lot is tight and small. I witnessed people yell at each other due to near collisions. Service is no-nonsense and apathetic. At the end of the day, they're not here to make friends and will probably throw you under the bus."

S"If you are looking for quality pho.... the kind that you can buy for $4.95 in NYC or only a tad more in LA.... this is NOT the place. I have been here several times... many in fact... and it merely became a late-night 'hangout' where men ogle women after they get out of a nightclub. It can be amusing to spectate once in a while but if you want to find a place for great food and avoid potential creepers, I would try elsewhere ;). \n\nSome of their rice dishes are pretty good once in a while and their calamari is hit or miss. I have friends who always order the calamari... The prices aren't over-the-top, but once again, I am a spoiled New Yorker who's used to the best Vietnamese food being extremely cheap and convenient. \n\nThe number one pro of this restaurant is the hours of operation. It's always nice to have an Asian restaurant to chill and eat at during all hours of the night ;)"

Especially when you are driving home that very morning from Vegas. \n\nOpen 24 hour's-1 Star \nGenerous Meat Portions in the Pho Dac Biet-1 Star \n\nThat's all i can give this place, because the broth here is so rich in MSG that its a joke. It was so salty that i barely drank the broth and just ate the noodle and meat. \n\nThe servers here gives off a negative vibe toward its customers. Though its probably family own it seems that the workers aren't interested in their work. \n\nCustomer Service/Food Quality both fail at this establishment: \n\nFind another place for your Hangover Remedy"

S"If the food does not make you sick, the customer service will!\n\nThis place is really a 1.5 stars for me, but I'm going to round up for these guys.  The hostess in the front desk was pretty cool, but not the rest of the staff.  Sadly that is about the only good thing I can say about this place.  Now on to the rest of the review.\n\nI visited this place because I was in the mood for some pho and happen noticed this place while driving by.  Dropped in and the first thing was the massive waiting line to be seated.  There were lots of people waiting outside too.  Waiting outside on a HOT summer day is not fun.  After 30 minutes of waiting, we were finally called and seated.  This is where everything started to go down hill from here.\n\nWe were seated and we knew what we wanted because we were looking over the menu while we were waiting, so we ordered a coconut drink, the regular pho bowl and spring rolls.  The server wrote that down on his notepad and just disappeared.  We waited for at least 30 minutes and not one single item we ordered arrive on our table.  We then started to notice people that were seated after us got their order and they were chomping away.  After about 40 minutes of wait time I was wondering how long it takes to make just a simple coconut drink.  Are they sending a monkey to climb up a coconut tree to retrieve the coconut or something?\n\nWe finally saw our waiter and asked him to check on our order and he returned back to us to let us know they were out of spring rolls, therefore they did not make the pho or the coconut drink.  The thing was, the server said it in a way where it was OUR fault that we ordered something they ran out of and that's why they couldn't complete our order.  I just don't understand how when they ran out of one item that is no way related to the other items on the order could prevent the entire order to be made.  It's not like it was a combo or something.  I understand if I ordered a #1 at Mc Donalds and they tell me they ran out of fries, then I would order something else, not make me wait 30 minutes and tell me they are out of fries therefore they can't make the burger.  I really wanted to tell the server to GTFO here cause there is no way you run out of spring rolls in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  It's the second most popular dish right after pho.  Its like a chinese restaurant running out of rice.  This is a MEGA CATASTROPHIC EPIC FAIL.  \n\nThe food finally arrived after putting in our order the second time, but the coconut drink did not.  I was about to take off my shoes and go out back to get the coconut down from the tree myself.  The pho dish was OK to average at best!  After waiting 45 minutes of waiting I have the right to have high expectations.  The size of the bowl was really small.  I wonder if they gave us the kids size bowl by mistake.  I can't believe they charge $8 for this kid size bowl of pho.  I can get a bowl of pho that is twice the size for $5-$6 at home!  The coconut drink finally arrived about halfway into finishing our food.  The drink was meh.  \n\nIn the end, the food was average, but the customer service just left a really bitter taste in my mind.  People think it is a good thing that they are open 24 hours.  No guys, that is not a good thing, they are there to FAIL 24 hrs a day.  Would you like to go to a place that fails 8-10 hrs a day or 24 hrs?  I personally would rather go to a place that FAILS less."

Service was a bit slow compared to the many employees that night. I felt like most of them tried really hard to avoid eye contact with their customers...I didn't like the Bun Bo Hue because it tasted kind of weird. Sort of like pho, but spicy... Their portions weren't big either. My bf and my dad had to order an additional rice plate to share and usually they don't need to when it comes to pho. Maybe it was a hit or miss. It was kind of pricey too. Perhaps, we should try another place for pho when we're in town."

Almost like fried mozzarella.  My date had the pho and it tastes like my homemade broth.  For the Vietnamese restaurant, this one is pretty good.

Meaning, my family who grew up in Vietnam loves this place and so should you. \n\nPho is really good - broth is tasty and pretty addicting and not too salty but definitely full of MSG which explains the minus 1 star\nEggrolls are my personal go to item because I don't really like pho\n\nWaiting wise, it gets crowded during lunch and around..1AM-2AM?

When it was our turn, she just led us to the table and threw the menu on the table and left. Waited some time before a server came to take order and haha... another one who's annoyed by overwhelmed traffic.\n\nWe ordered fried tofu, spring rolls, whole coconut and two Bun Bo Hue; food came out fairly quickly but the quality wasn't as good as I expected it, well, when I compare to what we usually have here in the South Bay. I did like the fried tofu and coconut and that's why I'm keeping two stars here; however, the spring rolls was not fresh and the soup base for their Bun Bo Hue was so bland, it didn't have pork blood or beef/brisket in them either. \n\nWill not recommended until you're dying of hunger."

It was 7 am and this seemed to be the only place open in Chinatown so it was my perfect opportunity to finally try it.\n\nI was craving pho the last couple weeks which naturally guided me to select from the pho section of their extensive menu. I went with a #13 which was a beef combination pho and included meatballs, tendon, rare beef and brisket. The broth and noodles were right on point with its flavor and wasn't too bland or strong like at some other spots. The meats were good, except for the meatballs which had a weird taste to it. \n\nThis is a fairly large restaurant and probably the biggest pho place I've seen. Do people have parties here like they do at Chinese restaurants? Let's have a pho-king party!

So far, this has been the best Asian restaurant we've had in Chinatown, so we just automatically come here, now. \n\nThe wait is ALWAYS a pain in the ass, because it's always freakin' packed!! But, the wait's worth it. They redecorated since the last time we've been, and it looks like a mini jungle near the windows. lol It's always very loud in this place. \n\nService is typical of any busy Asian restaurant - you don't have a specific waiter : you ask anyone who will come to you for service. haha \n\nTheir food is delish. We had the sweet and sour soup, which had pineapples, beansprouts, catfish, and more. Yum. Their hainam chicken is okay, but it was a big portion. Their stir fried veggies were cooked just right. We also had something called  ca kho, which is catfish simmered in some kind of sauce... I don't know what in the world that sauce is made of, but it's addicting! Mix it with the rice and nom away. \n\nTheir pho is pretty good too, although I forgot how much it was. A lot of places attempt to make pho but never succeed. Luckily, this place does, and does it well. \n\nWhat I didn't know is that they charge each person for rice. At first, I was kind of miffed by that, as many place don't, but I realized that this is very reasonable, considering that many people don't finish the whole thing and waste a ton of it. \n\nWait out the line and try it!

S'Thank you "random cosmopolitan valet guy" for leading us right to best place for pho in Vegas.  Pho Kim Long hits the spot big time. Broth is tasty and service is really swift. My friends ordered different kinds of Pho and were not disappointed.  I personally went with the non-Pho route and ordered the Bun Bo Hue like all my fellow yelpers and it was spectacular.  (Mind you, i\'m not really partial to having a beef foot in my soup ... yeah, not really my style - but, it was the bomb. seriously, it was so good.) I\'ll be back.  I\'ll definitely be back.  BTW, the eggs rolls were good too.  \n\nSide note:  After you\'ve inhaled your grub  - you\'ll notice that there aren\'t any cabbies waiting outside to take your semi-sober self back to your hotel on the strip, so you\'ll have to take a chance at hailing one right on Spring Mountain.  It feels kinda shady at 2a, but you\'ll be fine if you have a few folks with you. \n\nSide note 2: be careful of saying "pho-kim-long" out loud if front of your three year old.

S'I love this place and I go here A LOT but that doesn\'t mean it is good, it is just comforting I suppose. I don\'t generally go late night or when I am drunk. Mostly lunch dates.\nService: I have been coming here since 2008ish and it has slowly just gotten worse over time. The wait staff is always rushing you. I think it is ridiculous to be asked 4 times by the same time if you are ready to order within a 7 minute span. It makes you feel like "Hey we don\'t want to satisfy you, we just want your money and for you to leave." We got our food and halfway through our meal a lady came over and gave us our check, said thank you, and asked us are we done? My friend and I were both literally sitting with utensils in hand and half eaten plates of food. "No... We aren\'t" I commented to my friend under my breath about how rude that was and she must\'ve heard because she came back and took the check away. It has been feeling this rushed since they underwent their makeover a while ago.\nFood: the pho is delicious, all the rice noodle/egg roll combination dishes are amazing. I mean I would walk on hot coals if their egg rolls were waiting for me on the other side. I have never had an issue with any food being bad. But I love their calamari and sometimes it is amazing and sometimes, well, it is just deep fried squid.\nCheck it out and decide for yourself.\nThe egg rolls are the only thing that stop me from giving it 3 stars.'

My parents wanted to come here specifically for it, so we ordered 3 bowls. The sauce they gave with it is SO yummy, better than the broth itself, unfortunately. This time, the bun bo hue lacked flavor. I was hoping for pork blood inside because that's usually how I see it served but nada. Disappointment this time around.\n\nPho Tai Sac ($7.75): Not bad! I ordered the small bowl and after 10-15 minutes of eating, my bowl looked like it had not been touched. It was like a magical bowl of never ending noodles! I didn't know how to stop it. I ate a little less than half and had to pass it onto my sister & dad to help me finish. Good amount of meat slices.\n\n*BE AWARE OF EXTRA TIPPING!!

S'The real deal...it\'s my "Lotus of Siam" of Vietnamese food...(at least here in Vegas...)\n\nMy husband, the chef, eats here weekly with the boys from the kitchen and a few chef buddies from around town...They always sit in Ben\'s section - he makes great recommendations when Chef is feeling like having more than #11 (pho) and some orange chicken (hey it\'s usually 2am so he\'s entitled to be a creature of habit of sorts...).  Since I work more normal hours, I rarely meet him -- but when I can, it\'s always a treat...\n\nLast night, since I had the day off today, we went -- and it was yummy!  \n\nBen was there and in addition to my usual can\'t miss dish (the salt and pepper calamari -- with jalapeno, green onions and crispy garlic), he suggested the Vietnamese salad with chicken -- it was brilliant!  Crispy cabbage, crunchy crushed peanuts, fried shallot rings, crispy garlic , tender pulled chicken, cilantro and a miso/ginger dressing that was perfect -- I love salads that are balanced in flavor, texture and acidity... he said they make it with duck, beef, shrimp, calamari, just about every protein they have in house...  \n\nThen he suggested we try the lamb -- I know...lamb at Pho?  It was phenomenal -- tender lamb chops with Chinese spices, grilled to medium rare...over a cold, crispy romaine salad -- again another great dressing -- not sure about ingredients in this one though...\n\nThen he told us they had venison...but by the time he got back with sauces it was 86d, so he ordered the beef for us.  Out came a large, smoking hot black river rock -- a plate of sliced beef, with chunks of butter and limes.   He melted the butter on the stone, then put the beef on it and we cooked it to our degree of doneness -- squeeze of lime -- a dip in the sauce, and it was tender and delicious and took seconds.   That rock wasn\'t going to cool down anytime soon...\n\nLast night, the spring rolls weren\'t that great, and the dumplings were tough -- so I\'ll avoid them next time.  Hey, I can\'t eat everything...so it\'s fine with me -- but I\'m still looking for Vegas\' best potstickers... \n\nBut for a chef to come, and when he\'s in the mood, for the experience to be totally different -- that many think is just same ol, same ol --  and for us to be treated like royalty (uh, we\'re not Asian...), is a real treat.  \n\nI\'ve been in a few times by myself for a quick lunch -- and they always remember me.  It\'s nice because I\'m not the kind of regular that I\'d love to be...'

S"So, my question is, what is Pho?  We see the signs hanging all over town, so how come I don't know what it is?  I think I have had it before, my husband tells me I have, but funny thing is, I wouldn't know if I did.\n\nI googled it and it seems I have had it, and more than once.  I didn't know the official name of what I was eating, just knew it was good. So now that I know what it is, I am on a quest to find the best and thought I could start here.\n\nAccording to a few reviews, this place is supposed to have some really good Pho.  I picked out a charboiled pork with egg and thought it would be a little bit spicy, but it wasn't.  It was hot and hit the spot on this late night.  Is it one of the best, I cannot say that, but it's just the beginning of a tasty journey."

It seems that if you order pho it comes out super fast because our friend ordered it and it came out in no time. I ordered Bun Bo Hue because it's one of my favorite dish as I don't like pho too much. WOW it was SUPER DELICIOUS! I usually don't get the sauce on the side like that and it made the soup really flavorful. It was a good size portion too and it has to be one of the best ones I've eaten. Although it may not be the cheapest but it was worth the money. My bf ordered the Singapore noodles and he really liked it! You can definitely taste and smell the curry spices in the noodles. I would come back to this place again for the Bun Bo Hue!"

S"Of all the Vegas restaurants headed by big-name chefs, Bobby Flay's Mesa probably held my lowest expectations.  Imagine my surprise, then, when it turned out to be my favorite meal of the trip.  \n\nThe corn chowder tasted like a bowl of pure sunshine, with just a touch of kick.  Also sampled was the blue corn cake with BBQ duck, which was like a southwestern interpretation of a pulled pork sandwich.  And while I love the purity of enjoying a tamale or a chile relleno at a tiny storefront or, even better, in the kitchen of a Mexican momma, the way Mesa elevates both dishes to fine dining neither cheapens or lessens these dishes.  \n\nOnly mild oddity was it seemed the majority of wines offered were French.  For some reason I assumed, considering the cuisine, to see a lot more Californian, Spanish, and Argentinean wines.  I did, however, have a sip of George's margarita.  Easily one of the best I've ever tasted."

S"This place never disappoints.  We started with fried squash blossoms that included red and yellow pepper sauces.  I had a cioppino with green chile sauce.  Wow, that was an amazing dish.  I usually shy away from cioppino because I'm not that big on tomato broth.  Green chile sauce makes it more than worthwhile.  My wife had a grilled chicken that had mango salsa and 12 spices (that's one more than you get at KFC).  Dessert was another great creation.  We split an order of the churros that came with a chocolate sauce that was flavored with star anise.  The waiter recommended it.  It often pays to listen to what dishes they recommend.\n\nAnother standout dish I had on a past visit was the pork tenderloin.  Absolutely amazing chile sauces with that one, also.  The strawberry shortcake that time was good, but not nearly as good as the churros.\n\nAlso, I have to give kudos to the service.  The staff was more than friendly throughout the evening.\n\nThis restaurant is a must, whether in Vegas or New York (though Vegas is much easier to get into than NYC)."

S'Gorgeous place of course. Very modern, bright and open, it\'s Caesar\'s Palace and they really wanted Bobby Flay; as tasteful and modern as Southwestern can git.\n\nWe went for lunch late on a Wed afternoon during a conference break and it was surprisingly slow there at 1:45. Breadbasket is delicious of course with those Jalapeno corn muffins, beautiful works of art at half yellow and blue corn swirl. We started by splitting the Blue Corn pancake BBQ Duck which was smoky with low heat and just yummy.\nFor our entrees we had a Lamb chopped salad and a Chili Releno that looked even better than it tasted, and it tasted fantastic. They manage to get a very light batter on the chili and then somehow seal it with the cheese inside so that it \'blows up", really impressive. The lamb was a perfect medium rare and the salad good sized for what are generally small portions here. Presentation all Bobby Flay.\n\nService from Michael was attentive, even relaxed considering there wasn\'t a dozen people in the restaurant, so come late our usual plan. They are definitely pushing drinks like most Vegas restaurants and you can see the disappointment in their faces when we order our usual lunch time iced tea and a water with lemon, no ice.\n\nHighly recommended and not crazy pricey, but still a $75 lunch with one appetizer and two entrees and one ice tea. Do it.'

S'I had high hopes when I stopped by Mesa Grill for lunch in October of \'09.  One would think that, given Bobby Flay\'s status as a Iron Chef, his propensity to whore himself out for Food Network top billing, and his smattering of establishments around the country that the food would be appropriately awesome.  I wouldn\'t expect it to be, for example, Joel Robuchon or Thomas Keller good---but at least as good as any other celebrity chef restuarant in Vegas.\n\nMesa Grill, on the day I happened to dine there, was the worst restaurant I\'d ever been to.  Easily.  I\'m talking McDonald\'s bad.  Perhaps even Subway bad.  \n\nThe service was slow and forgetful.  There was plenty of staff to go around so nobody was over-committed with tables.  They were just slow.  And forgetful.  And slow.  I ordered a chicken and blackbean quesadilla for an appetizer.  I followed that with the spicy pork sandwich.\n\nBoth dishes were bland.  Very, very boring and bland.  There was no spice.  There was little flavor.  The presentation was tired, the flavors were muted, and the texture of all the food reminded me of fish cooked under a heat-lamp and then microwaved.  My pork sandwich was cooked RARE and served COLD.  Really?  I can understand, perhaps, serving the meat at room temperature but a cold, raw, pork sandwich shouldn\'t be served to dogs, much less paying guests.\n\nThe decor is nice.  The location is nice.  The drinks are good.  The menu has a nice selection---which serves to trick you into thinking the food is actually tasty, hot, and worth money.  If this restaurant is in any way representative of the Bobby Flay line of establishments then our dear Iron Chef needs to spend more time being a chef and less time playing one on TV.  \n\nI would never recommend anyone go here.  Trust the food blogs, critics, and professionals who have given Mesa Grill consistently low marks over the course of its Vegas run---it truly is a terrible restaurant and an embarassment to "spicy" and "flavorful" cuisine everywhere.  Shame on you Bobby Flay.  Shame.'

S"Bobby Flay certainly has grilling down. I've been here three times (the last two within two months apart). As each visit progressed, it gradually became a better dining experience. My first time there, I was just not enthusiastic about it as I am now. But with my most recent experience, Mesa Grill definitely deserves 5 stars!\n\nThe first time, I had their coffee rubbed filet mignon. It sounds more interesting than it tastes. As in, it was kind of bland. I know you're not supposed to ask for sauce with your steak (and trust me- I don't like sauce with my steak) but I was seriously contemplating taking my steak back to my hotel room so I may secretly add A1 sauce. \n\nThe second time around, I ordered the snapper. My opinion of the place went up significantly. Not because of the snapper, but because I had a bite out of my sister's rib eye!!! BOY OH BOY! It was like melted gold on my tongue. This piece of cow melted in my mouth and slithered its own way all the way down my tummy. There it lay so happily until digestion took its course and brought it out to reality. \n\nMy last experience here was just short of two nights ago. I went with my Human Garbage Disposal. He was very excited to try Mesa Grill because he is a fan of Bobby Flay and I was enthusing about the infamous melt in your mouth rib eye. I ordered another fish- the grouper. Our food arrived, I looked at the huge rib-eye enviously and looked at my petite grouper. Whatever right? As soon as I took a bite out of the grouper, I pretty much dismissed all theatrics of the rib-eye and deemed the grouper the best dish I could ask for from Mesa Grill. So flavorful, so colorful, so tasty! And maybe it was my imagination, but the rib eye that I stole a bite from did not melt in my mouth. Dear grouper fish, never become extinct. And may Bobby Flay's minion chefs continue cooking you. \n\nThe end."

I have to say that it was a excellent choice tho!\n\nWe were running late to our reservation because our show ran a little later than we thought, and so we called to inform the restaurant we would be a little late - the lady was so nice and said that it's fine.  We get seated immediately when we arrive and are greeted very promptly with the BEST server (although I forgot her name because I went here a few months ago).  Everyone in our table ordered a beverage, but one guy decided not to, but she gave him half a glass of wine just because she didn't want him to feel left out. =]  \n\nI ordered the mahi mahi but it was ok... BUT, my bf's pork tenderloin was so good it made up for it!  Our server recommended it to be cooked medium for the best outcome, and it really was perfect!  The portions are pretty generous and definitely satisfying.  After our delicious meal, we decided to splurge and order dessert.  We were all full so we decided to share one dessert among the 4 of us. We decided that our server was pretty on-point with everything we ordered, so we decided to have her choose our dessert.  She recommended the coconut cake (which none of us really looked at) but it was the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh just to let you know they have jalapeno pop bread that they only have during brunch(so when we came here for lunch they didn't have it :() .\n\nThey have some similarities of food for brunch and lunch but we tried to avoid getting the same thing as brunch. \nWe had the Smoked chicken + black  bean quesadilla, shrimp tamales, Swordfish, and cornmeal crusted chile relleno. \nI thought the smoked chicken quesadilla was pretty tasty. I think they grilled/fried the skin so it be crispy when you eat it and obviously goes well w/ avocado. I love the Garlic Creme Fraiche. \nShrimp tamales: I liked it more the first time I had it but it was still really tasty. I thought it was a bit oversalted this time around but the shrimp was very good. I love the corns that are in it. \nCornmeal crusted chile rellano- eh. Maybe it would be better w/ some kind of meat but it was a bit lackluster for me. Could use some more spice as well. It was pretty cool to see a whole pepper covered in cornmeal but it was very dry due to it as well. Barely got any eggplant in there as well. \nSwordfish: I thought this was absolutely delicious. The swordfish was cooked in perfection and had a GREAT sauce to go along w/ it. I love the cream green chile rice. It was kinda like risotto but less mushy. It was just an overall very tasty and seasoned dish. \n\nI would recommend it to anybody. It's a bit on the heavier side but I think it's definitely worth a try. Love their bread :3"

After 10-15 minutes it started to get hard and dry.  Ok, that didnt sound right but it did.  Someone asked for tabasco sauce but they don't have any.  So they waiter brought out a homemade green sauce in replace of the tabasco.  It was fantastic!  I wanted to drink it.  It had the right amount of heat and enhanced my burger.   I felt the food deserved 4 stars but the service is what brought this review down to 3 stars.  The waiter wasn't very friendly.  He was probably hung over or hated his job.  For this type of restaurant with lots of press and hype I would think Bobby Flay would know how important service needs to be.  I will probably go back and try a different dish next time."

Is that blood dripping down my chin?\n\nI love Bobby Flay.  I have naughty, naughty dreams about the man that simply are not discussed in any detail outside my therapist\'s office.  Though my suggestion to The Bud that we consider making reservations there came off as totally casual, devil-may-care, my insides were screaming, "Please, if you love me, you will take me here!"\n\nWe only visited once this trip, but it was our third visit to the restaurant, and it was completely perfect in every way.  Atmosphere is fiery, service attentive, food is creative, and unique.  The white peach margarita was delicious and boozy.  The sweet potato soup was beautifully spiced.  The NY strip steak was perfectly medium rare.  And huge.  And served with a house made steak sauce that made me whimper a little.

So the decour is unique and he uses quite interesting colors but besides all of that kind of stuff, the food simply tastes amazing.  I mean even a simple Rib eye steak isn't just a good piece of meat.  It's an AMAZINGLY beautiful juicy work of art.  The tiger shrimp tamale and the wild mushroom quesadilla were just delicious.  Even the Mojito was awsome!\n\nI don't know what to say.  Bobby Flay deserves all the fan fare he gets.  He truly is an Iron Chef and his restaurant Mesa Gril is a place I'd love to go back to time and again.  I am sooo looking forward to trying Bolo, his New York restaurant whenever I get around to visiting the east coast again.\n\nJust know it's a bit expensive ($117 for dinner for 2) and the wait can be long so make reservations and be on time."

Our server was not bad but for some reason he had this weird energy and we didn't feel completely relaxed around him.  \n\nWe wanted to have their fruit juice but we're told they were all out.  All three juices (orange, grapefruit and carrot/orange)!  That surprised me because as a restaurant by a very well known chef at this very popular hotel, I would expect them to have a decent inventory skill.  We're very disappointed and ordered cactus pear iced tea instead.  It wasn't bad but nothing special about it. \n\nThe warm bread basket had three different baked goodies.  The first one on top was almost like a soft chewy cookie with raisins and nuts.  I don't think it goes with any of their main dishes but as itself, it was very yummy and I wished I had that one after my lunch as a dessert.  I can't describe the second mini soft pretzel-ish thingy but I can say they were good.  And the bottom in the basket was a cornbread which was made with half yellow and half blue corn and had some corn, bell peppers and some chili pepper slices in it.  It was delicious.  Our waiter just dropped the basket off on our table but at the end of our brunch, I saw a different waiter at other table was explaining what they were to his guests.  The ladies at our next table were chatting pretty loud so I couldn't hear a thing but wished our waiter did the same for us. \n\nI ordered their honey glazed salmon and my sister ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich.  My salmon was very thick but cooked perfectly and was very moist.  The honey glaze and the black bean sauce were delicious and my sister loved her sandwich too.  I had a bite and the pork was very tender and although we both agreed the fries which came with the sandwich were little salty side, but still tasty.  Was it cheap?  No, but whew, we didn't think we've wasted our money...\n\nI don't think we can afford their dinner anytime soon after spending too much money in Vegas this time but we were very pleased with their brunch."

S'I expected the price to be a lot more expensive, but found it surprisingly reasonable. I ordered the "Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon" &it was amazing! I was a little hesitant when I read the description.. they incorporate a spicy black bean sauce, but I found the balance to be well executed! I have so much more respect for salmon!'

S"I really can not say enough about Mesa Grill.  I wish I could eat here all the time.  I am so glad that I don't live in Vegas because I would go broke.  Not from gambling but from going to the Mesa Grill and eating everything on the menu multiple times.  We have heard good things about the restaurant so I took my husband here for his birthday.  The staff was amazing!  Our waiter was the best ever, he was nice and helpful and knowledgeable.  My husband had the Lamb Chops, they were very good.  I however ordered the most fabulous thing on the menu, the Pork Tenderloin.  It was spicy and the sauces were perfect, the meat juicy and cooked just right.  The tamale that came with my dish was a sweet potato.  I don't like sweet potato so they gave me a jalapeno one instead, and this was also great.  For dessert we shared a banana cream pie.  It was delicious as well, sweet but not too sweet.  The restaurant itself is large and you can somewhat watch the kitchen.  The grilling area is right out front for people to watch and as we left we heard the cooks asking someone watching them if they had any questions.  I thought that was great that they encouraged people to ask about what they were doing.  This entire experience was one of the best dining experiences I have had.  The pork tenderloin was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Not kidding."

S'Ah, five-star service, literally impeccable from the time you enter the restaurant until you leave, but the food is truly disappointing for the price, three stars at best.  I will give them five stars for the cocktails as well.\n\nThe food is the problem.  Four of us sat down for dinner.  My wife and I shared the "porterhouse" lamb chops, which came with a tamale.  We also ordered a chile relleno side.  The lamb chops were excellent, though a tad overcooked.  We had ordered medium-rare and were told that the chops would be red to red-purple inside.  They arrived a strong pink inside.  \n\nThe tamale was absolutely awful, stuffed with what seemed like Jack in the Box taco filling.  No one at the table cared for the tamale.  My wife and I tried the chile relleno.  I don\'t know what Bobby Flay knows about Southwestern or Mexican food, but the relleno arrived coated in an extra crunchy cornmeal batter.  The filling, which is why the chile is called a relleno, was undiscernable.\n\nOne companion ordered the filet mignon and ordered it medium.  It arrived medium-rare.  Maybe the cooks had mixed up the lamb chops with the filet order.  At any rate, the filet was returned to the kitchen for additional cooking.  The filet was outstanding, rubbed with a chipotle mixture, which gave the meat a smoky, spicy kick.\n\nThe final person of our foursome ordered a New York steak.  He was disappointed.  The only seasoning he could taste was salt, which he said was a little too heavily applied.  The meat was good, but that\'s what it was: heavily salted meat.\n\nThey shared herbed mashed potatoes, which we all tasted.  They were good, but nothing that would merit a better review.\n\nAll in all, the meal was good, but, I believe, for the money I would go someplace else.'

S"Let me start out by apologizing to Bobby Flay...so sorry. When my wife and I watch him cook on TV I always make fun of him using the same ingredients, ie cilantro, corn, mango salsa, etc...but, man does it work in person. We went during restaurant week but I won't bore you with the same review that other people already wrote. All I will say is that I was very, very pleasantly surprised on how good the food was. If ever at Caesars, then I will stop in for a delicious meal. BTW, the hostess was a bit snooty and tried sticking us at a booty table at first..."

S'Make Reservations for this place...If you don\'t, you will not be able to eat there (possibly at the bar if you\'re lucky).\n\nOur party of 7 went here for lunch. This place is not for the simple eaters.  If you aren\'t keen on trying something "different" or fusion of flavors or consider yourself fairly picky, then I would NOT eat here. \n\nI loved this place but some of my friends had a hard time with the menu as they don\'t appreciate good "different" food. If you\'re one of those then you\'re better off eating somewhere else!\n\nI had the corn shrimp tamale for appetizer drizzled with cilantro sauce (HIT THE SPOT.) IT was the BEST tamale I have ever had. My lunch was really good too but Id prob wouldn\'t order it again. I had the shrimp tacos, but I just ate them right off the skewers instead of wrapping them up in a blando tortilla (However, it did look home-made).  The home made salsas were an added bonus--wish I had some chips with that.  NOt sure why but my DIET pepsi (THANKS BOBBY FOR PEPSI products NOT COKE!!) was really good too--they must change the oxy tanks daily b/c it was the freshest pepsi i had in Vegas..i know..so random.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come here again and try other things. It is a bit pricey but I think its worth it b/c everything is SO fresh and cooked to perfection. Also, the service was outstanding. My sister told the waiter she couldnt eat dairy and he made sure to consult with the cook about her order. Couldn\'t have asked for a better lunch. Bobby ROCKs.'

S"We came here for dinner and were looking for something light to eat since we'd be meeting up with other friends later.  So we ordered two appetizers (the shrimp with garlic tamale and the rough cut tuna nacho), an entree (chile relleno), and a dessert (the banana creme pie).  These along with the bread basket was more than enough food for the three of us.  \nI can't tell you which was was my favorite, b/c really they were all good.  The garlic corn tamale hit just the right notes of sweet and savory and paired really well with the shrimp.  Def a must order.  I think I like the tuna more though, b/c generally I like my seafood raw.  My husband loved the chile relleno, and said that it was the best he's ever had.  He's eaten a ton of this stuff, so that's saying a lot.  The dessert was a good finisher...it was more like a deconstructed banana cream pie.  i thought that the candied hazelnut at the bottom really added to the dish.  \nI will be returning for brunch, since this is what Flay is really known for.  Can't wait."

S"I chose Mesa Grill after hearing Delmonico's is way overrated. Having eaten at the Bahamas location, and despite my aversion to Bobby Flay, I decided to give the Las Vegas MG a try.\n\n1. Awkward seating arrangement: We had a table of six, and it seemed like they had to put a table in the middle of a seating arrangement in order to fit us. We would've been perfectly fine if the wait staff wasn't continually bumping into my friends' chairs and then asking them to move out the way. That was uncool.\n\n2. Food was great. Everyone was really happy with their dishes. Amongst the six of us, we ordered the duck, ribeye and pork tenderloins. For sides, pesto mashed potatoes, baby carrots, tiger shrimp tamale and sauteed spinach. We had to wait a bit for a couple of the sides because the waitress forgot them, but it wasn't too bad. Food came out hot and tasty.\n\n3. Desserts were okay. I enjoyed my spicy chocolate creme brulee in the Bahamas more than the profiteroles I had. I thought they were really stingy with the iced cream which put me off a bit.\n\n4. Service was alright. Our waitress was chatty and came around a few times to check on us.\n\nMesa Grill Las Vegas didn't disappoint and I wouldn't be against visiting BF's other restaurants."

The first time I had it, it was so spicy I nearly couldn't eat it. I ordered it again this recent time and the heat was much more mild and the sandwich was pretty good. The cactus pear margarita is amazing, the white peach margarita is a little too sweet for my taste. \n\nOverall the ambiance is OK, but the food is amazing. I will say if you have dietary restrictions like I do, check the menu before you come. They only serve brunch Saturday and Sunday afternoons, not their normal lunch menu."

The wait wasn't terrible, the ambiance was warm, earthy and classy, very warm and comfortable. Went here for a special occasion, was seated with a reservation around 7 I believe within a reasonable few minutes. The cheddar or asiago cranberry bread in the assorted basket was yummy. The cactus something sweet unsweetened tea was amazing! The portions were more than generous. Try the sweet potato tamale and the chipotle pork tenderloin or the bascobel blackberry sauce grilled lamb. It made it exciting to try the burger bar a few months later when we visited NYC."

S"I had really been looking forward to eating here and scheduled my birthday lunch here while we were in Vegas.\n\nThere were 4 of us and we were seated immediately for our 1pm reservation. I ordered a white peach margarita and it was delicious ($13). My husband got the margarita with the agave nectar in it and liked that as well ($16). I'd been studying the online menu for weeks and knew already that I was going to order the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash. \n\nThe bread was really nice. I liked the cheddar and jalapeno best. It was spicy and yummy.\n\nWe ordered the queso fundido to start. It was several cheeses (including goat!) with peppers and blue corn chips. YUMOLA!!!! This was delicious.\n\nOur entrees arrived and I cut into my poached egg and was unhappy to see the white was runny and gooey. That's not how a poached egg is supposed to be. A solid white, runny yolk is the norm. The hash was delicious, but some of the sweet potatoes were crunchy, not tender. They were clearly undercooked. My husband got the pork tenderloin sandwich and we were surprised to see it came cold.  I took a bit and did not like it, but he said he did. Our 2 other companions enjoyed their Mesa Burgers.\n\nI sent my dish back and waited about 15 minutes for a new one. A manager brought over the new one and apologized for the mistake. I cut into my poached egg once again and the white was solid - yay!  But the yolk was completely solid too - boo!  Why can't this place cook a poached egg correctly? I can do it and I can't cook worth shite.  So, the manager came back to ask how it was and I told him I've been waiting months to come here and I'm pretty unhappy with the way this dish came out. So he said he was sorry once again and said he would remove it from the bill. Nice, but not what I wanted for my birthday lunch.\n\nEven though it was my birthday, they didn't offer us a gratis dessert. We looked at the menu and nothing really stood out, so we passed.  Disappointed overall, but parts of the meal were good enough for 3 stars."

S'WOW! What amazing food. The service was great and I was overfed with appetizers and brunch. The design is interesting and I discovered I only took photos of the bathroom, so think about that. lol. The complimentary breads were a nice touch and didn\'t taste like anything I had had before. I could care less about it being a Bobby Flay restaurant though, because that just jerks up the price to an unreasonable amount just for him being a celebrity... I mean, when your server first walks up to you and asks "You know who Bobby Flay is, right?" without saying hello, you need to sort your priorities...'

Strawberry Fields cocktail is delicious - tastes like fresh strawberries! Churros are also delicious and sophisticated with the star anise. \n\nSo honestly, I ended up going back a few nights later and I enjoyed the experience more.

S"After thinking about the good food from Mesa Grill for a month, I finally had a chance to go back to Las Vegas.  Needless to say, I opted for Mesa Grill again.  \n\nAgain, we were there for lunch so we can avoid the crowd and the wait.  We were promptly seated and our waiter, John, even offered to snap a few pictures inside the kitchen for us.  That was really nice of him since we were very interested in what is like behind the scenes.\n\nMy wife ordered the Honey Glazed Salmon again and it was even better than the first time.  I went for the prix fixe menu items and ordered the corn tamale and the pork tenderloin sandwich.   The corn tamale is still my favor and the pork tenderloin sandwich is very unique. \n\nTips:\n- For lunch, there's always the prix fixe menu.  You'll get to choose one of five appetizers and one of three entrees, plus dessert!  This will save you a bit of money.\n\n- The pork tenderloin sandwich is meant to be a room temperature sandwich, so if you like hot sandwiches, this is NOT what you want to order."

S'I don\'t really like BBQ.  I don\'t really like Southwest Style cooking.  I actually don\'t really like Bobby Flay or his cocky attitude either...\n\n...I liked Mesa Grill.\n\nWhile the location may not do it for some, my buddy and I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat while betting on the NFL games as it is in direct view of the Sportsbook at Caesars.  \n\nImmediately on being seated we were brought a complimentary bread basket with absolutely amazing jalapeno corn bread, biscuits, and a cheesy garlic bread that was out of this world.  I ordered a diet coke which was repeatedly refilled and we were not charged for despite sitting around BSing for nearly 2 hours while my buddy drank two beers that he noted were well priced.\n\nFor meals, my buddy ordered the Mesa Burger with Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onion, and Horseradish Mustard on a House Roll with Southwest fries.....the burger was enormous and per his word "awesome."  I opted for the Thick Cut Ahi Tuna Nachos with spicy aoili and blue corn tortillas.  While it appears this amazing dish has since been removed from the menu, I still contest it is one of the 3 best forms of raw tuna I\'ve yet to consume.  The portion was large and at only $11 my total bill with tip for 2 baskets of bread, nachos, soda, and 2 hours of hanging out was a mere $15.\n\nWhile this isn\'t "5 star" dining, it is one heck of a deal for high quality food in a nice \'bar\' setting when in Vegas.  In retrospect I wish I\'d have ordered dessert, but with dinner reserves at Simon later that evening I didn\'t want to overindulge.....y\'know, after eating the Paris buffet for breakfast.'

S'The famous Mesa Grill, owned by chef Bobby Flay (one of my favorite TV personality chefs) is located inside Caesars Palace. Make a reservation its hard to get it (we did).\n\nThe decor was kind of lounge like, not what I would call romantic but not bar and grill like. Just a relaxed upscale lounge, a bit of noise from a large room with a good number of people. We were seated to close to other couples and a large party, its my only real knock on the place, give us a few more inches between tables (its literally about 8 inches).\n\nThe wait staff was great, different waiters for different function. The main waiter knew the menu, was able to make recommendations and assisted us with our selections very well. I would say the service was some of the best I have had. \n\nWe had the usual appetizer and meal, I had the classic Mesa Ribeye and my WIfe had Lamb chops. Bother were cooked expertly and seasoned well. I would honestly say that hers was better than mine, but beef can be boring when sat next to well prepared lamb (according to my taste).\n\nThe appetizer, drinks, and dessert was a reasonable bill for a very nice meal. \n\nI would say overall one of the better meals I have had at a high end place, so often you pay piles of cash for pretense and marketing. At Mesa you get great service, good food, and ample amounts. It is really a bargain.'

S"Caveat - This review is for brunch only.  We were pleased to see that we gained some comps at Ceasar's and headed over to Mesa Grill for some free brunch.  The decor is modern and bright with primary colors decorating the bar and more subtle hues throughout the dining room.  Our waitress was prompt in every way.  She brought us the delicious bread basket, which included a piece of Mesa Grill's cinammon roll, some jalapeno biscuits, and yellow and blue cornbread muffins.  \n\nMy hubby and I ordered the same dish - the spicy scrambled eggs.  The fluffy eggs came mixed with jalapenos, goat cheese, and green onions, and were topped with apricot glazed ham.  They were served with two wonderful buttermilk biscuits.  The goat cheese and jalapenos combined for the perfect explosion of flavor without either flavor overwhelming the dish.  I am not usually a ham person, but this ham was top notch.  I think we will add Mesa Grill's brunch to our regular stops when we are in LV.  It was really that good."

The tuna was excellent and I could have used a double portion.  The Goat Cheese Queso was very good, but how could you go wrong with melted cheese.\n\nFor dinner, the coffee rubbed filet and the green chili ciopino with crispy squash blossom and mashed potatoes for sides.  The cioppino was very fresh and flavorful.  Getting the shrimp peeled was a little messy,  but worth the added flavor.  My only complaint was that after eating most of the seafood from the dish the green chili base was not quite as visually appealing.  The filet was tender and the coffee rub wasn't overpowering.  Unfortunately, the filet wasn't hot and the plate was cold so the mushrooms and ancho chili sauce didn't come across very well.  The sqaush blossoms where incredibly light and the mashed potatoes were creamy.  \n\nI'll definitely be back, but I would probably opt for lunch instead of dinner."

I only had ONE glass of wine!\n\nLast trip to Vegas we regretted not stopping in at Mr. Flay's so we were sure to pop in on our first night, while wandering the city. Still full off a ridiculous meal at The Burger Bar we opted for appetizers and drinks at the bar only. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable about the food and I saw her whip a hot pink cocktail, something I have never seen.. I believe it was a cactus something or other... anyway we ordered some wine and 2 apps; Chicken Tacos and Goat Cheese Queso - WOW~ The food was so good, surely beyond my expectations! \n\nIn short, I can say we will absolutely hit up Mesa Grill each and every trip to Vegas!"

From the start, the service was great and the waitress had great recommendations and patience (everything sounded tasty). The bread basket contains a mixture of breads (one on the sweeter side, one more savory consisting of cheese and jalepeno, and a corn bread muffin). The veal chop (with bone) and wild rice tamale were excellent. Great flavors and perfectly cooked. The margarita that I had was tasty too. Overall fantastic experience. I'd love to give it 5, but I only upgrade when I've visited multiple times and can test the consistency."

You get a quick taste of a wine you chose and if you approve you're supposed to nod in approval which I almost pulled off. Trust me though, I don't think I would have scoffed and chosen another wine because the first wasn't to my satisfaction. \n\nThe table we chose seemed like the best for people watching and enough space between you and other tables.

Had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars, Mainly because the appetizers, salad, and sides are all 5 star but the entrees I've had are 4. I usually get a salad, app, and a side or two. I end up here on most of my Vegas trips and it is one of my favorite spots. You need reservations as it is always booked. I've snuck in and eaten at the bar a couple times but there is usually a wait for that.\nI LOVE the Sophie's salad and get it every time. For me it is the perfect salad, with baby romaine, garbanzos, kidneys, sharp white cheddar cubes, tiny toritlla pieces, kalamatas, cilantro, fresh chives and the dressing is a sweetish balsamic. Love the tuna nachos and the tamale side, but all the apps and sides are perfect. The specialty margaritas and mojoitos are ok but I like to get the beer."

S'Move out of the way Gordon Ramsey,  Bobby Flay is now in the palace.\n I was in love with the decor of the place and the atmosphere of when I stepped into this place.\n\nSpicy chicken with sweet potato hash: it was so good and the spicy level was on point. There were two big about one cup size of sweet potato hash with poached eggs on top. The entree presentation was amazing and I feel all presentation really brings out my appetite. I highly recommend this dish. \n\nPulled pork sandwich: The sandwich was made perfectly and had just the right amount of crunch from the bread. This meal came with seasoned fries and it was quite delicious \n\nSalmon Entree: The piece of salmon was just simply amazing. It had the right amount of sauce and seasoning that the fish just melts in your mouth. I chose to have it well done and it was just the perfect salmon. \n\nAlso, for starters they provided free bread and it was not just cheap white bread. It was home made muffins, mini corn muffins, and different type of bread. This place really does set a high standard because food presentation and quality. \n\nI was fortunate to try this place for free but with the prices it is a pricy place to eat. For vegas, I think its definitely a place to try especially since it from one of the chefs I enjoy watching on the food channel.'

Yes, their complimentary bread was that good - the cornbread, the scones... everything in that basket - and they give free refills.\n\nThe waitress was sweet and friendly. For brunch, she recommended the raw tuna nachos (aka tuna tartar) dish which was delicious, though a bit pricey. Their sea bass was good, but my favorite was the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. It was like an eggs benedict, minus the muffin, plus spicy chicken and hash. It's nothing you'd find at your typical Mexican breakfast joint.\n\nJONASAPPROVED!"

Tender shrimp with sweet corn and the masa is a great combination! The duck appetizer is also awesome. It has a nice glaze that mixes well with the meaty duck! I like to order the salmon for my main course. It's cooked just right with light sauce. The black widow mojito was nice and strong! Bobby Flay knows good food!!"

It is a solid restaurant in Caesars where you don't have to get dressed up and they still treat you like you are the most important person in the restaurant.  I love how the service is top shelf.  We have been here 4 times and everytime the waiters deserved their tips.  Food is fantastic too!\n\nThis past trip we ate here for lunch.  They now have a $29 price fixed menu but we ordered off or the regular menu.  We started with the bbq duck blue corn pancake.  So awesome!  I could have ate this as my meal.  Next I had the chile relleno and my husband had poached eggs over pork and sweet potato hash.  Both were amazing.  No skimping on spice.  Everything was sooo good that I would have licked the plates.  We also had deserts.  The strawberry and gooseberry shortcake was recommended to us and we were glad to have tried it.  I though it was going to be lame but I was wrong.  It had the perfect amount of saltiness and tartness.  We also had the chocolate cornbread pudding.  Definitely not a favorite.  Really bizarre with a strange after taste.  Not bad but just not my thing.  We will definitely return on our next trip."

S"We had a 7:30 reservation, but they were a little backed up, so we sat in bar area and had a pre dinner cocktail. I ordered a Gimme A Lemonade, which was probably meant to be equal parts Green Tea Vodka and Lemonade, but was mostly vodka.  Nothing wrong with a strong drink, especially when shelling out 12 bucks for it, but I don't think it was worthy of being a featured cocktail. Should have gone with the Black Widow Mojito. \n\nWe were seated after 10 or 15 minutes.  There were 5 of us total, and we each ordered appetizers. The Sea Scallop Ceviche and the Blue Corn Pancake were standouts. The pancake was wrapped around tender BBQ duck  and drizzled with a Habanero-Chile Anise sauce. Amazing.  The Ceviche was so good I literally had to stop myself from slurrping it up like Campbell's Chicken Noodle. Sometimes sharing is no fun.  Also noteworthy was the Beet Salad. \n\nI ordered the New Mexican Spice Ruibbed Pork Tenderloin, with Bourbon Ancho Chile sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale. It was a huge portion, cooked to a perfect medium temp.  It was delicious, but I kept pilfering from my friend's Fire Roasted Veal Chop, so I could not finish.  I also tried the 16 Spice Duck, which was as good as the Blue Corn app.  \n\nMesa offers a fairly decent wine selection. The 2006 Ken Wright Abbot Claim Pinot Noir  recommended the wine steward worked with every entree.  Our service was very good, and the only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that I felt that the dessert menu left something to be desired.   After dinner we headed straight to Payard for dessert."

The biggest problem with the restaurant is that it is totally open to the smoke filled casino.  You can\'t really appreciate a good wine or a good cut of steak when you can only smell and taste smoke. \n\nMesa Grill is "just okay" and there are many better dining experiences on the strip.'

S"While I was sitting outside La Salsa waiting for Mr. WTF to get back with the show tickets, I browsed Yelp on my phone, and discovered that I didn't need to settle for mediocre chain mexican food, I could go next door to Caesar's and try Mesa. Bobby Flay, eh, names don't impress me, but good food and good reviews do.\n\nWe went in without reservations just before 5pm. The place was pretty empty, yet the hostess said it would be a 25 minute wait. We couldn't wait - had to eat and get over to TI for the Cirque show. So we opted to eat at the bar.\n\nHubby had the Mango + Spice crusted Tuna steak. I tried a bite - it was okay, but couldn't hold a candle to my meal. I got the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. Gotta give this dish 5 stars - this was probably the best pork I've had in my life. It was spicy but not over the top, full of flavor, juicy, and the sweet tamale it was served with was a perfect companion to offset the heat. I think they should rename it Perfection on a Plate. Or Porkfection...no, wait, that doesn't sound so good. Anyway, if you go here, ORDER THE PORK.\n\nWe did not receive a bread basket full of goodies, so I'm knocking off a star. The bartender was super nice and she made a killer Lemon Drop. It was pretty pricy for what you get, so I'm not sure we'll go back. There are so many restaurants in Vegas to choose from, and I haven't even scratched the surface. But the pork tenderloin will remain a good memory."

S'We went here with good friends last weekend. We laughed when we were sat because 5:15 was the latest we could get a table reservation until 10:00 and for a while we were the only ones. I didn\'t have a drink- one friend had the house margarita and didn\'t say anything about it, and another had a bloody mary which she raved about during and after the meal. The bread basket was excellent- good variety and all very tasty. \n\nFor main courses I was the only one who didn\'t have a 5 star meal. Husband had the chicken which was great, and came with very creamy chive mashed potatoes. One friend got the special which was short ribs which he liked a lot, and his fiance got the lamb chops. This seriously was enough meat for 4 people. A very good amount of food. \n\nI got the duck and it was probably three stars. My first few bites were quite gamey, but after that died down I realized that the spice crust on the outside of the duck was VERY cumin heavy. I don\'t like cumin, and  as the description of the dish is "southwestern spiced duck" I really didn\'t think it would be full of cumin. No one else\'s spice-rubbed, southwestern dishes had cumin at all. Very odd.  Also, the tamale which was supposed to have both goat cheese, which I love, and thyme butter, tasted like neither and was a bit dry. However, the flavor problem I had is not the restaurants fault except for description, so I can\'t really fault them for that. Also everyone else\'s food was so good that I just picked something not good for me.\n\nThe service was very good- I drink at least 1-2 liters of water at a meal and they kept up! When we left at 6:15 I couldn\'t believe what we saw: crowded restaurant, crowded waiting area, people eating at the lounge-area with plates on their laps. It was very crazy! Make sure to get a reservation early, order anything but the duck and you\'ll be fine!'

S'Overall entrees were good. Expected more of an experience as a whole from this restaurant though. Entrees 4 stars, experience 3 stars. \n\nComplimentary bread (1 star): Very DRY. The only one in there that was okay was the corn muffin, and that still wasn\'t even that fresh. Other than that the jalopeno cheese and walnut bread were super dry. Scared me at first cause I thought I chose a bad restaurant just from how the bread was. Good thing the rest of the meal turned out better. \n\nGrilled Chicken (5 stars): Very moist and flavorful. Mashed potatoes were great too. \n\nLobster Out of the Shell (4 stars): Lobster itself was bomb. The hominy cakes underneath it, meh could have done without them on my plate all together. Very dense and not very flavorful. Lobster and sauce on the other hand was so good, but really, those cakes were just horrible! Try changing them to mashed potatoes or something.\n\nCame for my birthday but they don\'t do anything special for you!! )= They will only put a candle in whatever dessert you order. But come on with the money you spend here you can\'t bring out something small that\'s complimentary? It just makes it feel more like a celebration when they do that. The desserts didn\'t sound that great either. Probably wouldn\'t choose this for a special occasion dinner because of that.\n\nSERVICE (3.5 stars):\nOur waiter was nice, hard to find at times, and just really busy with all the other tables he was helping. Took long to get things we requested, or he\'d forget and we had to remind him. \n\nI don\'t know if I\'ll be back here. The entrees were pretty good, well half of the lobster dish was good. Maybe I\'ll try appetizers more. But the overall experience was just bleh. And that bread...aye...make fresher bread! Or better bread if it was "fresh", bad first impression right when you sit down.'

S'If you like Tex-Mex/southwestern food, come here. It didn\'t blow me away, but that\'s because the style of food isn\'t my favorite.\n\nThey have a great selection of wine, which is a plus. You\'ll be hard pressed to find a bottle under $50 though, so beware.\n\nFor appetizers, we tried the tuna nachos, which were REALLY GOOD, and the goat cheese "queso fundido," which was EH. The queso didn\'t even taste like goat cheese and it was really oily and reminiscent of what happens when I microwave cheese at home with nachos.\n\nFor my entree, I went with their only vegetarian option--the chile relleno. It was good, but, at the end of the day, it was cornmeal-encrusted chile stuffed with cheese for $25. I guess what I\'m saying is this place is really pricey for what you get.\n\nThe ambiance is nice, but the windows look right out into the sports book betting area, so it\'s not easy to forget you\'re in Vegas with a bunch of weirdos.'

The atmosphere is nice, we went for lunch and it had a somewhat upscale feel to the place- very southwestern. I liked the comfortable dining chairs as well. \n\nThe service is where they lose a star! My husband waited far too long for a refill on his soda, I would have loved to order one of their famous margaritas midway through our meal, and would have also liked to have another piece of their delicious asiago bread. I love bread and I can now consider myself a connoisseur after trying so many different types and this asiago bread at Mesa Grill is amazing! We waited a super long time for our entrees, but after our meal he was quick to pick up the payment. Hmph! I tipped generously regardless. It was pretty busy in the restaurant and I think they could have been understaffed, there is a possibility that our poor service wasn't entirely the waiter's fault. The bottom line is that we'll be back on a night when we are feeling patient. We'll be sure to order everything we want straight away in case they get too swamped and are unable to check on us."

S'My friend and I first came to Monta via the public transportation bus and I do not regret waiting in the cold for 20 minutes and another 20 minutes at the restaurant for a table. I was soooooo relieved that Monta did not disappoint as I was also feeling a bit guilty for making my friend wait so long with me.\n\nTheir ramens are surprisingly good and the broth is flavorful, but not overly heavy. I ordered the tonkatsu broth with chashu and egg. The chashu was fork tender and I really appreciated that the yolk was not fully cooked. We also LOVED their Mentaiko bowl. The scallion, nori and touch of soy with the mentaiko was a match made in heaven. We went back on our last night in Vegas just to have it for the last time. \n\nMaking the trek to CT for Monta is so worthed it.

S'I think besides there\'s just one other ramen place to compare this to in Vegas and I haven\'t been to the other one yet. Came here for a late lunch and waited for about 10 mins as the place is small. Not going to compare this to places in LA since I\'ve had better. We ordered their fried rice with pork to start off and I\'d have to say it\'s definitely one of the best I\'ve had. Delicious and plenty of taste with this dish. I would have to order it again the next time I come.\n\nI ordered their Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen which means "pork bone and special shoyu base" ramen. Bowl size and portion was just perfect but I could\'ve easily ordered another set of ramen because I was that hungry that day but controlled myself. Soup based wise, it was kind of salty. Ramen though was perfect and the mix of chashu and egg was perfect since I usually have these at other ramen restaurants. \n\nIf you\'re in the mood for a good ramen place while you\'re in Vegas visiting, Monta Ramen is the place to check out. Though soup base can be a bit salty meaning it\'s probably because of too much MSG, taste wise of the noodles can\'t go wrong.'

No heavy signage just three folks sweatin in the polstering heat serving up what unbeknowst to me the best ramen showcasing. Found out that they have a location out in Las Vegas and decided to take some family members out there to give it a try.\n\nGot there 30 minutes before they opened. All of us hungover from the night before, only to see that there is a line about to form! We turned off our engines parked and snagged in front of the line. in 30 minutes I kid you not, at least 40 others joined. Luckily we were in front. \n\nStarving and dehydrated. We ordered. I settled for the Spicy Tonkotsu with the added green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. Added additionally the Nori + Nitamago. (dry seaweed and hard boiled egg, respectively) some corn, etc. My gal got the Tonkotsu BLACK. and whoa. I've never had a ramen to that degree ever in my 30 years of life. What is this? A smoky flavored broth? almost like a bbq tang? THIS was my highlight. It was unusual. It was weird. But in the most gnarliest of ways a ramen can be. I highly recommend that one. \n\nfyi: their Chasu Bowl is one of the better ones I have experienced in all of CA. Definitely worth it as a side dish. \n\nAs a matter of fact. I am visiting MONTA again for MDW (Memorial Day Weekend) I am coming back. It wouldn't be a successful Vegas trip without a visit to Monta. Seriously best Ramen in town."

We ordered some gyoza, a tonkatsu ramen and a shoyu ramen with egg and kimchi and some cold green tea.  I loved that they offered kimchi as a side (I can't have ramen without it!) even though it was 'kimuchi' on the menu.  We tried to get the extra pork but they were out.  The gyoza was too greasy but tasted good.  The tonkatsu ramen was delish!  The broth was white, cloudy, flavorful and less greasy than the shoyu and the noodles were thinner.  \nThe shoyu would be perfect for a  hangover.  The broth was darker, clearer, greasier, and saltier than the tonkatsu.  The ramens come with some green onions, and two pieces of tender pork. \nThe one thing that will keep me from going back is the temperature.  It is too hot in there, uncomfortably hot to really enjoy your meal especially if its a bowl of hot noodle soup."

It\'s like the most amazing thing I\'ve tasted in my entire freakin\' life.\n\nThe restaurant is quite a modest noodle house, very small, and they have a simple menu. It seems this kind of place would just be something to overlook. But NO. Their ramen is the best ramen I\'ve had.\n\nTheir broth is very rich and flavorful-- I\'ve been to ramen houses were they put a lot of salt and MSG in the broth for its lack of flavor--not here! Very rich. Noodles were not too hard nor too soft, just right in the middle.\n\nBut, the pork. Dear god the PORK\n\nNext time I go I will get extra chashu pork in my soup. Their pork literally just falls apart. I\'ve had soft pork before, but that was because I\'d get nothing but cuts of fat. Here, the meat is so tender and flavorful. I don\'t know what they do to it, but it\'s just downright amazing.\n\nEach one of us got a different bowl of ramen they offered, so we pretty much ordered the whole ramen menu. Each one is delicious. Their shoyu (soy sauce broth) is the original ramen, but it is very delicious. I enjoyed mine. Everything else was delicious as well.\n\nWe got a chashu bowl, and it was a simple bowl of chashu pork with rice over it, but it was just the best thing ever. The pork is so amazing, I could go on and on about it forever.\n\nTheir kimchi rice is also quite good! Not too spicy, but it does give a kick.\n\nYou really can\'t get anything "bad" or "ok" here; everything on the menu is amazing.\n\nOur group of friends were rock climbers and just got done climbing in Red Rocks for the day, so they were quite famished. We each ordered one bowl of ramen to ourselves, split a chashu pork bowl, one plate of gyoza, and one plate of kimchi fried rice, but they decided to get extra noodles. Nope, even famished rock climbers could barely finish what we got. And the price we paid for was so small for the generous helping of delicious food we got!\n\n5 stars for Monta!

I also ordered the kimchee fried rice as well for $6.95. \n\nAwesome execution for both I may say! I loved the texture of the noodle. It was soft, but it still had that firm bite that you take into it. That's how I like my ramen! It also hd a very tender slice of pork in it and a few other garnishes. I loved the Shoyu broth. I don't know what else to say! It wasn't salty or overpowering. It was just right. Not too salty, and the broth was very nice with the mixture of the meat in it. YAY BROTHINESS!\n\nKimchee fried rice is also of A+ quality. You can taste that nice grill taste to it. The cut o the kimchee was small and so were the small bits of egg which is how I like it too be. So YAY KIMCHEE FRIED RICE! \n\nIt's such a good price too so I felt like I got more than what I payed for. The service was awesome. The server was very cheery and upbeat and attentive which I loved.

And the flavors are more subtle than comparable broths I've had at other ramen places. Between Shoyu, Tonkatsu, and Miso, I consider Miso to be the tastiest of all of them.\n\nA couple of the reasons I still think Monta is awesome is their Togarashi (the red chili/pepper flakes on the table). I don't know how they make it or where they get it from, but no other togarashi is equal to that of Monta's. The blend of chili and other seasonings make it incredibly addicting and it has more spice (heat level) than others I've tried.\n\nAnd of course, they still hold true to carrying the freshest mentaiko in town. That mini mentaiko bowl is still my favorite app / side dish to a hot bowl of noodles."

S"After living in Japan for a year, I fell in love with ramen. I tried Pho and saimen as a substitute but it's NOT same. So when I heard about this place and read all the great reviews I couldn't wait to try it out. It definitely lives up to the hype!! \n\nWe got there at 12 on a Thursday and had to wait about 20-30 minutes. It was well worth the wait. We tried the goyza (I make this fresh at home and restaurants never beat my fresh ones but since it has such good reviews we tried it). If your a fan, definitely order them! So good!! I got the shoyu with boiled egg and cashu pork. The pork just melts in your mouth and the egg adds a nice texture to it. My Dad got the tonkastu with the cashu pork and loved that as well. Both types had amazing flavor, and we're just like the ones we fell in love with in Japan. \n\nIf I could give this place 6 stars I would!!!"

That's all we want, right?  \n\nShoyu Ramen, broth is much thinner than the Tonkatsu, but overall very good flavor for both entrees.  \n\nNot too thrilled over the mini Mentaiko that I thought was a must try. That side order was a doozy for us.  The ramen and gyoza was good enough to fill our lunch tummies....and then back to cali.  \n\nA great place to unwind the next morning after a long night being a fool at vegas strip and losing all your $. This place won't senselessly rob your wallet thinner than it already is.  Monta is kind of like a great cup of coffee the morning after a serious hang over.

S'Monta Ramen is a very tiny ramen restaurant, with apparently, the best ramen in town. Now that I have tried it a few times, I would say that it is probably true. With the wait however, it just is not worth it suddenly. Especially because I am from Southern California, there are a lot more ramen places that is just as good, if not better, than Monta Ramen. But for the Las Vegas area, this has been the best place to get my ramen fix. \n\nThe broth is super fresh and clean, not filled with like oils and things like that. The meat is super soft, which just melts in your mouth. The noodles are just how I like them, RAMEN noodles. \n\nOne bowl is enough to satisfy your hunger. \n\nNow to mention the wait - my family and I waited 50 minutes for ramen noodles. Factoring that in, it was not worth it. The waitress even let back people who "left" from the waiting list, and came back! That\'s not what a waiting list does, if a party leaves, they are off the list. The waitress would squeeze the party back in. That just lengthens the time I am waiting outside, especially since she did it for two 5 person parties before mine. \n\nThey have another Monta in Vegas now. Maybe that one is worth trying out.'

S"Gah! I wish I read the reviews more carefully so I would have known that you need to order the egg as an add on. Everyone raved about the egg, so I assumed it was included, but it's not! \n\nOh well, the ramen is still excellent. I had the tonkotsu, but since my mom ordered the tonkotsu shoyu and my grandma had the shoyu, I was able to sample 3 out of the 4 available soups. The soup has a clean flavor and isn't as kotteri (fatty) as what you find at Santouka (my fave ramen joint). The noodles are also very thin - like angel hair pasta. The chasiu is definitely a standout and meltingly tender. I also ordered a small fried rice and it was delicious and quite literally glistening.\n\nWe came here around 1:30 on Saturday afternoon and scored the last 3 seats at the counter. As others have mentioned it is a very small restaurant, but most people eat their noodles and go so turnover is fast. Definitely a great place to check out in Vegas for some authentic ramen!"

S'I\'ve been to some premium ramen joints in North America (Kintaro in Vancouver BC and Ippudo in NYC), so I definitely came in here with tempered expectations.  In addition to the traditional Japanese greeting by the staff as you come in and an open kitchen view of the chefs preparing the food, what struck me was the significant number of older Japanese business men who had come in with their suits folded against their shoulders on a blistering hot summer day to order a steaming bowl of noodles!  That clued me in this was perhaps the real deal.\n\nBeing my first time here, I went with the Tonkatsu ramen, which is ramen in pork broth stewed for several hours.  Bonus points for speed since I could have sworn my entree arrived within 2 minutes from the time I ordered.  Step one is tasting the broth:  the broth was at once unctuous and velvety smooth with intense flavors of marrow and porkified goodness without seeming overtly greasy/oily.  \n\nMoving onto the noodles, there should definitely be some spring when you chew on the noodles and these were definitely on par with the other places I\'ve visited with just the right amount of "al dente" and some umami embedded within the noodles themselves.  \n\nFinally there\'s the pork which is marinated in soy and cut paper thin with a thin lining of fat that has condensed into a perfect strip of pork belly perfection that is just right for the creamy broth it is bathed in since any more would cause the pork to loose it\'s distinct note.  The basic order also includes some bamboo shoots and kikurage (japanese seaweed) and it is a steal of a deal at 6.99, but I think what would have completed my experience was the addition of a few toppings such spring onions or mustard greens (for a few bucks more) to cut through the richness of the broth and add some additional textures and color.  There is also the option to add a hard-boiled egg or to get an extra serving of noodles if you\'re needing something more substantial.\n\nAll in all, definitely an authentic joint that measures up to the greats and will be somewhere I will frequent again and again especially during the colder months.'

S"I'm so glad my gf found this place on yelp for our final lunch at Vegas!\n\nWe ordered:\n- Tonkatsu Ramen: Absolutely wonderful smooth & milky pork-based broth. My favorite ramen is at shin sen gumi, and this bowl of ramen was very comparable, if not better. I also added toppings of a hard boiled egg and extra slices of pork - they gave 6 extra slices in addition to the two slices of pork that came with the bowl by default. I decided to avoid the kimchi because I didn't want the Korean toppings to dominate the Japanese broth. Noodles were cooked perfect, and you can order extra noodles for $1.50.\n- Shoyu Ramen: This is the darker one, I believe it's miso/soy based. My gf had this, and I tried the broth and it seemed equally as delicious.\n- Gyoza: It's like lightly grilled potstickers\n- Fried Rice: typical fried rice as expected - not something to die for, but good.\n- Kimchi Fried Rice: Pretty much exactly like the fried rice, except that it had a bit of the tangy flavor that the kimchi added\n- Pork bellow bowl: This was my favorite out of the fried rice bowls. Lightly cooked, tender, moist and juicy pork belly strips layered on top of white rice. Definitely worth getting along with the ramen.\n\nService was fantastic. Our group of 5 was sixth on the waitlist, but it moved pretty fast; we waited maybe about 20 or so minutes.\n\nCliff Notes: Tonkatsu Ramen with hardboiled egg and extra pork. Pork Belly bowl."

I've had ramen in LA (which is much better back home, and I'm not trying to sound snobby, rather it's just something I can compare to), and the food here is a decent.  \n\nTonkotsu Ramen $(7) and +$2 for egg- slightly above average-The broth is pretty good.  It comes w/ 2 pieces of meat (which is detailed on the menu).  The pork base is pretty thick, so if you are into thick broths this is the place to go.  \n\nMy gripe is they don't give you complimentary egg w/ the broth, so you gotta pay $2 extra (which is pretty steep if you ask me).  I mean, who eats ramen w/o egg?  It's almost required!!!  I also would've preferred my egg to be a little more runny.  Part of the egg yoke should seep into the soup (but still retain it's shape).  The egg I got was slightly hard when I got it.\n\nPork belly rice ($5.50 for a large, $3.50 for small) - Average.  The pork belly is extremely sweet!  I think they use too much sauce or something. The sauce almost over-powers the taste of the meat.  I'd pass on this next time.\n\nI was able to try my friends Takana fried rice and it's delicious.  10x better than the pork belly.\n\nTips:\n-Not good for groups.

The cooks are out in the open, similar to the sushi bar trend.  I've always had good service, although sometimes there is a little bit of a communication problem... my English isn't so good sometimes! ;-)  But that's never annoyed me because I love the soups here.\n\nSo far I have only tried the Tonkatsu. I ordered with extra pork, egg, and (I know, shame on me), butter.  you can also order extra noodles if you aren't a big broth eater.  The Tonkatsu is, I believe, a pork based broth.  Its thick (for a broth), a little salty (but not too salty), and very flavorful.  The pork was cut very thinly, and was so juicy, almost buttery.  I barely had to chew it.  Now, I am no expert in homemade noodles or anything, but the noodles for me were quite good... filling and tasty.  \n\nI can't wait to try the other two main ramen dishes they have.

I\'ve been about 7 times or so now, to both this location, as well as the one at the Plaza. \n\nPros:\n- You will never leave hungry. The portions are gargantuan. My father is very much the target demographic, a big, burly former farmer who likes his steak and potatoes measured in pounds, please. He\'s the only person I\'ve ever seen casually finish a meal at HH. Just back from a early morning hike at Red Rocks and ready to eat a bear? Eat here.\n- The food\'s delicious. I\'ve had the Chicken and Waffles a few times, the Chicken Pot Pie, some pancakes, and a few of the skillets, and have had nothing to complain about on any of them. The Chicken and Waffles are my favorite, because ooooohhh the skin on that chicken. Yum.\n- Mellow atmosphere, warm, friendly staff, and even when the place is super busy you never feel prodded or hurried to clear a table for the next person. You feel welcomed. I reaaaallly like that in a place like this, where you might be eating brunch for an hour. \n- Great hours for a family that insists on getting up at the crack of freakin\' dawn, and even when they are busy, they have a dedicated place for you to wait, not just a curb or a crowded entryway. \n- Price is darn good for the food quality and quantity. A bottomless cup of coffee is about the same price here and at Egg Works; which means I\'m not getting a fun surprise on my bill. That Chicken and Waffles is usually Lunch, Dinner, and lunch the next day for me. As long as you have a fridge at hand for your leftovers, Hash House is a great deal. \n\nCons:\n- You will never leave hungry. Holy balls there\'s a lot of food. If your mom raised you to clean your plate, or you are from Europe and have never heard of the Doggy Bag this place will give you pangs. \n- You can definitely eat yourself sick. Be aware of your tummyfeelings.\n- Both locations are Popular, and they can get busy. And I mean really busy. Saturday morning around brunch time? Call ahead for wait times, and be ready for a wait around an hour if you get unlucky. This is not the place to come for fast food, or a quick nip in and out. Settle in, bring a newspaper for the wait, and enjoy that bottomless cup of coffee. If you come here with expectations for other than a leisurely meal, you made a mistake.\n- I can\'t imagine this place would be good for very large groups. Anything more than maybe 6-8 people, and I feel like you\'d be waiting a while for food to come out and be fresh and hot, but I\'ve honestly never tried it.'

There was not enough chicken to go with the amount of eggs, biscuit, and mashed potatoes on the plate. The biscuit was dry. The chicken and spinach was good. The slice of pineapple and orange was probably the best thing on the plate. I had a Fresh Lemonade Mimosa to drink. It was ok.\n\nI guess I will have to come back to give them another try since I also bought a gift certificate from Sunny Dining Deals. I wanted to give 2 stars cause the service was great, but 4 out of 5 got sick so I couldn't do it."

Who thinks to put red skinned mashed potatoes, homemade biscuit, sage fried chicken, spinach, applewood smoked bacon, eggs, hollandaise and chili cream sauce together?? This place,....and thank goodness they did,.....original and amazing!!! Soooo worth the 20 minute wait!!! Highly recommended!!! Come to the freestanding location, I hear it's better than the one in the casino. Atmosphere here is fun, a little loud and very friendly :-)"

Went during the week so it wasn't crowded at all, however our waiter seemed less than enthusiastic.\nBut the food is fantastic for the price.  I had the classic chicken and waffles, but felt that the waffles were somewhat dry.

Not just huge, more like ginormous plates of breakfast food piled into pretty positions.  I had a blueberry pancake and it was larger than the plated it was served on. I wasn't the biggest fan of it. It was just a pancake wit blueberries. I also ordered a chicken and waffles, the chicken was great and the flavor everywhere else on the plate was good. \nIt was nearly impossible to finish a plate so the leftovers were good for another 2 meals. \nThe service was actually pretty decent, the staff is definitely young but I had a good breakfast experience here overall."

I ordered the swiss and mushroom burger and it lasted me for three meals. THREE! I ate it for lunch, leftovers for dinner, and then leftovers AGAIN for lunch today! The prices are very reasonable for such mountainous portions. I am nervous to return now learning about this insanity. We came on a whim and we will be returning. Our server was absolutely sweet and very attentive to our needs. I have heard some complaints about the place from friends after telling them where we had lunch, however we didn't have any problems. My burger was juicy and well cooked. The mushrooms and swiss did not disappoint. The bun was quite soft and fluffy. I am commenting on the bun because I usually toss those to the side as I devour the real meal. A lot of place's buns can be quite dry or plain. I can't wait to return and hopefully be blown away again! I will definitely be splitting my plate with a friend next time!"

We also got their chicken pot pie which was a massive heap of chunky vegetables in a biscuit hat- pretty good, their massive burger with mac+cheese just seemed OK."

This last visit was for my mother's birthday and I must say that I had no complaints and there was enough leftover for me to take with me for lunch at work.\n\nPros:\n  *  Generous portions for the hungry\n  *  Really good customer service (this is important to me)\n  *  Quality food and decently priced\n  *  They quoted me a 30 minute wait, but it was actually quicker than that.\n\nCons:\n  *  If you like embarrassing a birthday celebrant, don't bring them here.  No singing.\n  *  busy busy busy so expect a wait.\n  \nOverall:\n  Okay so there was a wait (there is always a wait), but I guess that's a good sign right?  One thing is for sure, they have some enormous portions.  So big in fact that Man Vs. Food's Vegas episode actually came to this location to feast.  Don't mistake quality for quantity here.  The portions are grand ,but the taste is just as amazing.  \n\nTips:\n  *  If you share, make sure to order an extra side, otherwise they automatically charge you an extra $2 dollars.  Might as well get something extra since you're going to pay for it either way right?  \n\n *  Try some of their specialty drinks.  I forgot the exact name of my favorite, but it comes with a watermelon wedge dangling off the edge of the glass.  Spectacular!\n\n*  Come hungry... Seriously!  And don't come if you are in a rush.  Especially not during Brunch on a weekend"

I had a Thanksgiving turkey meatloaf that missed the mark for me (way too sweet).  \n\nOver all, it has been a good experience, and it's a place that I try to get to when I get to Vegas.

Super huge and we all shared it because apparently it was the homies appetizer.\n-The Trucker Something- It came with French Toast, eggs, and sausage. OMG the french toast was AMAZING!!! It had walnuts (or pecans) and bananas on top.

Ok, maybe not that big, but if I have one tip for any of you out there that eat more conventional sized portions, it is this: SHARE. \n\nSo, the fare is unique and served up in heaping helpings.

S"I took my parents to Vegas for the weekend on the condition that they eat wherever I take them because we were going to be yelping.  They agreed and said they'd be up for the adventure and assist on the reviews.  Our first stop was the Hash House.  It's a little ways down Sahara to the normal part of Vegas.  Ambience is cool with the stainless steel tables and very casual and clean environment.  As we were getting seated, we couldnt' help but notice the portions.  They're gargatuan...almost in the same class as Belisle's in Anaheim for you old timers.  \nWe sat down and ordered our drinks.  The wife had the plain old lemonade which she claims was one of the best she's ever had.  She didn't try the kiwi watermelon which is award winning.  We decided to order 2 meals for 4 peeps and split.  The waitress mentioned a 2.50 charge for the extra plate so she suggested getting a couple of sides so we opted for breakfast sausage.\nThe first platter was their signature corned beef hash.  Made with their corned beef cut into strips and tossed with red onions, brown onions, and green onions, this corned beef hash was excellent.\nThe 2nd platter was a bacon avocado scramble and this was delicious.  These 2 platters and the sides of sausage were more than enough to satiate our morning hunger.  \nService was great and this is definitely a local place.  Highly recommend if you're a breakfast lover."

S"While we were disappointed we trekked all the way out here ($15 cab from strip) and it wasn't a strip joint meets Amsterdam coffee house, the brunch was memorable.\n\nWe ordered a fried chicken eggs benedict and a banana cinnamon french toast.  My friend had seen a Man vs. Food episode here so we were expecting the dishes to be on the large side.  We revised those portion estimates upward when we saw a flap jack the size of a small pizza go by our table.\n\nThe fried chicken eggs benedict was massive and interesting to say the least.  They've taken a lot of liberties in calling this an eggs benedict.  The eggs are scrambled instead of poached.  The hollandaise sauce is replaced with a delicious chipotle cream sauce.  The English muffin is replaced with a massive (and fairly tasteless) biscuit.  \n\nThe fried chicken (perhaps 2-3 pieces worth) under this heap of toppings was delicious.  Also loved the garlic potatoes and apple-smoked bacon that was in there.  The eggs were just so-so but at least they made it feel like brunch instead of some gluttonous hangover binge.\n\nThe french toast was just so-so.  It's huge but size doesn't help when you order something that sweet.  I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nThe wait on a Saturday morning was 45 minutes.  Pretty impressive (and annoying) given that it's not on the strip.\n\nNot sure I'd make the trek out here again but it was worth a one-time visit."

Came an hour late past happy hour so missed out on seeing other yelpers but we were informed that the burger specials were still available.\n\nBuddy and I both ordered Stellas at the bar. Took a good 15+ min to deliver the order because something was a bit weird with the machine. The bartender told us drinks were on him for the inconvenience. So that was cool. \n\nI ordered the Mashed Potatoes & Bacon Burger. \nFirst impression was....eh it isnt that big. After eating half the burger i determined that the size itself wasnt the issue it was the lack of depth. \n\nThe beef patties arent seasoned so they have a very generic taste. The mashed potatoes were too light in flavor and contributed very little to the overall burger cept for filler and the bacon was just bacon. There was no stable meat to condiment ratio. Each bite was like getting punched in the face with flavorless beef.\n\nThe fries were good and the meal was good for how much we paid for them.

I am pleased to report that this place definitely lives up to expectations.\n\nFirst, if you're looking at this review I'm guessing it probably won't be news to you that the portions are HUGE. Seriously, HUGE. The plates are more like dinner platters that you'd see in a buffet. Lots of people seem to order the MvF featured item: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. I did not indulge, but my buddies did. Let me tell you, this thing was impressive. It's a sky high platter filled with mashed potatoes, homemade biscuits, fired chicken, eggs, and chipotle cream sauce. They bury a knife in it for scale.\n\nI opted for the mushroom, artichoke heart, sundried tomato hash for a healthier option and it was really well done. Flavorful and served with perfectly crispy potatoes and one of their flaky homemade biscuits. \n\nIf you're into bloody mary's, they make a really great one. Spicy and tangy, exactly how it should be. The double double lattes are also really great.\n\nThis place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area (go here and NOT to the one on the Strip).

I had the fried chicken and maple glaze. Fantastic! Portion was enormous, you definitely need to come with a hungry man here to finish your food.  I split the banana brown sugar pancake with my husband. HEAVENLY. Nothing compares.  The caramelization on the bananas and the surprising brown sugar bits in the batter were nothing short of spectacular.

I don't think I've ever seen this concoction before but it was pretty tasty. We added vodka to ours!\n\n3. Mushroom and artichoke scramble - very plain. It was very simply cooked and not as seasoned as the sage chicken and waffles. It was also on the dry side. If they added some cheese or hollandaise sauce, I think it would make the dish a lot better. \n\n4.

This I would understand if it was busy, or a weekend, or whatever - not a Wednesday morning when more than half the place is empty. So after waiting for our friends we go BACK up and get seated. I was getting the shakes by then bc I needed food so bad and just ordered and waited. Really couldn't care less about the place until I got my food. Ordered an Apple Juice for my drink and it was really good. It tasted like it was freshly pressed. The order came and yes, it was huge, but stop looking at the size people and realize that they put almost 2in high of mashed potatoes under EVERYTHING. Oh, and one thing I wasn't happy about, they don't list what is actually on/in the dish. They didn't mention that it had a type of salsa on top, or that it was on top of mashed potatoes.

S"I'm not a fan of giant portions and I generally try to stay healthy. That being said, I'm addicted to Yelp and try places against those ideals when I feel it's worth it. Visiting here wasn't my pick. But it wasn't nearly as bad as reviews here led me to expect.\n\n20 minute wait for lunch on a Saturday around 11AM, pretty standard.\nWe were seated at a cocktail table in the bar area and I really liked our server- Kelli?, lady with spiky hair and friendly, casual demeanor like a female Guy Fieri.\n\nBF ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, and highly suggested that I order the Kokomo meatloaf sandwich- so I did, with the house salad for the side instead of fries.  Portions for both are enormous and we could have easily shared just one dish, but wanted to try more than one dish. And now my guy has dinner to take with him to work tonight, so it all works out. $30 and change before tip.\n\nFried chicken and waffles- chicken is actually pretty moist and flavorful, waffles weren't bad but also weren't my thing. Accents of fried leeks and some roasted peppers made this better than I expected. Didn't go overboard with the maple syrup.\nMeatloaf sandwich is hefty- ate about a third of it and had my fill of the flavors. Liked the tomato sauce, felt the mozzarella taste was masked by stronger flavors but the texture broke up the meat and bread a bit. Heavy and rich, even if you're hungry, split it.\n\nUltimately, my careful picking at each dish and my hungry guy eating what he wanted (damn his metabolism!) only made half of each meal disappear. While many reviews here indicate that the kitchen is more focused on quantity than quality, the flavors weren't bad but given the gigantic portions, easily get redundant. \nBest to come with a group and share a few dishes."

S'I\'ve been here a couple of times. Both times I\'ve gotten fast & friendly service, even though both times the place was packed. Because of the staff, this might be the "Go to" Breakfast joint? Giant menu. The portion were very large & everything on all our plates came to the table hot(nothing was cold due to organization or lazy wait staff), the Flap Jack were huge. The only real negative, I have with this restaurant, is that they don\'t pan or griddle fry the potatoes, they cheat & deep fry them.'

S'Vegas gets a lot of international visitors, many of whom are in the U.S. for the first time.  So as a public service, let me explain a vital aspect of American culture: we like things to be big (note the casino-resorts on the Strip, the Grand Canyon and monster trucks).\n\nThis goes for food as well--we want it tasty and in massive portions (if it tastes great on the first bite, it\'ll be excellent on the 2,456th bite).  So, foreign tourists, if you haven\'t fed at the American food trough, you should, but make sure it\'s a tasty place.  \n\nEnter Hash House A Go Go ("HHAGG").  The pancakes come bigger than your head (and in a stack of three).  Prefer eggs?  The omelettes coming out of the kitchen are the size of a chicken.  And, unlike the generic buffets being offered at the casino-resorts, the food at HHAGG has flair.  The plating is creative and the food is simple, but imaginative--picture the classic steak and eggs just back from a European vacation and testing out French fashion on American soil.   \n\nSo why only four stars?  Well, for all the food\'s glitz and gigantic size, the taste is relatively straightforward.  HHAGG advertises that it serves "farm food" and while they do a good job with the classic tastes, there just isn\'t anything unique or amazing.  \n\nThat said, after a rough night on the town, there are few dishes that satisfy as well as the O\'Hare of the Dog (24 oz beer in a paper bag and 7 strips of bacon).  Final take: the food is solid and the place offers a great experience.  One of the better breakfast places in Vegas.'

S'First of all, please put up pictures of your more exotic dishes at the restaurant.  Sometimes words can not describe what this dish is supposed to taste like, but pictures speak a thousand words.\n\nSecondly, the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade is a pure stroke of genius.  You have given me an idea for a new party drink creation - KiwiWaterLemon Soju.\n\nNext, let\'s go on to A_____, your very defensive waiter.  I asked him to describe a "Scramble" and he told me what it was.  My response was "Oh.  Okay,  So it\'s kinda like a Denny\'s breakfast skillet."  He then got pretty irritated and told me that it\'s not anything like that.  "And unlike Denny\'s, we use fresh ingredients that probably came in from California this morning."  Geez.  Okay.  Relax.  So I was fucking wrong.  Excuse me.  Just correct me, don\'t treat me like an idiot.  I should have walked out at that point.\n\nLastly, do NOT eat the "HH Famous Meatloaf, roasted red peppers, fresh spinach and smoked mozzarella" (House Hash) served with eggs on a bed of crispy potatoes.  The meatloaf is tasteless, dry and gray.  There\'s a great biscuit, but no country gravy.  I ate the eggs and a little bit of the meatloaf, then let the rest of it rot.  This is a poorly designed dish and it should be removed from the menu.\n\nWould I come back and give Hash House A Go Go another chance?  Of course I would.  But to be fair, except for the great lemonade, my experience was pretty sub-par.  I need to be \'WOW"ed the next time.'

S'ive been hearing that this is the breakfast joint to hit up in vegas.  we went to this b/c i was so hungry after completing the first las vegas half marathon.  this place is away from the hustle and bustle of the strip on the west side of town.  it was a very good sign to see how busy this place was and how long the wait was.  just waiting outside and peaking into the heated outdoor eating area, you could see how enormous the plates were.  i should correct myself...they were enormous platters, not plates.  we were told that a party of 4 would be unable to sit in the bar area b/c the platters were huge.  \ni was impressed with the wide selection of breakfast items.  first off, going against the rules of post workout re hydration, i couldnt resist trying a libation from the mixed drink selection, why?  why not?  check this out...hash house bloody mary...premium vodka, bloody mary mix, fresh lemon juice, celery salt, Worcestershire and hot sauce, spicy pickled green beans (with extras ordered), 2 jalapeno stuffed olives, and a mt olive kosher petite dill pickle, with fresh cracked pepper sprinkled on top...f@ckin hella savory ...that won me there at that point.\ni ended up choosing the HH Famous Meatloaf with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella all on big chunks of fried potatoes.  my favorite and lovely dining companion ordered the Farmer\'s Daughter House Hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on also...big chunks of fried potatoes.  Both came on a huge skillet (which they called their "smaller" dishes...lies...they were huge...i just finished the leftovers 2 days later)  My other dining companion had a decadent omelet filled with smoked salmon and melted brie.  also, all our orders arrived with flaky biscuits, so you get to top it with some their own homemade strawberry jam (we ended up packaging some of the jam up for home...too bad it doesn\'t last long enough, not from me eating it all, but b/c it has no preservatives!!!\nthis ranks high in my favorite breakfast places to eat.  i will definitely return here with my lovely dining companion to enjoy the other things on the menu, such as the sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese scrambled eggs, or the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash, or even the roasted pork tenderloin, charred tomato, corn, baby green beans and mozzarella hash, and definitely for that damn bloody mary.'

I usually don't eat meatloaf at home or anywhere else, but for some reason, I really enjoy Hash House A Go Go's meatloaf.\n\nThe place is usually always hopping, so expect large crowds and loud ambiance.  The food portions are HUGE, so bring an appetite or be prepared to bring home lots of food!  I definitely recommend Hash House A Go Go for anyone looking to eat a hearty meal with their friends and family!"

S'A. Maze. Ing.\n\nI am a MVF regular, and somehow I missed this episode.  I found this gem with my fabulous Yelp app.  We love to hit up a delicious place on the drive back to Phoenix and the Hash House did not disappoint.\n\nBefore we pulled up, I was expecting to see a hole-in-the-wall type of dive-y place (with a name like "hash house" that is what I pictured),  man was I off!  Nice prominent outside and an inside atmosphere that feels modern/industrial and yet cozy/family environment at the same time.  \n\nThe walk from the door to the hostess stand was a little icy . . . the two girls didn\'t smile at all, however they did quickly seat us, which was nice.  Our server was great, I forget her name (sorry). She explained that they don\'t use microwaves or heat lamps; as soon as your food is ready, you get it.  Very cool! She had a nice positive energy, like someone who enjoyed her job.  \n\nLike all of the other reviews say, the food is phenomenal!  And the portions are HUGE!!!  Some of the most unique and creative menu items, yet all sound like the most delicious dish ever.  My BF got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, eggs, and bacon.  I am not a huge fan of fried chicken, but this might have turned me.  Melt in your mouth, moist chicken and a perfect, well-seasoned, light, crispy breading. Yum!\n\nAnd my breakfast was one of my favorite breakfasts of all time.  A vegetable hash with artichokes, mushrooms, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes . . . you know all the good stuff . . . not the silly filler veggies of normal breakfast places.  Served with potatoes and two eggs (over-medium) so I can spread the runny yolk all over my vegetable goodness.  My mouth is drooling just thinking about you.  Your\'s will too . . . just check out my pics of this stuff!\n\nOh, and how could I forget the homemade biscuits and homemade jam ("strawberry today" the server told us).  Again, I\'ve never been a huge biscuit fan, but these were by far the best I\'ve ever had.  Huge, softball size, light, flaky, buttery.  And that jam . . . oh, my goodness, I HAVE to go back!!\n\nI almost shed a tear when I couldn\'t take home my leftovers, there was no where to stash them for the 5 hour drive home.  Whaw, whaw, whaaaaawn.\n\nNext time . . . I will not wait until the last morning of my trip to go back!  As a matter of fact, we may just have to hit Hash House a Go Go on the way into Vegas next time!!'

S"The Hash House a Go Go is in an interesting place, located near car dealerships and your typical businesses. I was expecting it to be somewhere on the strip, but luckily it was easy to find right off of Sahara. It's a stand alone building with it's own lot. As I was told, the restaurants specializes in breakfast, although you can order lunch or dinner food as well. Breakfast is served all day. Portions are gigantic! I mean, huge, so come hungry. Unfortunately, I didn't come starving. I ordered a some drink called Watermelon-Lemonade, I may have the name wrong, but if you mention it to your server, they'll know what your talking about. It was sooooo good. For my meal, I was plain Jane and ordered a flap jack. It's so big, it hangs over the plate. I literally ate half of the inside of the flap jack. For the service and overall food experience, I'd rate them 3 stars. I would definitely return again and probably order something completely different though. I wasn't too impressed with the flap jack."

S"This is my second time coming to Hash House a GoGo for brunch, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.  \n\nFirst off, the pricing:  While none of the food items would be considered cheap, the pricing is slightly less than what you would pay on the strip.  \n\nSecond of all, portions:  Portions here are meant to probably meant to be served towards farm hands who have just had a full days work of lifting  100's of lbs of hay with no break for meals.  They are gigantic.  Trust me, you will most likely not finish your meal here.\n\nQuality:  Everything we've had here is top notch.  I'm hesitant to say that about any restaurant, however the food is excellent.  The drinks are creative and tasty.  It's hard to go wrong with this place.  That being said, here's what I've tasted thus far:\n\nMango Coconut Pancake:  This is bigger than your head.  Heck, it's bigger than the plate.  I think it was about the size of my wrist to my elbow... and with soft sweet mangos (must be quality canned mangos, since consistency and flavor were perfect) and shredded coconut throughout.  The thing about their pancakes is, it's made so well that you're pretty much eating cake for breakfast.  Soft, moist, and tender pancake.  \n\nRoasted Chicken Hash:  Not sure how they made these potatoes, but they are perfectly crisp and flavorful.  The chicken is roasted well, with a few dry pieces (roasting a whole bird perfectly tender all the way through is near impossible, mind you), but a good dish overall.  This may be the one dish that doesn't stand out from the rest.  I was surprised, however, to see my wife downing the scrambled eggs since she hates eggs... and she loved the way these scrambled eggs were prepared.\n\nCrispy Pork Tenderloin Farm Benedict:  Here's the winner for me.  A gigantic piece of breaded and fried pork, on top of biscuits, mashed potatoes, with a benedict sauce over the top.  Spinach, scrambled eggs... I was happy to just finish 2/3 of this... and the last 1/3 could have been put between two pieces of bread for a significant size portion lunch.  Get this.  If you like fried pork tenderloin, you will LOVE this.\n\nSmores Espresso:  Gigantic cup of coffee, drizzled chocolate all over, torched marshmallows covering the whole top, and a few graham crackers on the side for scooping purposes and eating.  Pricey drink, but beautiful and executed phenomenally.  Smores fan?  You'll be in love.\n\nHash House Bloody Mary:  I don't like bloody mary's.  But I order this one every time I'm here.  Great condiments, excellent flavor, just enough kick to help jumpstart the day.  (I'm a lightweight drinker, mind you).  Definitely spicy and flavorful, so it's not for those with bland tastes.\n\nVerdict:  While off the strip, very worthwhile to make the trip.  Great quailty, good pricing, huge portions, and friendly service... I've added this to my list of places to go to whenever I visit Vegas.  Followed by a nice 3 hour recovery nap to be scheduled every time.\n\nProtips - From the yelp reviews along with other friends who have been there, go for either breakfast or brunch... that's where they shine.  It sounds like dinner is good here, but not as good as the breakfast items.  Also, while splitting is a great option since portions are huge, unfortunately you'll have to purchase side dishes so that they don't charge the fee for splitting entrees..."

This is probably one of my top three places to go for breakfast now.\n\nThey describe the menu as 'twisted farm food', which is a good way of describing it. Everything is made fresh and it is all good. You can get a traditional bacon & eggs if you like, but if you want to be more adventurous, you can try something like the Salmon & Brie Scramble with a side of grilled mashed potatoes (yes... MASHED POTATOES FOR BREAKFAST!!! How can you not love that?!) \n\nThe various hashes are a specialty. I particularly was taken with the french toast with pecans and grilled banana. YUM! Also, the don't pass up one of their biscuits with homemade jam (they come with most meals). \n\nAll the portions were HUGEMONGUS so make sure you're hungry and don't plan on eating for the rest of the day! We barely made a dent in our breakfasts when we went there. This would be a good place to go as a group and get a bunch of different things and eat it all family style. \n\nThe service was friendly and attentive which made the experience all the more enjoyable. \n\nThis place is quite a bit off the strip on W. SAHARA, so a cab ride would probably cost a bit. Its best if you have your own transportation. I do believe the Deuce Bus goes out there also. \n\nIf you're looking for a great place where the locals go, check this place out.We enjoyed it so much we decided to go back one more time before we left town and I'm sure we'll be back again.\n\nIf you leave here hungry, you just ain't tryin'."

The cute girls up front stated it would take an hour to an hour 15 minutes to be seated so i was like maybe i shouldnt wait but decided to stick around since there isnt much to do in vegas in the morning.  it took about 40 minutes and we were seated.  Ok i am getting to the important part the FOOD.  I ordered hamburgers for kids from the kid's menu and boy i was wrong to get each one their own burgers.  The burgers were so big that kids couldnt even manage to eat half of it.  So my advice get one burger per two children :).. Flapjack i ordered was huge as well i would say 3-4 people could easily eat this and i am a big guy with apetite.

S'At my house we have several names for this place:  Hash House a NO Go, Hash House a No No, and Hash House a No Mo\'.\n\nThe main problem is that Man vs. Food hyped the place as being excellent with humongous portions. We wanted to experience it just for the novelty.  Amongst the three of us we had the pancakes with hash browns, eggs over easy and chicken sausage; the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger with fries and watermelon lemonade, and the Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger with the same fries. We also tried the barbecued ribs appetizer.\n\nFirst, the lemonade, which was tasty, was $5.00, no refills. That\'s way overpriced for lemonade that isn\'t spectacular, but it was attractive looking. Next, we specifically asked for the appetizer to be brought out before the meal (sort of the definition of the term "appetizer," right? We shouldn\'t have had to say anything) but it came AFTER the meal was brought out. How ridiculous is that? So two disappointments.\n\nWhen the pancake came out it was large, but it was underwhelming compared to the hype it got on TV.  Yes it was really big- bigger than one outstretched medium sized female hand. It filled up maybe 2/3 of the oval plate it was served on, leaving room for maybe one cup of cubed potatoes (hashbrowns) and 2 eggs over easy. But check out this photo from Man vs. Food: http://yhoo.it/18O6aVt - this was CLEARLY nothing close to what we got, hence the disappointment.   The seasoned potatoes had no flavor, and the pancake tasted like flour.  No flavor at all.  We asked for chicken sausage and one link arrived, splayed open on a small dish. It was basically a hot dog, not sausage.\n\nOn to the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger. The teenager enjoyed it greatly, however, the teenager likes just about anything. The burger has one pound of meat divided into two pre-made, pre-seasoned patties that are cooked in a press of some kind so that both sides are cooked simultaneously. This means no way to request medium rare.  Sigh...\n\nThe Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger was tasty, although the meat flavor seemed to come from the grill without additional seasoning. Well, let\'s just say the seasoning was mild. I won\'t complain too much about the burger- it was satisfying.  The fries serving size was average. I think they were seasoned, and had a nice crunch. \n\nThe ribs came in what appeared to be an Asian-inspired sauce, which I liked. One of the  four ribs was perfect, with tender meat falling off the bone. The others were chewy and tough. Hate to speculate on the disparity- I\'ll leave that to you. They were artfully leaned against a pile of cold, nasty-tasting potatoes.  What a waste of potato. We got the impression that much of the food is pre-packaged, pre-seasoned, so not much creativity happens in the preparation.\n\nThe atmosphere was different from what I expected- the dark lighting made a nice ambience even though the food is Denny\'s quality.  I liked the distressed wood everywhere and the (very) heavy metal chairs.\n\nSo, we will chalk this up to experience and probably not come back as a family, although I\'d bring the teen here if he wanted the burger again. for $13 it wasn\'t so awful in my opinion. \n\nOh- the waitress was EXCELLENT- she got a full 20% tip.'

S"I was fearful that this would be another overrated tourist trap, but I was blown away. Portions are huge- I'm a big guy and can only eat half of a plate when I visit.  I eyed the pancakes, chicken and waffles, and other dishes coming out... and there's no way I could finish any of them.\n\nPresentation of the food is what pushes it into the five star range. They do a great job.\n\nI've had two of the skillet plates and a pork tenderloin sandwich, and every time the food was delicious. The BLT Bloody Mary is a special treat.\n\nIf you go at peak hours, you're probably going to have a long wait for a table. That's why I try to never go to any popular eatery during peak hours if I can help it."

S'When you are in Vegas, you want to do things BIG.  Drink hard.  Play hard.  and of course, eat hard... but who really wants to eat hard \'everytime\' that they need to spend $40+ on a Vegas buffet?  Fear not- the locals know the best, and thank goodness for my awesome Vegas friends for taking Jaymie Lynn S. and I out for some good eats, because Hash House A Go Go is definitely a spot to remember.\n\nFirst of, this place was packed when we arrived during lunch hours on a Saturday.  Our wait was about half an hour, which is honestly not that bad if there is a delicious meal at the end of the rainbow.  So be prepared to wait a little.  In the meantime, I highly recommend looking over their menu because it is LONG and full of many options that are going to tease your every cravings.  From breakfast foods to a calamari steak, use your time wisely to choose.\n\nAmbience?  This joint was blasting remixes of Top 40 hits- I LIKE!  It made me wish I had that iPhone application that helps identify tunes you may be unfamiliar with.  We were seated on the right side of the restaurant which made for more room, but less air conditioning because the fans weren\'t blowing our way.\n\nOnto the menu!  I had a really hard time deciding what I actually wanted to eat here because there were so many.  I was looking favorably at the Chicken & Waffles options, when my friends recommended I try the "Andy\'s Sage Fried Chicken" because it had my name on it.  I figured- why not, and selected that for my lunch date.  I also ordered a lemonade, and was pleased to hear that drinks were bottomless here.  However, the lemonade proved to be a bit too sour, so maybe an iced tea would have been more appropriate.\n\nAfter waiting for what seemed forever (around thirty minutes... quite a bit of a wait IMO), our food came out.  Mine came out last, but what I saw on my friends\' plates was shocking.\n\nPORTIONS DO NOT LIE.  THEY ARE HUGE.\n\nMy Fried Chicken meal came with mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, medley of tomatoes and a side of fresh fruit.  It was big eats here.  The presentation of it was wonderful as well, and upon first glance, I knew I was going to have trouble finishing all of this food.  The chicken breast piece was juicy, and did not feel overwhelming being fried.  Everything on my plate was honestly very tasty... but to nobody\'s surprise, I could not finish this giant meal.  Check out the size of this plate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?action_user_photos=1\n\nIf you are a light eater, sharing one dish can be your life saver!\n\nJaymie Lynn S. let me have a taste of her calamari steak, and it was hella good!  It was an interesting take on the traditional calamari style meats, but I very much enjoyed it along with the condiments that came with it.\n\nThis was such a great eating experience, and I highly recommend it for any Vegas local or traveler wanting a great meal that is guaranteed to get you full.  Parking is available in a small lot outside of the restaurant, with more on the street once it gets packed.\n\nWith that... I\'ve completed the Las Vegas episode of Man v Food!'

S"It all started with a plan...a plan to try their dinner buffet for $23.99 on a weeknight with unlimited beer and wine. I can't possibly say no to that, can you? That was the first thing on our agenda coming in to Vegas from Orange County. Traffic happened and we got delayed, let's say 3 hours delayed form our original plan. We called to inquire what time they would put away the food if we came right at 9pm which is their closing time. We were assured over the phone that we will have more than enough time as long as we get to pay before the clock strikes 9.\n\nAfter holding our breaths and skipping out on stops for a bathroom break, we finally made it to Studio B just 3 minutes shy before closing. Whew! \n\nThe place wasn't busy at all so I wonder why it took a while for them to take us to our table. Our table was finally ready but our chairs were wet and sticky. I asked for them to replace the chairs but the server assured me it was only water so she wiped it off and left it there for me to sit on. Eek!\n\nWhen our server greeted us, we were assured once again to take our time with the food because they'll have it out until around 10pm. I heard him but as I was going through my rounds, I decided to get everything I wanted before sitting down to eat. I literally had 3 plates in front of me and a bowl of soup before I started digging in. \n\n30 minutes in and they started shutting off the lights and pulling out the dishes from the buffet. You're kidding right?! If I had listened to our server and the person who answered the phone, we would've been screwed, big time! \n\nThe rest of our party was quite upset. We had other dishes we would've wanted more of or some to try. I didn't even get the chance to hit the dessert area. Although that one closed later, I was too busy eating my main dishes before it got cold. Unlimited beer and wine alright but guess what? I only got one glass of cider. Boo!\n\nIf we all lived in a perfect world and we got here on time, I would've been able to muster a 3.5 stars for the price and value. \n\nTheir oxtail soup is one of the best I've had. The hot and sour soup was something I went back for while their prime rib was dry and a bit rubbery. Everything else was forgettable. Ok food + fair service + horrible experience = 2 stars. I've definitely had better!"

S'Studio B is probably the best buffet you will get in Vegas. The only downside is it\'s location. Studio B is located in the M resort which is off the strip, so if you didn\'t drive to Vegas, it\'s a little too out of the way. \n\nFor dinner they serve a ton of crab legs and a variety of steak selections. Oh, and did I mention the UNLIMITED ALCOHOL?! That is probably the best part, so do not hesitate to drink up! They serve a few beers, wines and my favorite is their M Resort cider. It\'s so light and crisp and refreshing!! It goes great with the meal. \n\nThe quality of food here is way better than the other buffets on the strip. They have a pretty good "international" variety and a very extensive salad bar. The Studio B dessert bar is too amazing! Make sure you save half your stomach for dessert because when you get around to it, you\'re gonna wish you did! They serve so many of those cute little dessert cups and cakes. Their gelato has the best flavors and consistency!!! I wish I saved enough room to try every flavor....and every kind of dessert. \n\nIf you go to Studio B for dinner, do not expect  to go out later that night. You won\'t be able to fit into your dress clothes after binge-eating all the delicious food but you\'ll probably lapse into a food coma before you can make any plans for after dinner!'

S"I eat here once a week and I don't get the crazy rave reviews for this buffet. Look, it's far from the worst in town, but it's not this awesomely amazing place some reviewers make it out to be. I know because as I said, I eat here about 5 - 6 times per month. The food is consistent to an extent, but it's far from gourmet. They have their ridiculously overpriced seafood buffet on Saturday and Sunday, and I don't recommend it unless you have a comp. The pricing is outrageous for what you get. I don't care if you drink 10 glasses of cheap wine or Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, you aren't going to get your $40 worth! \n\nThe prime rib is usually really good, the Chinese lettuce wraps are a standout, and I like their sugar free frozen yogurt (their other sugar free desserts are atrocious). Everything else is standard buffet fare, but at least there's a great selection! \n\nOn a typical day you'll find: Greek salad, Italian food (the worst pizza you will ever eat -- try some and you'll see), lots of inventive salads (artichoke salad, marinated cauliflower, 3 bean), American food (fried chicken, beef stroganoff), carved rotisserie chicken / ham / lamb / prime rib, lots of veggies (green beans, broccoli, zucchini), several types of baked fish, a very small Mexican section, sushi, an Asian section (Korean ribs, ginger stir fried crab legs), a rotating selection of soups and breads, and desserts. I'm leaving lots out, but you get the idea."

S"This review is for the Seafood Buffet only. It's available on Friday night, Saturday and Sunday lunch and dinner.\n\nThe buffet used to be cheaper, now its $29.95, but definitely still worth it. They used to have the $2 off per person who has their rewards card, but it has now been canceled. \n\nThe line can get pretty long, since the word got out about what a great deal this place has. Just get there a bit earlier so by the time you get inside, its dinner time already. \n\nEven though its about 10 mins away from the strip, its definitely worth the drive out there. \n\nThere's all you can drink of red wine, white wine, rose wine, beer and cider. There's plenty of seafood to choose from: snow crab legs, shrimp, oysters, fish, etc. They have several kinds of crab legs: cold, warm with melted butter, stir fried with ginger and onions. There is a carving station with the typical prime rib and lamb leg. \n\nThe desserts are amazing. There's plenty of cakes, pastries and cookies to choose from. They even have a ice cream station with more than 10 flavors to choose from, and either waffle or sugar cone, or just in a cup. They even have a coffee machine where you can request coffee, cappuccino, mocha, or any other coffee-based drink. \n\nFor a buffet, this is a pretty good deal, the quality is decent and there's plenty of variety to satisfy everyone's palette. The servers are quite quick on their feet in bringing you your requests. \n\nI definitely recommend this place over other seafood buffets in Vegas. The Rio seafood buffet can not even compare!! Its worth the drive, the wait and the money!!"

S"My boyfriend I recently came here. We heard so  many good things about it so it was finally time to try this baby out. It's about 10 miles south of the strip. \n\nThis place is pretty amazing. Las Vegas buffets have slowly gone downhill and there's only a handful of places I am willing to spend $ on and the M Buffet is one of them. They have an array of foods from teriyaki chicken, to chicken adobo (filipino cuisine), to ribs, salmon, etc. Their desserts are AMAZING! Gelato, creme brulee, cakes, and pastries! The creme brulee was yummy! They also had flan! mmm!!\n\nEverything I ate was prepared very well. It's really good quality food and plenty of it. The wait wasn't too bad on a Saturday afternoon. I think we waited 10-15 minutes max. Maybe we lucked out eh?\n\nWorth trying at least once!"

S"Ok so I was kidnapped and dumped in the middle of the desert and stumbled upon the M resort and came into their buffet. Alright the real story was my friend had a local friend that met up with us and took us out here to eat. We went for lunch on a Saturday and I must say the quality and selection was pretty good. They still had some breakfast food out which I love, but it wasn't great. Their other items were pretty tasty though. They had everything from Asian  to midwest to southern comfort foods - all pretty good. The paella I got was a little watery though, but still pretty good. I managed to get like 3 plates of food and couldn't do anymore. They had a nice dessert section too that I passed on. Supposedly alchohol is free here too and they had some type of wine station too. I guess I would come here again if I rented a car in Vegas, otherwise it is a little out of the way."

I'd Rather spend $50 and eat at a better buffet."

S'I thought that because the M Resort was a couple of miles away from the strip that this buffet would not be so busy. I was definitely wrong. I paid for the breakfast, but by the time I was seated, it was already lunch time. I waited approximately 30-40 minutes before I was seated.\n\nAlthough I did not reap this benefit due to the fact that I was driving, beer and wine are unlimited during lunch and dinner time. There is a huge variety of food here, so much variety that I had sampled so many of them. By the time I left the buffet, I was completely stuffed. There is something for everyone here, including a large selection of food for vegetarians.\n\nThe people that worked here were completely nice. The assistant manager was telling me about the variety they had here which was a very nice personal touch. I loved the modern feel of the buffet including all the TV screens that wrapped around the entire buffet. It felt like I was in a minature stadium, but instead surrounded by delicious food.'

S'When I told people (friends, coworkers, random nurses at work) I was going to Vegas, literally everyone recommended this buffet.  Everyone.  It\'s cheap, they explained, and the food is just as good as the Wynn.  I mean, you can\'t get a more solid recommendation than that.\n\nSo why is it that after waiting 2 hours in line and shelling out $31.99, I felt so cheated?\n\nOkay, my family doesn\'t drink much, so the endless beer and wine deal was lost on us.  And I don\'t eat much shellfish, so the extra I had to pay for "Seafood Dinner" that weekend was also wasted.  But does that mean that on weekdays the buffet doesn\'t include seafood?  That\'s silly.\n\nHonestly everything I ate was just okay and not even cooked very well.  Prime rib, korean short ribs, lamb, pork ribs...all of the meat was tough and chewy.  And where was the meat selection?  I had to satisfy my lamb craving with tough, overly-sweetened barbecued pieces.  And the desserts...uninteresting and not as extensive a selection as the Wynn\'s.  My whole family agreed that we were disappointed overall with the meal and wouldn\'t be coming back.\n\nWithout all the hype, I probably would have enjoyed Studio B a little more.  But for a buffet that calls itself "The Best Buffet in Las Vegas," it just doesn\'t deliver the goods.'

Unlimited champagne and juices = bottomless mimosas. Bottomless mimosas in my book is always a good thing. \n\nThe food could be better, but it wasn't horrible.

S'With the wave of premium buffets hitting Las Vegas (Bacchanal at Caesars, Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan) Studio B is not at the top of the category anymore.\n\nThat having been said, it is still one of my favorite buffets in the city. For dinner it is slightly more than half the cost of the other two I mentioned and the food, while not at the same level, is very close. The most notable difference is that this is a more "traditional" buffet setup rather than the painstakingly individual plates of the higher end buffets. Quality wise, I have enjoyed everything I have had there. And yes they still have the typical meat carving stations (prime rib, pork, sausage, fish.)\n\nLet\'s not forget...Beer and wine INCLUDED.

S'I had friends in town they wanted too go M buffet. I know not name name but always used too calling it. Lol! Buffets not often frequent them but of all buffets believe this is the best one in town. The diversity is quite amazing from the craving stations, asian section, cold salads, little sushi of maki and hand rolls, american foods, italian foods, and desserts section very unique too buffets. Now the standard buffet just about universal terms it all broken down too ethnic stations and then salads/cold items and desserts. I feel makes this stand above all others is the size. It snakes all around one side of the restaurant. Every station is filled with different items too choose from so most part not think anyone finding something eat. The all you can drink beer or wine something never see any other buffet. Certain days they have seafood day the day I went with friends visiting out of town. You know the day because not only is it hell of busy but the line for the crab legs cold or hot can be ridiculous. They put out whole tray then four or five people later its gone end up waiting again. Still worth the wait. The dessert section another part that stands out. Sure they have normal small petite fours of desserts on plates, also have whole gelato section have over ten flavors choose from, and even do mocha or cappucino order. The restaurant ambience if nice not feel like buffet little more upscale feeling too it. The price is normal for any dinner buffet compared too the strip. The only downfall is M property not near the strip but great property and worth the drive..'

S"Best buffet in Las Vegas? Quite possibly. Unfortunately I think the Bellagio has the edge in freshness and more unique food items, but the M Buffet gives it a run for its money.\n\n*SNAPS* for Studio B for seriously giving a TON of choices!\nIt's $33.99 for a seafood brunch (which basically lasts ALLLLLL weekend). \n\nTHINGS I NOTICED:\n- Sashimi had some FUNKY tasting toro (tuna). Very questionable.\n- HOT & COLD crab legs! I hate it when buffets give ICED crab legs. \n- Raw oysters that did not seem very fresh.\n- Good dessert bar that offers unlimited barista coffee drinks!\n- Why is there no restroom INSIDE the buffet?\n- Long wait. SERIOUSLY long wait.\n\nA Las Vegas native informed me that the buffet is BOGO Free on Saturdays before 2pm. I cannot confirm this myself...but if its true then Oh My Goodness."

S'After checking into our hotel, we immediately went out for one of the main purposes of visiting Las Vegas: BUFFET!  I am a big fan of Bravo\'s Top Chef.  M Resort was the host of last season\'s production.  For some reason, that made me feel M Resort must have really good food.  When I went online to look up their restaurants, I found out they have a buffet that offers UNLIMITED wine and beer!  Seriously?  All you can drink booze?  We are so there!\n\nM Resort is not even in Las Vegas.  It\'s in the city of Henderson, which is about 15 minutes drive from Las Vegas.  The hotel was so new that I couldn\'t even find the location on my navigation system.  We actually had to call them for direction.  We got to the buffet around 8pm.  There was a pretty long line.\n\nAfter waiting in line for about 50 minutes, we were finally in!  Sunday night seafood dinner buffet is $31.95 per person.  If you have a M Resort card (those free member cards that accumulate points when you gamble there), I think you get like $2 or $3 off per person.  We were too hungry and tired to go get the cards though....\n\nThe buffet is an "open kitchen" style buffet.  We could see the chefs cooking at each station.  They have a circular seafood station in the middle of the room, as well as cuisines from around the world along the wall.\n\nWe didn\'t even sit down at our table, and just headed straight to the seafood station.  For my first plate, I got crab legs, oyster, shrimp, and a juicy piece of prime rib.  The prime rib was cooked perfectly.  It gotta be the best prime rib I\'ve ever had in a buffet.  The crab legs was meaty and delicious.  Oyster was super fresh.  I think it only took me 10 minutes to finish this plate because (1) I was really hungry, and (2) the food was that good!  Seriously, they have AMAZING seafood here.  Everything was just so fresh and good.  Did I mention we LOVE the crab and prime rib?\n\nOh wait!  We can\'t forget about the all you can drink alcohol.  You can\'t order alcohol from servers.  You have to bring your ID and go to the bar to get it.  They had red wine, white wine, rose wine, and beers.  You can only get 1 drink at a time, but more than welcome to go back as many times as you want to, as long as you can manage to walk to the bar still.  I don\'t really remember how many glasses I drank.... maybe 3 or 4?  Yeah I was pretty drunk that night, and totally got my money worth.\n\nTime for some cooked food.  Braised oxtail had meat that just fell off the bone.  So tender.  Sushi was probably the only disappointment that night.  They had a very small sushi station with just a few selections.  This was a plateful of Asian goodies.  Corn chowder was sweet and yummy.  Love the sauteed curry crab.  Clams were good, so was the kalbi.  Mussel wasn\'t so good.  It had a strange taste.  Like the spicy pad thai a lot.  And a bowl of clam chowder.  Of course, more crab and oyster.  I looked around the dining room, and saw all the Asian customers busy eating crab legs.  But the non-Asians were just eating noodle and pizza.  I wish I can teach them how to eat buffet "properly".  haha....\n\nDessert time!  There was a constant line at the dessert station. I wasn\'t too greedy and only grabbed a few desserts that I like.  The chocolate mousse was soft and creamy with a crispy base.  So good!  Creme brulee was yummy.  Couldn\'t get enough of the almond tiramisu.  Dr. P\'s favorite was the lemon ice cream.  Macaroon was the only one I didn\'t like.\n\nIn case you still don\'t know, I LOVE CRAB!  M Resort has the best seafood buffet in Las Vegas!  Totally worth the money.  I want to go to Vegas again just so I can eat at M Resort\'s buffet!'

(note: lunch ends at 2:30. if you're coming from LA, be sure to head out by 9!)\n\nThe food did not disappoint. As always, I tried to have a little of everything and was pleasantly surprised to find Pancit on the menu! For those that don't know, Pancit is a Filipino noodle dish often served at parties or large get togethers. I generally make a rule to not eat Pancit unless it's home-cooked, but I took a chance with Studio B. Verdict? Not as good as my mother's, but definitely better than any I've had from Filipino restaurants!\n\nAgain, I had to take advantage of the all you can drink! The house cider continues to be the best ciders I have ever had. It is just the right level of sweet and the best buzz for the buck!"

My boyfriend was becoming enflamed as we waited and waited. He said if he would have been given a little heads-up (I guess I forgot to mention that litlle tidbit of info to him), his nerves would have been way less taut and frazzled. So I'm giving you a heads-up...expect around a 1 hr + wait.\n\nA friend told me about this buffet, a friend that is a restaurant owner, so I figured it would probably be something pretty special. We came during lunch, which is served from 10:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. and is priced at $15.99. Breakfast is served from 7:00 - 10:30 a.m. and is $10.99. Dinner starts at 4:00 p.m. and runs till 10:00 p.m. and is priced at $23.99. The Grand Seafood Buffet is only served on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays for $33.99. Children 4 & Under eat free! With these prices, no wonder people were surging in!  We missed out on the Seafood Buffet but there is so much food during the lunch and dinner periods, that you will be more than happy. \n\nThey have salmon and albacore nigiri, futomaki sushi rolls, crawfish, grilled shrimp, fried shrimp, pear & walnut salad, gourmet salads, pastas, antipastos, mussels, prime rib, roasted chicken, roast beef, applewood bacon, turkey, chicken a la king, paella, hummus, pita bread, enchiladas, nachos, ham 'n cheese mac, oxtail soup, ponsit, lumpia, egg rolls, chicken masala, saag paneer, pizza, calzones, lasagna, lattes, cappuchinos, expressos, hot chocolate, creme brulee, tiramisu, fruit tarts, cannolis,  gelato, French macaroons, cookies, chocolate souflee, amaretto cups, brownies, chocolate-covered strawberries, crepes, fruit, pudding, bottomless wine & beer and so so much more. \n\nAnd these were only the items coming off my recollection and from the lunch menu!\n\nEverything, save for the nigiri, was very tasty. The nigiri was not bad - it just didn't have that freshly made flavor (which is totally understandable considering the mass volume of output at play here). The rice was crunchy from refrigeration. The paella was my favorite - seasoned shrimp, clams and rice in a savory broth. The goat cheese and walnut salad and the ham 'n cheese mac were excellent. My boyfriend liked the oxtail soup and the prime rib. The chocolate souffle and the oreo cookie gelato were quite delicious. And the cappuchinos made by their Studio B barista were strong, hot and frothy. \n\nStudio B Buffet is a great dining option if you can contend with the long wait.  I'm mean, people were rolling in 12-people deep!! I'm still on the fence about the 2 hour wait. It is a beautiful, impressive spread of food though, with lots of wonderful food, so I'll probably be back (I gotta try the Seafood Buffet)."

S'I "think" I\'m at the right place?\nI\'m staying here at the M Resort\nI came for the breakfast buffet\nIt was the same as any HUGE HOTEL BUFFER BREAKFAST-dry, over cooked foods sitting in trays, a big sticky mess with 20% of the items empty (not refilled).\nOne super friendly(unusual) very slow custom eggs to order guy. Big line 4 eggs, is it worth the wait? If you saw their waaaaaaaay over cooked "eggs Benedict" the yolks were hard as rocks (and that was their FRESH BATCH right from the kitchen. The fruits were either empty plates or under/over ripe. \nOh yeh, we had a old surly waitress? Why? Doesn\'t she work for tips? She was rude, abrupt & slow...and that was just for liquids??? What\'s up? \n----Overall review:1.5 stars\n----Just another sub par mediocre breakfast buffet.\n-----(NOTE:This review is ONLY 4 the BREAKFAST BUFFET)'

S"Several things that I liked about this buffet.\n\n1.  Cheap.  Lunch price is $15.99, which isn't bad at all considering the quality. \n\n2.  Free wine, Bud Light, and hard cider.  Can't beat that.\n\n3.  Since it's so out in the middle of nowhere, easy to get in and out.\n\n4.  Selection was very good.  Things I recommend - sashimi salad, oxtail soup, pork ribs, cr\xc3\xa8me brule, fried Pollack. \n\n\n\nThings that were meh.\n\n1.  The line was short when I arrived at 12:50 with a party of five.  But it took 30 minutes to get seated.  It wasn't packed, so they slow the flow down since there must be a limited number of servers, not because of a limited number of tables.\n\n2.  The price is right, but still no local or military discount.  However, I'm fairly certain that 80% of the people eating were Clark County types.\n\n3.  That pumpkin ice cream was unedible.\n\nJust asked my son what he liked - Korean kalbi ribs and the mac and cheese.  He said he didn't like the pistachio shots, flan, and tamales.  He's 18 and jobless so he shouldn't be so picky."

S'An amazing buffet!\nThis buffet is one of the best tasting and organized. This buffet is shaped in a snake formation going from one end to another it starts off with your simple salad and the more you go in the more variety of food you will run into.\n\nThis buffet is very family friendly but yet looks quite professional at the same time. The waiters and waitresses are indeed very kind and friendly as well as some of the chefs themselves. \n\nI stayed at Las Vegas for 3 days and all 3 days I was there I ate at a buffet and I would say that Studio B and the M was definitely the best tasting.\n\nThough they do not have many sushi options but only a few. The taste of the sushi really stands out from other buffets, which makes up for the amount of sushi.\n\nWhile you are here I suggest everyone to visit the dessert section which is separated from the rest of the buffet.\nThe desserts there are the best you will taste! Most buffets here at Las Vegas, Nevada has a decent amount of desserts but Studio B has more desserts then the rest plus the taste is wonderful! A must try!\n\nAlso you do not have to pay for your drinks, It is free!\nEven including alcohol!\n\n5 stars for the wonderful taste!'

S"My FAVORITE buffet in Vegas ... and it's not even on the strip!!\n\nYou know that random buildling about 10 miles from the strip that looks like it's out of place? YUP, welcome to the M resort! Before coming here, I've heard some pretty amazing things about this place and my friends and I FINALLY got off our lazy butts and drove here. BOY WAS IT WORTH IT. \n\nFirst, UNLIMITED and PAID FOR (included in the buffet price) amount of champagne and crab and lobster?!?! Uhhh, YES PLEASE. Second, the food variety here is AMAZING. This was pricey - $50/60 per person - but it is REALLY really worth it. Come on ... unlimited portions of these?! Score! We literally stayed here for about 2-3 hours just eating mounds of seafood and drinking glasses of champagne and mimosas over and over. NOM. \n\nLike I said, the other food choices are also extremely delicious. I LOVED the quinoa (my new favorite food!) and veggies. Everything was extremely fresh and the line for the seafood was actually NOT long. We were lucky to not wait in line since our friends held the table for us, but the line seemed a bit long ... though it looked like it was moving pretty fast. \n\nThis buffet is spacious and able to hold LARGE parties - we had a party of about 10-12 and we just scooted tables together with no complaints. \n\nI'm pretty much in love with this place ... but WHY does it have to be so far from the strip!? :( It really is the only inconvenience ... but I guess if you're a gambler, the casino is pretty nice. So after you've stuffed yourself silly, go ahead ... gamble! We actually came up about $100 when we stopped by. Try your luck ;)"

S"Came on a Friday nite at 6 and we got in at 8, the line is huge! $37 per person, all you can eat, all you can drink, although I started tipping the lady who pours drinks after my 4th glass of champagne. Booze is cheap wine and champagne and some 4  beers on tap. All kinds of food you can think of and most people indulge in tons of crab legs. You can sense the smell of buffet, but that's almost every buffet and I would say that this one is one of the cleanest in Vegas. Also I'm not a big fan of buffets, the food is cheap meat and vegetables cooked with who knows what to make them taste good, but that's just me. We had fun with friends and enjoyed the drinks and 2 of the friends won big, big bucks gambling in the M Resort that night, so I would say that it was a good night!"

S'We\'d been meaning to come here for forever and finally decided to give it a go last night. \n\nMy first thought was that the entry process is well organized. Unlike other buffets, which will keep on ringing people up despite the line to be seated being so long that there\'s nowhere for the newly paid customers to stand, the process was orderly and quick. \n\nThe food is delicious. I found the quality to be on par with the Bellagio buffet. And the variety of food was excellent. There was a ton to try. Among my favorites: General Tso\'s chicken, spicy salmon rolls, the tiny bratwursts, shredded pork and the pesto salmon. For the first time ever, I went back to the dessert area for seconds. There were a million little cookies, meringues, tarts, slices of cake, plus crepes and gelato. The crepes aren\'t made to order, but they were tasty (I had two). The gelato was great. \n\nI do have a couple of complaints. The first regards the layout of the buffet. It takes the shape of a very bulbous bell curve, with the "top" of the curve poking out into the middle of the room. It\'s kind of awkward to walk around and it tends to be a long walk back to your table if you\'re on the opposite side of the curve. There should be a path "underneath" the curve to cut out a lot of unnecessary walking (I love exercise as much as the next person, but this is a buffet....the less time you have to spend juggling plates and trying not to run into people, the better). My second issue is that none of the "cuisine areas" are labeled. It would have been helpful to see quickly where the Asian food or the carving station or the salads were, rather than having to walk the whole buffet line to figure it out.\n\nAll in all, it was worth the $24 per person, but due to the layout, I don\'t know that I\'d go back anytime soon.'

S"This is must stop buffet place when I come to Vegas.  \n\nThere is several varieties of food to pick from.  Sometime on the food it is hit or miss, depending on if you get it fresh or if it has been sitting out for a while.  Try to get in line early for the crab legs and seafood, because the line gets long.  The price here is pretty good ($15.99 lunch), we came during lunch time and stay until dinner but paid the lunch price.  I only suggest this if you don't have plans or if you have time to kill.  Plus, there is unlimited wine, beer, and champagne, for those who are of age.  I love the dessert selections and enjoy the gelato here.\n\nIf you don't mind driving away from the strip for a couple hours this is a good buffet to go to."

S"This buffet wins me over by the quality of food it presents, and the price that it offered ($14.95 during weekday lunch hour, what a steal!)\n\nI visited during weekday lunch hour and the line was not very long.  We were seated quickly (~15-20 mins). The dining room itself is very, very grand.  The way they designed makes you feel that you are surrounded by foods, in a good way (Foods were easily accessible, you just need to reach your hand out).  I had enough space between me and my neighbors, which is a nice thought.  There's a real studio on site where they film the show on certain dates.  \n\nService is on the spot.  Our plates were taken out routinely and the drinks were refilled as soon as we finished it.  You can tell the level of service is high here and people do work hard compare to some other buffets on the strip.\n\n* Drinks are free (White/Red/Imported Beer) +++ for some alcohol lovers!!\n\nThe food:  So many to choose from.  Got the standard world cuisine fare.  I tried at least one bite on most of the items,  more on some particular items.  I have to say the foods were all well presented and the taste is in between above-average to excellent for a buffet restaurant. \n\nSome of my personal favorites during lunch hours were their fried items (Chicken, Shrimp), steak, italian station, their Ox Tail Soup is phenomenal.  Steak is decent, and I liked their salad and sushi station. Its actually better than some non-Japanese operated Sushi buffet in town!   I also liked the fact they have lots fresh cut fruits so I can get some fibers without cutting /preparing it.\n\nDessert station is another highlight of this buffet.  There are so many to choose from.  Cakes, Fruit Tarts, Mousses, Cookies, Macaroons.. They made it infront of you, and this is the same items that are selling at the M resort cafe at the entrance of the Casino area.  I also LOVE their gelato.  Made from scratch daily, 18 flavors to choose from , plus the toppings of your choice.  I tried most of them , and the only place that have smiliar quality in terms of dessert was Wynn, but they don't have as many varities as Studio B buffet, and you are paying much more $ for it. \n\nFeel stuffed? There's also fresh pressed espresso/coffee that's made to order!  Whoever designed/organized this buffet should be awarded for their thoughfulness.  Without this attractive buffet, I think  M resort would lose alot of clients due to their geographic locations (about 10 miles from the strip).\n\nGive this place a try! You will be agree with me and other voters (with our pocket money) that this is THE BEST BUFFET of Vegas in 2010!"

S"came here at 2 pm on a friday so we could get the lunch price of $15.99 and eat dinner food which started at 2:30 pm. i guess a 100 other people had that idea too. i was glad they honored lunch price for everyone in line before 2:30. finally sat down at 4 pm. line moved slow but the buffet looked empty. that was annoying. \n\n- seafood was nothing special\n- prime rib was really good\n- sushi looked old and there was no sashimi\n- sadly my favorite thing was the asian bbq ribs\n- free beer and wine\n- desserts bar was huge\n\noverall, for $15.99 this buffet was worth the money. but if i had to pay the $40 reg price, i'd be sadly disappointed."

S"The food is very good quality for a buffet.   However, the price has been increased and the crab legs are now cut in half.   So, if I had rated them months back, I would have given 5 stars.  Now, the price is higher and the crab quality is lower.   When they cut the crab in half (which I'm sure is being down to reduce waste), it drys it out.  Not as good as it used to be.   4 stars for now.   I'm sure it will be lower in the future."

S"Seafood buffet is offered during the weekends (Fri, Sat & Sun) for $39.99 which also includes beer and wine. There are lots of different varieties of food, but I came for the seafood so that's all I tried.\n\nThe oysters on the half shell were disappointing. They were stacked on top of each other in a huge pile over ice so bits of grit and shell were mixed into the oysters. \n\nThe crab legs were split open for easy eating and served over ice. They weren't salted enough during cooking so they were a bit bland. \n\nBaked mussels tasted spoiled, but the steamed mussels were good.\n\nPili-pili shrimp was cooked well and  the sauce was tasty.\n\nClams and salmon were decent. Fried shrimp tempura was crispy and good. \n\nThe buffet also had Prime rib which was well seasoned and delicious. Served with au jus and horseradish cream sauce, yummy!\n\nAll the deserts were sooooo good. Little bite sized pieces of everything were perfect after stuffing myself with all that seafood."

S'.., This is definately a must in everyone\'s buffet sex life. Word of mouth spread across our group that the M resort had I believe 2010\'s best buffet in Vegas. \n\nThat was enough for my gf Diane & I to dive in. We were celebrating her brother Michael\'s birthday for the 4th of July. Her family had already been here a few times already & had waited up to 2 hrs. to get in. \n\nGiven it being a weekday, especially a day after a major holiday. We expected the line to be shorter than usual. It was only $13 per person, so I really suggest you hit this on a weekday. The line moved fast so we were seated within a half hr. \n\nThe set up in the place is awesome! Swanky, hip, & sexy, whoever did the decor @ Studio B, I applaud you. I can\'t even properly explain how to describe the set up because I\'m not a fashionable architectural guru. But I will promise you that you will like it. Modern but cozy, with about a hundred or so tv\'s that work in unisen to make a huge screen up on top of one side of the buffet. \n\nThe buffet itself has an ecclectic variety of food. From Pad Thai to meat loaf, carne asada & sushi. \n\nHere\'s what I had:\n\nscrambled eggs- awesome!\ntons of bacon- awesome!\nbbq ribs- tasty, but not mind blowing\nchile verde-  was ok\nmeatloaf-  was ok\nkorean bbq ribs- my favorite thing from the buffet, superb, great flavor!\npineapples, cantelope, honey dew - all fresh & tasty\nmacaroni salad- tasty\nbreakfast sausage- very tasty\npizza bread- tasty\npeach w/ cottage cheese- was ok\n\nThe dessert was what really put everything over the top. I would have given this place a 4 star review, but yeah those desserts were amazing. \nI had:\n\ncannolis-delicious\necclairs-delicious\npistachio gelato- delicious\nraspberry crepes- delicious\nflan- delicious\ncream puffs- delicious\n\nThey even had free beer on tap. I left here feeling really really satisfied. Especially hearing David Bowie\'s "Ziggy Stardust" while I was in line @ the dessert section. That totally gave them "cool points" from me. Bowie @ buffets? Haha alright alright, what else do you have? Check this place out, I\'m sure you\'ll find something worth coming back to.'

S"The quality of this buffet has gone WAY down and prices way up since the first time I came here in late 2010.  I ate here with my bf on my way back home from Vegas for brunch and it was $44 per person, not including gratuity.  Price included unlimited mimosas, wine and beer, which wasn't optional.  This price is a RIP OFF, seeing that you can eat Bacchanal, Wynn or Cosmo buffet for around the same price for DINNER.  The food was in no way even close to what they serve at those places.  I think if the price was cut in half, I might have given it one more star.  \n\nFood:  \nSelection is decent.  There is your salad and soup areas, bfast section with an omelette station, seafood with crab legs, cocktail shrimp and oysters, sushi, prime ribs and steak, and Asian food section including kbbq and Chinese noodles.  The have a small dessert section, and I say small in comparison to Wynn's and the like.  I really liked that they had an espresso machine where the barista could make you a fancy caffeinated drink.  \n\nQuality is just bad.  Crab legs are tiny and the meat is meager.  There is a slight aftertaste that I hate, which comes from not-so-fresh crabs.  The prime rib looked too well-done and the steak was also overcooked and just wasn't appetizing.  The rice on the sushi rolls were rock hard so I took off the rice and ate just the nori and the filling.  The lobster bisque was the worst I've ever had - can't really call it lobster bisque if there is no lobster in it.  Oysters were handled without much afterthought by the person putting them on the buffet line, and were not fresh.  Just anything I put on my plate, i took a bite of and gave up.  Even the chocolate souffle tasted like semi-wet chocolate flavored baby powder.  I felt bad for wasting all that food.  \n\nAfter the 2nd plate, I almost wanted to ask for my money back.  \n\nIf you are in Vegas and want to do the buffet thing, stick to Wynn, Cosmo, or Bacchanal."

S"Many of our friends have recommended this buffet (with high regards) so we tried the Seafood Buffet last saturday for lunch. The promotion is 2-for-1 pricing for iMagine card holders, until December 18. There was a large line but it went fairly quick. My husband played his free play of $5.00 (initial gift when getting the card- your choice of the free play or a t-shirt) while I stood in line. The majority of people in line were Asian. And the line proceeded to get longer and longer, even as we exited the buffet. Also worth mentioning, prior to eating here, we've eaten at the Cafe and Baby Cakes (yummy gelato). \n\nLet me preface by saying that there is fairly large seating here- booths and tables- I was amazed at the size of the buffet as well as the ambiance (let's be honest, the typical casino buffet lacks ambiance). We were seated on the farthest end- we had a pretty view- it's unusual in that most casinos and buffets omit clear windows and views. I was facing the window so the people's faces looked like shadows, but that was ok. There was also a demonstration area but it was a little secluded. Our server Solangel was very attentive (kept our drinks refilled) and busy carrying off a large platter of dirty plates and glasses.  \n\nI had to be picky because there was an enormous plethora of selections: snow crab legs, sushi rolls, nigiri, oysters on the half shell, peel and eat shrimp, fried shrimp, fried fish, paella, carvers: mahi mahi, prime rib, turkey, and chicken, asian grill, custom omelettes, greek food, italian, sweet potato mash, bread, salads, and fresh fruit. I completely avoided all the heavy foods. I sampled the baba ganoush (it's good- but my hubby didn't like it), asparagus (crisp tender, not overdone), mahi mahi (ok- not the same when one you're so used to getting it fresh elsewhere; at least it wasn't fishy), okra wrapped fish (so tender- I almost debated getting another piece but I resisted but maybe next time...), peel and eat shrimp, crab legs- I think we found our favorite place for crab legs (sweet, fresh, and just enough salt)- not a surprise that this was the majority of our meal, mussels and clams (good), teriyaki chicken (yummy sauce using ), caprese salad, pineapple (very sweet). It's almost impossible to try everything here- because there is so much! Also, note that some dishes are not typical of the average casino buffet like Chicken Adobo (Filipino). Everything is top notch here. The price is slightly higher but it's worth it!\n\nThe dessert station was equally impressive; also where you get the gelato and coffee- the line can get pretty long since it's just one station, but the wait is not bad. Different kinds of macaroons, assorted cookies, creme brulee, flan (very good), tiramisu, chocolate souffle (yummy), carrot cake, chocolate cake, fruit tart- are what I remember- I'm sure I'm missing some others though. I had the peanut butter gelato while my husband had the coconut gelato. I wanted to try many other desserts but the portions aren't small enough- it'd be perfect if some of them were petit fours size, then I wouldn't feel so bad about consuming all those calories. I know, I'm at a buffet, just go with it.\n\nI highly recommend this buffet to locals and tourists alike, but get the iMagine card in order to take advantage of the promotions. There is something for everyone. Beer and wine is included at lunch and dinner- have you ever heard of that? I cannot stress enough that this is simply not the typical run-of-the-mill boring casino buffet; it's so much better, in so many ways, from the taste of the food, to the offerings, to the ambiance. I would even say that there are elements that make it a gourmet experience."

There was surprisingly no wait for our party of 7, possible because of the fact that it was a Sunday and the Rock and Roll marathon was taking place.  There is a good variety of food- salads, pizza, asian, soups, prime rib and of course seafood.  Desserts also had a good variety.\n\nService was variable throughout the night.  Despite it not being too busy, we found that we would be out of drinks and our plates would be stacking up pretty fast."

S'there\'s a lot of mixed reviews about studio b buffet being both good and bad. you figure that showing up saturday for dinner, you\'d get the better end of the spectrum. eh.\n\nhere\'s the lowdown:\n-king crab legs [both warm and cold] were a tad bit too salty. the forked plastic tool used to assist in yanking out the meat did not help but at least the crabs were pre-cracked [standard these days, anyhow]. just give me a pair of chopsticks, and i can do wonders.\n\n-oysters. no mignonette sauce. aahhhhhhhh! these were definitely not the best, but at least they were somewhat still fresh. since i love "me" some oysters, the majority of my plate[s] consisted of these clam shells - with lots and lots of lemon juice. \n\n-prime rib was somewhat decent. i\'m not a big fan of prime rib anyhow, but i\'d agree with Pauline C. that it\'s above buffet quality standards.\n\n-the rest of the fillers were typical. after a few samples, i didn\'t even bother with the rest. sometimes you can tell how good or bad something is simply by looking at it [or smelling it in my case].\n\nthe dessert - probably the only reason why the ratings are so high i\'m not a dessert person, but i somehow ended up partaking in a few delicacies. i caved for the presentation alone and indulged in what looked like a chocolate and vanilla mousse cup and gelato. yum!\n\nmy conclusion - it\'s overrated. skip the buffet, and go for something nicer altogether for the same price. your stomach may not be as full but your body will thank you later for it.'

S'Came for lunch on a Monday, Nov 8, 2010.  Walked away happy and full.\n\nThe buffet is located in M Resort, which is off the strip, but it\'s a very nice place.  My draw dropped at the price -- $15.  There was no line (it was a Monday after all).  The cashier lady was super nice, and asked if it was our first time (it was mine, not my date\'s).  She explained that there is a beer and wine bar - all you can drink!\n\n(No thanks though, I\'d rather fill up on FOOD)\n\nI\'m having trouble recalling the decor in detail, and I didn\'t really take pics of the place... I remember it being a very expansive dining hall, slightly reminiscent of a very upscale cafeteria.  Sorry, I\'m sure that didn\'t sound appealing, but, like I said, I\'m having trouble.\n\nI do remember giant screens with food show clips and commercials (situated above the food counters).\n\nAnyway, I would describe the food as very fresh and flavorful.  I remember thinking each plate was at least decent to very good... none that were a miss.  The selection is smaller than Rio, but the quality more than makes up for it.  I would say it\'s almost as good as Bellagio\'s... and considering its price, it has knocked Bellagio from the #1 spot for best buffet in Vegas, imho.\n\nGo, try it out.  This place has my stamp of approval.\n\nOh yea, and they give you nice thick napkins!! (read my other buffet reviews from the "buffet of buffets" trip)'

S'On the way to Vegas you see signs of "M - Voted Best Buffet in Las Vegas", something I wanted to see for myself!\n\nI was invited to have a buffet here in Studio B, and most buffets make money off of their alcohol. Studio B has beer and wine as part of the buffet. On to the selection, it is HUGE. Anyone walking in will find something they want. I tried almost every dish on the menu, and it was good. So far it\'s the best Vegas buffet I\'ve been to. It\'s really clean, and you can see that they emphasize a lot on the quality. The prime rib was delicious and tender, they have snow crabs, and a lot of selections that are virtually unheard of in your standard Vegas buffet.\n\nMost Vegas buffets have a reputation for quantity over quality, but as I heard from one of my acquaintances, when M opened they really wanted to provide the quality of the buffet and they didn\'t just want regular people coming in to take as much as they wanted but to actually TASTE the food & come out satisfied with that quality. Recently though, he said that the quality isn\'t as good as when it first opened, but still better than most.\n\nA lot of value for your money if you do choose to dine here.'

S"Despite the 2-hour wait (yay, Friday evenings), I am giving this place five stars. I had a crabload of crab to make the best of the $33.99, and the warm crab is so much better than the frozen cra(p) at many buffets. Even having to crack open the crab yourself isn't a problem, and it could be an advantage if you wanna slow down your pace.\n\nI have no idea why the Yelp reviews that I read didn't mention the strange utensil that they provide to crack the crab, but yeah... it's actually pretty cool once you figure out that you have to find the soft parts of the shells (crack toward the wide sides, not the hard corners). Oh, and make sure the pointy end goes in.\n\nMore importantly.. . rum raisin gelato! Most of the other flavors that I tried were great (mango, chocolate chip, strawberry, peanut butter), but rum raisin has always been my favorite. The stuff at this buffet has like 5x the raisins as Haagen Dazs. Heck, pretty much all of the gelato here is way better than any ice cream and most desserts at Vegas buffets. I just wish I had a chance to try the coffee flavor before it ran out, but I guess I'll live... or come back.\n\nWine was decent and beer was fine according to tablemates. Orange juice was way too sweet, so ask them to give you half a glass or something so you can pour your drinking water into it until it's no longer orange sugar water. I enjoy sweet things, but not like this...\n\nOther things to try: roast beef tri-tip (pink-er = tender-er), korean BBQ (flavor might be smeared on but texture is good), osso bucco (broken-down marrow and cartilage somehow are awesome)\n\nStuff to skip: sushi (looks like crap compared to real sushi buffets), anything starchy (too filling), anything you'd find at a fast food place (pizza, fries, much of the Asian area... looking at you) \n\nFinally, please go earlier than I did."

S"Before Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon, the buffet at M resort was probably my second favorite after Wynn and Bellagio.  Nowadays, the buffet list has shifted a bit as Bacchanal is king for me.  However, the M resort buffet is still a very good buffet. It's usually the buffet I go either on the way into Vegas or on the way back home since it's nowhere near the strip.  It's also the only buffet that I've been to that includes beer, wine, or champagne without an upcharge.  The selections here are your typical premium buffet options such as crab legs, sushi, a carving station, good dessert bar, etc.  It's clean and I like that there's a lot of room to maneuver around the food stations.  Come here and stuff your face before you head back to Cali."

S'Studio B did satisfy every craving I had from BBQ to seafood (delicious) and they provide FREE beer and wine for dinner. However, their line is ridiculous. Not because of the alcohol, but because their dining room is small. My family and I waited in line for about 3 hours to be seated. We do not have to wait this long in the other buffets on the strip. Each time we attempted to give up and leave, the line started moving, so we decided to stay. There are 3 lines after you pay. 1 is for VIP, 1 is for parties of 5 or more, and the other is for 4 or less. My advice is to keep track of the groups around you because people like to take advantage of the line just to be seated asap. Parties of 3 were in the 5 or more line and were going to be seated before us (party of also 3) and we were there before them. My mother was livid and blew up on the seating hostess because they are not paying attention to the amount of people in the proper lines. We were sat before the other party of 3, but still! How many other parties did they do that to?? I do not recommend Studio B if you are starving because the wait will make everything worse.'

S"After reading all of my friends' reviews, I feel compelled to write a novel about how amazing Studio B really is. However, I don't think that will do it any justice, so I will keep it nice and short.\n\nIf you're driving home from Vegas and you didn't get the chance to experience a Vegas buffet, this is the perfect place. Just make sure you come EARLY, as the lines fill up fast. Around 10 a.m. should do.\n\nThere are no words to describe how bad of a food coma I got after coming here. I've been to a lot of buffets around the world, and I would have to give this #2 on my list (nothing beats the Singapore Hyatt buffet). Have you ever seen a buffet so huge that you can walk work off a good amount of what you ate just by walking around and looking for more food? \n\nThe selection here is PHENOMENAL. You really have to pace yourself, though, and try everything first. Then, you get what you really want. The Chinese food section is nothing special, so you can avoid that right away. Just make sure to load up on crab legs.\n\nDesserts: HOLY SHIT. Whatever you do, save room for them. Even if you don't have room, walk around, go the bathroom, let everything out, and come back. The price you pay for your entry here will not be worthwhile if you don't indulge in the desserts. \n\nOne thing I never realized is the free wine and beer, which I've only seen at a buffet on a boat in Finland. \n\nTo sum it up, I didn't eat for 2 days after coming here. My friends and I invented a new term for the level of awesomeness that you achieve after experiencing Studio B: stomach raging."

S'The BEST chicken & waffles I\'ve ever had in my life. Roscoe\'s can suck it!\n\nI was guided here by Yelp after searching for some nearby breakfast foodstuffs. Reviews were solid, and they spoke of portions so huge they were legendary. Finding it inside the Imperial Palace was a little tricky, but a helpful security guard guided us while he told me about how "you can\'t go wrong with anything" in regards to what I should order. We got seated no problem - must have come during a lull. \n\nMy eyes immediately locked on the Sage Chicken & Waffles once I was presented with the menu. Two succulent fried breasts of chicken placed atop a tower of four bacon waffles, coated in syrup. Call a cardiologist because I was ready to risk a heart attack for this meal. \n\nOf course, I can\'t have a big breakfast meal without a suitable beverage. Enter the B.L.T. Mary, a 20 oz. Bloody Mary made with bacon-infused vodka, all the usual fixings, and garnished with a strip of bacon, romaine lettuce and a tomato slice. It also came with a single piece of white toast that my gf noted looked like a large Melba toast. I opted out of eating it, though. \n\nGood thing, too, because my jaw went slack when she brought out my order. The portion was gargantuan. I quickly dove in. The chicken tasted like something sweet had been added after the deep-frying, making it ridiculously savory in addition to being extremely succulent. The waffles were so chock full of bacon that it was protruding from every seam. The combination of chicken, waffle and syrup was the experience I wanted to have at Roscoe\'s, but never got. The flavors were so good that I drove myself to finish off both breasts and 3 of the waffles entirely. After that, I was certain my stomach was about to explode. \n\nMy gf got the "basic two eggs with potatoes, bacon and fruit" for $6.95, but there was nothing basic about it. The plate was huge, and she could barely finish it off. Even their most unassuming items are still enough food for two. Total out the door was about $35, and worth every single penny. I\'ll be making this my go-to breakfast spot in Vegas from now on.'

The waiter said the chicken Benedict is most ordered and was also on Man vs Food. He ordered the Chicken Benedict and within minutes the monstrosity came out. It was an epic proportion and I can see why this was on Man vs Food. Our waiter told us all the plates were huge! (It is for 2-3 people to share!)\n\nI'm not a big eggs Benedict person, so I wasn't very enthusiastic when my friend said he needed help. The layers of mashed potatoes, biscuits, bacon, eggs, fried chicken topped with cheese and chipotle sauce was messy, sloppy and did not look appetizing at all. \n\nI squeamishly tried to get some of everything at an angle. I started with mash potatoes and it was somewhat good. Much better than what I expected.  \n\nFor the portions and the price, it is worth it for the strip."

S"I was soooo excited to eat here.  I had it on my list and was making sure I was not going to leave Vegas without trying it. It was easy to find.  Just head straight through the Imperial Palace until you hit the escalators.  We were are very hungry after a night of drinking and dancing and hoped to not have to wait too long to get seated.  It was pretty busy and also a Friday morning.  We were pleasantly surprised to get seated promptly in a nice comfy booth.  I ordered coffee and it came quick enough and was quite delicious.\n\nOne thing that stuck out in my mind as odd was the waiter told us right off the bat that the kitchen does not have any heat lamps, so the food is served out as soon as it's made. I thought OK, great, that means we will have our food quickly.  Eh, not so much.   Our food took a bit to come out.  It wasn't excessive but we definitely waited longer on our food than we did to get a seat.\n\nDue to knowing the portion sizes are enormous we decided to split plates.  My dining partner and I chose the HH original Benedict.  It comes with bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, and is topped with a roasted red pepper cream as well as two eggs.  Additionally it sat on top of a split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes. The potatoes reminded me of the potato pancakes my mom would make when I was a kid with leftover mashed potatoes-nice and golden browned and quite tasty. That was probably the best thing about the Benedict.  The bacon was good too, but hey it's bacon.\n\n Now for the not so good, the eggs were underdone and the parts of the white were still clear.  That kind of thing doesn't bother me, but I would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly.  The thing that was the biggest bummer was that the food was luke warm.  So I guess the no heat lamp thing doesn't necessarily work to their advantage because my food had to have sat back there for a bit before arriving to the table because it was not hot.  Also, the fresh tomato and spinach did not bring anything to the table.  Had the spinach been slightly sauteed or wilted and seasoned, it could have been a different story.  I think having those put on top of the Benny just made it even colder in temp.  Also, the whole thing was under-seasoned.  \n\nThe red pepper cream tasted like roasted red pepper bisque that was under-seasoned and cold.  I really do like the concept of having a Benedict topped with lighter ingredients and sauce, but it was all cold and under-seasoned and disappointing.  I kept going back to the bacon, egg and crispy mashed potatoes.  I will say that I was able to split this with another person and between the two of us couldn't even finish it.  Our bill came to $12 each, and I was very happy, and even though it was underwhelming, it was still worth it for the price.\n\nMy other friends ordered the Bananas Foster French toast-also huge, as well as the Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato and fresh spinach hash.  My friend did not like her hash at all.  I tried it and agreed with her that it was completely under-seasoned.  I hate having to add salt at a restaurant.  I think it should come out seasoned correctly.  Also the salt shaker had course salt in in that barely came out the holes in the shaker-a huge pet peeve of mine.  The bananas foster was huge but nothing out of this world.  What I did really like though was the split banana topped with sugar and bruleed.  It was so delicious and the banana developed a very creamy texture.  It was served still in the peel, which I thought was pretty cool.\n\nOverall, the value is great, and the quality is also good.  I can only base this review on the one visit I made here, and there were definite flaws in the execution of the food.   Although the plates are huge, impressive looking, the taste is what matters most, and it unfortunately was lacking.  However, on a whole, due to the value of the food and he fact that one plate can be split between two people, I would like to go back and prove that Hash House can really live up to its hype."

The staff from my experience is always on point. Not only does my server check on me, but so do busboys and managers. Service is always a plus here from experience. I have eaten everything on the menu from the breakfast side already and can't tell you a bad one. This place is known traditionally for their hash and eggs dishes with the side of fluffy big pancakes. The highlights here for me are the steak and eggs with the cheese cooked inside the steak, the breakfast cheese quesadilla. the fried chicken and waffles with the bacon cooked inside the waffle itself and of course the signature Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (Man vs. Food). All the food is flavorful because this place puts it's own twist to each dish. The portions are epic, definitely come here early eat, and take home your leftover for lunch.

We ordered the Chicken Benedict and it was a wonderful combo of mashed potato, biscuit, egg, chicken, spicy gravy, spinach, and perfectly fried chicken. I may have missed another ingredient because they were piled on each other like a mountain. I usually don\'t like this form of "plating" (if you can call it that). Yet, everything worked and was perfect. I enjoyed it so much, I came back for breakfast... brunch... lunch... linner? Don\'t judge me, we were just here at 3am... next meal... cut to 3 pm. Ordered the Trucker Breakfast and a Smore Mocha. Smore Mocha was yummy, just hard to drink bc of their "plating?" It was drenched in chocolate syrup (not the drink, but the cup). I had to rip the cup of the plate bc the syrup glued the two pieces together. It wasn\'t discouraging enough to take any stars off their rating though. The waffle with banana was AMAZING.

S"This place was not bad. The lower rating is mostly due to the wait and location. We went on a Sunday around 1. First of all finding the place is a bit odd. Then once you get there there was about 50+ people waiting in the waiting area. Our wait to get seated was over an hour. Once we finally did sit down our order got taken quickly but we waited another good 30 minutes or more for food. And even saw parties seated after us get food first. I had the fried chicken Benedict and husband had the chicken and waffles. The food was good. Nothing extraordinary, nothing to wait in line for over an hour for but if I was able to get in fairly quickly I would go back. I think the hype is more for the portion size. HUGE! Definitely easily shared between 2-3 people. This place is open 24 hours so definitely could see this as a great after party choice or hungover breakfast spot. Since it was later in the day I didn't see either. The place is loud. Really loud. So if you're looking for a relaxed place to grab some breakfast go elsewhere."

S"poor service brought down the rating and overshadowed the food\n\nour server came and gave us our menu and asked what beverages we would like. that was where the decent service ended. \n\nthere was a question at our table about if there was a smaller portion of the hash and he said no with an attitude. \n\nwhen asked where were the lemons for the water he said i'll get it later in a very PISSED OFF TONE which i thought was just from it being busy but all the things that happen after that was just too much. if the lemon was part of the beverages shouldn't it come out at the same time as the beverages. it's not like i'm going to acid the eggs. \n\nwhen the lemons came out there was a FINGERNAIL STUCK TO THE RIM of the cup, so we asked another staff to give us new lemons. that was gross!!!!!! even he said it was disgusting.\n\ni didn't see a split charge stated on the menu. when we said we will share, our server told us that there will be a $2.50 split charge fee per person with a bit of an attitude. \n\nwhen we asked for napkins he TOSSED it onto the table like a FRISBEE. \n\nthe potato was good. crispy and not too oily. it was served in an iron skillet along with scrambled eggs, biscuit, and some fruits. the eggs lacked salt, but i think they purposely do that so customers can add their own salt. \n\nthe orange juice is not freshly squeezed. it's from a container, but we didn't see the brand. \n\nafter the bill was taken care of we had a talk with the manager and it was awkward when he was taking our plates while the manager was still there. \n\nto be fair the others who brought us our plates were nice, but our assigned server was the primary issue. \n\nfood - 3 stars\n\nservice from assigned server - negative 10 stars on a -10 to 10 scale\n\nservice from others were ok so 3 stars"

S"When you get in you kind of feel like you're a cattle herded up a rickety old escalator and into a small rectangular room with no windows. \n\nHowever you're greeted with some jolly hosts in Pajamas and super hero gear, in what seems to be some kids dream/ nightmare. While you wait youare offered a mimosas and bloody marys. The bloody mary , costing 10 bucks is HUGE.\n\nWhen you sit down you'll notice the shoddy halogen lighting and lack of decor, but that all doesn't matter when you get your mountain of food.\n\nI would recommed just split one thing for two, or if you want to feel like a fat king or queen or prince or dutchess, just order one of these monster plates for yourself.\n\nFor vegas its more for taking photos, but at the same time you can pay a little more for a buffet. \n\nFood is solid and tasty. \n\nBut its nothing you can't find in a smaller portion at KFC or Dennys."

S"I love benedicts and I was craving a good been- I read some Yelp reviews and found Hash House A Go Go and decided that would be my breakfast place. I also looked online and the menu seemed delicious and I love fresh, organic and farm food. I ordered the HH Original benedict. I knew I would miss my hollandaise sauce but the roasted cream sauce sounded interesting. The service was great and the food comes out super fast. It was huge to my surprise. It was pretty bland to me and what makes it huge is the super enormous scoops of mashed potatoes and two fluffy biscuits. It's a total carbohydrate nightmare. I ate the sauce and the eggs and a few bites of potato with biscuit. But I still craved my traditional benedict that I originally had my heart set on. I should have ordered a scramble instead because there is a lack of protein in this dish. \nThis is in the Quad Casino and there is a lot of construction going on in the casino so it can be hard to find - just follow the signs or ask someone. \nIf you like carbs- then you will probably like Hash House A Go Go. This place will make you fat."

S"The sole reason we went here was because of the man vs. food coverage of the fried chicken waffle. It is tucked in the middle of the casino, but you see it clearly marked on the escalator going up.\n\nThe line was out the door even when it was only 11:30am. Wanting a quick brunch, we toiled around for 30min before been called. I was actually surprised that I did not see more people ordered the fried chicken waffle, but when ours arrived, people were asking to take pictures of our food. It was HUGE. Good thing we only ordered the fried chicken waffle between the two of us or we'd be lugging doggie bags with us for rest of the afternoon.\n\nGreat place to take people who haven't been."

S'My husband and I came here for breakfast to this location after trying to decide what we wanted to eat. We had ate at one of their other locations off the strip last year and were already prepared for the portions sizes. We opt to split one of their breakfast meals and were not disappointed. There is a small surcharge for plate sharing but at this place it is is well worth it. The banana brown sugar flapjack tasted very good and had chunks of bananas throughout. It reminded me banana nut crunch cereal. Make sure you have plently of time to waste. The service was very slow and took awhile to get refills on my coffee and water.'

S"I found this restaurant here on Yelp while looking for a decent brunch spot to visit solo.  This place apparently has made a name for itself on the Vegas Strip because there was a ridiculous wait. When I approached the hostess stand, there seemed to be a lot of confusion as to whether lil' ole me had to sign in and wait 2 hrs or if I could just go over to the bar that clearly had three seats available. After waiting 10 mins, I decided to be a dare devil and just take a seat at the bar against the hostess' direction (no way in heck I was waiting 2hrs by myself). When I sat at the bar, I was immediately greeted by a bartender who directed me to the awesome tropical mimosa on the drink menu. The mimosa was pretty darn tasty and I eventually ordered a second. The menu was extensive so it was kinda difficult to make a decision on one of the many fantastical dishes to try. I finally opted for the hardwood bacon & avocado scramble. As you can see from the photos, the portions here are HUGE so I wasn't able to finish the meal. My food was absolutely scrumptious and all of the other plates I saw come out looked great as well. Overall, it was a great experience but the wait kept it from being a solid five-stars."

S"I think this restaurant was the first one I bookmarked for our trip to Vegas. Huge portions, crazy menu, sold. The fact that we didn't have to travel off the strip to eat at it, was even better.\n\nWe made the epic trip down the strip to find this location. There seemed to be a huge lineup of people waiting for tables but we were told around 40 minutes for a table of 4. You're given your little buzzer (that doesn't work down on the casino floor) and then you wait. They both scream out your name and collect your buzzer, and if you're not there when they do so, off the list you go. Our wait was around that time but when it's 2pm and this is your breakfast, that time seems like an eternity.\n\nService was quite sparse, though our waiter was very nice. We placed our order for drinks and two came out right away, and the other two (bar beverages) took about 15 minutes. 15 minutes for a bottled beer and a margarita. Then we waited for our food and it must have taken close to an hour. The menu says that it make take a little while but after the wait for the table, this was a lot.\n\nI got a burger, stuffed with mushrooms and cheese, and a side salad. The burgers are huge and very messy to eat. Have lots of napkins! The meat isn't seasoned and so really it's just a very big average burger. The dressing on the salad was delicious and I think that was my favorite part of the meal.\n\nThe other meals at the table were fine but nothing was seasoned very well and it was all kinda meh. Portions are unnecessarily huge and they'll gladly box your leftovers up for you. Again, it took a long time for the bill to come and so by the time we left, it was after 4pm.\n\nIf you want to feed a family of 4 with one plate of food, this is your place. Prices are very reasonable but try to hit them at a slow time and be prepared to wait a long time for your food."

S"I had heard so much good stuff about Hash House A Go Go and couldn't wait to try here.  Unfortunately my first experience did not live up to the hype.  The service was great, but what I ordered was not.  I was really excited seeing everyone else in the place getting their big plates of food.  My mouth was actually salivating waiting to get my meal.  What I discovered is that I ordered the wrong thing on the menu.  My entr\xc3\xa9e looked terrible compared to everything else I saw.  I had ordered the Reuben sandwich with fries, and it was one of the funkiest tasting sandwiches I have ever eaten.  It tasted like bad pot roast on toasted, buttered slices of bread.  It was so inedible that I could only stomach about half of it.  I was super hungry when I got here, but I lost my appetite eating the sandwich.  The fries were okay, and were mainly what I filled up on.\n\nI heard the waiter tell someone that everything on the menu is good.  Not true!  The Reuben sucks!  Don't get it!  However, everything else looks good and I still want to give Hash House A Go Go another shot to see if it is really worthy of the hype."

S"Always read and heard reviews about this place serving up good breakfast. So I decide to stop by one morning for late breakfast while in vegas. Got here early and put our names down. Within the next 10 minutes or so the place filled up quickly and there was a long wait. Couple of my friends were running abit late so they didn't seat us since all the parties weren't there. So we kept getting pushed back till my friends arrive and they keep calling other parties before calling us. We were furious plus it doesn't help I was so hungry prior to getting there and one of my friends husband was on his lunch break. So the wait ended up being almost an hour, and the food was mediocre at best. Seriously? I got the waffles with eggs and the portions were pretty big but they tasted plain and  nothing special other than their portions being huge. But I prefer quality over quantity, esp vacationing in vegas. \n\nehhhhh next stop!"

S"I went to Hash House A Go Go for the first time in San Diego and had a fantastic plate of food with fantastic company. So when I was looking for brunch places in Vegas, and saw that it was conveniently located down the strip, I told my friends and family we were going there for brunch.\n\nWe arrived for a late brunch on a Saturday. At about 2:00 probably. And it looked like there was a long wait, but in fact the queue went by quite quickly. In fact, our friends weren't there yet, so we had to tell them that we weren't ready to be seated. However, since we waited quite awhile for them, we were first in the queue when they did come, so we got seated fairly quickly after they arrived.\n\nThe service is a bit hectic, but our server was really nice and helpful. We ordered Bloody Marys all around, and I opted for the BLT Mary. It comes with toast and a packet of mayonaiise and you get to build your own mini BLT with the garnish. Fun and tasty! Not the best Bloody Mary around, but big and strong enough to get the job done.\n\nI had the sage chicken benedict and it was really incredible. The other half ordered the chorizo hash and it was also really tasty. Just a lot of food. A lot. Like none of us finished our meals. But that's okay. It's not incredibly expensive for the food you get, and they weren't really in a rush to get us out so we got to chill out and have a good time.\n\nOur friends who are Vegas veterans (they live close by so get out here quite a bit) were impressed with my choice as they really enjoyed their lunch. I'd definitely come back and go to other locations. Maybe try something else. But their benedicts are so good, it would be hard for me to choose something else."

I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken with bacon mashed potatoes and a fried egg. The chicken was a bit dry and the mashed potatoes were bland. I also ordered a side of fried potatoes and sausage gravy, which ended up being uneaten because there's already so much food for one entree. Definitely don't recommend the fried potatoes though. They don't have much flavor to them.\n\nMy friends split the Chicken and Waffles and that was definitely a good idea. I really have no idea how one person can consume that much food in one sitting! The waffles were very soft and doughy, if you like that. I do so I really enjoyed them!\n\nEveryone at our table seemed to enjoy their food.

S"My first visit, and even though it's tucked away in the Imperial Palace casino, there can be a wait, with all the tables filled.  Seriously, don't know of many people who visit the Imperial Palace, other than elderly smoking slot jockies; the young crowd that walk through here are making their way directly to Hash House.  \n\nSo much food!  My buddy ordered the blueberry pecan pancakes, and it was big enough that the size overwhelms the entire plate~ seriously, and it's pretty damn good.  Whole pecans and blueberries tucked into a giant pancake.\n\nI ordered the house-smoked salmon with hash, and it was a disappointment.  The salmon was flaked into bits, mixed in with chunks of potato and bits of cream cheese.  I couldn't pick out too much in distinctive flavor from the salmon.  The huge biscuit is great, but I had to ask for a side of butter.  I was left wishing for waffles or french toast. Lots of food, and could easily have fed 2 people.  That goes for the drink too.\n\nLike, seriously, the Mocha S'Mores was too much for me, and they charge like $6.50 for it.  Would it kill them to halve the portion and the price?  I only drank half of it.  2 split graham cracker pieces, stuck in a caramelized marshmellow topping the mocha is how I'd describe.  Most kids could love it, but I found it too sweet.  Still, it's fun to look at.\n\nService is decent, considering the amount of traffic the restaurant gets.  Waitress was nice, and all smiles.  I wouldn't be a regular here, but I wouldn't mind revisiting to try something different.  I'll bear in mind I'm buying a meal and tomorrow's take home breakfast in one sitting."

S'I came here for one thing and one thing only, the Chickens and Waffles. I was sold after seeing the picture. It was the #1 thing I had to get when I was in Vegas. \n\nLittle did I know that they did not serve it on their late menu. I got sooooooooooo fucking pissed that my gf knew I was being like a kid and throwing a tantrum. What a FAIL! \n\nI had to make the best out of it so I decided I ended up getting the Indianas Favorites which came with Andys Sage Fried Chicken, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatos and a biscuit. \n\nThe fried chicken was awesome. Perfectly made and so moist. It wasnt all greasy like the chicken you would get from KFC. If you like bacon, you will love the mashed potatoes.The gfs blueberry pecan flapjack was delicious and pretty humongous. \n\nTheir 1 lb Angus burgers look mighty tempting also as I saw a few tables order them. \n\nOne of my favorite beers is offered here, Arrogant Bastard in a 24 oz bottle. Gotta love that. \n\nLastly I hated how this Hash House location is at Imperial Palace. This casino is just a complete fail. Ghetto as hell. Seriously do I have to take 2-3 different elevators just to get to the casino? Next time Im headed to 2nd Hash House location for my chicken and waffles. \n\nThere you have it, 2 reviews in one.'

S"At first I thought Hash House A Go Go was going to be a letdown, or just another diner type place that got over hyped. I mean, it was crazy crowded and we'd probably be neglected. To my delight, the reality was that the food was amazing and the service was above and beyond, thanks to our awesome server, Kai. \n\nWhen we arrived around 10 on a Saturday, there was a 30 minute wait. We expected as much, but I needed coffee desperately. The hostess said we could get some at the bar, so I sidled up and ordered from Kai, who informed me that the bar was first come first serve and encouraged us to hang out there. We soon found 2 stools and everything just kept getting better and better. My wife ordered a hazelnut latte to start. It was without any doubt the best hazelnut beverage I have ever tried. It tasted natural, actually like hazelnuts, and was just fantastic. \n\nAnd then the food came. All those reviews that tell you to split a plate with someone are right. Split a plate! I got the chicken and waffles, and they were as good as everyone else has already said. I can't recommend it enough. But there was more than enough food for 2 people on that glorious plate. The waffles had strips of bacon in them. Come on! So those were obviously great. And the chicken was perfect too. Fried just right, moist and tender, with crisp, savory breading. Pour some syrup on that pile of food and get ready to smile because you are in for a treat. This is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, and the price was a downright bargain by Vegas standards. Throughout, Kai checked in with us, bantered and generally made us feel comfortable, like we were with friends. Between the food, drinks, and the completely awesome service, Hash House nails it."

Split the chicken and waffles. Still couldn't finish it all. Also tried a couple of the scrambles that friends got, and were delicious. The biscuits were wonderful, too.\n\n+ Drinks were some of the best I've had, period, and the best we had in Vegas. We got the spiked watermelon lemonade, both juices fresh. It came in a glass that you get to keep and is actually super neat, and nice quality. The booze is something like 20 oz and strong - and that with the glass is $12.95. If you ask me, that is not bad. \n\nHeads up that it is in a super random spot in the middle of the Imperial Palace casino, so kinda hard to find.\n\nI would like to give a special shout out to our waiter. I will come back and add his name if I can find my receipt. He was so attentive, helpful, friendly, everything, had great suggestions, didn't mind that we asked him to take like 50 pics, offered to put the second watermelon lemonade we ordered for the road (because they were that good) into several cups so we could all share.

S"I have been to all the HHGGs in town, and finally got to try the IP location when my folks were in town for the weekend.\n\nWe went on a Saturday around noon, so I definitely knew there would be a wait. They quoted us 45 minutes, but it ended up being only about 25, which isn't bad. If you're at any decent breakfast place on the strip on a weekend, you'll have to wait. \n\nI typically enjoy going to the older properties to check them out and get a bargain drink, but with all the construction going on right now, the IP is hell to get in and out, plus the smokiness level is pretty high down in the casino. Luckily, HHGG has its own mezzanine-kind of level, which is all smoke-free.\n\nSince I'm with child over here, I didn't order a drink, but I did sample the Orange Crush (kinda like a mimosa with vodka and a salt rim) and the bloody mary (super spicy and very strong) - I thought they were both great! The bloody mary, especially, reminded me of something I'm definitely looking forward to after the baby is born in May!\n\nOn to the food. I almost always get something with fried chicken at HHGG, so this time I went for the fried chicken benedict. The chicken was excellent, as always - delicious sage breading, not too heavy, and no bones! They came on top of spinach, tomatoes, scrambled eggs, cheese, and a biscuit, with a kind of creamy chili sauce all over. Oh, and underneath, was a huge block of mashed potatoes, probably the equivalent of 2 large potatoes! My one complaint about the dish was that the biscuits were kinda dry and bland. The others in my party got the vanilla waffle, blue cheese burger, and rueben sandwich (which is called the pub crawl). I seriously loved the waffle and the pub crawl. The corned beef and sauerkraut were so delicious and flavorful, they totally complimented the rye bread, and I usually hate rye bread. I thought the burger was good, but nothing too exciting.\n\nYes, there is too much food! We were all super hungry (and the waffle was only like a half meal, since it comes by itself), and together we ate about 3/4 of everything. No problem - I love leftovers!\n\nPrices run from $8 for the waffle to $16 for the eggs benedict, which is all totally reasonable. The drinks are a little high at $14/ea for the specialty drinks, but that's definitely in line with typical strip prices.\n\nOnly drawback was the service. While friendly, our server seemed super rushed, and the kitchen took a while to get our food out."

That helped but the alcohol soaked in quick as I was super hungry.\nMy friends and I ordered 3 dishes.\n1. The popular fried chicken and waffles - this was very big and I liked the waffles, but  other than that I did not really find it to be awesome. The sage in the chicken is interesting and I guess that makes it special. The chicken was soft and not dry.\n2. Fried chicken benedict - this one was okay. Lots of cheese and I'm sad the egg was not poached, it was scrambled. Definitely did not stand out to me though.\n3. The salmon scramble with pesto, brie, and some other items. This one was good, I liked the scramble, though I was so full from trying all the other dishes I could barely finish this. The biscuit is very good too, like an oversized KFC biscuit. The potatoes it came with were okay.\n\nOverall, this place was good for a one time thing, I wouldn't really go back just b/c the wait is long, and the space is annoying b/c people are walking EVERYWHERE. \nThe food wasn't awesome, but if you like big portions for a decent price this is the spot for you!"

It's carb overload. (thats hard for me to say because I LOVE carbs).\n\nThe meal just started off on the wrong foot. I HATE spicy food, and I have a weak tolerance. I ordered the HH Original which is smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream and two basted eggs. All this over the biscuits and then over a huge pile of mashed potatoes. Reading this on the menu, there is no spice - safe for me to eat. Not so fast... when the plate comes it is decorated in a red sauce (which I was falsely led to believe was red pepper cream) and took a nice big taste of it and turned out to be hot sauce. It sent my taste buds into a frenzy and I really wish they would just garnish the plate with the actual red pepper cream instead of adding the hot sauce to the plate. It really ruined my taste buds for the rest of the meal. \n\nOverall, just disappointed. Not worth all the fuss."

I got a Hash House Quesadilla stuffed with potatoes, jalapenos, eggs & tomato with a chili cream. Ew. Why did I think this was going to be good? This thing was potatoes, really, not much else, smothering in this chili cream that was so not tasty.\nBut I came back. For the Snickers pancake. Which is a pancake, with Snickers pieces in it. Not original or very creative. Not very good either. The griddle makes the good part of the candy melt, and leaves behind a stick to your teeth part."

S'Seriously the best brunch spot in Las Vegas! This is such a popular spot that you almost always have to wait 30+ minutes for a table, but it\'s so worth it :) \n\nMy favorite item from here is the sage chicken and waffles. The waffles have BACON in them! And the chicken is just phenomenal! As you may have read from other reviews, these come in a HUGE portion. It\'s literally 3 meals for me, no joke! I\'ve also tried the blueberry flapjack. The flapjack is the size of a pizza!! It tastes like just your ordinary pan cake, so nothing special there. Something else I\'ve tried is their French toast. They should rename this "French bricks" because that\'s the size of these toasts!! I also love ordering the watermelon lemonade! So yummy! \n\nOverall, I LOVE dining at Hash House A Go Go :)'

S"Was packed on a Sunday afternoon.  Glad we came though.  Had Andy's chicken and waffle.  Bacon was infused in the waffles, so you can't go wrong.  The chicken had a sage flavor to it, and was nicely breaded.  The breading actually stayed on the chicken as you cut it, instead of falling apart.  Our waiter Jason was pretty cool.  It was busy, and you can tell he was in a rush, but took the time to split our checks.  Definitely a good stop for a foodie.  Portions are huge like everyone says.  I think 2 plates could have fed us 5 guys.  Try it out."

It's written in fine print on the bottom of their menu, along with a little notification that your food may take awhile to prepare because of it. (Our waiter quoted us 45 minutes for our food to be done after we ordered.)\n\nAs for the food though, I was pretty underwhelmed. We ordered the Chicken Benedict, Chicken and Waffles, a smoked salmon scramble and a chicken hash dish. The portions here are very large. Four dishes fed 7 girls, and we probably would have been just fine with 3 entrees instead of being greedy and adding the fourth.\n\nThe star of the show was the Chicken Benedict. Delish! The sauce and melted cheese... Mmm.. The flavor is different from your traditional Benedict with hollandaise sauce, and well worth your time. \n\nEverything else we ordered though kind of fell flat for me. Bland... Boring... A waste of my stomach space. I was looking forward to the chicken and waffles most but I had a few bites and abandoned it. \n\nThe wait to be seated and the wait to get your food is a little unbearable, especially when you're hungover from your Vegas shenanigans the night prior. But I would come back just for that benedict!"

I saw an episode of Man vs Food and while I was in Vegas, I figured this was a great spot to go to. \n\nThe wait wasn't too bad, around 15 minutes or so.\nI believe I got the truck driver sepcial.  They gave me one of the biggest pancakes ever.  I only ate a little more than half of the pancake and I was already out of it.  The sausages were quite good and the scrambled eggs were soft.\n\nI would give this place 5 stars, but the food is only spectacular because of the portions.  I honestly would get a take home box, but I don't want to hold that stuff around Vegas.\n\nI'll try to the sage fried chicken from Man vs Food next time.

I think they now know to never doubt the girl who constantly is checking Yelp for recommendations. \nI started my meal off with their HH Bloody Mary. Ooooooh, so good.... nice and spicy with a green bean and pickle garnish. Hells yes, pickle. BOMB. My friend opted for the BLT Mary, which came complete with a strip of bacon, a romaine leaf and a small piece of white toast. For reals? Yep.\nI had heard about the Sage Fried Chicken with Waffles (which my friend got and OMGOMGOMG... yeahhh), but knew myself better than to even attempt and instead got the roasted chicken scramble. I seriously love any type of omelet/scramble with chicken, and this was no exception for me. I chose the crispy potatoes... glad I did. The potatoes themselves weren\'t crispy, but they came with super-crispy bits of the potato skin that had come off in the cooking process. Nom nom nom. Those three words are actually the perfect description for this place.... so I will leave you Yelpers with..... Hash House A Go-Go (yes, even in Imperial Palace)=nom nom nom.'

It is actually inside the casino and up an escalator so don't bother looking for it from the strip. You'll just get lost. \n\nI came here with about 20 people (yea. 20.) and knew about the long waits but we were all willing to eat here. The hostess quoted us a 45 minute wait but surprisingly we were seated in ~25 mins despite the large amount of people in the lobby. I felt bad for the waitress though as she had to yell across the three connected tables to all twenty of us to explain the menu. She sounded like she was losing her voice but she had a very cheerful attitude nonetheless. \n\nPortions are ginormous so just share; I recommend it. I split the sage fried chicken Benedict with my gf and it was way more than enough. We also split the snickers pancake with another couple with us. The Benedict was very tasty and stacked high, about 7 inches in height, 12 inches if you include the rosemary sprigs sticking out of it. It could've been that we were starving and getting over our hangovers but it was an amazing combination eggs potatoes fried chicken gravy spinach and bacon. I'm glad we shared the pancake because it was huge as well, probably at 12-13 inches in diameter with chunks of snickers everywhere. Also very sweet so I only ate about 3-4 bites of it and had to stop.\n\nVery affordable assuming you split the dish with another person. Fyi the bathroom is downstairs in the casino area.  Definitely worth stopping to try it out unless you've been to the original one in sd."

Perfect complement considering it was 2am in the morning. on a separate visit, i had the salmon omlette which wasn't that great and was more on the fishy side and oily side(it was drenched with olive oil to cook the fish)  overall its a pretty awesome place. \nbtw. the chairs suck .. they've been ruined by fat butts, so you tend to sink into them in an uncomfortable way where your arms are a bit elevated ...

So, you'll have to come in, write your name down and then wait! We stayed at the Quad and wanted to come here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. When called them from our room, they said the wait time was 30min. So we came down to write our names to get on the wait list. And when we did, the lady said that the wait time was going to be 45min. We waited.\n\nFinally, our names were called and we took our hungry selves inside the restaurant. Here is what we ordered:\n - Coffee\n - Scrambles (Smoked chicken, sundried tomato pesto, spinach and goat cheese)\n - Waffle\n - Pancakes\n\nWe got the food 50 minutes after placing the order.

It gets crowded so expect the wait. I ordered their famous chicken and waffles, which looked extremely presentable and tasted very scrumptious. I like how creative the dish can be, adding in a bit of crispy bacon to the fluffy waffles and maple syrup to the crispy chicken. I tried to finish the meal as a whole, but I ended up bringing the rest to the hotel for later! Plus, I also ordered their gigantic BLT Bloody Mary, which turned out to be just as delicious. \n\nService was excellent at Hash House.

It doesn't fit in very well with Imperial Palace's oriental theme, but that didn't stop us from coming in.\n\nEater beware: the portions are HUUUUUGE. Our friends made the mistake of ordering a dish for themselves, and left at least half of it. Thankfully, I decided to split a dish with a friend, so we ended up finishing it all.\n\nI ordered the infamous Safe Fried Chicken & Waffles. I really didn't know what to expect, so I was surprised when I was served a sculpture. Yes friends, this was a work of art. Four waffles beautifully arranged with two chicken breasts skewered on top, covered with shallots and other garnishes. \n\nThe waffles didn't have too much syrup on them, which is exactly how I like it. To my surprise, there was bacon cooked into the waffles, which was a pleasant surprise. The chicken was pretty lightly fried, which I enjoyed as well. The crust was sweet, but not too sweet, which was a good contrast to the savoury chicken. \n\nOverall, a great must have experience if you've in Vegas, and not too pricey at all. Service is a bit slow on weekdays, but you're going to need to take your time with these portions."

My boyfriend ordered it and I ended up eating most of his chicken because it was just so damn tasty.  The mix of herbs they put in there really infuse the chicken and make it taste like a bird that\'s flown in from heaven.  I thought the friend chicken here was inifintely better than Roscoe\'s (I know, blasphemy to some).  \n\nAlso, I usually can\'t eat more than a bite of pancakes.  But...the brown sugar banana pancake is also REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD here.  The pancake is pizza size, and the entire top is glazed with a crunchy brown sugar coating that pairs great with the pancake beneath.  Yum!\n\nI got some kind of a sausage scramble (can\'t even remember which one) which was not really very great.   Also, the "bacon waffles" do have bacon embedded in them, but they disappointingly do not taste quite as good as they sound in theory.'

S"My boyfriend and I made a stop here on our Vegas trip. We were very satisfied with our choice. Our disappointment with Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse included very rude staff and mediocre food (seems to be a consistent criticism amongst the yelpers). However, Gordon Ramsay's Burgr is a whole different restaurant compared to his steakhouse. The service was excellent! Very prompt, professional, and happy! The overall vibe of the restaurant is more laid back and casual with a trendy element in the decor. And this time, the food was great and far more plentiful. We ordered the euro burger, Hell's Kitchen burger, and a Oreo creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e shake. The euro burger was so flavorful! The flavor of the first few bites was so delicious, however, it was quite overwhelming and filling towards the end of the burger. I would've preferred it in a slider size. The Hell's Kitchen burger, although not as flavorful as the euro, was excellent! It was not quite as heavy on the stomach as the euro, which made eating the full sized burger much easier. My personal preference would be to have more heat/spiciness from the jalape\xc3\xb1os on the HK burger. And the Oreo creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e shake was certainly unique and tasty, but nothing special in the way of taste (they have nice straws though!). My overall experience here was great and I would definitely return to try some of their other items. \n\nOh and also I was happy because I got to see Christina Wilson in the kitchen! She was the winner of season 10 Hell's Kitchen! I was cheering for her during that season. Happy to see her in Burgr's kitchen!"

Now, I know the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the American Burger are popular items; but listen to me: you see that photo I posted of that Southern Yardbird Burger? That could be YOU.\n\nWith that out of the way, Gordon Ramsay BurGR was enjoyable overall. My crew knew that there was going to be a wait in order to seated; we got to the restaurant around 5 on a Friday. Once we got the text message that seating was available, it was on. I can't remember exactly who our waiter was, but he was on point the entire time; made sure drinks were filled, provided great recommendations, and provided that Las Vegas hospitality to some folks coming from the East Coast.\n\nI can definitely see why this place stays packed: good food + good drinks + good service + friendly atmosphere = satisfied and returning customers.

S"3.5 stars\n\nWent on a Tuesday, arrived at 11 am (opening) about 20 people in line but all we're seated quickly so no complaints on the wait.\n\nI ordered the American burger and Just fries (regular potato fries with chilli ketchup and curry ketchup).  It was too much food for one girl but I knew that going in, I just had to try them both.  The fries would be a good size for two Canadian girls to share.\n\nThe burger was 3*'s all the way.  My biggest disappointment, the bun.  Looked great but tasted just ok, further to that the texture was almost stale and chewy.  It had been grilled (heated) at some point but not recent to arriving to me.  The beef was tasty and well cooked.  There were 4 pickles and 2 tomato chunks teetering on top of the burger which made it difficult to close but even more difficult to get a bite of burger with pickle and tomato on it.  I know a lot of places do that but I still don't like it... Spread the love.... Don't stack.  Oh, and too many red onions for my liking.... A whole thick slice.\n\nThe fries were 4*'s, large chunks of English style fries cooked golden brown, yes I agree with previous reviews - the ones at the bottom of the serving container get a tad soggy (but they're still delicious!).\n\nThe curry ketchup won best overall and biggest surprise at 5*'s.  It paired perfectly with the fries and was extremely addicting.  It's worth adding I did not think I would like curry ketchup, at all.  \n\nDining alone I ate at the bar, service was pretty lame at first until some loser decided to stand behind me waiting for my seat and for me to finish my wine at which point the bar tender made it clear to me that I was to relax and enjoy myself and told the DB to wait somewhere else.\n\nI wasn't wowed but the overall experience, especially since it's called BURGR (and that was the biggest fail) but there are some good qualities.  I probably wouldn't go there again unless I tried the other burger places on the strip and they were worse."

This time I honestly felt it was an overpriced burger joint I could eat at back home. To start with service was lacking. Upon sitting we weren't given a drink menu or any spiel about speciality drinks. My water glass was consistently empty and our server never came to check on us because he was watching the football game in the corner. Our jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers were cold in the center!

S'My first visit about two weeks after the opening was amazing.  My second visit, not so much.  \n\nThis restaurant has become very popular, and there is often a long line of people waiting to be seated.  We arrived at off-peak time on a Sunday afternoon, so the wait was only about 5 to 10 minutes.  The restaurant was nevertheless packed inside and on the loud side.  I could be mistaken, but there seemed to be more tables in the dining area than before. In any event, if you are not seated in a booth, you will be pretty close to the adjacent tables.  \n\nThe service during my first visit rivaled fine dining.  This time, the service was slow, infrequent, and unpolished.  It took too long for our server to make her appearance after we were seated.  She was soft spoken, so it was hard to hear her over the din of the crowded restaurant.  When I asked her what beers they have on tap, she appeared to me to be annoyed by my question and placed an iPad in front of me to peruse.  She took our order very mater of factly and was on her way.  \n\nIt must have taken 15 minutes for my beer to arrive, and that was about 10 minutes after my buddy\'s diet coke was delivered by a staffer who informed us the beer he didn\'t bring would be coming "soon."   Some other guy eventually brought the beer.  \n\nIt took a good while longer for the food to come out.  I ordered my burger medium, but the burger I was served was well done.  I ate it without saying anything to avoid further annoyance to our server and because lord knows how long it would have taken to get a replacement.  \n\nWe were staying at the Encore, so having lunch here wasn\'t exactly convenient.  Based on my first experience, the place seemed worth going out of my way for.  Based on my second visit, I might give it another chance, but I wouldn\'t go out of my way to do it.'

Let me just tell you that you will not be disappointed!\n\nThis place is easy to find as it is located near the entrance of the casino at Planet Hollywood. As you wait in line, you'll be able to look at the touch-screen menu and gaze at the fiery decoration.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. Euro Burger ($16): Truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomato. I actually preferred this over my own burger. This is probably my favorite one! The truffle was spot on along with the flavors of the burger. The goat cheese was a great complement to the meat and truffle. Just imagine a perfection infusion of savory flavors leaving you wanting more!! (5/5)\n\n2. Farm Burger ($15): Duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and fried egg. Frankly, the only reason I chose this was because I was attracted to the idea of duck breast bacon. It wasn't that special as it just tasted like any typical bacon. However, the burger was delightful and delicious. But overall, I was eyeing my boyfriend's Euro Burger all night hehehehe. (5/5)\n\nService was friendly and very attentive. Will I come here again? Of course! I want to order my own Euro Burger next time and maybe run into Gordon Ramsey himself! The staff told us that he visits the location every so often. :)"

I went during restaurant week and I feel like the staff did a disservice by not telling us about the deals without me prompting them. I didn't hear them tell about the deals to other customers nearby either.\n\nI had the chantrelle burger cooked medium. Great flavor with the mushrooms, figgy-onion jam, and the buttered bun. I had the just fries which I love steak fries, but couldn't finish them. And then part of the $20.13 restaurant week price was a sticky toffee push pop which was very good. \n\nSolid restaurant in which I'd go back.

The Hells Kitchen burger was tasty and packed a bit of heat from the peppers. A solid burger that I would order again.  The dog was so huge that it was borderline obscene, also very tasty and packed some heat.  The rings and fries were perfectly good, nothing spectacular.\n\nThe service was slllloooooowwwww.  We waited 40 minutes after ordering for the food to arrive.  I am sure the kitchen is slammed and working out the kinks since they\'ve only been open a week but the servers made it worse with comments such as: \n\n"Wow, your food hasn\'t arrived yet, that\'s totally sucks!  But I promise it will be worth the wait, save room for dessert"\n\nThe comment may have been cute and peppy 1 time but it was gratingly annoying the fifth time.\n\nI\'ll come back after the kinks have been worked out of the operation.  The burgers are really, really good...'

S"If you're a hot dog lover, get your hot dog lovin' butt over to BurGR for one of the best all beef hot dogs you'll ever have.\n\nMy mom and I both ordered the fresh roasted chili dawg--sans cheese. This was seriously a FLAVOR EXPLOSION. The hot dog had a genuine, juicy beef flavor and was slathered in tasty chipotle ketchup. I devoured this massively long hot dog at a record speed. Even the bun--the sweet, crisp bun--was a standout in comparison to hot dogs I've eaten in the past. With a tall beer and no sides, eating the whole dog left me satisfied. \n\nThere was only one small trouble. Right before my mom took the last bite of her hot dog, she discovered a hair amidst all the juicy hotdog madness. She instantly felt grossed out by her meal, of course. The manager came to the table and removed the cost of her hot dog from our bill. She was so gracious about the whole thing that it didn't put a damper on our delicious lunch.\n\nGordon Ramsey clearly dreamed up a unique vision of the classic chili dog and hot dogs will never be the same again now that BurGR raised my standards :(\n\nAwesome lunch spot in Vegas!"

S'In the wise words of Gordon Ramsay, "This was bloody fantastic." Also, "*BLEEP* BLEEP* *BLEEP* %$%#%#!!!!"\n\nI didn\'t expect much going in, as every time I walked past BurGR it was always filled with tourists that looked miserable and tired. Tourist trap to the max, but like a moth to a flame, I was attracted to it and knew that after 3 times in Vegas without going in, this was it. \n\nIf you\'re a Total Rewards Member (at a higher tier), all menu items are a dollar off and you can cut everyone in line. Too bad all my points are at MGM.The wait wasn\'t too terrible and I was plenty entertained by the people behind me talking about Master Chef Junior and the differences between the UK and US Gordon Ramsay shows. \n\nMy friend and I weren\'t in the mood for fries (wahh...next time) so we split a cold chicken soba salad and HOT DIGGITY DAMN. Yes. Drop whatever the hell you\'re eating and split this. It was so good I didn\'t even want my burger anymore. I just wanted more salad. \n\nShe ordered the Farm Burger ("orgasm in my mouth") and I ordered the Hell\'s Kitchen Burger medium rare. DELICIOUS. While not the best burger I\'ve ever tasted, it is definitely top 5. Everything went well together and I happily scarfed down $15 while trying not to look like I was vacuuming it into my mouth.\n\nThe service was fantastic and our server was personable and friendly (not to mention super young).

S"Came here with the family that was in town.  Very steep prices, but really no different than anything else on the strip. \n\nStarted with some apps.  Onion rings, jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers, and the wings.  Loved the wings, very good sauces, liked the lollipop.   The onion rings were some of the best I have had.  Battered to order, great taste. Poppers were good also, great cheddar dipping sauce.  I thought there was a little too much breading on them though. \n\nEverybody ordered a burger, one person ordered the 5 spice breaded chicken sliders.  Lets start with the sliders, phenomenal!   The breading was perfect and very flavorful, even better than the burgers.  I ordered the farm burger with the egg and duck breast bacon.  Egg on a burger is always a good option, but I felt the bacon was lost, really didn't add anything.  The other three also ordered burgers, they all really enjoyed them. \n\nWe also ordered some sides.  The sweet potato fries were very good, and we also ordered the regular fries.  Regular fries were good, but greasy.  There was a pool of grease at the bottom of the cone that seeped onto the table. \n\nOur meal was great, we will be back.  My only complaint, three of the burgers were overcooked.  Mine was the only one that wasn't.  We did nothing about it because they were so good."

I tried it, it was ok.\nI loved my farm house burger. The egg was cooked well and duck breast bacon was good, but it was more like pastrami, not bacon. \n\nCoffee shake thing with Nutella pudding - pretty darn good.\n\nThe service here is amazing for a burger joint. \n\nThe biggest downside - wait time. It was a 45 minute wait on a Friday at 2:30... By the time we were seated and done with our food it was 4:30\n\nAll in all good experience. Not as good as BLT at the mirage though."

S'Not a build your own disaster place.  No teriyaki or yakisoba garnish.  BurGR is not about reinvention but about creating the every day burger on steroids and what a great burger it is.\n\nTake a flavorful, plump, juicy, fire grilled burger put it in a good brioche bun, top it with greens (arugula instead of lettuce), cheese (fresh European instead of Kraft singles), onions (as jam), tomato (oven roasted) saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms (chanterelles); you get the picture.\n\nThe chanterelle burger is delicious. Pungent chanterelles, spicy arugula, and the onion jam compliment the char flavor of the beef.  The Euro burger equally good.  Earthy truffle aioli, tart goat cheese, peppery arugula, and sweet oven roasted tomato.  As with the chanterelle burger, the toppings bring out the flavor of the beef.\n\nThe two meat burgers are creative and delicious.  Props to the farm burger with its slightly gamy duck breast "bacon", sharp English cheddar and fried egg.  A great interpretation of the Midwest classic.  Ooey, gooey, juicy and messy.  Delicious.\n\nFor sides, parm truffle fries.  Nuff said.\n\nSomewhat inconsistent service and probably the reason for the burgers arriving over temperature.\n\nTip: use your Total Rewards card to get a minuscule discount (don\'t bother getting a card if you don\'t have one).\n\nNever thought I\'d see the day when a British chef honored our humble burger.  Cheers!'

S'I would start by saying after having Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill I was looking forward too trying Gordon Ramsay Burger. Thankfully my cousins visiting choose different Gordon Ramsay. I was not disappointed but neither did I get wowed or impressed with the food. If not for all the Gordon Ramsay name sake all over the restaurant strip it down without it. It clone of Bachi Burger even down too the way serves the fries. I had the Hell Kitchen Burger. Solid burger it cooked too perfect medium, nice moist and juicy inside. I enjoy the combination of the cheese,, roasted jalapeno, avocado, and over roasted tomato. It had that nice little heat from the jalapeno overall solid burger. I had the truffle fries that was good. I felt they could have mixed the seasoning especially the truffle oil or whatever they do better throughout the fries. I felt times that fries bottom had no truffle flavor. The dipping sauces was solid. Dessert try the sticky toffee pudding push up pops. My cousin and I split since it came two pop ups. I did LOVE the presentation of it. It literally looks like old school pop ups ice creams remember getting from ice cream truck on the street. But say in food presentation makes the first impression but if the food not stand up then all for not. I totally feel about it. Plus after the sticky toffee pudding NO WAY it could have competed with the one at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill. I felt the cake itself very bland nothing stood out with it. The ice cream between layers nothing special and overall dessert that waiter pushed hard felt let down. \n\nThe service was great! I love the energy we got from our waiter. He was very informative. They also have the Ipad touch screens for there drinks just like the Pub and Grill. I liked different approach with the menu on top of the napkins and just style. The menu is straight forward same as Bachi Burger just burgers, friends, apps, shakes, other non burgers, and desserts. Surprise considering its the STRIP property and big name but prices were reasonable. If remember correctly Bachi and here average burger is in $15 range. The hostess wonderful, friendly, and start you off great experience. \n\nThe one thing that aggravating is too find it. The signs NON of them in Planet Hollywood directs too it. Not that the layout of the casino helps one bit. It next too PF Changs or say around the corner. \n\nOverall it was cool knowing that just went too Pub and Grill then Burger. Now all I need complete the tirfecta is Steak. If urge for gourmet burger sorry but Bachi Burger my go spot! If on the strip not bad alternative.'

Lacking moisture, the burgers we tried were just "okay"...the truffle fries needed salt...and the starters like the pork buns lacked flavor, as if an ingredient or two was missing.\nGordon, Gordon, Gordon...we wanted to be pleased with your presentation of one of the simplest foods elevated to your standards!

S'Never have I had a meal at a burger joint that was so well thought out, presented, executed and reasonably priced. The food was so above expectations that the dishes I had rivaled those of established and well known burger joints. \n\nThe dishes were simple and comforting, well known and commonplace among the typical foods one finds at a burger joint but each had a twist and an added element that intrigued me. \n\nI didn\'t actually have a burger (it was a hot dog) but nevertheless every component of that meal was memorable. The quality of the meat and snap to the "dawg" delighted one texture. The creaminess of the avocado added another. The toppings were fresh. The fluffy on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside bun enveloped all that goodness.\n\nThe jalapeno poppers were crunchy on the outside and the cheese was gooey on the inside. It was lightly spicy and the cheesy dipping sauce they were on top of was also a little spicy. \n\nThe truffle fries were also well made and I crave them often. Nicely sized, fluffy on the inside and salty from the Parmesan. The hint of truffle oil came through nicely as well. \n\nFor a weekday and party of two, we didn\'t wait long. The prices were fair and the food is one of the best you can find on the Strip for the prices especially because it\'s so well made and tasty.'

S"This place serves up one heck of a burger! There are so many clever combinations of burgers and names that goes with them.  I always like Gordon Ramsay's shows and I always wanted to try a restaurant of his. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it packs a punch. It comes with asadero cheese, roasted jalape\xc3\xb1o peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomatoes. The meat was moist and juicy, the jalape\xc3\xb1os makes it have a spicy kick, and all the other toppings makes the burger complete.  My friend ordered the Damnation Chicken Burger. When you order a chicken burger what do you think of?  Dry? Piece of chicken breast across a bun?  Not this place!  It was a patty style chicken burger that was moist.  It came with hot mayo, cheese, and a carrot slaw.  They also have fries, shakes, salads, and snack.  They have two unique ketchups one being a curry flavor and the other a chipotle flavor.  The decor there is nice, clean, and sharp looking.  They have a bar where you can enjoy a drink while watching a sports game and having a burger.  Highly recommend this place to anyone."

They were taking the large groups out of line and texting them when their table was ready.  We only had a party of two and they told us it would be about 30 minutes but luckily we only had to wait for about ten.  The beer and drink list was surprising good.  The server gives you an I-Pad which is nice because it means the beer list is always up to date.  We shared the truffle fries and they two of us couldn't even finish them, they were pretty large.  I had the Uber Cheese Burger and it was delicious!  My husband loved his burger as well, I think it was called the Farm Burger or something and it had yummy smoked duck bacon.

S'I can\'t even tell you how much I loved this restaurant! I\'m a diehard Gordon Ramsay fan and have vowed to eventually visit all of his restaurants around the world! Last visit in Vegas I went to Steak (which was mouth-wateringly delicious) and this time in Vegas I convinced a few friends of mine to come with me to have the best burGRs of their lives! It was my husband\'s birthday and there was quite a wait but it didn\'t even matter because of what was to come (plus your in the great planet hollywood resort and casino with tons to do while you wait). We started our meal off with the jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers which were such a treat! You get six delicious jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers and one of the six is a "surprise" (all of its stems and seeds, which create the heat, remain in the jalape\xc3\xb1o). I was so excited to get the surprise jalape\xc3\xb1o since my idol GR claims that the one who gets the surprise popper is the lucky one in Vegas. Nice personal touch! Moving on the star dish! I had the Euro BurGR and I usually like my meat medium but I took a risk and had medium rare as the chef recommends and it was something I do not regret in the least bit! It was the juiciest burGR I\'ve ever had! All of the different elements and ingredients perfectly harmonized together. From the toasted black and white sesame seeds on top of the bun to the oven roasted tomato and goat cheese which added a zingy taste of heaven in my mouth. The arugula and truffle aioli were just the perfect touch to the perfect burGR. I also tried the uber cheese burGR which my husband had ordered and it was just as amazing. Gooey ooey cheese stretched for miles on end with every scrumptious bite. The onion rings were the perfect amount of crisp and came with amazing chipotle ketchup. This is definitely a place that I\'d go back to the next time I\'m in Vegas and I can\'t wait for my final stop restaurant of Gordon Ramsay\'s Pub & Grill! I really can\'t wait to visit all of his restaurants eventually and maybe my fourth time in Vegas he\'ll open another one! That would be phenomenal just like him and his success!'

S"Finally!!  I get to eat a burger.  \n\nIt's been 40 days and 40 nights since I had some red meat.  I admit, I am a carnivore and giving up red meat was no easy task.  So what is the first thing I'm craving?  A burger, of course.  So, BurGR it is.  \n\nService:  \nUnique situation when we arrived for dinner.  It was around 5 PM on Easter and they were closed.  Apparently, BurGR had a small fire the night before and all the inspections kept them from opening on time. Not a big deal to me.  Safety first, right?  Once they opened for business, we were seated right away and our orders were taken fairly quick.  Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full.  So far, so good. \n\nThe Food:\n-American Burger:  I'm old fashion when it comes to a beef burger and decided to keep it simple.  But I also needed to make up for being meatless for so long.  So, I had them add an extra patty.  This was perfect, this was huge.  My burger was cooked medium-well and it was both tasty & juicy.  My only regret...wish I didn't get this with cheese.  The cheese was a little salty and took away from the burger. I managed to eat the whole thing.  Obviously, I was satisfied.  Obviously, I recommend.  \n\n-Sweet Potato Fries:  This was Ty W's and Lore D's order.  But that didn't stop me from taking a few pieces.  I thought that these were pretty good. They hook up the fries here.  It's big enough for 4.  \n\n-Truffle Parmesan Fries:  I read reviews that this is really good. I thought that they were just okay.  Maybe it's the batch that we got.  I just thought that the ones that I had were a little under cooked.  Still tasted good, though. \n\nOverall, I recommend BurGR if you're craving a decent burger.  Price is about average to what you expect to pay in a restaurant on the strip, especially one owned by Gordon Ramsay.  \n\nPS:  I had another great dinner with Terri R (who happened to come here last year after giving up red meat for 40 days), Terri's teen, Ty W, Lore D, and their son.  I had a great time and we all deMELished our burgers."

S"OK. First off is why only four stars and not five! Well that is simply the ambiance. There is nothing bad about the setting, but there are just a lot of televisions hanging on the wall. To me this just gives it the feel of a sports bar and not a gourmet burger joint.\n\nBut I guarantee you, that is what it is. This is one of the best burgers I have ever had. I do not go in for all the fancy toppings and condiments, so I just got the American Burger. Lettuce, Tomato, onion, cheese and one perfectly cooked 1/2 pound piece of meat. If anyone has ever had burgers and other cuts of beef that were OK; this is the burger that will let you know how a good piece of beef should taste. If you understand the concept of umami, this burger has it.\n\nThe fries are different than most people are used to. BurGR does not use russets like most restaurants. So their fries are lighter and less starchy but still have a great crunch. The fries come with two flavored ketchup's. They both add a nice flavor. But the fries are worth it without anything added.\n\nI took the plunge and had myself one the BurGR's milkshakes. The milkshake was wonderful alone and did not need the pudding that it is topped with. But I tell you, the pudding on top makes this one of the most unique milkshakes I have every tasted. It was creamy and chilled to the right temp. I will be going back for more of these shakes when I can.\n\nI did not have any issues with the service. We were well looked after the entire time we were there. When we were first seated, it was near the front. It was a particularity cold day here in Vegas, so we asked to be moved. This was not an issue and we were moved further into the restaurant. We had great service from start to finish. The uniforms are very appealing as well. The uniform has a sexy look to it without being to revealing. Congratulations to the designer for a very appealing and comely look.\n\nOne last thing about the restaurant that is very appealing is the kitchen. The kitchen is open at the front so you can see what is going on in there. They also make everything to order. Nothing is precooked. So do expect to wait about 15 to 20 minutes to get your BurGR."

S"Oh my goodness, how do I not have a review for this place already? This is my favorite spot on the strip for burgers. The main reason that this spot up'ed Holsteins for me is that there's something special about the texture of their thick beef patties that almost has a melting effect once it hits your taste buds. I really don't know what it is and I would have never thought that it would make a difference but after coming here, both my boyfriend and I found ourselves looking for that texture and flavor in other burgers. Their brioche buns are amazing as well and also, all of their shakes have a pudding layer. So evil.\n\nBurGR faves:\nChanterelle Burger-  chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, fig-onion jam\nFarm Burger- DUCK BREAST BACON (yes it's that good that it needs the caps lol), English sharp cheddar & fried egg\nEuro Burger- truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, oven roasted tomatoes.\n\nTruffle fries & Sweet potato fries- I know that every burger place has these on their menu but it's BurGR's sauces that set them above the rest for me \n\nShake #2: strawberry shake w/ coconut pudding + chocolate cookie. Heaven!\n\n Another thing to add, everytime I've come here the service is amazing. All of waiters/waitresses give the same extensive treatment of talking about their entire menu, giving recommendations and having the best attitudes. They are all also very quick without seeming rushed. There are not many places that I've been to where all of the staff members are on the same level of great quality service. Awesome training on management's part.\nThe only thing I would mention, these ladies and gents need a new uniform!!!! It is the TIGHTEST (not in a good way) most unflattering uniform I have seen! You can see every little dent and fold on them lmao I feel bad for them! Haha But anyways, other than that, this place gets an A+ in my book! Can't wait to go back! :)"

Great beef, cooked perfectly, and seasoned plenty.  In Vegas, a lot of people will argue that most if not all restaurants are overpriced, but I really don't have a problem paying $15 or so for a burger when it tastes like this.  Between here and the Pub and Grill, Gordon Ramsay is killing it right now.  I can't wait to hit up Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris.\n\nOn top of the burger we also order the onion rings and chicken sliders as an appetizers and both were phenom.  I wish the chicken slider came in a full sized burger portion, because it would make for a great entree.  The ranch here is also amazing, and nothing beats quality ranch."

I had the Britannia burger (cheddar + mango chutney) which was quite good but I would have liked to had a little more bite from the cheddar.\n\nWe also had the regular fries which were some of the best I've had in a long time. Piping hot, crisp on the outside, fluffy inside, and perfectly salted.\n\nOne of the top burgers I've had in town. Other noteworthy burgers are at Burger Bar, DW Bistro, Ogden's Hops & Harvest, and Nob Hill (which closed to make room for Pub 1842 which doesn't have the same amazing burger)."

But given that Ramsey's name is on it you expect a certain level of quality and its not there and honestly I'm pretty forgiving.  I know line chef's and serving staff work very hard and things happen but I again because Gordon Ramsey associated his name to it I expected a base level of quality.\n\nMy burger was ok, undercooked but ok and I enjoyed it honestly but I should have eaten at holstein's in the Cosmopolitan which is a lot better in my estimation.  \n\nThe burger was undercooked.  I had ordered medium rare but what I got was really rare. Despite being super rare it was good enough to eat and not return.  The burger was also pretty bland, I expected a bit more flavor.\n\nThe fries were overpowering - a lot of Parmesan which got all over everything and overpowered the fries and everything else.  But surprisingly I will say the ketchup was really good! It was also good presentation, I'll give it that.\n\nBut honestly I don't think I'll go back and wont be recommending it to anyone.  Its cheap and looks neat but if I want to pay for a premium burger I'll go to holstein's as I've had very good luck there.  \n\nMaybe it was a bad day I'm not sure but as I said I was less then impressed. I wanted to give it more stars I did...but it just wasn't there."

S'What makes me a fan of Chef Ramsay is that we both share the same standard when it comes to preparing food, and running a successful food business.\n\nThat being said, this was my first experience at one of his restaurants. \n\nI have to be honest and say that my expectations of BurGR were not high since it is a burger joint and not one of his flagship restaurants. I was nonetheless still excited to try it. \n\nWe (my wife, mom) arrived about 8PM on a Wed night. There was about 25 people in line so the wait to be seated took about 25 min. \n\nOnce seated, we were promptly greeted by our server. ( I only use names when the service credits the individual, I don\'t bash ) She was very knowledgeable about showing us the touchscreen, and her steps of service would satisfy management in knowing that she knows how to suggestively sell beverages and appetizers. \n\nSince we have never been her before, we took some time to take in the menu. \n\nWhile I was checking out the menu, I could not help but to be distracted by this awful smell coming from the table. I was trying to dismiss it, but it was strong enough to make me realize that if I did not get rid of it, it would ruin my "first experience at a Ramsay restaurant" \n\nMy wife saw me smell the table several times, and confirmed that I was not crazy. She and my mom could smell it too. \n\nI\'m a foodie, so getting rid of this smell was a no compromise thing. \nYa feel me??\n\nI\'ve been working in "the biz" for 18 years. I knew this smell. It was the sour smell of bacteria. At first I thought that it came from the towel that was used to wipe the table and that it could be fixed by just asking that the table be wiped down with a clean towel. \n\nNo biggie right?\n\nI had to use the restroom so my wife asked our server if she could take care of this. Her response was "oh, ok" \n\nI came back from the restroom and sat down. My wife informed me that nothing was done yet. Ok I thought, not a problem. (yet...)\n\nOur server returned with 3 waters and proceeded to suggestively sell beverages and appetizers. I ordered a Guinness and the jalapeno poppers. \n\nShe was the type of server that speeds off the table before confirming with all the guests that everyone is finished ordering so I stopped her and asked if we could have the table wiped down again. Her response was again "oh, ok" As I hastily explained to her about the smell, I discovered where it was coming from when I picked up the VINYL PLACE MAT  that was in from of me.  \n\n(Here it is, the answer! The table gets washed but not dried, the place mat goes back on the table and stays wet. Bacteria forms on the bottom of the mat and that nasty sour smell is created over a period of time. Even though the busser wiped down the bottom of the mats, a hint of the smell still remained. It would have to go through the dishwasher, but I don\'t think it would have survived. Still, I did not let my silverware touch it)\n\nMy wife is the sweetest woman you could ever meet. Every person that meets her will confirm this. It is usually me that says things the wrong way on occasion.\n\nWhen the request to wipe the table came a second time, our server  responded with a look that I did not see, but pushed my wife off that very long ledge. \n\nI let her handle it because if were me I would have not been as tactful. \n\nLong story short, we got the table fixed (well, sort of) and my diplomatic wife decided to keep our server. It was one of those things that puts a beacon on your table that keeps you from complaining about anything else that could go wrong so you don\'t look like vindictive people. \n\nIf it\'s one thing I can\'t stand is vindictive people. Especially in the food and beverage industry. \n\nWe placed our burger order and waited for the culinary magic to begin. \n\nThe poppers arrived. 6 roasted (or fried?) breaded, stuffed jalapenos dipped in individual shot glasses half filled with cheddar ranch. My first bite led me to believe that they were still cold in the middle until I took my second bite which was warmer. The ranch cooled off the dipped part of the popper so don\'t wait to eat them or they will be cold. The flavor (hot or cold) was phenomenal!!!! loved it and they were very spicy. I would return just for these. \n\nThe BurGR\'s we ordered were the Farm, American, and Hell\'s Kitchen with a side\norder of Parmesan Truffle fries.\n\nBeautiful looking burgers! A picture on every plate. The fries, not so much. Seems they take "just fries" and add Parmesan on the top and you get your truffles on the side. The truffle aioli  was delicious, but the fries sat a little too long under the heat lamp.\n\nThe burgers were executed perfectly. I thought the meat was under seasoned if at all. The brioche bun was ever so soft, the toppings flavorful.  \n\nThe Shakes are to die for. My wife said it was the HERO of the day. \n\nBurGR is an experience worth trying if at least once. \n\nDitch the placemats though, just to be on the safe sanitary side.'

S"Gordon Ramsay is one of my fave chefs to watch on TV. He's sort of the Simon Cowell of the foodie world and I love that!\n\nI was extremely excited to dine here with the bf and our bodybuilder friend Seth (Elf boy). We actually patiently waited in line for about 20-25 minutes. Not so bad of a wait for a popular restaurant on a night where people were ready to grub before hittin' up da clubs. \n\nI loved how casual the environment was but it still had it's little upscale feel to it with the service. I thought it was pretty cool when the waitress brought out this iPad drink menu where you can scroll through all the drinks they offered. Seth and I both had a glass of the Pumpkin beer which was bombtastic! \n\nI honestly don't remember which burger I ordered but I do remember thoroughly enjoying it. The meat was cooked perfectly medium for my taste. \n\nWe also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 regular fries and onion rings for the table. I liked how the sweet potato fries came out with this delicious honey dipping sauce and there was powdered sugar all over them. You definitely don't need to order any dessert if you get these fries.\n\nI definitely would come back here with a huge empty stomach so I can try out some other tasty items on their menu! Maybe for lunch that way there's no wait. :)"

S"Dear Gordon,\n\nThank you for opening this delicious burger joint.  As usual, the service was excellent.  Our server was attentive and very friendly, too.  I also had the pleasure of sampling some appetizers and let me just tell you, you make the best jalapeno poppers I've ever had in my life.  The truffle fries are excellent as well! Of course, the burger was perfect and cooked to perfection. The meat was well seasoned and the temp was spot on.   Additionally, for a burger joint, the hot dog is pretty darn good.  It's actually my parent's favorite thing to order. \n\nThank you again for an absolutely wonderful dining experience.  \n\nBest,\nLauren S.\nYelp, Long Island\n\nP.S. for everyone who thinks I'm crazy, I know this letter isn't really going to Gordon.  It's called - having a little fun here and there."

S"Nom! 4.5 stars.\n\nWe waited 45 min for a table which I expected, but then another while to order our food... and then felt like an eternity to GET our food. In reality it was probably 20 min, but I was starving at that point.\n\nGordon Ramsay really delivers here. We got a Hell's Kitchen burger, Farm burger, and truffle fries. I think the prices are very reasonable, even pre-discount (I think any Total Rewards card gives you $1 off the price of each item).\n\nPer our usual routine, hubby and I shared both burgers. I can usually pick which one I like better but not this time. Both very different from each other and equally stellar. It may look smallish but we were so full we couldn't finish the fries. Oh, those fries... just enough truffle taste, finely grated parmesan that were good enough on their own or in either homemade sauce. I'm salivating now.\n\nWorth the wait!"

S"Came in around 7pm on Saturday night and it was packed. We originally had a party of four and the hostess said it would be an hour and a half wait. She put my name on the list and the text us when the table was ready (it took 45 min).By that time we had acquired 2 more people. One of the manager guys told us to hang tight and he would accommodate the change; we were seated 10 minutes later. The service was great. All the staff was pleasant and although busy, it seemed like we were the only table our waitress had. It's reasonably priced as well. We had a Hells Kitchen Burger which was ok, nothing to back flip about. The Parmesan fries were delicious with the house ketchup; there was a truffle mayo too but I found it to be too bold for my taste buds. Sweet potato fries were good too. I can't give 5 stars b/c the burger was just ok and they don't take reservations. Everything else was on point though. We'll be back to try out some more burgers :)"

S"This restaurant is located inside the casino in Planet Hollywood. The atmosphere is noisy, but this is worth dealing with because of the very excellent food choices as well as interesting drinks. Our server was so personable and knowledgeable about the menu that we tried some things we might not have if we'd not had her advice. The three of us started with some different beers and a wonderful whiskey lemonade cocktail. Then we tried an order of their onion rings. Presentation was beautiful and the taste was the best ever. We had two sauces served with the rings. Amazing! Our burgers were all different and beautifully served. Again, amazing taste! Definitely not your ordinary burgers! I know Gordon Ramsay's passion is taste, presentation, speed of service, and a manageable menu. He delivers excellence here! Everything coming out of the kitchen was beautifully served. We wanted to try an order of the Parmesan Truffle Fries and there were so many, along with two different sauces, that we could not finish them all. This just might have unexpectedly been the best dinner at a restaurant we've ever had.  I would definitely recommend this everyone coming to vegas wanting a phenomenal burger."

S"Being a Gordon Ramsay fangirl, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try one of his restaurants while in Vegas. And the boyfriend, being a burger fanatic, couldn't pass up the opportunity to try another burger joint. It was the perfect match (and perfect excuse) to line ourselves up for 40 minutes to get one of those coveted tables.\n\nAll of the servers are extremely kind, helpful, and knowledgeable about the burgers. Each one comes out in a perfect sphere of deliciousness, and it is quite a bit embarrassing to try to stuff it in your mouth to take a bite, so this may not be the place to take a first date. I ordered the Farm Burger, and everything was absolutely scrumptious. I savored every single bite and felt perfectly full afterwards. The truffle fries were equally as yummy and are definitely a must-try.\n\nThe cherry on top that made this meal even better was the dessert shake. I ordered the coffee with chocolate hazelnut pudding (doesn't that just sound amazing?), and I was in heaven. If there's one thing that I would want to eat when I'm having a bad day, it's that. I'm craving it right now as I'm being reminded of its creamy and chocolatey taste. Mmmmmm....\n\nJust as expected, this Gordon Ramsay restaurant delivered absolute perfection, and the price isn't too bad considering the other non-buffet options that are available on the Strip."

S"Quick review.. I loved the one other member of our party of 4 loved it, the other two thought it was okay... At like 11pm on a Thursday we went for dinner once we checked in. Was told 30-45 minutes, gave our number so they could text us, 5 minutes later while watching the Bellagio fountains across the street, the text came. \n\nService meh, waitress had friends sit at the table next to us about half way through and it was like we didn't exist. \n\nThe Poppers were EXCELLENT we all agreed on that, the Maui Onion Rings, good (but I'm not a huge parmesan fan) so I didn't expect to love them since I knew they had them. \n\nI had the Farm burger medium rare and perfect! Was one of the best I've ever had. Duck Bacon, sharp cheddar & an egg... SO GOOD... \n\nWife had the Euro burger seemed to really enjoy it. \n\nFriends spit a burger (not sure which) but they asked for medium well (and it was split) so you could see the temp and it was medium rare-rare so it had to be sent back. But by this time out waitress had stopped paying attention to us, so making this happen was a task. \n\nFood was very good, I'll chalk up the poor service to our waitress. Good ambiance, would try again. \n\nWe also got some of the pudding shakes to go a few days later as we passed through (too full to try the first trip in) those were excellent. Something you don't really get anywhere else, but worth it as a togo item to try if you don't have the time to stop in and want something sweet and tasty."

S"This is my new favorite restaurant in Vegas!  So good that after trying it for the first time I went back for more the very next day!\n\nGood burgers, yummy truffle fries (huge portion more than enough for two), and the best shakes I've ever tasted!!  I LOVED the banana shake with butterscotch pudding.  I got to try the Oreo shake with creme brulee pudding and that was delicious as well.  I may have to get that next time!  \n\nServers are pretty friendly.  I really liked our server on the first day: friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and cute too to boot.  I wish I had gotten his name but he looks like Clark Kent without the glasses :p  I think he knew he had us in the palm of his hand and that we would give him a good review so he had us fill out a survey after our meal.  Of course we rated him highly!  We unfortunately were not seated in his section the next time we came in but when he saw us he gave us a smile and a wave :)\n\nFYI: they do not take reservations over the phone or online.  The restaurant fills up quickly within that first hour of opening so get there early or be prepared to wait a bit.  If cigarette smoke bothers you try to get a table in the middle or toward the front of the restaurant.  The back section is very close to the slot machines so it gets very smoky there - we requested to move from that section on our second visit.  \n\nOne more thing to note: to enter the restaurant if you are coming from another hotel take the entrance just at the top of the moving walkway that takes you from the street to the hotel, which is next to Cabo Wabo Cantina (on the Paris side of the building).\n\nAn added treat: you get to take your menu home with you as a souvenir :)  Totally recommend this restaurant and I cannot wait to go back!\n\nP.S. Make room for their shakes!!"

Some other reviews I read said that they were seated rather quickly. \nBurGR really need to work on their front end system!! They do not take reservations... Only parties of 3 or more get to give their number and go wait for a text until their table is ready. Parties of two must stand in a miserable line resembling a line for a casino buffet. Even the cheapest restaurants have a better system than this. Waited 45 minutes in line, then another 30 at the table before our order was taken. It was a Friday night, but come on, their has to be a better way!!\n\nThe food.....The stuffed jalapeno appetizer was really good. My husband ordered the hog burger and I had the hells kitchen burger. We shared the Parmesan truffle fries. My husband said his burger was very flavorful. Mine was good... not great... but good. I guess my expectations were a little high. I am a local and for me to battle the Las Vegas strip on Friday night for a burger it needs to be worth the effort. \nMaybe I will give them a try for lunch during the week when it isn't so busy.

Had the Euro burger with goat cheese and it was cooked to a nice medium.  The burger was a nice size, not too big but maybe slightly too small to share.  The truffle Parmesan fries were really good and a pretty large portion (easily share).  The sticky toffee pops were not my favorite.  I order the sticky toffee dessert at all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants (including one in London) and honestly this version I just wasn't too keen on.  The peanut butter ice cream was the problem.  It seemed too salty, maybe with a caramel ice cream it would be better.  Overall not my favorite burger joint in Vegas (Bachi burger is the current winner) but if I was stuck on the strip I certainly wouldn't complain."

S'Oh Gordon Ramsay, is there anything he can\'t do?\n\nMy pal and I have started an annual tradition....1. Going to Vegas every fall and 2. Eating at a burger place the day we arrive. This year my friend\'s Food Network crush (come on, we all have one...) on Gordon Ramsay led us to BurGR. Hot off the plane, we headed over to Planet Hollywood.  After wandering around for awhile, unable to find BurGR, we asked someone...naturally, at that point we were practically on top of it. Duh.\n\nAfter a short wait, we were seated. Our stripper I mean waitress came by and explained the menu to us. It\'s somewhat limited....burgers (duh #2), including chicken, pork, and portobello burgers, a couple salads, a couple hot dog choices, a fish sandwich...plus some apps, shakes, and fries. We wound up going with the Hell\'s Kitchen Burger and banana shake for her, and the Uber Cheese Burger (FYI, "uber cheese" = 3 different kinds) and chocolate shake for me. We ordered regular fries to share, which came with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup.\n\nThe shakes arrived first...ok, there is pudding on top of them. How can that be bad? A shake and pudding combined takes care of all kinds of girl needs. We were in love.\n\nWe also really enjoyed our burgers...the meat was of excellent quality and very flavorful.  Even the bun was good. The fries, however, left something to be desired....they were not terrible, but the burgers and shakes were so fab, we felt let down. The 2 ketchups were tasty, but the fries seemed like maybe they were sitting around for awhile? Which I find hard to believe, since they must serve fries all day long. So I guess if there IS one thing Gordon Ramsay can\'t do...it\'s fries. But we got over it. \n\nWe would surely go to BurGR again (duh #3)....I\'d love to try some of the other burgers and shakes....however, we\'d pass on the fries....the next table had an appetizer of onion rings, maybe we\'d get those instead. \n\nA very solid 4 stars.'

It might be a wait, but all you have to do is tell them at the front that you have a party of whatever amount of people, they tell you how long the wait is, and you're set to go. We stayed across the street at the Jockey Club and sent someone over to put our name on the list. We got to relax in our room for the hour it took.

S"This is the second Gordon Ramsey place I've tried and I can honestly say he's the most overrated celebrity chef. A few years back had drinks and food at LONDON in NYC and it was like, meh. Nothing special, just ok and a little disappointing. Shrugged it off and just resigned myself to the idea that it was better to watch him on TV than to actually go to one of his places....then Vegas happened. \n\nIt was late and BurGR was almost the only place open so why not. The place looked great-nice, clean, and modern. Hostess was friendly and our server was really nice. Menu looked interesting and enticing so it seemed like there was hope. \n\nI know it's a burger place (hence the name - duh!) but the hot dogs looked really good so I decided to order one. Bad idea. It took a little long for the food to come out but that's ok. We were in no rush and our server was friendly. Finally our food came and it looked amazing. My plate was huge, looked great and then I took a bite. It was the worst bite of food I've ever had. It was super salty. I mean SUPER SUPER salty. So salty that I almost spit it out like the restaurant's namesake does on TV. I thought it was me so I took another bite and it was confirmed. BLEH....!\n\nI'm not one to complain to a waiter, have food redone or replaced. When the waiter came and asked how everything was my friend insisted I say something so I did. Our server was apologetic and kind. He offered something else and insisted I pick something else. By then I was so turned off I would of honestly preferred a return but graciously accepted a hamburger. He took it away and apologized and told me I was not the first person to complain and that the kitchen was working on the recipe. Really?!? Not the only person to say this and the kitchen is working on this....really?!? (My guess is that they have the hot dogs custom made for the restaurant.) Sorry, with a big name associated with this place I'd think this would of been fixed BEFORE you even opened the doors.  \n\nBurger came, was decent but by then my taste buds were so blasted by the salty dog it was pointless. (BTW: If you're ever in NY Shake Shack is the place for a good old fashion juicy burger.)\n\nIf you go get the burger, forget the hot dogs until they've improved the recipe."

S"Well I am a big fan Chef Ramsey and his styles of food so I am biased, I had the pork burger, was a great spin a burger.  Truffle fries are a must get, and the chipotle ketchup was great as well.  The atmosphere is loud and modern, we enjoyed that.  \nThe waitstaff was the part not quite up to par with what I would expect from a GR restaurant.  They could be a bit more attentive and less social with each other and pay attention to the customers.  \nThe wait was fine, greeters were nice.\nOverall it's a $50-$75 burger trip, but the uniqueness and experience is worth it."

S"If you're into gourmet burgers, this place is a must try! It's prob the best gourmet burger I've ever had! I tried the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Southern Yardbird burger, both were soo delicious. It doesn't look too big, but they are filling! One order of fries is more than enough per two people. Prices are pretty reasonable too, about 13-17 dollars a burger. Just the thought of it makes me want to go back!"

S"This place is the bomb diggity! My husband and I have been here a few times now since it opened. It's located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino and has a casual, hip vibe to it.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of hamburger meat, but they offer chicken burgers as well. I ordered mine with blue cheese, slaw, and spicy mayo. My husband ordered his hamburger basically the same way, minus the slaw. They were both excellent. The fries are large enough for two people and there are a few options as far as flavors go. We chose the parmesan truffle fries this time, which were devoured in a hurry. The other options are original or sweet potato, and all are served with two types of homemade ketchup.\n\nBe sure to save room for dessert here!!! This place has the most unique milkshakes ever! There are several different flavor combos of ice cream shakes topped with (wait for it)... pudding!!! My fave is the coffee shake topped with chocolate pudding, while my husband enjoys cookies n' cream with creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e pudding. The pudding melts into the ice cream and creates the most unusual, yummy creation known to mankind. We go to Vegas often, and ALWAYS make a stop for one of these shakes.

They each come in a small individual glass with dipping sauce. \n\nWe got a bottle of red Terra Valentine wine which paired well with our burgers. I had the Euro Burger as I'm a fan of goat cheese, which tasted excellent with the beef. All the flavors combined with the cheese, truffle aioli, arugula and tomato created an orgasmic flavor. The size is quite large for being a gourmet burger. \n\nI would've given 5 stars except the wait staff were a bit slow for it not being so busy."

It is less busy upon opening at 11 am, and later at night. Did not try the appetizers because we wanted the shakes. Will try some next time though. We ordered the cookies & creme shake that had creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e pudding in it! To die for! My Hubby (we were honeymooning), had the coffee shake with- wait for it- hazelnut pudding! He also had the Hells kitchen burger. (mine was better). I got a euro burger. It was cooked to perfection and had truffle aioli on it. Unreal. Could be the best burger I have ever had. Ever. The burgers were def big enough- so big we split one on our second trip there. Also had truffle fries which also have the amazing truffle/garlic aioli for dipping. I can't express how delicious the aioli was. I was practically licking the bowl. Could not leave without having the sticky toffee pudding push pops!! Too cute. Very good, but not as good as the original sticky toffee pudding offered at Gordon's gastropub @Caesars. Can't wait to go back! My one gripe- they don't let you call ahead for take out.

I like my meat pink. Yeah judge me. But it's so juicy and the taste of the goat cheese, truffle and arugula just blends into some kind of goodness. \n\nFury Chicken Wings: Ok this is not for kids! It has a kick to it...a spicy-ness kick.\n\nSweet Potato Fries: Vanilla powerdered sugar and honey jalapeno mayo. Ok, powdered sugar on SWEET potato fries? Ok too much sweetness going on here.\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries: Hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt and truffle aioli. OMG. Just truffles left and right. \n\nJust fries: the safest type of fries you can get.\n\nThe restaurant is fairly small. OR I thought so.

S'I came here with my family for a total of five people. We had a bit of a wait but the host was professional and nice and sat us as soon as she could. The food was amazing and they have a really fun beer menu too, oh and pudding shakes! \nWe started off with the jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers which are served with one popper containing seeds so its a bit of a roulette. They were fun and were super tasty. My burger was the Farm burger with duck breast bacon and a fried egg. It is just as amazing as it sounds, perfectly fried egg (a little goopy yolk), cooked perfect medium...highly recommended. We tried the three different types of fries, loved the truffle fries and really enjoyed the curry ketchup with the "just fries". \nThe service was exceptional we had Dorota and Chad and they were genuinely personable and attentive. Emily the manager was equally attentive and friendly. We are def coming back...theres 4 more puddig shakes i need to try after all:) BurGR captures what Chef Ramsay is known for, great food with great service.'

S'I\'m a Gordon Ramsay fangirl as much as the next person, and after a good experience at Steak this was next on my list to try. Prior to seeing the O show, BF and I came here for dinner on a Friday night- not thrilled that they don\'t take reservations so the line wraps around the corner for a predictable 30 minute minimum wait. But the hostess was super sweet and the wait went fast.\n\nBEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS: The cheddar-ranch dip made this dish for me, but wasn\'t enough to save the rings for my guy, who felt they were overly breaded and not crispy enough. Wouldn\'t get again but loved the sauce.\n\nHELL\'S KITCHEN BURGER: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno pepper, avocado, and oven roasted tomato. Looked a bit more delicious than it actually tasted, the jalapeno is a kick in the mouth that is quickly quelled by the cold, creamy avocado and roasted tomato. Wish it came with more than one roasted jalapeno, the first bite of combined flavors was best, the rest only had one or two of the featured ingredients and came off as bland.\n\nFARM BURGER: duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. The egg makes this, but everyone else seems to say the bacon makes it. I\'m not a huge bacon fan but expected to be converted by this one. Not so much. Egg yolk plus medium-rare burger was delish, cheese flavor was lost and overpowered by the other ingredients.\n\nTRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES: After the \'rings ordeal, I didn\'t think we needed another side but BF insisted. The order is enormous and even with our large appetites we did not come close to finishing. The truffle parm and truffle salt don\'t hold a candle to the amazing truffle aioli. \n\nSHAKE #5: coffee shake, chocolate pudding, "praline cookie". Served in one giant glass with two wide boba-style straws, this was a tasty treat. Liked that it wasn\'t super sweet. Praline cookie is more of a wafer without much flavor.  \n\nOVERALL:  Food didn\'t quite live up to the hype: bummed there isn\'t a mushroom burger with cheese on the menu, but for the two burgers we did order, the cheese was understated with both. Would customize a burger on a future visit, subbing chantrelle mushrooms for the tomato on the Euro burger. Rounding up for quality, as the actual beef was by far the best burger I\'ve had in a damn long time.\n\nShout out to the hostess, who was super sweet, brought out a menu to view while in line, was the first of two staff to recommend the HK burger we ended up getting.'

Ordered the Caesar salad which sounded interesting but the apples seemed like an after thought, just a little topping to a mediocre overly dressed pile of lettuce. I got the American burger which was really juicy and delicious and bf got the Hell's Kitchen which he loved. It definitely has a big kick, if you don't like spice you won't like that! Service was super slow but we were watching tennis anyway so no big deal. It's decent and better than eating lunch at a bar where everyone is getting drunk so 3 stars, served its purpose for what we needed."

I had calamri as an appetizer-the marinara is AWESOME has a little bit of a kick. This was followed by fish and chips:one of the best I've had in Arizona (I'm sadly resolved to the fact that I probably won't get good English-style fish and chips anywhere in The Valley, so this will do) There's nothing I can say about the beer that hasn't been said, but their summer seasonal was amazing and I could have stayed there all night putting many away. The only downside is the lack of parking. I had to park down a dead-end dirt road.Trying to turn my SUV around was like that scene in Austin Powers with the cart in Dr. Evil's lair.

S"This isn't a review, it's a love story.\n\nFour Peaks and I have had the most amazing relationship over the past four years. We were first introduced back in 2007. It was the summer before my senior year of college and I was barely 21. It was not love at first sight. Oh, no no. I was new to the world of beer and it wasn't my beverage of choice (though a Peach Ale on a hot night was always delicious).\n\nBut this isn't a place you go to solely for the beer.  Good food was nothing new to me, and this is where Four Peaks really shines. My friends would get together and drink, and I would eat. And eat. And eat. Hummus, pizza, bruchetta (you have to get the shrimp and goat cheese!), burgers, fries. My heart flutters for their Salmon BLT.\n\nAnd then I got into beer. This is when Four Peaks and I began our unstoppable love. I'm truly lucky to live close enough to stop by regularly, but far enough away to not become a fat alcoholic. All of the beers are perfect in their own way, my choice always depends on my mood and what I'm eating. And don't miss the cask conditioned selections! Always interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere completes the trifecta of awesomeness, with the indoor/outdoor feel and giant brewery equipment looming in the background. There is something for everyone at this perfect little local gem, and to this day I haven't found anyone who disagrees. I'm beginning to think Four Peaks isn't really a monogamous lover..."

S"3 stars for being aite...\n\nI think most of the 'buzz' (if there still is any) has to do with the location. As the name suggests, this place isn't really promoted or advertised anywhere in the Cosmo, or in Las Vegas in general. There is not menu, or even a sign in the hotel that says that it exists. \n\nIt's actually called the pizzeria according to the cosmo, but its found pretty much on the 3rd flood right by the elevator. Look for a corridor decorated with golden album all over the walls. When you come in there is no menu printed anywhere, instead you just look at the pizzas they have and pick one.\n\nThe costs is usually around $5-6 a slice depending on what you get, which I think is pretty price for quick slice of pizza. The food itself is decent, the white pizza is excellent as I am a fan of ricotta, but there are quite a few average pies as well (pepperoni is no different than most other places). \n\nI think the real attraction is the fact that it is pretty much the only place in the Cosmo where you can get food for less than $10 a person. And it does seem kind of 'cool' to go to place that is a secret... But I think that secret is getting out especially when you see a long line drunk kids from Marquee stretching out of the hall way."

But that's not such a bad thing really, as it keeps the location mysterious and 'in the know' plus it makes it kind of fun in discovering it.  The spot is literally hidden from view and the only way I found it was when I saw some dude come out from a dark hallway with a big box of pizza.  \n\nI ordered two slices and they were delicious!  You especially have to try their White Pizza with Ricotta and Mozzarella Cheese.  It was my favorite slice.  Take a look at their slices......(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=ncKnJNu1chqnamZNqPvfxg) they're huuge NY Style thin slices.  Very good and actually pretty filling.  The slices can range from $4.50-$6 depending the toppings which are a little pricey but considering that the slices are extra large and are very tasty, the price is pretty much justified.\n\nIt's nice to see more quality pizza joints open up on the Strip.  With this spot and La Pizza, I'm glad that I can pick up a slice for a cheap lunch or even for a late night snack.

At any rate, the line may seem long but it moves pretty fast. I wouldn't say it's exactly like NYC pizza but it comes pretty close.  We tried a slice of the pepperoni and the white pizza.  After a few bites of the white pizza the ricotta and mozzarella became cheese overload for me.  Definitely go with the pepperoni as a no fail choice.

Maybe it's their secret way of keeping the place hidden and away from all the tourists.   Just find the public billiard table in the open floor, and then look for a long dark hallway which seems like it's a private entrance for staff.  Once you walk the long dark hallway, you will walk into a small pizza shop, and the smell of fresh pizza will immediately engulf you!\n\nMy friends split a cheese pizza, white pizza, and a pepperoni, olive, and mushroom pizza.  The line can get long, so be prepared to wait!  Once you order, the server will take your slice of pizza and bake it in the oven for a few minutes to get it nice and melty.  I believe a pizza slice comes out to be around $4 per slice.  I thought the price was slightly high since it was a super thin crust, and the slices didn't seem all that big.   The pizza was pretty good, but definitely not as good as the stuff served in NY.  I did not care for the white pizza, but the cheese and pepperoni pizza was pretty good.   Also, the crust was slightly chewy, which I did not like, but I really liked the cheese and spices they topped on the pizza.  One slice of pizza is like an appetizer, so I would suggest you order 2-3 slices a person, if you want to actually get filled up or eat it as a dinner.    I'd come back for a late night snack or an afternoon appetizer if I'm in the area, but it's not something I would walk from Wynn to Cosmo to eat.

S"This is the best pizza I've ever tasted. I know my East Coast friends are a little skeptic about this assertion. I don't even know how to describe it or why it's so good. It just is. Go try it for yourself. If you can find it.... \n\nIt's on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Just go up the escalators by the Liberace Rhinestone Rolls Royce on the first level or the escalators by the All Saints store on the second level. Look for the pool tables and there will be a hallway lined with vintage record album covers. It's next to a sushi restaurant. \n\nThe service is always quick and friendly. The prices are a little steep for pizza and a drink. Almost $20 for 2 slices and 2 sodas. \n\nPlease try this please and tell me if I'm wrong! If this is not the best pizza you've ever tasted...let me know where I can find better pizza!!"

S"Secret Pizza is so much fun to take people to!  They do pizza exceptionally well...nice crispy bottom, chewy crust, great sauce.  It is not my all-time-favorite or anything, but on taste alone I'd hand out 4.5 stars.  \n\nAny two of the following puts it in a unique place that is well deserved of 5 stars for me:  It is called Secret Pizza for a reason, there are no signs; it is not located on the restaurant listing for the Cosmopolitan. Walking down the hall to a hidden gem is half the fun!  Then there is the fact that you can get a quality IPA on tap.  The wall of records is is incredibly cool, and the black & white tile fits so perfectly.\n\nPizza + secret + atmosphere + IPA = an easy 5 stars in my book.  I will take out-of-town friends here anytime, but i'd also stop in for a slice if I was anywhere near the cosmo!"

I have been to the cosmo twice already and never seen this place, so I had to ask around, and they pointed me toward a long hallway all hidden in the back. \n\nSo it being hidden doesn't seem it gets a lot of customers, but I guess from the reviews it's doing good. \n\nNo menu, so you just have to look at the pizza and decide. This place is crazy small. It might fit 15 people. Only like five seats so it's a race to find one. I stood up and ate my pizza because I didn't want to walk around cosmo trying to find a place to sit. \n\nThe pizza was pleasant, nothing bad about it. \n\nTrash cans are full, so napkins are stacked high.\n\nIt seems like only two guys are running this place so it's hard. \n\nThe prices are the same everywhere in Vegas, so I am use to the 3 dollar bottle of water and the 4 dollar slice of pizza."

S"The not so secret, Secret Pizza, has been in my bookmarks for a long time. Since I'm pretty sure everyone knows exactly where this place is by now, I won't go to far into it's whereabouts. But, if you do happen to have a hard time finding it, here's a little tip. There's a strange little glass elevator on the 3rd floor...look just to the left of that and you'll see the dark, but wondrous, hallway to pizza heaven. You're welcome.\n\nInside you'll find an arcade game, a few counters to stand at while you eat, and the pizza counter itself. Yup, that's it. After you place your order, you make your way down the line and pay for it at the register. Now, I'm not sure if anyone's really paid much attention but there's well over a grand hanging up on the wall as a decoration near the register too. Maybe a slightly over the top take on the ole' first dollar made thing? I don't know, but it was fun to look at it.\n\nThe pizza selection itself is decent. They have single slices in several varieties, including their infamous white pizza, as well as full pies and somewhat of a build your own option. I also saw a few deep dish slices sitting out but they were huge, and at $8 a slice, I didn't think I'd be able to finish it all. So, I opted for just a single slice of the white. \n\nWith all the hype, I was actually surprised at how good this pizza was. And sure, it's $5 a slice, but they are so big it was easily justified in my eyes...and stomach. Plus the flavors are great and the crust is on point. I really dug the large clumps of ricotta with the hint of garlic, and it's not overly greasy either. Perfectly foldable, and delicious. No complaints and I'm dying to go back to try a slice with some meat added to it. One of the workers said sausage really adds to the white pie.\n\nOne thing I suggest is trying to hit this place up in an off time, if possible. We missed a big rush of people just before 6pm, but as we were leaving, the line was starting to hit the hallway. With standing counter space for only about a dozen people, you might end up juggling your greasy pizza plate and your beer filled red solo cup while tourist play running back to the counter. That wouldn't be good.\n\nIf you've yet to try Secret Pizza, what are you waiting for? Surely not a tip on how to find it. Just get down here already!"

S"Legit NYC style pizza right down to the white tiled hole in the wall setting, complete with pinball machines and signed dollar bills taped up next to the register.\n\nThe crust is just the right thickness and almost has a bit of a sourdough flavor. The sauce is mild and subtle, and the cheese is perfectly proportioned. The pepperoni and meatball toppings are both winners.\n\nThe staff has that New York sass to them, but always provide solid service.\n\nI don't care if it's a ridiculous $4.50 per slice, Secret Pizza is the best slice in town, is worth a special trip, and is my go-to when I get that craving for a good slice or four."

S"A clever idea and much easier to find than many would have you believe, Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan is one of those places that seems to get a lot of praise from all the wrong sorts of people yet curious to experience it myself and without dinner plans until 8pm I decided to stop in for a snack while shopping Crystals.  A small place with a TV and a couple of pinball machines plus the slice counter down a long hall of records the restaurant was perhaps half full when I arrived and with three pizzas ready to serve my choice was simplified dramatically when a fresh Roma and Ricotta emerged from the oven as I was waiting in line.  Friendly in service and low in price for a hefty slice with excellent ingredient quality I've heard many compare Secret to New York slice shops and while the foldable structure and gas oven production is similar I'll simply say that anyone making such claims is a fool - most New York Slice shops are serving low quality ingredients on a subpar crust for ninety-nine cents while Secret is serving top quality sauce without unnecessary sweetness under smooth mozzarella on a crust with a good crunch, great chew, and an excellent crumb.  Admittedly bummed that they were completely sold out of canolis that are, alas, pre-filled but still something I'd like to try I've no doubt I'll head back for the square slice sometime soon."

S"I recently came here at 3 a.m. with a group of friends after we were done clubbing at Hyde. ROOKIE MISTAKE. Oh man, I feel so dumb. I have been a fan of Secret Pizza since day one, and this was the first time I went at such an insane hour. Egad. I don't recommend this AT ALL. Sure, we were the fools that walked from one damn casino to another, which in all honesty is also a dumb mistake. But the pizza here is so, so good! Nice, thin and crisp!\n\nAfter the long trek from the Bellgio to the Cosmopolitan, we saw the crowd but got in line nonetheless. After waiting for more than 20 minutes we decided that in order to make the most of it we should order a whole pie. Well some other people had the same idea and they had been waiting for 45 minutes. What? We ended up getting one slice per person, which is really sad (and kind of expensive). This was a week ago and I am still craving pizza. \n\nThe lesson? Go before midnight. You'll thank me for it."

S'We walked pretty much the whole second floor for 30 minutes only to find this pizzeria is on the 3rd floor. This was all because the review I saw on Yelp said it was on the 2nd floor... or maybe I read wrong due to the Fat Tuesday I had with me?\n\nSo yes it is on the 3rd floor, near the pool table! There is a door with no sign or anything, but behind the door there is a long walkway covered in Italian record cover art, and as you pass it, boom! Its a small pizzeria! I ordered two slices, one pepperoni and another with sausage and ricotta cheese. The pizza is very good, big slice and NY style... where you have to fold the pizza to enjoy it. The pepperoni was good but the winner for me was the sausage and ricotta. OMG. That was amazing. Next time I definitely will be ordering a box of that.\n\nThe pizzeria is again small, with a few stools to sit on and also a few pinball machines. It was fun talking to some of the people there who were also enjoying their pizza. Pricing was fairly high compared to your local pizza place (like $4-5 a slice) but hey, it\'s Vegas and also at the Cosmo, the "it" hotel at Vegas right now. A whole pizza is probably the best bet, as its around $22 for a whole pizza. Also they are open til 4am for all the drunkies! lol.\n\nOverall, a cool "secret" pizza spot in Vegas!

The service here is great and friendly but it\'s not like this was the best pizza I ever had.\n\nYou can order individual slices or a whole pie and you can even get 2L bottles of soda.  I had the veggie which was pretty good and the white pizza which was tasty but it was a huge greasy mess since its basically garlic oil and ricotta cheese.  The oil was literally dripping off the pizza and while its garlic flavored its also not very appetizing when it cools down from pipping hot.\n\nThis place is pretty darn popular so I think they should change the name to "was secret\' pizza (I kid).

S"Spot on pizza. It takes at least 30 minutes if you order a whole pizza, so to curb your hunger you can just grab a slice... although, the freshly baked pizza is really worth waiting for if pizza is your thing.\n\nMy one issue? Secret pizza is not really secret. On Saturday night it took 30 minutes to get through the line, then another 30 ,inutes as my friends and I ordered a whole pizza. At 3am - we were drunk and hungry so this was not happy time.\n\nGranted, it was Saturday on Halloween weekend so maybe it was especially packed. But if you don't want to wait in line, avoid post club hours as everyone from Marquee just makes there way over to Secret Pizza."

Minus one for that, but other than wait time, quality pizza right hurr.\n\nBe aware of bitches who cut in line--Sure, we may have alcohol in our systems and are hungry as hell, I'm still sober enough to follow the line, so get your ass to the back of the line.

S'If a restaurant is good, then the word spreads like wildfire. The secret pizzeria in Cosmopolitan is no exception. In two days, I have overheard about this place from a complete stranger while waiting in line at another restaurant, read the stellar reviews on Yelp, and today, heard about it on a morning radio show. I knew I had to try this place ASAP.\n\nLucky for me, I work on the Strip so my co-workers and I went during lunch. Good thing I did my research or we would\'ve never found the place. It was like a treasure hunt... third floor, next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, down a secret hallway lined with album covers... and there it was!\n\nOnce I saw the white pizza come out fresh from the oven, I knew I wanted a slice of it before even hearing what\'s on it. A slice of the white pizza and a soda cost $7. Not too shabby at all.\n\nThe pizza was heavenly. The crust had the right amount of crispiness, garlic and cheesiness. I\'m usually not a crust eater but I devoured every last bite. I seriously considered buying a whole box but didn\'t want to share with the whole office.\n\nThe real test was when I brought back a slice of cheese pizza to my co-worker, who is a New Yorker, and is very critical about restaurants that claim to have "authentic New York pizza." He said the pizza was "pretty damn good." \n\nI\'m pretty sure you\'ll find me here at least once a week for lunch. Maybe dinner too!'

Crazy enough, I've passed by this place a majority of the time I've come to the Cosmo but never noticed it.  The hallway is right next to Blue Ribbon, wedged right next to the restaurant on the right of it.\n\nThe hallway was clearly decorated with vintage album covers.  At the end of the hallway there were 2 pinball games (a Vegas & Monopoly machine) & a Galaga!  I got the white pizza and my friend got regular cheese w/ mushrooms.  Initially, I didn't really like the taste of the white pizza($4), because whatever cheeses are thrown to them, but after it cooled off a bit, it was actually pretty tasty.  My friends pizza had a nice crispy crust with little sauce but was still really good overall.\n\nThis place is a good & cheap spot to go if you're on a budget."

S'I love the idea of all the "secrecy!".  Do you need a password?  Find a special map? Sound daunting to you?  Don\'t fret.  Just go to the Cosmopolitan and find the escalator and the directory will tell you its on the 3rd floor.  If your faculty to read has left you (and that does happen sometimes in Las Vegas) just look for the folks who are walking around in the hotel with white, plain pizza boxes and ask them where they got it.\n\nWhat\'s really likeable about this joint is that:\na.) it really keeps to its mysterious charm.\nThere\'s no sign, just a dark hallway that you would pass and wouldn\'t even know it was there if you weren\'t looking for it on purpose.\n\nb.) Its so unexpected.\nYou\'d never think you\'d find a place that serves pizza for $4.50 a slice in the trendy and posh Cosmopolitan hotel.  There is nothing fancy about this place - they serve your pizza on paper plates and soda in a red dixie cup!  They also have beer.\n\nc.) The pizza is SO DANG good!\nGood in a "Man I\'m so drunk and I hella want a pizza right now" way as well as when you\'re sober.  The thin crust is perfectly crispy and you know that its really good pizza when it stays that way even if its been sitting out on the warmers and reheated for you.  The WHITE pizza is has no red sauce but olive oil instead, and has a great combo of parmesan, mozzarella and dollops of ricotta.  Super flavorful and super cheesy.  The Pepperoni and Combo slices we got were just as delicious and with just the right amount of sauce and toppings to hold well with the glorious thin crust.\n\nGreat to have a slice there and good to buy a whole pie to take back to the room.\n\nDid I tell you that I don\'t keep secrets very well?  ;)  Not this kind anyway!'

S'Secret Pizza, you sneaky little devil. This pizza joint, if I recall, is located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan. Once you step off the escalator, look for a nondescript hallway, no signs, no nothing but  quite possibly a looong line of people. Congratulations, you\'ve unlocked their "secret" venue, now prepare yourself for a good 30 minute wait. I won\'t lie. It\'s pretty much torture, especially if you\'ve found yourself here after club hours like myself. You can try your best to entertain yourself with the semi-neato-skeeto album covers but who are we kidding, anytime you get a whiff of that delicious pizza or someone exits the venue and walks past you in that narrow hallway, you\'re reminded how you\'re STILL in line and STILL not stuffing your piehole with, well, pie.\n\nAfter you\'ve managed to snake yourself to the end of the hallway, you can start eyeballing which pie is destined to be yours, individual slices or a whole pie? I opted for the latter and had to wait longer but it was worth it. I got half mushroom & pepperoni and the other half was ricotta and garlic. I enjoyed both types immensely but favored the white pizza and would gladly bathe in slices of this pizza - so good! Uber good!!\n\nPizza had a nice chewiness and the cheese was cheesy goodness. Definitely hit the spot! I ordered a large pizza and ducked out to one of the open tables just to the left upon exiting the hallway and inhaled my little slice of heaven.\n\nOh, by the way. You might see some unusual happenings while in line. For instance, one girl got to the cashier, turned around, lifted her dress and shook what her mama gave her. My friend and I turned to look at each other and mentally said, "Did you just see that?" while one other patron yelled out "Does that get you free toppings?" Hahah, we all laughed.\n\nAnyway, duty called (boyfriend back in hotel room patiently waiting) so I paraded out of The Cosmopolitan and made my way over to MGM. Unfortunately BF was passed out, sad story for him, but happy ending for me: I plopped down in our living room and helped myself to another slice :)\n\nSo my verdict?\n\nWorth the wait? Unfortunately yes.\nWill I come back? Oh you betcha\'\nWill I save pizza for the next morning? No, it\'s definitely better hot... unless you have access to a microwave!'

S'Giving this 4 stars mainly because of the pizza, not so much the service.\n\nA friend told me about the "secret pizza" place, so when another friend and I set up a date to meet, I suggested we try it.  Good thing that friend did some research, otherwise we may not have found it!  She knew it was near another restaurant and that it was a long hallway.  At the end of the long hallway was a pinball machine, making it look like an arcade or something.\n\nWe went down the hallway and it wasn\'t quite what I was expecting:  it was basically a counter with a menu board, and mostly seating facing the wall on bar stools.  For some reason I expected a sit down place, or at least something with more tables.  Fortunately we were there when it wasn\'t that crowded.\n\nI found the menu a bit confusing - it sounded like you could order slices with customized toppings, so my friend and I were trying to figure out what we wanted since we didn\'t want to order a whole pizza.  Then we noticed that they already had pizzas ready to serve by the slice - we looked at them and decided on 3 slices:  pepperoni, sausage & mushroom, and cheese w/ white sauce.  We each also ordered a soda.  The total came out to just under $20.\n\nWe cut each slice in half, and that was a good amount of food for us for lunch.  And the pizzas were all quite tasty!  It was definitely worth it, food wise.  The service was just okay - nothing bad, but nothing good either.  I wish the menu board was easier to figure out, maybe describing the ordering process or something.  The seating area isn\'t that great either, and it was pretty filthy.  When we first got there, it was slow - it seems like one of the workers could have quickly wiped down the counters before it got busy again.\n\nBut, nonetheless, it was good pizza, and I\'d definitely go back again (but maybe do like what some other people did and take it out into the lobby area to eat).'

I quickly dispatched my handy Yelp app and searched for "late night food" (it was 2AM after all) and noticed the intriguing title of "Secret Pizza".  Not only were we already in the Cosmopolitan but it also was highly rated.\n\nFinding this place was an adventure, partially because it\'s hidden/not listed anywhere and also because I was already three sheets to the wind and would probably have a hard time finding it even if I didn\'t have anything to drink.  Alas, do not discount the determination of two twenty something males with a craving for some late night pizza.\n\nThe actual pizzeria wasn\'t terribly big and thankfully wasn\'t crowded when we went so ordering and paying for our slices was relatively fast.  I ordered a slice of the white pizza (effin delicious) and another equally delicious pizza (see photo) which name escapes me.  Both slices were amazing from the toppings right down to the crust...which I ate all of.  The cost of my fourth meal was $11 (verified by the credit card receipt in my wallet the next day) which was not only reasonable but totally worth it.'

Each slice is preheated, and one of the disappointing things is that both of our slices were overly salty.  The slices were good, but no where near the hype. And not anywhere near the quality of an authentic slice from NY.  I think the slices were $5-7 each, and beer was $7-8.\n\nThe service was OK and there is virtually no seating.

Given the pizza joint at The Cosmopolitan is not listed in any of the hotel\'s customer collateral nor is it advertised on property and one has to both know it is there and how to get to it, my hubby and I figured this would be more the myth of "secret place" hype than good pizza. Happily, we were wrong.\n\nFinding ourselves at the Cosmopolitan about 1:30 in the afternoon one day last week and hungry for just a little something, we went to the Pizzeria. What we discovered is this teeny place makes really good pizza. In fact, my Brooklyn born and reared hubby thought it a good rendition of New York style pizza and coming from him that is high praise. It was the chewy, foldable crust, he said, and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. \n\nA generous slice was about $3.50 so a good value for Las Vegas eats. Pies are sold whole too. \n\nThe VERY little pizza shop has standing at counter space for maybe eight - and another two spaces that are low enough to be used by both people in wheelchairs and shorter people...love universal access like that. \n\nBut you could not get my claustrophobic self to stay in that little space to eat, so we walked to the lobby outside the Pizzeria and enjoyed our slice in that "game room" setting with a pool table, board games, low tables, chairs and sofas scattered about and multicolored glass lit ceiling above. \n\nAnd here goes a nod to the very nice Security guy who walked over to talk to us. "Oh oh" I thought, "we\'re probably not supposed to be eating pizza here." But as it turns out, he wanted to simply ask how we liked the pizza and being from New York himself, he agreed with my hubby that it was very good indeed. He introduced himself as Chris (Cosmopolitan staff do not wear name tags - a tactic that is part of a service strategy to get the employees to introduce themselves to guests) and asked if he could answer any questions about The Cosmopolitan for us. That kind of friendly approach from customer facing employees was consistent with every one of our experiences at the hotel, by with way, with the exception of the staff at the Chandelier Bar on the second floor.  ( But that\'s another review.)  We made sure to leave the lobby table as clean as we found it. \n\nPizzeria opens at 11a.m. and stays open until sometime in the wee hours of the morning. \n\nHere\'s how to get there (see photos included to illustrate): \n\na) Take the elevator near the Chandelier Bar to the third floor. When the doors open you\'ll see the lounge with the pool table in front of you. \n\nb) Make a hard right hairpin turn as you exit the elevator and you\'ll be in the short hallway that leads to the tiny Pizzeria.  You\'ll see a pinball machine at the end of the hallway. ( If you make only a right turn as you exit the elevator, you\'ll end up at the hallway that dead-ends in a concourse of meeting rooms. Ask me how I know that. :-)  A hairpin right is the thing. )\n\nc) The pinball machine you\'ll see in front of you as you make the hairpin turn is actually at the entry to the pizza place.\n\nSo there you go!  Mangia!'

S"This place is a very solid pizza joint. Coming from New York, I appreciate a good solid pizza. \n\nThe prices for a pie here isn't the cheapest in the world, but it's some of the cheapest you'll pay on the strip. At 26 bucks for a regular pie and 28 for a white pie, it's really a good deal. There are 10 slices to the pie, and it comfortably fed myself and 3 of my family members. \n\n30 bucks for a dinner for 4? I dare you to find that anywhere else on the strip. \n\nWhat's more is we enjoyed playing ms. Pacman and their pinball machines while we waited! The lack of seating is a bummer, but we got the only 4 chairs in the place so we were fine. \n\nThe white pie was really good, though next time around I think we will give the regular pie a shot with the meatball topping. It looked delicious!"

S'I love everything about this place. It stands for something, a voice of truth, reason, and simplicity in a city built on ostentatious complexity and because of this, I can say with complete confidence that there is not a better meal in Las Vegas. \n\nSo rare it is to find a great meal and an unbelievable price for Las Vegas that I would choose a meal at the Pizzeria over any other place in town. I mean it. Here you will not find a line for gamblers who have been given complementary dining and line passes, you will not need a reservation, and you will not find a dress code. \n\nWhat you will find inside this hallway is truth. People who seem genuinely happy you came in to grab a slice. You will find real pizza. Unharmed by some celebrity chef being paid too much to make expensive food that is rarely worth the cost. \n\nYour food is served on a cheap paper plate, your beer is served in a red plastic college party cup. Have a seat on one of the three barstools, play some pinball, watch some sports and soak it in because when you exit through that hallway, you will not find another real restaurant on the Strip until you return.'

S'"NOT SO SECRET PIZZA".\n\nYes, there was a line.\n\nPizza was good but not mindblowing.  \nThe crust is super crunchy..\nThink I prefer more of a rustic style pizza that is a litte more burnt around the edges and slightly more chewy.\n\nBut it was good and very affordable.\n\nBeer prices seemed good until they hand hand it to you in a red cup...\nTalk about TINY...  It was like 8 ounces?\n\nDefinitely worth a try if you\'re staying in the Cosmopolitan, but I\'d say skip it you\'re coming just for the pizza.'

S"The name alone grew my curiosity.  Once I tried it, I thought, 'damn, I wish it were still a secret!'  Unfortunately, everyone and their mothers knows about Secret Pizza.  If you don't, then you need to go upstairs from Chandelier in the Cosmopolitan and look for the Vinyls.  \n\nOnce you walk through the hallway lines with record covers, you'll see this little quaint slice of heaven.  The place always has a line, there's a few stools to sit on in the back and a few vintage arcade games for your pleasure.  What I really like is their wall of money by the paying station.  The top row is lines with $100 bills.  Bawlllerrrrr!  LOL.\n\nWhen it's your turn, choose the pizza they have and they'll reheat the already cooked slice.  Usually runs about 6-8 dollars depending on the type of pizza.  I was with a group of 4 peeps.  We all the Chicago style pizza square with sun-dried tomatoes on top with 4 PBR drafts.  Total came to about $50 which was a little steep, but soooo worth it!  The pizza was full of cheesy goodness and the bottom of the crust was super crispy.  Every bite was amazing and it really filled us up!  Beer was crisp and very cold.  Perfect Sunday meal.\n\nIf you're smart enough to find this place, you deserve a slice of heaven.  That's my motto for this place.  If you need help though, just look for the pool table and you'll see the hall of records close by.  You're welcome in advance."

S"At the end of a walkway hall with records is some hidden pizza. This place has no signage and is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan. It's hidden... yet tons of people seem to be able to find this place and devour their pizza. Proof that if you offer something good, people will find you. \n\nI came here with my friend after watching Rose. Rabbit. Lie. I had one drink there... but it was sooo strong that it made me feel sick and I was in some dire need of some quick comfort food to ease my tummy.\n\nWe looked for this place on the signs... none of which says Secret Pizza anywhere... so I looked on my trusted Yelp for clues. Like I said initially,  it's located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel. It's in a corner... but if you spot the pool tables (which are easily visible) the wall of records leading to Secret Pizza is right in front of it. \n\nThe hallway is not too long... but it feels very exclusive/secret at you have to walk this hallway to get to it. Lol. The pizza place itself is very small with very few seats. My friend and I beat the crowd because we were able to get seats and have no line, well, only 2 people in front of me. After I got my pizza and came back to my friend who was saving seats... the place was packed! Even just standing it was packed!\n\nAnyways, as far as it being just one slice of pizza... the price was okay. I'm used to Costco's $2 slices haha. Here, they have pizza with the red sause (tomatoe) or white sauce. A cheese slice is $4.50, white is $5, or red with toppings is $5.50. I had a red slice with pepperoni,  sausages,  and mushrooms. The pizza was good!! Very tasty and the crust was cripsy. I loved it! A nice warm cheesy, crunchy, savory,  and tasty bite each time. The slices are pretty big... so for $5.50 it wasn't too bad! Of course I ate the whole slice and my stomach was satisfied. So glad we came here and got some pizza to counter the alcohol I was carrying in my stomach. It was the perfect counter to drinking in Vegas. Just beware that the slices are pretty greasy... so if you're worried about that, use napkins to soak up some before you eat!\n\nService here was nothing special. Not good, not bad. Seating is bar style on 2 walls... but there's only like 5 chairs I saw? Definitely not enough for everyone to sit... the rest of your party will have to stand... ot take it out to the pool table area where there are a few couches around. Chili and permeasean cheese are out at the bar area along with napkins. They also have a pinball machine here! I'm not sure if it works as I didnt notice anyone playing it.\n\nThis place is open all nigh, and late night too. So it's perfect after a night out in Vegas of drinking, dancing, partying. Its hidden.... but if all the stumbling drunk people can find it, then you can too!! 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan hotel near the pool tables... just follow the wall of records!"

The pizza chefs are pretty legit there.\n\nThere was not a long line (just about 5 people in front) when I went (around 7:30PM). A friend of mine recommends me the place cause she knows what Vegas is all about! It took a long time to make the whole pizza pie for 3 people to share though (35 mins), but it was definitely worth the wait. Waiting was not so hard, it's good to walk around and do something else around (gamble). ;) \n\nThe pepperoni and meatball are delicious toppings, and the center of the pizza was magnificent. That first bite has the perfect ratio of tomato sauce and cheese, then as you eat towards the crust more cheese! The dough was so good that I ate everything! I normally don't eat the crust but it was really that good to me. \n\nI'm not a huge critic on pizza like I don't really pay so close of attention to how they make it, but I have eaten pizza around NYC like Grimaldi's and Lombardi's. I have a bigger heart for this place. :)"

S'Good pizza, a little pricey ($30 large 18" pizza, 10 slices, 3 toppings).  It\'s expensive but you are eating at Cosmo, not Costco lol.  The pizza is above average but it\'s not super-mega out of this world awesome.\n\nIf you are getting late night eats then expect a long wait (both in line and while they make it).  I think we waited in line for 25 minutes and another 20 minutes for them to make it.  \n\nSeating is limited so you might find yourself eating in the lobby just outside (especially if you are rolling w/ a large group).'

He was putting on a show for everyone! Huge slices for $3-3.50. I don't even think they charged me for a drink now that I'm thinking about it... I love that they have garlic powder in addition to crushed red peppers and parmasean. YUMMY.

Amazingly its next to blue ribbon inside a small alley. We find it and we tried it. Amazing??? No, Cheap, yes. Unforgettable?? Hardly.\n\nIts just like regular pizza really. You want a good pizza for a super deal and taste absolutely magnificent go to Trevi in Cesar Palace. Monster size pizza for $15 dollars.

It is one of the most greasy, delicious,  white looking pizzas that I have ever tasted, \n\nAnd yeah haha it doesn\'t really have a name btw or a sign or something that will imply that it\'s located there.

You go down a random hallway and it opens up to what looks like a pizza joint in NYC.  no menu, no anything.\n\nSince Cella P and her boyfriend were supposed to meet up with us, Liezl E and I just waited in line.  Well, after a few texts back and forth, they weren\'t coming and we were already in line to try this pizza, so hey, how about we buy a whole pizza and bring it back to the house?  Sure!\n\nWe ordered a whole pie - standard pizza - half with pepperoni and half just plain cheese.  I had some of both - the sauce, the cheese, the dough.  SO GOOD.\n\nIf you want to attract some drunks and crazies, just walk through the Cosmo and out on to the strip to Planet Hollywood (which is where are car was parked)  We got a lot of "I\'ll give you a dollar for a slice" and "where did they get that pizza"\n\nWe all enjoyed the pizza, and I\'ll definitely be back to the random place inbetween two restaurants when I\'m in vegas later this month.'

Here is the breakdown by slice:\n\n*The Crust - Meh! I\'ve had better (2 Stars) - You are looking at approximately a 14" diameter of thin crust with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  One word comes to mind, "greasy."  \n\n*Sausage and Roasted Garlic - Meh! I\'ve had better (2 Stars) - The sausage was good, but I think the Roasted Garlic was forgotten--maybe that\'s why they charged us the 3 topping price.  Plus, I do not think they gave us enough of the sausage per slice to make it more fulfilling.\n\n*Pepperoni and Green Peppers - A-Okay (3 Stars) - Probably the best combination of toppings that made the pizza tasty.  The pepperoni tasted like it was suppose to.  What brought this slice up a notch was the flavor of the roasted green peppers.  \n\nThe Secret Pizza is really in a nondescript location--with no signage at all.  If you are near a random billiards table, you are in the right place.  The place is A-Ok, but I\'ve experienced better.

S"*Best Pizza in Las Vegas*\n\nI believe that good pizza is very hard to find. It's one of those foods that is often made to be a quick cheap fix, and I find myself calling the majority of the pizza I eat average. I'm rarely ever wowed by a slice of pizza and I've grown accustomed to that. When I heard about all the praise this pizzeria was getting I was a bit skeptical, but I will let you know that all that praise is very, very well deserved.\n\nYou need to go on a bit of a hunt to find the pizzeria at the Cosmo. They don't advertise it, you wont find any signs pointing you in its direction, and they don't even mention it on their website. It's located down a random hallway on the third floor nestled next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar. It's a very small pizzeria with only a few stools for sitting and eating. They don't even have a menu. It's all about the pizza here.\n\nThe sauce is delicious, the toppings are delicious, and the crust is delicious. This pizza is delicious! It's made New York style with the floppy pizza that needs to be eaten taco style. The sauce has the perfect amount of flavor to accompany the toppings without being overwhelming or becoming overwhelmed. You can tell that the sauce is fresh along with the toppings. They don't have the largest selection of toppings but the ones that they do have are fresh and beyond tasty. The crust is just the right consistency and is one of those crusts that you wont mind eating the ends of the pizza. It all comes together to make the best pizza in town that I have tried so far. It is a bit pricey when compared to other pizza places but you pay for the quality. \n\nI can't stress enough about how good this pizza is. It is one of the very few pizzas that has been able to wow me. If you want to taste how a real pizza is supposed to taste like go to the Pizzeria at the Cosmo."

That only makes it all the more authentic to me. Just enough attitude to make it interesting but not enough to annoy you. That's why I keep coming back. \n\nSo a slice will (as of this writing) run you about $5, which ain't cheap for pizza. But it's very well made, slowly baked and they'll reheat it for you without even being asked. So I knocked off one star for pricing but in fairness, they DO give you a free cup of water if y ou want it. Also keep in mind it's standing room only and no place to sit but plenty of counter space to stand and eat along the walls. \n\nLove the atmopshere, 80s music often blaring in the background with a few vintage arcade games from that era as well. It's like a time warp back to my teen Generation X years and I love it. Some great art and photos on the wall as well. All in all, a lot packed into a little place. \n\nDefinitely stop by this place - if you can find it. But finding it is half the fun."

S'This is the best pizza ever.  I am not saying this because when I ate  it I was drunk.  It was really good.  The first night I had the pizza was actually the morning after.  I had to eat it the next morning because I fell right to sleep because I was drunk.  I got popped in the microwave and it was good!!  So the next night after another night of partying, but this time I wasnt drunk.  We bought pizza.  It was delicious!!  \nThe first night, we were at Marquee partying and of course we were hungry.  We went to the 3rd floor and saw a bunch of girls eating the pizza and had to ask.  It was in a hallway and there is no name or poster or anything indicating that a pizza place was there.  But you can smell.  This was a saturday night and it was a long line.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The pizzas looked good.  We got about 10 slices of pizza and paid about less than $40.  \nThe next night which was Sunday, there was no line at 3am.  We waited a couple minutes and ate it right there.  \nIf you ever in the hotel or at Marquee, you have to stop by this place.  best pizza ever!'

The Yelp reviews led me the right direction.\n\nThe workers were really nice, espeically considering how hard and fast they were working b/c of the huge crowd. \n\nI love that they offer free water! The sodas were $4 for a solo cup size but the nice cold water fit the bill to wash down my slice. \n\nI wish I'd waited for my slice to cool a bit before I went after it. It was so fresh and hot that picking it up caused the toppings to slide around. I went folded style and it was greasy good. \n\nI'll try it again next time and chill out for a minute while it cools!"

If you peer through the hallway and see a red pinball machine, you've found yourself some bomb ass pizza.\n\nDon't worry about the toppings, it's not about the toppings here. It's about the crust and the sauce, both of which this little pizzeria knocks out of the park.\n\nThe sauce on this pizza is perfectly seasoned, and there's just the right amount. But the best part is the hand-tossed crust. People usually like thin crust because it's crispy. People usually like pan crust because it's doughy. THIS crust manages to be crispy AND doughy. We figured that one large (10 slices) was enough to feed 5 of us (3 girls, 2 guys), but this pizza was so good that we had to order another large to go.\n\nThe prices here are a bit steep ($4 for a 2-topping slice, $22 for a 3-topping large), but the premium price will definitely get you some premium pie."

I kept seeing people with these slices of pizza and I'm like...  hey!!!  where you get that... and they like... its a secret!  hehaea... someone told me.\n\nSo...  I like to try new pizza places.  I'm in search of the best pizza!  or like my mom says... peekza.\n\nI been to chicago, miami, new york...  and a bunch of other places.  I got a decent basis for judging pizza. So everytime i go any where i order a pepperoni and then whatever special...\n\nnow...  The pizza was average.  The cheeses were not high grade and you can tell because a high quality cheese will melt evenly and you won't see too much of a cut between the oil and the cheese.  This pizza had pockets of oil... so instantly i knew it was a midgrade cheese.\n\nIn new york, (which doesn't have the best pizza by the way but are top contenders) they throw chunks of mozarella...  they look like little mcnuggest and boom...  you get this sexy cheese spread.  And no pockets of oil...  \n\nThe sauce wasn't knock your socks off good...  but it was decent.  Not too sweet. a little on the thin side for me...\n\nBut it was a decent slice.  What killed it is the price.  I paid for two slices and a can of orange crush 15 bucks.  I was like... for serious?\n\nAdd it to room 1159...   it didn't work no registered guess in that name.  oh well.\n\nSo i dish out my card... cry a little bit.  then eat my pizza."

It's near many of the other restaurant but there's NO signage ANYWHERE for this place.  Hence  the secret I guess.  \n\nWe went to check it out when we first arrived to possibly get a quick lunch but it doesn't have places to sit and eat so we decided to try it later.  Bad move! \n\nWhile there during the day, there was  no line, but things changed at 3 in the morning.  There was a serious line.  But what are you to do when it's the only place open and you need some grease? \nLine moved fairly quickly and we got the slices we were eyeing earlier.  We tried the white pizza and pepperoni with peppers.  \nPizza was bomb!  Loved that it's all thin crust.  Had some good flavors going on.

Luckily in the same trip we decided to check it out again and this time there was almost no line. I didn't see a menu so I just looked at what pizzas they had available. I opted for the pepperoni/sausage slice. From what others said, they usually pop it back in the oven for a quick reheat, but I think with the turnover and how quickly people were coming, the pizza was still fresh out of the oven and didn't need a reheat. \nThis place makes no sense. There is no sign and the hallway is super long. They even have like a pinball machine? Totally doesn't fit the lavishness of cosmo either. It was like 3-4 dollars a slice and served on weak paper plates. \n\nAlthough a bit greasy, it was really good. Totally hit the spot and even though I wasn't hungry, I really wanted to get another slice. We ate right outside the pizza joint because it was too small and crowded inside."

It's actually really good for a pizza joint. The only problem is the place is slightly expensive, but totally worth it and being in the Cosmopolitan I wouldn't really expect anything less. \n\nIt's about $5 per slice, but the slices are pretty decent. I like the white sauce pizza, but they do have the regular red sauce. They have a wide range of toppings, but I usually get sausage or pepperoni but sometimes a combo too. \n\nOnce you order they throw the slices in the oven to warm it up a bit so you do have to wait a little bit. So it does come out hot and you'll have to wait a little bit for it to cool down. When my friends and I went, there wasn't a line at all, but it blew up pretty quickly right behind us, which was surprising. \n\nIt's a pretty good NY style pizza, I'll definitely be going back soon for sure for some more pizza."

I went with 3 friends and we managed to make it more cost effective by buying one whole pizza and a 2-liter vs. separate slices and separate drinks for all 4 of us.  I think that cut $20 off our potential bill haha.\n\nOne positive - we went around... 11:30 a.m. (?) so we beat the lunch rush and didn't have to wait in a line.

Yelpers came through once again.  The pizza was off the hook at this little hole in the wall.  And when I say hole in the wall, I mean hole in the wall.  The place is hard to find.  The Cosmo does not list it anywhere on their signs.  We had to ask several people before we were guided in the right direction.  Its on the third floor of the hotel toward the back down a long hallway with no signs outside.  Just keep asking and you'll find it.\n\nThe pizza was really good and cheap.  Had a couple slices of mushroom and one pepperoni with a couple PBR's.  I'm assuming this is what NY style pizza is suppose to taste like.  The place is super tiny and can only fit like 10 people and they only had 3 stools.

I've never had white pie before and I'm glad I lost my white pie virginity here LOL, sprinkle on some red pepper flakes and your slice is solid. \nThis was all i ate on a 3 day trip to Vegas while staying at the Cosmo, every day..\nI just wished they delivered :(\n\nThe second time I came here wasn't as flavor packed as the first but I still love it anyway :)\n\nAs far as ordering goes, I would definitely call in and order ahead of time if you're planning on getting a fresh whole box of pizza.

Custom or added topping only a few minutes for slice. All slices had to be reheated for variety of toppings on hand. Irregardless of pizza order, all slices reheated. Still good not great and not so heavy. Priced like the other small pizza places around. \n\nWe ordered and shared a Sicilian deep dish enough for two persons. Pepperoni, sausage, olive among deep stack of melted cheese. Good flavor. Reheated correctly and good on a budget. \n\nOverall enjoyed the quick grub. Great on budget. Okay on flavor.

The burger was overcooked which always bothers me, as the meat loses its flavor when it is burnt.  I like Kobe burgers and this one tasted like nothing more than a middle of the road restaurant burger.  The sweet potato fries were nothing to write home about either.  Just a note, I got my burger on a ciabatta bun and I would not recommend this, as it was too dry and really took away from the burger.  \n Chef veggie burger with buttermilk zucchini fries was also pretty blah as far as the burger is concerned, but the zucchini fries were pretty good, these I would recommend.

I send it back because the meat is so raw on the inside. They then cut my bite off and browned the area they just cut off. So it appeared cooked. I took another bite and it's still raw inside. At this point I am not sending my food back. I ate the bun and left meat there. $30 burger and I couldn't eat it because it was so raw. Will never eat here again."

Does it taste like a premium gourmet burger?  Yes.  But the problem likes with the fixins.  Everything is an extra charge.  Bacon, avocado, cheese, onions, grilled onions, and of course the fries.  I think i had the NY beef or the sirloin.....the kobe seemed too outrageous at the time, but i think now, i should ponied up and just threw down $$$ for tasty american wagyu.\n\nI dont recall sliders, but i think that wouldve been a better way to go.

Ordered the Burger Bar Sliders so that we could try three different burgers. One was Angus, pretty good, very basic. A little dab of mayo and mustard and it's perfect. The next was the bacon burger which was my least favorite out of the three because the patty was a bit dry and not as flavorful. The last was the onion burger and I think this is the reason that makes Burger Bar so popular. The patty was so tender and moist, one bite into it and it was oozing with juices. The caramelized onions enhances the rich flavor of the beef, my mouth probably said oh em gee! If you get the chance, order it with sweet potato fries to top it off!"

S"If you want a quality gourmet burger, look no further.\nWhen I went I had a kobe burger with prosciutto. Burger was juicy and very tasty. The kobe was so rich with flavor and melts in your mouth. The prosciutto was a good salty addition to compliment the patty. The bun was nice and toasty yet soft.\n\nRecommend:\n\n* Nutella shake: Liquid heaven. smooth & creamy, but can be rich (in a good way)\n\nThere is a location in San Francisco that I want to try sometime. Fortunately I don't have to go all the way to  Vegas to eat there."

S'YUM YUM YUM!!!\n\nI am only reserving a star for the extremely sub-par service that we received. The food here is incredible, seriously.\n\nI opted for the mildly less decadent Angus burger with Swiss cheese and the regular fixings and a side of sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked perfectly medium and it was moist and tender like nothing I have ever tasted. Now I wish I would have gotten the Kobe beef, I know it would have been incredible.\n\nThe restaurant has sports playing, in the booths you have a personal TV which is pretty cool.\n\nOne thing to definitely try next time is their flight of beer floats-that is right, BEER floats!! They do a float with Guinness and coffee ice cream. I can only imagine how tasty that is.'

S"A concept table service burger joint plus full bar in the shopping zone of Mandalay Place, from chef Hubert Keller of Fleur-de-Lys fame.  The concept is that you choose a base burger (3 kinds of beef, lamb, turkey, garden, etc), one of five buns, and then pile on your choice of about 40 toppings at extra cost, ranging from homemade beet pickles to a half lobster or a fried egg.  The $60 Rossini burger (with foie gras, sliced black truffles, and madeira sauce) is something to try at least once and the $16 regular Kobe burger is good too.  Knowledgeable and courteous waitstaff, great ingredients.  A real temple of burger-dom.  Only two reason for four stars instead of five are: 1) bar concept though ineeds work and better mixed drinks (but does have 24 beers on tap); and 2) prices a little high, and really, after all that it's still a hamburger."

S'See profile site for full review with formatted pics.\n\n\nPerhaps it was Boulud, perhaps Keller.....at some point someone decided that a 99cent cheeseburger at McDonalds simply wasn\'t enough.  Foie Gras, Truffles, Shrimp, Lobster.....you name it, you got it.  While I do find it odd that I found myself being led into Burger Bar by my friend when I don\'t particularly like beef and don\'t eat burgers, I will admit to have had a few in the past and my all-time was the Thurman Burger in Columbus Ohio, a famous one in its own right.  In a day that included Tableau for breakfast and Alex for dinner I must say I didn\'t expect much from the Burger Bar....but I was pleasantly surprised.\n \nWhile the Bar was located in a shopping mall at Mandalay Bay I didn\'t judge....most of Vegas feels like a mall anyhow and Per Se in NYC is located in a mall, as well.  Arriving around 2:30pm there was a line...a good sign I guess....our names were taken and 10 minutes later we found ourselves seated at a 4-top in the middle of the restaurant.  While the place was quite loud, conversation was quite easy and our menus were delivered quickly.  With 5-6 bread options, 5-6 meat options, 40-50 topping options, plus desserts it actually took longer to order than we had imagined.  Eventually I settled on the Turkey Burger on Ciabatta with grilled Shrimp, Pesto, and a side order of Sweet Potato fries while my buddy opted for the Kobe Beef Burger with Sharp Cheddar and Hickory Bacon on Whole Wheat with Spicy Skinny Fries and a sampler of beers.\n \nAs the place was busy we chatted for a bit and I decided to get up and explore.  Much to my surprise the kitchen was wide open for viewing and I wandered about to realize how fresh all the ingredients were, the bread being baked in visible ovens, and the meats stored in large lockers.  Everything appeared very hygienic and clean, very much unlike your average burger shack.  By the time I arrived back at the table my buddy was working on his beer and approximately two minutes later the food arrived.  While I spent a moment dressing my burger and eating my incredibly garlicky pickle spear, I heard my buddy partially-moan....clearly he was loving this burger.\n \nOnce my burger was adequately dressed and I had a large pile of ketchup for my fries it was time to dig in.  Crisp ciabatta with a fluffy interior first greeted my tongue followed by the wonderful basil blast of the pesto mingling with plump and tender shrimp and well cooked yet juicy turkey.  Great texture, quality ingredients, wonderful flavor, well cooked....what more can you ask for in a burger?  I next dug into the fries which were simply fantastic and #3 only to Michael Mina\'s Duck Fat Fries and Michael Symon\'s Lola Fries in terms of crispy outside and soft/salty inside.  I do find it rather unfortunate that the restaurant did not order an organic/original ketchup given the quality of the ingredients otherwise, but I guess a minimal amount of HFCS won\'t kill me.\n \nHaving finished off our burgers and laughing more at the PTI analysis of the USC/Oregon State result my buddy and I opted for a dessert burger - the chocolate version featuring a split donut topped with a chocolate gnache puck, mango "cheese", and strawberries.  Humorous in presentation and tasty in flavor, this choice was excellent and split down the middle this "burger" was just enough after the huge burger/fries.  The mango cheese was especially surprising in its fresh taste and jello-like texture while the chocolate puck was so rich I doubt I\'d have finished one myself.  The donut was a tad dry, IMO, but didn\'t hurt the burger overall.\n \nAll told I liked the energy and the food at Burger Bar.  While certainly our most "low class" meal, I actually enjoyed the experience and the pricetag more than Sensi and Craftsteak and my buddy loved it which was excellent since he humored me in going to so many French restaurants on the weekend.  IMO, foie and truffles are best served by a chef like Stratta or Savoy and not on a piece of beef and buried under toppings...the concept of the Rossini Burger is ludicrous and anyone ordering it is showing off and missing out on the opportunity for more originality and customization at a lower price.  Regardless, to each his/her own and I think the concept of designer burgers has a lot to offer...even if the underdressed and uncustomizable option at Father\'s Office is still the standard by which most burgers are judged.'

S"I don't know why I never reviewed this place sooner, but this is the home of some of the best burgers I have ever had, period.\n\nI went there with the bf for lunch, so it wasn't too busy and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a booth. I liked the fact that each booth had it's own TV. Cute.\n\nThe service was fine as well...I don't recall waiting forever or having an issue at all. Maybe it's just the luck of the draw? In any case, screw the service, focus on the burgers!\n\nI love Hubert Keller, so I was definitely expecting something amazing. I ordered the 3 sliders, which were simply DIVINE.  I still have flashbacks to eating the one with cheese and caramelized onions! If I could only have one last burger before I died, that would be the one.\n\nThere were some more expensive burgers on the menu that I had been tempted to try, but since I hadn't ever been there before, I chose to be a bit frugal until I figured out if I approved of the burgers.  Boy, do I approve!\n\nWhen I head back there though, I think I'll have to try something with truffles (my fav.!)..."

S"I read about this place having the best burgers on the strip, so I made sure to include it on the itinerary for a lunch during our trip.  Husband ordered the Kobe burger with some avocado, no cheese and I went with the no preservatives selection on a sesame bun with jack and lettuce.  I am not sure what went wrong with this combo, but the bottom bun turned to paste/mush and was really gross.  I was scraping it off to be able to eat the burger and was not eating especially slowly where I could see this happening.  He liked his burger a lot, and the fries were very good (as were my zucchini fries and the sauce sampler we got) so I only took off a few stars.  It's hard to give more than 3 stars when your main item falls so short.  The basil and truffle mayo sauces were my favorite - both were better on the zucchini than the ranch it came with!  Skip the white BBQ and the spicy ketchup, they are forgettable.  I even put the truffle mayo on my burger at some point to try and salvage it, but no dice."

S"It was late Friday night and we were tired and hungry from walking all day along the strip. We were staying at the Delano so we didn't want to go far and found this restaurant still open in Mandalay Bay Shops. Owned by Hubert Keller, he is infamous in SF for his restaurant, Fleur de Lys (which recently closed) and for being on several shows such as Top Chef, Top Chef Masters, Top Chef All Stars, Top Chef Just Desserts and Secrets of a Chef (his own cooking show). It has a dark bar atmosphere with very dim lighting. The booths also have their own little TVs that you can change.\n\nNote: the pricing and some items on their website is different than on their menus.\n\nOur order:\nRossini: ($65) Kobe Style Wagyu Beef w/ sauteed Foie Gras and shaved Truffles on an Onion Bun w/ a Black Perigord Truffle Sauce\nBuild-your-own: (Total - $27.60) Buffalo Burger ($17.95) on a Pretzel Bun (+$1.50) Pepper Jack (+$1) Fried Egg ($1.95) Grilled Onion (+$1) BB Ketchup (+$0.95) Skinny Fries (+$3.25)\nPink Monkey: ($8.75) Strawberry Ice Cream, fresh Banana & Strawberries topped w/Whipped Cream and added Malibu Banana (+$5.50)\nCrabbie Shake: ($11.50) Crabbies Ginger Beer served with a scoop of Lemon Sorbet and shaved Candied Ginger\n\nThe kobe beef is ground in-house so I had my burger medium rare. It was very tender and juicy. Loved how much of the truffle you could taste and smell. My friend really enjoyed his burger and was moaning with each bite he took.\n\nBoth of the shakes were sweet, bursting with flavor, and as yummy as they sounded. Definitely order one w/ your meal if you opt to come here.\n\nThe burgers and drinks were really good. Were they worth the hefty price tag? Not really. Especially since everything is nearly nickle-and-dimed if you're not just getting a plain burger and the items on the menu increased in price (i.e. sauces increased by a dime, the Rossini Burger was prior $60 instead of the $65, several of the other burgers increase by $3-4 as well, etc).\n\nService was decent. They only dropped off food and refilled our water so nothing to praise or complain."

Kobe beef, fleur de sel, truffles, lobster? Who the hell puts this kind of stuff on a burger? It's pretty insane. Was really tempted to order the $60 burger, but then I thought of the children in Africa and how at the cost of this one hamburger, it could feed a kid for a year. Stupid conscience! I'm totally going back and ordering that shit next time! Great beer selection, I think the Dogfish Head IPA would go well with the Kobe. Oh and you gotta try the zucchini fries, this is a must. My only complaint is that there's too many things to choose from, too many delicious things. It's like being forced to choose between laughter and fun, you lose either way because you're missing out on the other."

S'To start with, this is between mandalay and luxor. NOT mandalay and 4 seasons like the map says. We went for lunch and our waiter took our drink order, came back a few minutes later with waters and took our food order. A food runner brought shakes over 5 minutes later (about 10 minutes after ordering drinks) and my wife\'s was good and as described. I ordered a martini and got an alcohol free shake. After waiting a solid 5 minutes, we never saw the waiter so I just drank the shake as it looked good. It was delicious, but not what I ordered. Our burgers took just over 20 minutes to come out after ordering. My buffalo burger was GREAT and my wife\'s burger was also great. The major down side was being sat next to some trash that was swearing at their 3 year old to stop eating zucchini and "take a bite of your F****N chicken" and "you have to be sh**ting me, just try the fu**ing sweet potato fry". Then they were doing toasts to their therapist. They def were toasting the wrong person, they should have been toasting to their child\'s future therapist. They won\'t be winning parents of the year any time soon. Overall, we\'ll go back but we\'ll go during a very off hour to get a booth, some peace and hopefully faster/better service.'

S"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  It's always a great place to take folks who don't get to Vegas very often and don't know where to venture out to eat outside of their hotel.  \n\nThe Burger Bar has something for everybody.  They have a list of menu items they've put together as well as a create your own burger side.  Basically, you pick your bun, burger, cheese, vegetables, other toppings, and fries.  They have all kids of cheese, three or four types of bacon, many veggies, several types of onion, and even some uncommon items such as fois gras.  They have steak fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, seasoned fries, and zucchini fries.  You can pile it as high as you want.  The burgers are big and as delicious as you want to make them.  \n\nThey even have a few dessert burgers where a doughnut serves as the bun.  Originally, they only had one and it wasn't anything great to me.  Since then, they have added a few more options that I have yet to try.  Their milkshakes are delish as well.\n\nI usually make my own burger, but last time I ordered the sliders and they were very good.  It was a perfect choice when you're not hungry enough for a big burger.  The sliders are three mini burgers that are each different.  I'll definitely order that again.\n\nTime and time again, this is a great place and always has something for everyone, carnivores and herbivores alike.  I'm not sure about the vegan folks though...  They do get super busy and I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Roll up your sleeves, head to the Burger Bar and see who can build a better burger!"

S"I only end up at this place out of convenience (when I'm headed to House of Blues), not lust. \n\nBurger Bar wins the award for most expensive veggie burger. \n\nYou buy a basic burger (meat and bread) and then they have a lot of fun burger add-ons. I got a veggie burger on an onion bun with bacon -- just kidding -- avocado, blue cheese and baby spinach. Also got a side of sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Both were good, but the zucchini fries were just battered and fried zucchini sticks. I don't know what I was thinking. \n\nThey also have a fat list of draught beers. \n\nMy two friends and I each got a burger and we all shared a pitcher and our total before tip was about $75. \n\nThe two times I've gone (primetime on the weekends) there was like a 20-minute wait. But you can take their number down, go window shopping at Urban Outfitters, and call the hostess to see if your digs are ready. \n\nAlso, look at the menu outside as you wait, so you get your grub quicker. \n\n* \n\nOn a separate visit, I ordered a $3.50 PB-chocolate shake. Kind of expensive, right? But they give you the leftovers that won't fit in the glass, old school style. \n\nAlso tried the Buffalo shoestring fries. They were very good, by my standards. Tasted like they stole Jack-in-the-Boxes' fry seasoning recipe and applied it to a crunchy shoestring. Shoestring is the superior cut, but they were a little too crunchy. \n\nI found out that you can order all of the burger add-ons a la carte, with out having to buy a burger. So you can basically make a salad. This news is epic. Next time I'm gonna make a $40 Lobster tail-asparagus salad. \n\nI asked the waitress if ordering only a la carte items and no burger was common.

We were seated an hour and a half later at 10PM.\n\nThe entire time, we were telling the hostess to just split our group into groups of 4 or 6, and every time, they would just tell us, "it\'s okay.. it\'ll just be 15 minutes."  During that hour and a half of standing in the middle of the mall, groups and groups and groups and groups of 4 or 6 white people were promptly being seated.  It\'s a lot of fun to watch somebody show up, get seated, eat, pay, and leave, while you\'re still waiting for a table.\n\nAfter we finally sat down (we demanded that they the let us take the next seatings regardless of the size of tables), service was good, and the burger was mediocre (maybe worth 3 yelp stars).  Not that good when compared to the Father\'s Offices and Umami Burgers of the world.  My nutella shake was pretty solid also.  But our experience was so atrocious that I\'ve got to give it a 1 star.\n\nSo to sum up, Burger Bar might be worth the trip if you are part of the Master Race, but I am not one of the lucky few, so I will never go back.'

The server was slow to get around to take our order and just didn't seem like she wanted to be there or help us.\n\nThe zucchini fries were just okay. People were really all about them in reviews, but the breading wasn't much more than basic bar provolone stick breading. A few times the zucchini inside just slipped out leaving a sheath of uninteresting breading. Not awesome. The sweet potato fries were very good and the mac n cheese bites were good, but I seriously think it was just Kraft mac n cheese that was fried. That's not a complaint because I have a nostalgic fondness for that, and I have to say at least it was full of mac n cheese. Some fried mac n cheese I've had (like at state fairs) is mostly just breading.\n\nFor my burger, I was very undecided. I went with the natural source beef with brie, the red wine reduction sauce, mushrooms, and carmelized onions. It was appetizing and filling, but the bottom of my bun deteriorated. I went with the plain bun; maybe others are more substantial. I ended up eating the last half of my burger with a fork. Medium is more like medium rare. This doesn't bother me, but FYI in case you expect your burgers to be more cooked through.  \n\nThe TV in our booth was not in our control, though the server did get the staff to change it. The TV was beat up with a good 20% section of poor/damaged pixels.\n\nOur milkshake was the best part.\n\nNot the worst meal I've had, but not good enough to make me come back."

S"Ah the first destination of gluttony was at The Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay. Not only was the gf and I hungry after making our way down to Vegas, we were starting to get grumpy about it. \n\nThe wait time: 25 minutes. \n\nThe gf really didnt want to wait, but lucky enough she decided to do so or I would have missed out on what could have been...a great experience. \n\nDuring the wait, I stayed thirsty and ordered a Deadlift IPA. Being a gym junkie, I got the badge on my IPhone to prove it, I went with the Deadlift IPA just because a deadlift was a exercise. lol. \n\nThe 9 oz's of golden brown liquid was filled in a wine shaped glass. Why couldnt restaurants serve IPA's in a schooner. 33oz of great beer would eliminate the hassle of reordering. Id be down for that. Not your standard beer, on a empty stomach, you can get tipsy quickly. As I grabbed my beer, the bartender forgets to even ring me up as I stood there waiting for the bill. Our table was ready and I was not about to stand there waiting for a bill so I took it with me to the table. Already, this place was a ++++ for me. Did I just get this right? A free beer? Hell yea! \n\nWe sat down and looked over the menu. Kobe burger was the only option for me but I was debating if foi gras for a extra $30 even worth it. The gf rejected the notion of me eating a $60 burger so I parted ways and decided to go with some toppings. \n\nKobe burger........and then some.\n-Avocados\n-Coleslaw\n- American cheese\n- Bacon\n- Grilled Onions\n\nThe total for my burger alone was $26. All that was missing was a fried egg, in which the restaurant wanted to serve scrambled due to the recent egg scares. I ended up passing on it, but I knew a fried egg would have made it even better. \n\nOh and it doesnt end there. I got an order of sweet potato fries and a Caramel Latte Milkshake. \n\nIf your going to do it, DO IT BIG! That is just what I did. \n\nThe gf had a Angus burger w/ aioli and skinny fries. \n\nAs expected, when our burgers came out, Kobe beef is Kobe beef. I tried both the Angus and Kobe and was able to make a direct comparison. Hell, even in a blind taste test, I would be able to differentiate Kobe beef with Angus Beef. The very first bite of the Kobe burger and the juices gushes all over my hands. The texture was so soft and moist. Each bite took very little effort as the Kobe beef melted away in my mouth. \n\nThe Caramel Latte Milkshake was made of coffee ice-cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels. My god, it made me wonder what the other milkshakes tasted like because this one was just indescribable in words. Any explanation would be unjustified. \n\nThe Burger Bar got me. It got me good. Definitely a must try if you want a great burger."

S"I came here 2 years ago for lunch and I haven't been able to stop my mouth from watering every time I think about the burger I had here. The build your own burger is an awesome idea! I forgot which bun I had with my kobe beef, swiss, portobello, and avocado burger with a side of sweet potato fries, but it was the best burger I've had so far. I didn't get a chance to go back when I was in Vegas last year but I will not leave until I have my burger from Burger Bar when I go next month!"

S'I\'ll keep this one short and simple.\n\nI forgot what burger I ordered, but I think I would only come back for the Hubert Keller burger for $60.  I ordered random toppings, and it was... ok.  For $20, "ok" is "NOT ok."  Sure, the meat was tender, the fixings were fresh, but... I could also get that for $4 at In N Out.\n\nThe $7 vanilla milkshake was... also "ok."  Alright, I\'ll acquiesce that it was good.  But Johnny Rockets\' milkshake still reigns supreme in my book, and a little over half the cost.  (Mind you, I\'d be willing to pay... $10 for an amazing milkshake, and cost has no factor in my decision that Johnny Rockets has the best I\'ve tasted).\n\nThe bartender looked like a buxom "Trinity" (from Matrix), and she was pleasant.  I did sit at the bar with my friends to eat, and it was definitely more enjoyable to have an attractive bartender serve us.\n\nBut come back, I shall probably not.'

S"For our group's end of the year dinner, we were angling for burgers and decided on this place mainly because they were likely to be able to seat a table of just shy of twenty. I got more and more excited as I did my research and found that this was often listed as a top burger place in Las Vegas. Hey, don't laugh at my naivete! You know it's all about Bachi anyway if you're a local.\n\nI chose the Hubert Keller burger because I wanted to try buffalo meat and I was too lazy to try to custom-build one. Oh, and the whole having his name on it thing means it has to be good or else, right? Indeed, it was delicious. It came out medium-rare as I had requested, and the first thing I did was try to take a bite without adding the red wine and shallot reduction. Mistake number one! Gotta pour that sauce on there to get the maximum flavor out of this. Granted, the caramelized onions and blue cheese complemented each other well, but you need to use the sauce. Also, I liked the bite from the red onions that I threw on later and barely noticed the lettuce and tomato, which is fine by me because I just didn't want them to go to waste on the plate.\n\nDid I not talk about the meat yet? Well, that's because I was saving it for its own paragraph. I loved it. It was similar to beef in a way, but it had a much cleaner flavor. It's somewhat hard to detect the unique flavor that sets it apart until you get a piece of mostly meat in your mouth, which I finally did at the end, and it's definitely not what I would call gamey or anything. It's just something different to appreciate because you don't eat it everyday (well, I guess you can, but I can't be bothered).\n\nThe only drawback to my meal was that the fries somehow just did not go with the burger, so it was like eating two separate dishes the entire time. I think I should've had sweet potato fries instead. When I tried a few of those from my friend, the sweetness called out to me as something that would have worked. So for those of you who might wanna try the Hubert Keller burger, I do suggest that you try to substitute in sweet potato fries for the normal thin fries (but it might cost more? dunno).\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a great place on the Strip to have a burger. If you're from out of town (and you're not one of those deprived people who have never tried In-N-Out), you won't go wrong making this your burger stop."

S"Best burger I've ever had with excellent service to boot need I say more? Probably not but will I of course. The food here is awesome. My burger always comes out medium rare and I never have a problem not getting my toppings. I usually order the Angus burger with chipotle mayo, portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions and avocado with pepper jack cheese. Fat fries are a must of course and you simply have to try the awesomeness of the nutella milk shakes. \n\nThe service is excellent. The food comes out after being cooked perfectly and you never feel like you're being ignored. \n\nThis place is definitely my favorite burger but it also has my favorite shake. I have tried plenty of other burger places but always make my way back to burger bar."

S"I actually liked the sports bar atmosphere of this place  Great place to watch your football wagers win while filling up.  also love the beer selection(chimay and fat tire on tap).  Tried the surf and turf burger with bacon.  Burger was good, maybe a little underseasoned.  Lobster was a tad bit over cooked.  Wish it were grilled instead of steamed Bun was good.  The kicker on this burger was asparagus.  Surprisingly good!  Overall the burger was a bit dry, could have benefitted from some sort of sauce.  This place cooks its burgers to steak temps which maybe a little rare for a lot of people.  The fries were the most disappointing part of the meal.  The skinny fries came with my meal.  They tasted very generic.  they were the type that has that crispy coating(potato flour I think)  But they were uninspired for a a burger joint.  Thought in/n/out's fries blew these away.  Not too expensive for a celebrity chef joint."

Then the manager came over and apologized. I had to wait about 10 mins for my food. I felt that they could have offered me a free refill on my beer or a free dessert. That is why I only gave them 4 stars.\n\nThe first time I was here was back in 2006. The menu was different back then. I ordered the American Kobe Burger ($16). It was really good. My friend ordered the Kobe/Foie Gras/Truffle Burger ($60). I was half way through and my friend made me take a bite of her $60 burger. It was effin of the hook!!

J/K.... keep it simple and get a great burger to start w/ a beer from the tap or mixed drink from the full bar, add the sweet potato fries and a malt/shake if you like.'

May be most peeps were sleeping in from a night of partying? ;)\n\nI almost almost ordered the grilled chicken burger since I\'m trying to watch what I eat since I\'m getting married in June, but OMG, I\'m so glad I "wised up" and ordered the Kobe burger!!!   It was the best burger I\'ve ever had to date.  I ordered my burger medium with aioli and grilled onions on a wheat bun. It was cooked to perfection. I didn\'t order any fries, so I "stole" skinny fries from my df - boy, they were quite good! Just the way I like them. Service was attentive and friendly.   Our server really was on top of things.  \n\nMy df and FBIL ordered the buffalo burger, they said it was very good though my df thought his burger could\'ve been cooked a little more (he ordered medium but it looked medium rare).  My FSIL (Christine T. ) ordered the kobe beef burger also, but she ordered it medium rare. She said she should\'ve ordered it medium instead.\n\nMust get the chocolate burger!!  The four of us shared it and it was just enough for a taste.\n\nIf I\'m craving a burger, I\'m going to hit up the San Francisco location - hopefully, it\'s just as good!'

S"3 1/2 stars. Angela suggested this place telling me she had heard it was one of the best burger places in Vegas. It's also got one of the most expensive burgers in the States. So we came meeting a friend of hers who also brought his own friend.\n\nI got a bite of everything and actually I've uploaded a pic of my receipt. So you can see exactly what we ordered. I got the $60 burger and had them cut it into 4 pieces so we all had a bite. Angela got their spicy lamb burger, the other two ordered a peppercorn and salmon burger. I actually got a bite of all them. \n\nLamb burger was overcooked. Almost well done, a medium at best. Was incredibly disappointing. Not good at all and I like lamb burgers. So don't order your lamb burger anything less then medium rare. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend any beef burger less than medium rare.\n\nThe salmon burger was overcooked. Wasn't too impressed with this also. I mean both this and the lamb were like 2 stars to me, would not ever order them again. The peppercorn on the other hand was outstanding. Really strong fresh peppercorn and it's super tasty. Really liked it a lot.\n\nOk, so the $60 burger. The beef was cooked perfectly. Just really, really excellent and tasty. The truffles, excellent. Burger also get serves with truffle oil on the side which you should absolutely pour on top and it so enhanced the flavor of everything. So what was its weakness? The foie gras. Not enough of it. Angela has never had foie gras and she told that she couldn't taste it. Not a good sign. I'm practically French and have eaten a ridiculous amount of different types of foie gras. Yeah, certain foie gras can have an incredibly powerful taste and overwhelm anything else if too much is used and eaten at once. This burger did not have this kind of foie gras. I could physically see the foie gras and even I could barely taste it. Seriously disappointing in this but other than this, a great burger. Worth $60. No, definitely not. Maybe a $30-40 burger. Maybe, though honestly I don't think I'd ever order this burger again. I'd encourage someone else to give it a try but I'd be good.\n\nSo what really was the gem of evening? You can not only customize your burger and make any 100s of different permutations of different types of burgers here, you can also customize your own shake! This includes beer floats! But what's the true sign of a real milkshake connoisseur? I'll show you how you make a shake. So I told our waitress that whomever makes the milkshake, to customize me one. I was going to leave it to their imagination and experience. I said I'd eat anything and wasn't allergic to anything. The only thing was that I didn't want anything boring but a shake of all shakes. So it turns out, there's a guy who's dedicated to just making the shakes! How awesome is that. When he came out with my shake it was beautiful. And this is the real reason why I posted up my receipt so you can see what he put in it. I boxed my shake with a black pen so take a look! This alone will make Burger Bar a special place for me.\n\nSo overall not a bad eating experience at all. I'd definitely come back anytime."

S"Hubert Keller is an instant hit with me, dwelling in San Francisco for only a year and a half of my life was an increscribale twist in the direction my world headed. I guess that is why I am drawn to Chef's from SF. I have been eyeing this place after seeing a piece on the travel channel. Nestled between a bunch of chic stores, art galleries and bars. \n\nI dug it. \n\nI was totally pleased with the menu setup  4 basic burger types with all the sides sold separately on the side-  milkshake & beer lists as well were very, very detailed. :) Great touch. \nThe surroundings were causal but people seemed touristy and business suit types. I would see this gem as a great place to get around midnight after one too many cocktails or after a day at Moorea Beach (the adult pool)\n\nI ordered the Buffalo burger with caramelized onions, bacon, & Swiss cheese. The zucchini fries and the skinny fries, They are a separate charge from the burger.  \n\nTried the 5 beer sampler and a wheat hoegarden, left a little tipsy and the perfect amount of fullness. Job well done Burger Bar!"

S"After watching Top Chef Masters, I'm a big fan of Hubert Keller. Who else can manage to cook a 5 star meal in a dorm room using a hot plate and a shower stall? I also admire his diverse interests- not many chefs can boast about being a DJ in their spare time!\n\nAnyways, I was excited to try out his Burger Bar restaurant when we were in Vegas. We got here around opening time, and there was already a line forming to try out the delicious burgers. Although we had a large party, we were seated promptly. \n\nWe decided to order the chicken wing appetizer, and I had a nutella shake to start out with. The chicken wings were good, but quite small compared to other chicken wings you'll find at other places. The nutella shake was beautifully presented, with elegant swirls of chocolate syrup laced on the inside of the cup. The shake itself was smooth, rich, chocolate indulgence, topped with chocolate whipped cream and a sprinkling of whole hazelnuts.\n\nAlthough I didn't order the beer float paddle sampler, a person in our party did, and it looked amazing! (See pictures for the evidence!)\n\nAlthough the Rossini burger was indeed tempting, I decided to forgo the $60 price tag and order the signature Hubert Keller burger ($22). After all, why not order the owner's favorite burger? It was perfectly cooked to order (Medium rare), with tender, flavorful buffalo meat, spinach, blue cheese, caramelized onions, with a lovely red wine sauce on the side. I'm not normally a fan of blue cheese, but it meshed well with the other ingredients. The only slight negative was that the burger really needed the red wine sauce on the burger, otherwise it tasted like it lacked a little seasoning. The fries that automatically came with the burger were decent, with a nice crisp outer layer.\n\nMaybe if I strike it big in Vegas one of these days, I'll splurge on that $60 gilded lily of a burger, but for now I'll go for the other signature burgers!"

I ordered the sliders while the boy ordered the Kobe. I may have erred with the sliders, but they were so dry and tough...... no place should ever offer them on the menu if they so epically failed at making them. The boy's Kobe was alright, but it hardly balanced out the ick of the unsavory sliders."

Better than burgers at other restaurants, granted I don't usually order burgers when I go out to eat. They do actually have A LOT of gourmet toppings to choose from, which was nice. Also, the sweet potato fries were really good.\nThe hubs had the sliders and said they were very good. They had a ton of craft beers to choose from, and I thought the prices for reasonable for a place on the strip. The place was packed, so we sat at the bar when two seats opened up, after waiting about 25 minutes for a table.\nI think I might have gotten food poisoning though, since I got violently ill after eating here. The hubs was fine. I can't remember, but I probably ordered my burger medium. Shoulda gone for well-done, I guess.

S"I think my experience at Burger Bar was just OK because I didn't actually get a burger (I had the chicken sandwich), so keep that in mind. It also took a little while to get seated (though not the 45 mins they quoted us, luckily!) For the cost, the chicken sandwich was just OK. WAY too big (but really most things in Vegas are out-of-control huge anyway). The zucchini fries that were recommended to me weren't as good as I'd hoped. A bit too greasy and not zucchini-y enough, if that makes sense. I think they had too much breading. The sweet potato fries I tried off someone else's plate were great, though. I love sweet potato fries! Those at my table who got burgers seemed a lot more happy with what they got than I did... So definitely go for a burger if you go there. I was also intrigued by the build-your-own milkshake, but after the HUGE amount of food (and seeing the $7 price point) I wasn't in the mood for one. Maybe someday!"

S"This restaurant, by famed restaurateur Heubert Keller touts itself as the best burger in Las Vegas and the ultimate burger experience.  Instead this place is everything you would expect from a stuck up gourmet who wouldn't know a great burger if it hit him in the face.  Don't get me wrong, you won't get food poisening here and you won't come away saying that the burgers were inedible, in fact for the most part the end result is a good burger.  I am certain however, Mr. Keller and his chefs have never seen the parking lot of a sporting event with a charcol grille and a spatula. \n\nFirst, what I don't like about this place.  The burgers were cooked like a gourmet would, meaning good for a steak, bad for a burger.  All the burgers we tried were underdone and we asked for them medium.  Second, the prices are outrageous.  You will not get out of here below $20.00 per person and for a burger, that is just wrong.  Third, the service is absolutely attrocious for the price.  This is supposed to be a burger place but they treat you like the fine dining establishments, meaning rude service and slow service.  Fourth, the Kobe burger is a waste of time.  The flavor is lacking and quite honestly, you don't need the best meat to make a good burger. Fifth, the bun is boring. I expect better from a 20 dollar burger joint.  The buns we had were dry inside and soggy outside.\n\nNow, for the good about this place. 1) you can get just about anything on your burger and you pick and choose what is on it. 2) you can get just about any type of meat on your burger from kobe to buffalo to ostrich. 3) the burger is tasty if you get them to cook it right.  The sides and drinks deliver.\n\nStill searching, let me know your favorite burger place so I can try."

S"Booze, boobs and burgers are all found at The Burger Bar on the second floor in a mall atmosphere. Price of burgers start from 9.50 to 23 dollars. If you like milkshakes you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't go here.\n\nA regular angus beef burger costs 9.50 while a Hubert Keller burger is 22. Carmelized onions and bleu cheese are that big of a mark up? They place it on a ciabatta bread that is extremely fluffy and not chewy so that's a plus. Next time I'll order the angus beef and put 3 cheeses on it and get some spf's next time. The quality of meat is fine. The buns are spectacular. Went back on another occasion and tried the Kobe beef burger. It didn't stand out like I thought it would. Still, you can't go wrong eating here.\n\nGreat service. All the girls have something attractive for everyone and come in different varieties while wearing a small top and yoga pants. You have the blonde athletic type, the very skinny and perky asian, the curvy alternative gal, the drop dead gorgeous latina with caramel skin and big, curly highlighted hair and a big, curvy butt in an extra tight shirt. I fell in love with this particular girl and tried not to look at her so much during my stay. This girl was bad ass. She is making some lucky guy out there really happy.

S":o)\n\nIt pains me to give Burger Bar four stars.  First of all, I'm not typically a burger type of gal, except when it comes to In n Out, but everything surpassed my expectations and was super tasty.  Unfortunately, my burger's lobster was overcooked and service slightly disappointed me.  :(  \n\n\nBURGERS:\nHubert Keller burger - Buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun.  The buffalo added the perfect amount of gaminess to give this burger a good earthy kick with the blue cheese to add a mildness to it.  Which was slightly odd since blue cheese has so much flavor and usually packs a bold punch.  Everything harmonized beautifully and I was happy to chomp away. \n\nSurf & Turf - Black Angus, grilled half lobster, grilled green asparagus on a plain bun.  Sadly, the lobster was overcooked and was chewy.  Other then that, the green asparagus complemented this burger perfectly.\n\nAmerican Classic - Black Angus beef, America cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun.  A very good basic burger.  The juiciness of the beef makes this one exceptional.\n\n\nSIDES:\nSweet potato fries - Hands down the sweet potato fries won the sides battle.  They were very typical very good sweet potato fries.  Good ratio of sweetness and saltiness, and nice and crispy\n\nOnion rings - These babies reminded me of the onion rings you get at Carl's Jr. with the same texture and crispiness.  The biggest difference between the ones at Burger Bar is that the onions doesn't slide right out of the ring.  :) \n\nAioli - Do yourself a favor and just get it.  It's so good.  I wanted to cover my hands with this sauce and lick it all day.  I know it sounds absolutely disgusting, but it was soooooo good!!\n\nZucchini fries, Skinny fries, Fat fries - They're all good, but not amazing.\n\n\nFrom a service standpoint, I was a bit disappointed because we told the server that it was my friend's birthday.  Sadly, she didn't bring us a little burger dessert, but we were stuffed beyond all belief to even fathom having another bite.\n\nHere's a little note.  Keep their number on hand.  Even though they don't take reservations, you can call them to ask them for a wait time and to put your party on the list.  It's almost like a fast pass for the Burger Bar.  :)"

The wait was about 20 minutes and they wanted us to sit at a table near the entrance which was an awkward looking location as people were coming close to it when they were entering and leaving. we declined and opted instead to wait an additional 15 minutes for something else. 5 minutes later we were seated at a comfy booth. They even let us bring our fat Tuesday drinks in. The atmosphere is sports bar like and fun. The waitress was nice and helpful when it came to the menu as it was our first time. She had some great recommendations. I had the Lamb Burger with customized toppings of caramelized onions and Jack cheese. The waitress warned that it wasn't for everyone and you either love it or hate it. I love gamey meats so to me it was flavorful and juicy. The zucchini fries could have been thicker cut because it seemed to be mostly batter but the fried batter was crisp and tasty so i enjoyed them. My girlfriend had the Hubert Keller Burger which was very tasty with just the right combination of toppings to satisfy. The skinny fries were decent French fries. We tried the martinis and they were good too. Would definitely go back to try one of their other creations!"

S"I must say that Hubert Keller can definitely make some stellar burgers. \n\nThe Burger Bar is LOCATED in the Mandalay Palace (Between The Mandalay Bay and Luxor walkway) is one of my favorite places to get a burger in LV. One, I love the \n\nQUALITY OF MEAT. They have great choices to choose from such as Angus, Lamb, Buffalo and my favorite Kobe. Not only is the meat good, they also have great buns. I think they work out a lot. PRICES here are very reasonable and in my opinion, excellent for the quality of food. If you a balla or if you just won a few bucks gambling then I would recommend you try the ROSSINI. It's a 60 dollar burger that is made with Wagyu Beef and foie gras.  I can tell you that it's worth it (If your a burger lover and like foie gras that is) Similar to other burger joints, the Burger Bar offers specialty burgers or you can customize your own. My recommendation would be to do both if your with someone else or if your really hungry. \n\nThe ENVIRONMENT here looks like  your average bar and grill. Dim lighting and lots of TV's.  They even have TV's in every booth. This place has always been crowded and there was always a wait list whenever I ate here. I have said this in many of my other reviews but if you don't like to wait then go and eat early to beat the crowd. \n\nThe SERVICE has been good on both visits. They took care of us well which was pretty impressive considering how busy they get.\n\nOverall, I can always count on this place to satisfy my burger needs whenever I am in LV.  I give this place 5 stars because I believe that the quality of food for the PRICE to go along with their SERVICE is worth it."

S"I had the pleasure of dining here a few months ago with my girlfriend and don't regret it one bit. These guys are one of the first restaurants in town to make gourmet and specialty burgers a cornerstone of their business so their pioneering efforts alone make them worthy of your business... in my opinion. The decor is rather nondescript, but the beer selection is noteworthy. \n\nI decided to try the buffalo burger medium, on an onion bun with shitake mushrooms and blue cheese crumble.  It was pretty fantastic and easily one of the burgers I have ever had. It was rich and flavorful without being excessively greasy. The steak fries were solid. My girlfriend opted for the turkey burger with fresh made guacamole which was good, but I really wouldn't recommend it unless you have a strict diet or avoid red meat for religious reasons. The bottom line is that there are many different kinds of burgers here for the various tastes and preferences of burger lovers Prices were ok considering this is located in Mandalay bay and has garnered quite a bit of attention over the years. In my opinion this is THE place to go for a burger if you are in Mandalay Bay--without question."

Even though this place was not directly inside the casino, it is in the mall attached to the Mandalay Bay.  There always seems to be a wait every time I come here and sometimes I don't have the patience and chose another restaurant.  It's a nice place and they have a fun menu.  The restaurant is long and narrow and small.  It makes you realize why you have to wait.  The burger was tasty although it may not be the best of Vegas. Service was friendly.   Believe it or not, I thought the burger at the Irish bar next door was better.  Still a good burger and experience and I will return only if I don't have to wait."

Why yes, a well-crafted burger with whatever the hell you want to plop, drop, dump, or slather on top, paired with a damn good milkshake, preferably with some alcohol added. My burger of choice was angus with grilled lobster tail, chipotle aioli, bacon, and avocado on an onion bun....with a coffee/Bailey's milkshake concoction thingy whose name escapes me. damn good though. And for dessert I had the tasting of 5 beer floats...5 different beers each paired with their own scoop of ice cream. Been done before of course, but 5 ways...and they were a nice size too....30 oz worth total. When you come to vegas you will come here, because I command you."

My shaved truffles we ice cold. The beef was cooked perfectly however.\n\nI also ordered the Nutella milkshake. It tasted like an extremely rich chocolate milkshake, nothing like nutella which I love so much.\n\nThey had a kids menu also. My son ordered the kids cheeseburger  which was about an 1 and a half in diameter...\n\nMy other son got the chicken strips, and my wife got a plan cheeseburger.

Unfortunately, I'm sure it added to the pricing as well.  \n\nI had a buffalo burger and my, oh my, was it juicy and melt in your mouth!  Buffalo being a lean meat, that's no small feat.  I'd be hard pressed to move away from such a delicious burger on a future visit!  On said visit, I'll definitely want to save room for a sweet burger."

You really couldn't get any sense of him putting his finger into the place with it looking like any other sports bar in the entire world. Sure you can get foie or lobster on your burger but it just doesn't have the finesse that you might expect from a chef like him.\n\nOverall its a good burger bar with TVs in each of the booths. and plenty of taps of beers to choose from. You can basically create your own sampler of beers which will range from $2-$6 each depending on which beers you actually pick. The burgers can be built to order with basically anything available for you to add on to.\n\nAs sides i tried their Fried Cheese (love them, reminds me of denny's), and Zucchini fries (tasty, the breading stayed on while eating)"

I had the peppercorn burger and it was good. I like pepercorns and the cracked pepper flavor. Very unique tasting sauce. Chipotle aioli was just ok. Milkshakes are very expensive, I think it was $8.50 and up. I had the Nutella milkshake and it was awesome. Next time I want to try the $60.00 burger (kobe, foix grois,mushrooms and truffles). It looks really good. I am not sure if it is worth it. Oh yeah...add a fried egg to your burger if you can...it adds flavor. Sweet potato fries!!!!! Enough said!\n\nService - \n\nAside from the stuck up bitches at the hostess stand. Especially the one with a tattoo on her arm. Service was prompt and friendly.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful. \n\nPlace -\n\nVery casual scene. They have TVs in the booths. A bit tight when it is crowded. In between Mandalay and Luxor...Parking is a drag.

S"A buffet of truly epic proportions.  Since it was Chinese New Year weekend, they bumped prices to  $51/pp.  Overall, our party of seven had an excellent meal.  In terms of overall quality-to-value, I think Bacchanal is above Bellagio but slightly below Wicked Spoon.  Note also this restaurant is very large and loud - they play music and the background.\n\nLines for the meat section were longer than the line to get in at 5pm.  The meat section has ample selections, with the smoked brisket and lamb chops being the stars.  The lamb was seasoned well and soft and succulent.  Mint jelly was available but the lamb had more than enough flavor.  I enjoyed the lamb so much I didn't even get a chance to try the prime rib or artisinal sausages.\n\nThe other amazing dish was the corn tortilla steak tacos.  It had marinated grilled beef that was perfectly cooked and topped with a green sauce with a good dose of line.  The corn tortillas were warm and soft and definitely freshly made.  Probably one of the best tacos I've had anywhere.\n\nThe wagyu beef sliders were juicy when I picked them, however two of my dining companions found them dry and over seasoned. Guess I was lucky - I had two of these tasty mini burgers without issues.\n\nNear the back of the restaurant you'll find the asian section along with sushi, followed by a salad bar.  Sushi was fresh and the rice was made perfectly.  Of the Asian dishes, probably the Chinese greens were the best.  They were stir fried with garlic to a point and cooked enough to where it still had crunch.  Strangely there weren't a whole lot of other cooked veggies at this buffet.  I tried some baby carrots and some corn cobs but that's about it.\n\nFried items were also good - calamari baskets, spicy fried fish, fried chicken, sweet potato fries and tater tots, etc.  You get a hint of spice as you savor the sweet taste of the sweet potato.  Surprisingly low on greasy but high on crunchy!\n\nThe seafood section was near the front of the restaurant, with fresh oysters, crab legs, etc.  Cooked items included halibut, which was cooked perfectly too.  Despite the cool decorations, I did not see any lobster or Alaska king crab :(\n\nLastly, the dessert section was truly massive, probably one-upping Wicked Spoon.  The have gelato, mochi, and crepe sections.  Also, four varieties of the mini dessert cones and other tempting goodies on a stick.  The chocolate-dipped strawberries was something else - probably the biggest, ripest, and reddish strawberries I've ever seen.    \n\nThis buffets selection is so massive you run the risk of getting too full early and missing out on some really unforgettable dishes.  My friend tasted one taco and then wound up getting three more before hitting the dessert section.  It's a bit pricier than other Vegas buffets, but their meat, dessert, and  Mexican, and fried selections are superior.  Everything else is similar to other buffets."

S"Rounding up from a 3.5 star review! \nI went for brunch on Saturday, and arrived just before 12p.  The line was not crazy, but when we left it was, so we hit the sweet spot, apparently.  The line moved quickly, and there was even loungy mood music playing, which helped pass the time. The cost was $45/person. \n\nThis new buffet had beautiful ambiance, natural lighting, friendly staff (the guy at the meat carving station was super friendly!).  The tables were quickly bussed, and the layout was very big! It went on and on.  Mostly everything was clean and replenished often.  They even give you mini-potholders made of plastic to help you grip hot bowls and pans. \n\nSmall rant:  I HATE those individual serving containers! From mini-pots/pans to baskets, to bowls!! UGH! They take up a lot of room on your plate, you can't really hold them in your other hand, and they are just frustrating in general! I'm at a buffet! Stop trying to restrict my servings! Or at least give me a cafeteria tray so I can put everything there. I was tempted a few times to dump the food out of the fancy-schmancy little dishes and just onto my plate, but I resisted the urge. \n\nRant over.\n\nOf course, on a buffet, food can be hit or miss.  I loved the steamed (chilled) shrimp, the seafood pasta, the mushroom risotto, the chicken marsella, and the ribs.  I also thought the ham and cheese croissants were great, and enjoyed the brisket as well.  I also really liked the freshly made crepe- a nice ending to a meal. The coconut shrimp was just ok- I didn't see any sauce for it, and the sweet potato tater tots were great!  I had a small bite of the sliders, and they were tasty too.\n\nI tried some of the Asian offerings- the spicy fish was super spicy (lots of chili pepper), and the dumplings were fine.  I skipped the pizza and most of the pasta selections. There were also sushi offerings and a few Mexican items too.\n\nOn the negative side, the crab legs (which can be steamed upon request), were rather puny, and the mac&cheese was nothing great. Neither was the fried chicken in the chicken and waffle basket (not very seasoned).  I was pretty disappointed with the French toast too (bland).  The bread pudding seemed to be the only thing that wasn't refreshed- it looked old and picked over.\n\nOn balance, I still think the M buffet is tops around.  Next, I'd probably give the edge to Wicked Spoon, because their food is a bit more flavorful.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I finally checked it out, but isn't going to be a must-do on my buffet list."

S"I really wasn't planning on coming back to Bacchanal Buffet for my recent trip to Vegas.  It was all situational because I literally spent a good 30 mins walking back and forth across the middle of The Strip trying to decide where to eat breakfast.  That when I just said the hell with it and go to Bacchanal!\n\nIt's been literally a year since the last time I've been to Bacchanal Buffet and at that time they had just opened.  The food has actually gotten better but the price has gone up.  Here now are all the plates I had from this visit:  \n\nFirst plate went with comfort foods.\nFried Chicken & Waffle, Mini Chicago Dog, Huevo Ranchero -- http://bit.ly/IIdyfe\nAll good stuff.  The Mini Chicago Dog was the best part! \n\nSecond plate went for all seafood.\nMussels Meuniere, Shrimp & Grits, Pan Roasted Salmon, Seafood Paella --  http://bit.ly/1h4c5vx\nThis was probably my favorite plate I put together.  The mussels were really good with nice garlicky taste, the salmon was cooked nicely, and the Paella and Shrimp Grits provided good filler.\n\nThird plate covered the meat station.\nTruffle Polenta, Roasted Prime Rib, Roasted Mushrooms, Kielbasa, and Shrimp Cocktail --  http://bit.ly/1fanybJ\nI was starting to get full at this point but once again, no complaints with this plate.\n\nThen I noticed they actually had a ramen station so I went ahead and tried it.\nRamen with bamboo shoots and chasiu pork -- http://bit.ly/IIe2SF\nIt was meh.  LOL  Broth wasn't too bad though\n\nFinally, desserts.\nStrawberry Peppermint Creme Puff -- http://bit.ly/IIefFw\nKey Lime Tart -- http://bit.ly/1h4cmyF\nMango Tart -- http://bit.ly/IIedgC\nTheir desserts are very comparable to Wicked Spoon and Wynn.  So no matter what you pick up, you'll be in for a pretty and decadent treat.\n\nOverall, I was pretty satisfied with my return visit to Bacchanal.  I'm a little on the fence with the $27 price tag for lunch (I meant to come for breakfast, but just missed the deadline and ended up paying a little more for lunch price), but for what I picked up, it paid itself off.  It's still one of the best buffets on the strip!"

We actually went twice (brunch and lunch on two different days) because we stayed at Caesars, it was convenient, and satisfied all our cravings.  Highlights-salad bar, meats and cheeses, pizza, sushi, and all the American offerings.  May have been the best biscuits and gravy ever.  Yummy fired chicken.  The desserts at lunch and sweets at breakfast were outstanding too.  My only criticism is lack of offerings at the Mexican station, I love Mexican and couldn't find anything that appealed to me."

Ein Traum in jeder Hinsicht!\n (Siehe Foto unten) (Siehe Foto unten) \nIm altehrw\xc3\xbcrdigen Caesars Palace mit seinen alten R\xc3\xb6mern hebt sich das Bacchanal Buffet-Restaurant v\xc3\xb6llig romfrei ab. Nichts erinnert hier an die Historie, dieses Restaurant ist topmodern, klar gegliedert, weitl\xc3\xa4ufig, hell, gestylt.\nWer hier fr\xc3\xbchst\xc3\xbcckt, sollte sich einen Block mitbringen und dann in aller Ruhe die diversen Tresen ablaufen, Notizen machen, Reihenfolgen festlegen, seinen Hunger- und Appetitstatus sorgf\xc3\xa4ltig analysieren und sich dann hineinst\xc3\xbcrzen in ein lukullisches Abenteuer.\nWer m\xc3\xb6chte, kann hier das gro\xc3\x9fe Fressen beginnen. Die Vielfalt ist unbegrenzt, alles, wirklich alles wird angeboten. Das geht weit, weit \xc3\xbcber das \xc3\xbcbliche eines Fr\xc3\xbchst\xc3\xbcckes hinaus. Ich erspare mir Einzelheiten, denn es gibt nichts, was es nicht gibt. Warm, kalt, s\xc3\xbc\xc3\x9f, sauer, westlich, \xc3\xb6stlich, japanisch, thail\xc3\xa4ndisch, franz\xc3\xb6sisch . Wer es sich hier zur Fr\xc3\xbchst\xc3\xbcckszeit  die erfreulicherweise bis fast zur Mittagszeit geht  gut gehen l\xc3\xa4sst, der braucht sich f\xc3\xbcr den Rest des Tages keine Essensgedanken mehr machen. \nDer Kaffee oder Tee wird regelm\xc3\xa4\xc3\x9fig nachgeschenkt, die S\xc3\xa4fte auf Wunsch ebenfalls. Vanessa unsere Bedienung gab sich alle M\xc3\xbche, uns den Start in den Tag zu angenehm wie m\xc3\xb6glich zu machen. Nat\xc3\xbcrlich war es f\xc3\xbcr uns dann eine Freude, das hier \xc3\xbcblich hohe Trinkgeld flie\xc3\x9fen zu lassen.\nDie Tische stehen nicht zu nahe beieinander, so dass man durch den Nachbarn beim Gespr\xc3\xa4ch nicht gest\xc3\xb6rt wird. F\xc3\xbcr die japanischen G\xc3\xa4ste stehen auch Rundtische zur Verf\xc3\xbcgung. Und man kann sich wirklich Zeit lassen, im Gegensatz zu \xc3\xa0-la-carte Restaurants wird man hier nicht  wie so oft in den USA  mit dem letzten Bissen freundlich hinaus komplimentiert.\nDas Restaurant ist selbstverst\xc3\xa4ndlich f\xc3\xbcr jeden zug\xc3\xa4nglich, nicht nur f\xc3\xbcr Hotelg\xc3\xa4ste. Und der Preis ist f\xc3\xbcr alle gleich (und f\xc3\xbcr alles, was man in sich hineinstopft): $ 21,99 + Tax = $ 23,77. Das sind bei heutigen Kursen ca. EUR 18 !! Hier passt der Begriff Schn\xc3\xa4ppchen. \nFazit: Buffet-Essen in LV ist eine uneingeschr\xc3\xa4nkte Empfehlung. Hier im Bacchanal stimmte einfach alles. Wenn alles stimmt und schmeckt sind f\xc3\xbcnf Sterne angebracht.'

S"This was my first time at this buffet extravaganza.  I will give you my opinions and throw in those of my friends who dined here before.  We arrived at 5 pm on a Wed. evening.  The line was not terrible but was growing.  Wait was probably 15 mins.  Still $50 for a weekday dinner.  Military id gets you seated first.  From the front, the buffet does not look that big...but it does stretch to the back.  You are first impressed with the shucking area (oysters) and crab legs.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it...\nWe were seated towards the middle and drink orders were taken right away.  For a buffet, the service was pretty darn good.  There seemed to be 2 waiters helping us and drinks were refilled and plates cleared quite promptly.  \nWhen it came to the food, I am the type to try a few things and go back for the things that I liked.  So here are my highlights...\n-  Oysters:  just ok.  We had Aquaknox the night before and you couldn't compare it.  But this was the first time I had oysters at a buffet in vegas, so I give them points for even offering.  I didn't try the shooters next to them, but my friends said they were also tasty\n-  Crab legs/shrimps:  This is my vice.  I love crab legs.  I thought in general, the legs were on the small and wimpy side.  With that said, I like the fact that you can get them warmed  (not a given at other buffets).  I also like the drawn butter dispenser.  The shrimp was also really good and they had a nice cocktail sauce to go with it.\n- Meats:  Lots of good looking meat product, all displayed behind a glass wall.  I thought in general, it was very good.  My favorite was the lamb chops.  Very juicy and flavorful.  One of the best lamb chops that I have had (Carnevino was actually my favorite).  The brisket was good, a tad on the sweet side.  Baby back ribs were ok.  I added the BBQ sauce to it.  Every one thought the prime rib was really good as well.  Very satisfied with the meat offering.  I also liked the mac n' cheese that was served next to it.\n- Sliders/Fried Chicken:  The sliders were good.  I didn't fill myself with it, but in any other situation, I would have consumed more.  I thought the friend chicken was really tasty and crispy.  I liked how they served them individually and kept them fresh.  They didn't seem to sit there for more than 5 mins.\n-  Sushi:  Pretty decent for a buffet.  I loved the poke that they served.  Great flavor\n- Asian:  Great asian selection\n- Dessert:  ONe of the best selection that I have been to.  Huge gelato display (espresso was the best) along with Mochi ice cream (haven't seen that before).  The girls loved the macaroons that were served.\n\nI was pretty impressed since this was my first time here.  My friends that have dined here before thought the level had dropped a notch.  I think that is how Vegas buffets go.  When they first open up, service and food are at a peak.  Then as time goes by, things tend to drop.  I just like the fact that most of the items seems to be very fresh.  I would definitely return, just not sure if I would wait 1-2 hrs for this."

S"My first time to try this buffet at Caesers and it is delish!  We are lucky we know a high roller & got into the shortcut line because the regular line was hundreds deep!\n\nThis is one beautiful buffet!   I love how they decorated the whole area.   Lots of action stations & a huge dessert island.  I barely got a sample of all the items they had to offer.   It was a big assortment. \n\nHere are some Highlights:\n\nWarm boiled Crab legs.  The cook it in front of you!\nCreme brulee with the perfect crispy layer on top.  The creme part was a little dense but very good flavors. \nPepper dungeness crab, good flavor but not as fresh\nCarne asada tacos were really delicious! \nLobster corn chowder, great flavor! \nSliced salamis/panchetta were very good\nSteak was amazing!  Though the line was insane....  \nSweet potato tots with sweet glaze in a mini fry basket were yum\nPoached salmon with arugula was flaky & flavorful\nMussels were ok\nSpiced pumpkin pie was good for the season\nChoc creme brulee was like choc pudding with a yummy chocolate layer\n\nThis is one delicious buffet with so many choices,  it's sure to make everyone happy!"

S'This review is based on my experience of the current visit of the buffet; not the food, since I just did not get a chance to enjoy it.\n\nAnyway, their waiting system is just pain in the a--.  For those of you who are first timer to the buffet, you need to get a ticket from their kiosk instead of waiting in line like other buffet.  Then you need to go back with your ticket with printed time and wait in line again.  Yes, you need to wait in line again.  Plus. for those people who paid for the EXPRESS LINE will seated sooner than who don\'t.\n\nMy wrap up conslusion to Bacchanal Buffet is: \n"Waiting, waiting, and more waiting."\n\nTo Bacchanal Buffet, I suggest you to change your waiting system back to the traditional way.  Plus, get rid of the EXPRESS LINE, so everyone will be treated equally.  First come first serve.'

S"When you walk in to a buffet and they give you a small rubber contraption just to hold hot plates with...you know your palette is in for some insane-whatever-happens-in-vegas-stays-in-vegas-goodness... but man, oh man, that is an understatement.  You walk in and the place looks like a 5-star restaurant...the ambiance, and the presentation of everything is simply majestic.  But of course...what are we here for?  What are you reading this review for?  the FOOD!!!!\n\nI gotta say, I am totally in LOVE with Bacchanal Buffet.  Why?  I'll give you at least TEN reasons why...I can probably give you 50, but time is of the essence, and I'm sure you don't have that much essence to read a review of that length...\n\n1)  Portions - the presentation and portion size is such a great idea, not that they were the first ones to ever create it, but still, it's nice to have it already prepared for you to take because the serving has been set; that way you avoid the possibility of loading up too much on certain items.  It seems like you should be walking around with cafeteria trays just to carry all the single portions around, but I guess that prevents you from overloading too\n\n2) Wagyu beef sliders....O M G, if you've never heard of grass fed beef, Wagyu I heard is some form of Kobe beef hybrid...but it is EXCELLENT.  Definitely worth getting a few of them.\n\n3)  Crab legs...you have the option of getting them steamed.  Just ask for them, don't get them from the cold iced area, give them an empty plate and ask for the steamed crab legs\n\n4)  Ramen - Never saw a buffet actually have ramen, udon, and pho before, and I would never have thought it would be so good, but d to the ayam man...it really was.  The broth was excellent!  I HAD to stop myself from getting more so that I could be sure to try everything.\n\n5)  Breakfast items...skirt steak and eggs, truffled potatoes, mini-red velvet pancakes and even CRONUTS were the standouts for the breakfast items to note.  \n\n6)  Fresh squeezed juices...poured into single-serve carafes...another awesome idea, both presentation-wise and practical...wise, he he he.  Horchata, Carrot, and your normal juices all available, super fresh, and super good. :)\n\n7)   Carne Asada tacos...man!  Such good quality carne asada makes for some amazing tacos!\n\n8)  Gelato, ice cream, too many too choose from for dessert, especially the....\n\n9)  Lava cake for dessert....just the way you'd want to have it\n\n10) Oh before i forget, PEELED Jumbo Shrimp coctail...I LOVE that!   I hate peeling shrimp, esp for shrimp coctail, he he he.  \n\nI mean, i can only review what I remember...I almost wish I had my laptop and a video camera during the whole experience, but hey, we do what we can. :)\n\nWish there were some oysters, but could've been an availability thing.\n\nIt's roughly $50 bucks unless you're some sort of high roller, so for us commoners...it can be a little steep...but TRUST me, it's totally worth it!   Your stomach will be thanking you for days.  \n\nHands down my absolute favorite  buffet out there...I've hit up Bellagio, M, Rio Seafood and regular, and pretty much all of the main buffets out there(still haven't tried the one at Cosmo yet), but it is head and shoulders above the rest.  I still like M, but just the items here blew me away.\n\nService staff is very friendly and you can pretty much ask for anything...don't forget your mimosas...for those of you over 21 of course.\n\nMy Advice, go early for brunch...esp if you like breakfast items, because you get the best of both worlds.  I would say to come around 10-10:30 on a the weekends to avoid the crazy crowds and to ensure you start getting your food quick.  \n\nI haven't yet tried dinner and I know that there are some items that are available ONLY at dinner, such as the Macarons, but I don't really care much for them, and we confirmed with some hosts that the most variety is available around brunch time.\n\nI used to say that I can't come to vegas without putting a SINGLE bet on something...but now I gotta say I can't come to vegas without eating at Bacchanal! :)"

S"I came here early on a Saturday evening and didn't need to wait to be seated. However, it was a different story for those who were in queue by the time I left. The service was decent, although it did annoy me when they completely cleared my table before we were done eating. \n\nMy stomach ate itself while I stood in line for the meat station, but I filled up on the meat really fast (try the prime rib). I liked that the crab legs were already sliced in half so they were easy to eat. There really weren't any other main dishes to choose from, but there was a wide variety of desserts. \n\nAlbeit the food is good, I still think Wicked Spoon wins when it comes to Vegas buffets."

S"My brother insisted that I try this buffet and so I did.  I was waiting on my parents and we got to the buffet around 8pm...the host told me there would be a 45 minute wait....I was hungry but it was up to my parents if they wanted to wait - and they didn't mind - however during the time I was asking them, I let this group of four go ahead of me - and I guess I was lucky because one of the girl from that group gave me a receipt or birthday voucher of some kind that cut my waiting time in half. So I have her to thank for that and we got in line to go in right after. \n\nWe still had to wait in line for about 20 minutes - there was this other line that they opened up next to us and they kept letting the people from that line in immediately - I was thinking they were either guest of the hotel or some kind of VIP because they got this black placard with a diamond on it - looks important. The hostess was reassuring me that I would get our table soon - and after 15 people went in from the other line and 20 minutes later we finally got our table right in front of the steamed crab legs - perfect for my parents because that's pretty much what they eat.\n\nThis buffet was truly amazing in it's selection of foods. There biggest section was Seafood, Asian and Desserts- they had so much seafood choices, I wish I had a big enough stomach to try everything. \n\nThe meats that I've tried - lamb chop was tender and juicy but the beef ribs were a tad chewy and the pork ribs were really dry. All the seafood that I tried (oysters, crab legs, cocktail shrimp and mussel) were fresh and appropriately prepared. I also had a beef slider - tasty! a few of the sushi rolls and salad. \n\nOverall the food was very fresh and you see them refill it with a fresh batch of food as it runs low. Lots of there food actually do run low so it's a good sign - some buffets have food that sits there for a while but I didn't see that happening here. I didn't eat a whole lot of desserts since I was already really full with the savories - but I did have room for a macaroon, mango pudding and creme brulee. Yummy Yummy definitely filled my tummy that night.  This buffet is fairly new so we'll have to wait a couple of years to see if it will go downhill - but at $50 a person I really hope not. I've been to both Bellagio's and Wynn's and they were great before too but the quality has gone down a notch."

The girl told us food will serve until they close which was 11PM on a Friday night we said okay lets do this. \n\nWe paid for this buffet along with the 24 hours buffet we had the total reward card so it was a bit cheaper. Total for two on Friday with the 24 hour buffet ( paid $30 extra each for this buffet ) came up to $205 and something cent.\n\nWe were seated had the server took down our drinks. We rush like animals to get food cause they were closing soon. I was surprise they had EVERYTHING still refilled !! \n\nPrime rib, steak ,\nLamb chop...... Oyster were fresh! Fresh juicy crab legs!! And Kobe beef burger ! What!!!!?? Delish! Also don't forget to check out the dessert place if it's your birthday tell them and they will make you a plate of their choice and write happy bday on it which is nice. When it hit 11pm all the food is put away EXCEPT dessert so yum yum. ( we went clubbing after this ... Yup not a good idea lol )"

The only thing I wanted to comment about was that the crab claws were not cracked well enough so it was something that was hard to eat.

One of our group members complained because he never waits in line for food. He ended up saying it was totally worth the wait. We came on a Sunday night and waited about and hour. Just grab a drink to sip in line and you'll be good. \n\nThere is a huge selection of food and just about everything is incredible. Here are a few if my standouts:\n. Crab legs - a must have\n. Ceviche - delicious \n. Tuna and salmon sashimi (like a high end sushi place!)\n. Charcuterie bar - lots of cheese and meat selections \n. Tiny baskets of waffle fries, chicken strips, tater tots etc. \n. Dessert!\n\nAnyone who knows me knows dessert is ultra important and this buffet did not disappoint.

S'Look, if you\'re reading this, you\'ve already proven that you hold a degree in advanced eating techniques. Who reads up about buffets but people who enjoy eating? \n\nWith that said, there is a difference between people who want to gorge themselves with whatever they teeth may fall on, and those who want nothing but quality. \n\nThe latter people should continue reading from this point on. \n\nBacchanal Buffet has been the talk of the town for a bit now, and when it finally opened up on September 11, 2012, it did not fail to impress the masses. I actually got to enjoy it on its first Saturday at dinner. \n\nFirst, the line was long. But not as long as I have waited at the "M" buffet on a couple of occasions. It can only get better..or worse as word spreads about Bacchanal.\n\nSecond, the service. Let\'s get this out of the way now. It\'s week one, and it was a weak one. But I can only imagine it will right itself out with time, so no biggie there, and no stars lost.\n\nThird, the food. Come on... I don\'t have to tell you what to expect. Look at the photos. Look at the reviews. It says it all! Ok fine, I\'ll tell you the two things that totally blew my mind. First up, the crab. Wherever you go, you had a herd of people, that goes and triages through the freaking crab legs to grab the claws and nothing but the claws. Bunch of vultures discarding pieces to the side to find the elusive claw. And then they leave. With all the claws. What the f.....\n\nBUT Bacchanal fixes that problem and offers claws by themselves. That\'s right. BY THEMSELVES. But holdup! They are already pre cracked and take absolutely no effort to eat. \n\nThe second thing that blew my mind...crap I forgot, I ate everything and then fell into a food coma.\n\nThe end.'

These are the gourmet buffet when comparing to the older buffet choices.  Lots of choices.  Portion are set in individual plates.  The chef or server is there to help you or freshly cook your serving.\n\nBy the way, Bacchanal is definitely better than Wicked Spoon buffet.   We found that the Bacchanal has more variety and may taste a little better.  Service and settings were both excellent."

S"This is absolutely the best buffet in Vegas right now. If you're a buffet person, i.e., can actually eat your money's worth, you can't miss this while you in Vegas. Yes, it's pricey. I came on Dec. 29 and paid around $51 and change for dinner. I think it had to do with holiday season too, but I also don't have the rewards card at Caesar's so there are ways to cut it down a couple dollars.\n\nFoodwise, my favorite stations were Asian and Dessert. I'm surprised Asian was so good because usually at buffets the Asian station is the least cared for. They had good qaulity dim sum, and they even had this ginger chicken soup that tasted exactly like my mom makes it. It was pretty damn good. The sushi was OK, and when they DID refill the sashimi plate, it was really fresh. They even had legit porridge with all the scrumptious sides. \n\nThe snow crabs and cocktail shrimp were average, you can't really saying special about them unless they were ridiculously fresh and plump, which they weren't. The meat station had the most choices I've ever seen in any buffet. Pork ribs, beef ribs, lamb legs, brisket, prime rib, chicken, sausage, and they even had this giant bone-in meat that I can't even say for sure what it was. The bone was literally the length of my arm, and my friend said got it said it's supposed to be beef, but no one could say for sure. I attached the picture comparing the size of it to my friend's head. Needless to say we couldn't finish it, but they did help me wrap it up for my dog. \n\nI would say I spent over half my time at the dessert bar. It was one of the best dessert stations I've seen in any buffet. The crepe station was to die for, and I tried every single ice cream/sorbet. One reason their ice cream station stands out to me is that their flavors are not ordinary and plain. There were baklava, strawberry basalmic, mint watermelon, sticky toffee, blood orange, etc. The flavors were not too drastically extreme where you couldn't understand it. The sorbets were refreshing and not too icey while the ice creams were creamy and rich. Everything at the dessert bar was made very well, and it was definitely the highlight for me. I didn't have room for this, but my friend said even their tacos were amazing. Overall, I didn't eat my money's worth, but the quality is definitely pretty high for a buffet. I'd say it's still worth it once in a while."

The seafood here was delicious, they offered cold and hot versions. They had clams, oysters, mussels, crab legs, jumbo shrimp etc. The prime rib was the consistency of butter, the best I have ever had. The lamb chops were also to die for. I enjoyed the asian soup dumplings and sushi and nigiri. The lasagna was delicious, as was the lobster and corn bisque and wagu beef sliders. The dessert selection was huge, they had gelato, sorbet, mochi, crepes, cupcakes, tiramisu, macarons, and so much more. I was informed that they make special desserts as well. I was delighted to have a banana souffl\xc3\xa9...Ok this was no joke the best thing I have ever eaten in my entire life. I had two. I would actually just go here for these even. Really an incredible experience. The wet napkins they have are actually warmed, wet towels individually wrapped. I would make it a point to come to this buffet.

S"Among my favorite in Las Vegas.  We used to like Bellagio and Wynn, but Bellagio seemed to have changed in quality (dramatic decrease).  Cosmo (Wicked spoon) was promising when I laid eyes on the salads, but the dessert seemed pre-ordered and not made in house.\n\nOverall, Bacchanal was the one we keep on going back to!  Their Achilles heel, however, is the sushi and the pizza.   Everything else is excellent!  Don't laugh, but the carne asada tacos are something I get every time even though it is probably not the biggest bang for the buck...LOL\n\nTIP: walk behind the casino through the mall to cut down on walking time by half!  Just enter the mall from the casino through the margarita bars with the low-cut hooter lookalike servers, and the next entrance point to the buffet will be just a few stores away.  Secret shortcut!"

I came on a Monday and luckily only had to wait 10 min (I think my review would have been less stars if I had to wait over an hour for this). \n\nPros:\n-Really new and the layout (esp if you\'re seated near the front) makes you think "Oh shit there\'s MORE??". So I guess if you\'re into that.\n-Food is good overall, really good selection\n\nCons:\n-None--expect maybe the wait if you do have to wait a long time for this. \n\nLike I said, this buffet is good but it wasn\'t OMGAH amazing. \n\nAlthough...I DID notice they had a shave ice stand near the dessert and that made me super happy because I\'ve never seen that at a buffet and it was good.

We were afraid that the wait would be crazy, especially because it was the holiday weekend, but it wasn't bad. The line looked long, but from the time we started waiting until we got seated was about 50 minutes. Totally do-able.\n\nWe saw a sign that stated there was a 2 hour limit so we quickly got our grub on. steamed crab legs, tacos, corned beef hash, 5 types of meat, japanese ramen, charcuterie, fried chicken, sweet potato tater tots, desserts... it was A LOT of food. as we were progressing through our meal, one by one we saw the three couples who were in line in front of us leave. wayyy confusing because we weren't even halfway through the buffet yet! weak-sauces... anyway, we barely had a minute to spare before our 2 hours were up. service was GREAT. we had a super sweet waitress who was very attentive, and this other dude who cleared our plates consistently. the food was okay. not the best. wicked spoon is way better.\n\nThe second time I came was on Christmas at 11am with a party of 4. Again, the wait wasn't more than an hour and the price was $52. Exact same food. And same plate clearer man. I was finished with my meal within the hour this time because i was over it.\n\nI always hit up buffets when I'm in vegas, but i don't think i'll be back at bacchanal for awhile. wicked spoon's food beats bacchanal's BY FAR."

From BBQ (which looked great with brisket, racks of ribs, pulled pork, etc), Chinese, Italian and Japanese, an extensive selection. They have something for everyone.\nThe desserts were excellent.

S"This place was so overrated. We went just for the experience because we were on vacation in Las Vegas. Compared to the other Las Vegas Buffets, this one is not worth waiting for and there are much better ones out there such as Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon. The wait when we got there to get our ticket was already overwhelming and that was just the beginning. The ticket for the approximate wait was 176 Minutes (3 Hours) but we waited anyways. FACT: You could pay $20 per person to cut to the front of the line. After that long 3- Hour wait, you need to wait once more but to pay for your meal for about an hour or two. It was very pricey ($300 for 4 People). After half a day's worth of waiting, my family and I were not even impressed. The food was typical Vegas food. Though I only give the overall food a 6/10, the dessert bar was what made it the real deal. I gave a 10/10 for the dessert's bar because of the variety and taste. TIP: Try the horchata (Mexican rice drink) in a bottle."

S"I usually don't like going to buffets, but when you are in Vegas you gotta try one of the buffets there.  I heard from multiple people that Bacchanal is the best, so I had to try it.  \n\nThe decor was just beautiful especially for a buffet place.  This place is really big and spacious.  You don't feel like a sardine like other places where they try to pack as many tables back to back.  \n\nThe food was good.  I don't know if I'll come back here again, but it was definitely a good experience eating here.  There were lots of variety and stations to catered to certain types of foods, like Asian, Italian, and American.  There was a giant dessert section, it was the bomb!  So many different kinda of desserts that'll you'll want to try it all!!!  One thing that I didn't like about the desserts was the gelato.  I thought it was dumb that they served it in warm bowls!  Like by the time I got back to my table the gelato was half melting and I was probably like 20 feet or less away from the dessert station.  Food over all was decent.  I kinda thought there would be more types of food going into the buffet, but after walking making my rounds, there were as much as I hoped for.  They had a meat craving station, so a chef is craving meat right in front of you.  I wanted to try the ribs, so when I got it I wasn't expecting it to be so big!  It took up my whole plate!  When I went to eat it I felt like a lot of it was fat.  Also the only utensil they will give you is a butter knife!  That butter knife did nothing!  We asked for a real knife, but they said they aren't allow to give us any.  So I didn't even want to try ordering more of their pieces of meats at the craving station cause it was so difficult to eat.  I liked a few of the foods in the Asian section.  \n\nBy the way this was for lunch buffet.  It costed about 40 before tip.  Overall not bad.  If you r in Vegas, it's a one time must try."

S"This place BEATS all the buffets I've tried here in this sinful-gluttonous city of Las Vegas. Just freaking get your ass here and try their food. It's WORTH THE LONG HOUR + WAIT. Quality here is phenomenally amazing. Portions are just right for your meal. The food here is flavorful enough to tickle your taste buds. Great place to rage for hangover food after a night of drinking, double-fisting, and dancing. I'm definitely coming back here again and again every time I visit Vegas. \n\nService is even excellent here. As for the decor, amazing! Their dessert buffet is to die for. From their succulent quality of their gelato to their scrumptious, thick and fatty caramelized flan. UGH. DROOL."

I don't think I've ever thought buffet food could actually taste good but I was wrong. And they had lamb chops!! Its kind of secretly tucked away but lamb chops make you get your moneys worth. My faves- clam bake, shrimp cocktail, mac n cheese, chocolate chip fudge cookie, and steak tacos. Highly recommend if you come on an empty stomach so you can get your moneys worth. Also our servers were awesome!"

S'3.5 but I am rounding up. \n\nLots of selection! (For Lunchtime) Even the chinese food corner wasn\'t as bad as I anticipated. Except the duck was a tad fatty so I only had a tiny piece when I would\'ve liked to have more. The workers there were friendly. Particularly the guy cutting the meat. He joked around saying how the pieces I was asking for was too small and said I should enjoy eating a more "normal" sized portion haha. But of course I was only trying to save space in my stomach for a chance to be able to try everything! I also thought the fresh juice next to the seafood was a plus. They had fresh squeezed fruit, cucumber, even carrot juice! \nThe only downside was that the desserts were WAY tooooo sweet! After eyeing the dessert section I was excited to eat all the cute sweets they had, only to find out that one bite or nibble from anything was already enough. The desserts certainly look real good and appealing, but one bite of a few was more than enough for my sweet tooth. \nAll in all, I still recommend this buffet for your trip to Vegas!'

S"Came straight here for lunch after driving for hours from Los Angeles, so my group arrived with an appetite.  We were in line at about 12:30 p.m. and the wait was 10 mins or so.  Not bad at all.  The food had its ups and downs.\n\nGood:\n- The shrimp dumplings were good, along with the other dim sum options\n- Korean short-ribs.  Yes.\n- The nachos plate was good, but had to be picked up during release as they go fast\n- Dessert was great.  I had tiramisu, flan, and cr\xc3\xa8me brulee.\n\nBad:\n- Avoid the sushi, the rice is gross.  It tasted day-old.\n- The sliders beef was borderline rare, which was a shame for people like me who prefer medium well\n- The oysters were grainy.  I think they were being chucked with too little care.\n\nThis is an above average buffet at most.  I'm going to try another buffet during my next Vegas visit."

S"Come when they open or before !! On a friday i came when they opened and the wait was 10 minutes...saturday the wait was 3 hours...not worth rushing through a buffet that cost $50+ a head...of course there is always a line for the carving station and the snow crab legs (no king crab legs here). \n\nBalsamic Fig Ice Cream: what a wonderful and unique combination...I jumped at the chance to try this and think it was one of the best items there \n\nAztec Chocolate Ice Cream: There a kick to this one...and while it's unique I would not get this again.  \n\nLamb (Carving Station): well seasoned and cooked to perfection...this is a must try \n\nBeef Brisket: This is fall of the bone tender. One of the most popular items at the carving station and worth the wait \n\nThe food here is all around the world but I'd say the most popular were the seafood & carving station. Dont forget to try the variety of juices which is next to the variety of breads. On top of that they also have a meat & cheese section. \n\nOverall this buffet has a very good variety with some stand out dishes. I'd return when the wait is shorter"

S"Ok so I'm usually a Bellagio or Wynn Buffet kind of girl, but how could I not go and try this place at least once?  My husband and I ate at the Bacchanal for the first time this past weekend.  I guess we came at a good time because we only waited for like 20 minutes in line-I heard people waited for over an hour when it first opened.  Anyway The decor is super clean and modern which gives the space an nice open feel.  The food is pretty damn good.  They have a section for Asian, Italian, Mexican, American and Seafood.  \nAsian: Over all it was good-not great.  They did have dim sum and sushi which was good.  There was a soup station which I didn't try but people were lining up like crazy for it.  \nItalian:the pasta station was awesome! Very tasty marinara sauce.  The Pre plated stuff was ok... I like the Italian food at the Wynn buffet way better.\nMexican: typical although they had an impressive salsa and condiments bar in this area.\nAmerican: This is where all the carnivores belong. They had the most insane carving station I've ever seen. How do I put it? Let's just say there wasn't a type of meat they didn't have available for you to try.  On a side note they did not have any mash potatoes, but they had very tasty roasted potatoes and VERY tasty tater tots.  \nSeafood: OMG! that pretty much covers it.  Jumbo size shrimp cocktail, the best crab legs ( hot or cold), lobster corn chowder (AMAZING!), oysters, etc... Just amazing.\nDessert: One of the best dessert section in a buffet I've ever seen! They have cheeseccake cake pops! Gelato which you can get in a cone on your way out! Your own personal size Pizzookie!!! and all of the other greats-tiramisu, cupcakes, candy bar, cookies galore, crepe station...the list goes on :)\n\nJust note some of the plating is pre done onto cute fancy decorative containers so it may be hard to get as much in one visit through the buffet-you definitely need to have a plate in each hand-LOL  \n\nOh yeah it's only an additional $15 for endless beer, wine and mimosas!"

S"Came here on a Thursday evening for dinner a few months ago. There was  NO LINE which was a super plus. The food was definitely good quality, but I just wasn't that impressed. I actually enjoyed the lunch buffet at Wicked Spoon better and it was half the price. I expected to find a variety of things I wouldn't see at other buffets seeing as this is the largest but to me the selection wasn't particularly wowing. For the record I don't eat seafood so that portion of the buffet was lost on me and it seems to be what everyone raves about. \n\nCustomer service wise our waiter was fantastic. Didn't rush us, made great conversation, was ultra attentive and it really helped make the experience. I'm glad I got to try this place once and was even happier I didn't even have to wait in line for it, but I don't think I'll ever come back unless someone else is paying. And even than I'll probably try to convince them to go to Wicked Spoon."

S"Awesome buffet. 3 years ago I saw a few signs that said Spices Buffet at planet hollywood was voted the best. So we tried it and it sucked. Then 2 years ago I saw signs that said Bacchanal buffet was voted the best. But was hesitant because I was lied to before with the Spices Buffet.  This year I see they're still ranked at #1 so decided to try it. IT WAS AWESOME!!!\n\nI had about 8 glasses of different juices. Strawberry, Guava, Jamaican, and mango! The food is very good also. The buffet is well organized. you have to check in at the terminal and they let you know what time to come back.  We went on a thursday around 8:30pm and had to come back at 8:50.  It was pretty crowded. After that it only took about 5 mins to be seated."

I could go to lunch sushi buffet 4 times with that kind of money where I'm from! \n\nBest part of the meal was the dessert selection: dessert mochi and tons of mini desserts so you can try a bunch!\n\nThere's a ton of food and most of it is good, but the cost wasn't worth it."

S"I'm a huge fan of Bacchanal buffet! We were looking for a buffet place after our blue man group show and wicked spoon was closed. Luckily Bacchanal was open until 10pm! We got in the line and after around 15 mins we were seated. Bacchanal is a very busy buffet place, and our waiter was busy running around.  They have a great seafood section. I love the shrimp, crab legs and oysters. They are so fresh and so good, and they're refilled promptly! Bacchanal has a huge dessert section with all the fancy tiny cakes. My favorite is mochi ice cream and i love the coffee/red been flavor. You should definitely try Bacchanal Buffet. It totally worth the $50 I paid."

S'I was very excited to try this extravagant and hyped up feast. But in the wise words of Public Enemy "dont believe the hype." This was a disappointing feast to say the least. A friend and I went and luckily were spared a 2 hour line and instead only waited 15 min. The staff was friendly and as we were being walked to our table the hostess showed us where everything was and gave us her recommendations. \n\nThe selection of food is good with some unique features such as a taco stand (one of the few really good things there) and a noodle stand where they will make you ramen or pho dishes (which are just meh). Most of the food is typical buffet food which is expected to be just ok because its in fact just a buffet, but at $55 I expect a level of quality higher than the norm. I went to the carver part of the buffet and saw a good selections of meats like prime rib, roast, duck, and rack of lamb. I decided to try the lamb and regretted that decision  immediately.  It was completely inedible and that is not a word I use lightly. The meat had a taste similar to burnt rubber with a similar consistency. The dessert section was really good with a wide selection of gelato various pastries including macaroons and cheese cake pops. \n\nI may of just fell victim to the hype of this place and had a bitter taste in my mouth because of its failure to live up to it or the inedible food that they served,  whatever the reason I could not justify giving it above 2 stars.'

S"OMG where do I even start. Gluttony is one of the 7 deadly sins, and I sure as hell planned on committing it in Sin City. It's times like these when I wish I was a cow, and had 4 stomachs. But alas, I do not but I sure ate like a cow. For a $45 dollar dinner, you'd be a fool to not eat like one! This is not a time to be faithful to your diet. This is a time to cheat cheat cheat because well, you paid for it. \n\nLocated in the Caesars Palace, I was so excited to try this buffet out. I drove from LA to Vegas, and made sure not to eat breakfast or lunch before getting to Vegas. I suggest not eating for at least the whole day if you come for dinner because with all the food here, you'll want to be hungry. \n\nWhen I first saw the line, the first thing I wanted to do was RUN. I was so surprised it was long because I went on a Tuesday. It looked like a line from a theme park! I can't even imagine the lines on weekends.  I was in starvation mode and the line just made me so sad. But I decided to stay and it was worth it. The line went by surprisingly fast and before I knew it we were seated after about 20 minutes. \n\nThis was the biggest best buffet I've ever been too.  Their food is divided into sections like Seafood, Mexican, Asian, Italian, and American.  I like how they serve the food in small portions so you can try a lot of different food.\n\nMy favorite thing there was the shrimp cocktail on steroids! They were the juiciest biggest shrimp cocktail I've ever seen. SO GOOD. There was a station with all types of meats that they cut for you but the line was so long so i didn't even bother.  I decided to get the tacos instead, and they were just as good as the tacos I get from LA trucks. The pasta that I tried like lasagna and rigatoni was amazing too. All the food was such good quality. They had cute little drinks in glass bottles near the Mexican station. I helped myself to unlimited horchata and mango juice.\n\nAfter driving through 4 hours of endless desert to get from LA to Vegas, I was so relieved to see endless DESSERT! They have gelato and endless mochi, and a crepe station where you can make your own crepes.  On top of that they had cake pops, chocolate covered strawberries, and red velvet woopie pies, a million types of cake, and the best part was UNLIMITED MACARONS. Macarons are usually almost $2 each in other places, and here I could eat as many as I please. They were just as good as the ones at the restaurants too.\n\nMe and my friends stayed a full 2 hours stuffing our faces, and I pretty much had to be rolled out of there.  Hands down the best buffet in Vegas."

S"Based on my friends' recommendations, Bacchanal was a required item on our itinerary for my most recent Vegas trip. I heard about the 1.5 hour amusement park-like lines, so we decided to come for a late lunch/early dinner.\n\nBEST BUFFET in Vegas! Why the 4 stars instead of 5 you ask? The lunch selection was a bit cheaper, but the quality wasn't nearly as good as the dinner quality. Also the way the buffet is arranged is that the prime rib and the seafood sections are very close together, so the line is VERY LONG and and SLOW.\n\nTips:\n1) $15 for express line\n2) Dinner selection, which tastes wayyy better starts at 3:00pm.\n3) Come early for quicker entry. If you're coming during peak times, you better not have anything else planned for the night because you'll spend the whole evening there standing in line and eating.\n\nCuisines: There are more, but it's too extensive for me to include everything.\nChinese (Peking duck-AMAZING, chow mein, soup, etc...), \nJapanese (some nigiri, rolls, ramen), \nMexican (soups, \nItalian (pizza, pasta, etc...)\nBBQ (ribs, brisket, sausages)\nSteak (Prime Ribs\nSeafood (oysters, crabs, mussels, shrimp cocktail, oyster shooters)\nFried foods: (chicken, tater tots, sweet potato tots, etc...)\n\nEssentially, they something for EVERY taste and preference.\n\nDesserts:\nThe dessert station is huge! It includes a bunch of pastries, cookies, chocolate-covered strawberries, unique sorbets, crepes, etc... There are so many I can't even remember a quarter of what was offered."

S"OH MAN OH MAN BACCHANAL BUFFET.\n\nI've been dreaming of this for awhile. We came for dinner at 1 pm but it was brunch and the wait would be two hours once you put it in the reservation machine. Perfect because dinner food starts at 3 anyway. \n\nDecided to go shopping got a call on our phone and literally ran to the buffet from Express. The only time I run.\n\nIt was crowded. Holiday pricing was $63 per person. It was pricey but that is okay because we ate our money's worth and more.\n\nEveryone has a different idea of how to eat their money's worth in buffet food. Some ate a bite of everything. Some eat their worth in dessert. Me? \n\n\nKing crab legs, oysters, shrimps every seafood imaginable. So that's the first thing we went for. Mussels good, clams not as good as mussels, salmon was delish, crab legs bomb.\n\nThen we went for the MEAT. The line was kind of long but that's okay cause we delegated tasks. I got in line while my friend went to grab things to eat in line. We ate a whole plate of food in line. No shame. Oysters were yummy better than the ones I had at palace station the night before. Salami yummm and cheese. \n\nThe meat was all right. Too salty and over seasoned on the outside. I'm not a big fan of lamb. Turkey was okay. BEEF RIBS were my FAV. \n\nI heard tacos were good. Desserts hit or miss depending on what you like but there's so many you are bound to eat something you like. \n\n\n\nSome tips: \nEat fast so you don't feel how full you are.\nDon't eat carby things like rice pasta bread you will get full too fast. \nDrink water to wash down everything.\nGo for your favorite thing first before you get too full to eat it. \nTake breaks you are allowed to be there for two hours but they probably won't notice if you're there for like four five. \n\n\n\nHappy feasting!!"

S'You know a place is poppin\' when you have to wait 2+ hours to get in. But all good, cuz the homie hooked it up with that VIP Status (aka he gamble a lot) so we got in real quick. I\'m talking Quickbooks son!\n\nI heard Cesar himself ate at this place (My Mexican homie) and even he said "Me encanta!"\n\nWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do, and man do the Romans know how to eat son!\n\nLet me break it down for you guys to make this review easier to read.\n\nARCHITECTURE & DESIGN: \nAin\'t nobody trying to eat at a basic ass sit down buffet. This place is architecturally sound! Glass everywhere. Those good old architecturally sound Roman arches (go learn something and Google it) are made of glass! But it\'s sparkling glass, the type that glistens when lights hit it, kinda like vampires from Twilight. Not that I watch Twilight, just saying. \nLay out is pretty awesome too. All foods are separated by segregation. That\'s right, racism is even alive in food! Asian food towards the rear of the buffet, crackers and deli in the middle, BBQ in the front! Damn right! BBQ deserves to be in the front! Even vegans know!\n\nFOOD: \nLet\'s get to it! AWEEEESOMMMEE. Brisket and the ribs are good enough to bring PEACE on Mother Earth. They got lamb, chicken, turkey, pork, beef, combine em all and you get LA CHUPA fawking CABRA! Who else you know got LA CHUPA CABRA!?? Even the people serving the food are happy. That\'s the key, you want people creating your food to be happy as Pharrell, that way you taste the love. Not in a weird way though. You know what I mean! Seafood is everywhere, you want your crab legs? you get your damn crab legs and some! \nThey have ramen soup, though I\'m not a big fan or Ramen soup, other people are. Crackers, deli meat and cheese --- DOOO NOT SLEEP ON THIS! I\'m talking these are 5-star caliber Lunchables people! Another thing to not sleep on are the Horchata, Guava, and Strawberry drinks they keep in a glass. If you ever have a bad day, one drink of either of those and you taste the meaning of life --- ENJOYMENT BABY! Did I mention there are UNLIMITED mimosas! Mama say, mama say MI-MA-MOSA! (Ode to MJ). I know ya\'ll Vegas peeps love you some mimosas. I see ya\'ll on Instagram hashtagging the shit out of it #MIMOSA. \n\nDESSERT:\nWhere do you start? Gelato, Ice cream, so much cake, it\'s ridiculous. The downside of the awesome buffet is you probably won\'t have enough space for dessert. Of course, they also have fruit, but if you\'re like me you go straight for the MEAT anyway.\n\nIf you have the moola and time to spare, or you have a homie in the VIP (brazzers), then try this place out. You won\'t regret it!'

S"Be prepared to wait in a super long, tourist packed line.. Unless you want to jump in the express line and fork out an extra $15! We went around dinner time and waited a little over an hour in line. Not too bad when you're with good company but my stomach was growling like a beast by the time we got seated. The buffet was hidden so if you do not know where it is, be sure to ask someone. They don't even have marquees with directions anywhere! Bacchanal is also on the pricey side but you are definitely getting your money's worth. Most buffets in town don't have fresh oysters which is why I love this one! There were pretty lengthy lines once we got inside as well. I think I waited about 10 minutes to get to the carved meats. Not a big deal because I already knew the wait was going to be long.  The service is what bugged me the most. I understand that they're busy but that does not mean they get a free pass for service. Our server was not very attentive at all.  He never once came to ask us for refills on our drinks or to see how we were doing.  We had to constantly call him over to get drinks, which he did not even get right on 2 separate occasions.  Also, every time he brought us new drinks, he just left the old glasses there.  By the end of our meal, we had a table full of 14 cups, yes I counted. For such a small table, that does not leave very much room for our plates. It was super annoying.  We also witnessed him yelling at the busser for some unknown reason a few times.  It was very unprofessional and made us uncomfortable.  I think we were just unlucky with our server.  Other than the service, I think Bacchanal is pretty decent.  I probably wont be coming back though just because the wait is so long."

They boil the king crab legroom in front of you.\n3. They have tomahawk ribeyes. One of these will set you back $90 at a steak house.\n4. Stone crab claws...that's crazy. They didn't have it when I went so I'm guessing it's only available on weekends.\n5. You get to build your own crepe.\n6. They have congee, pho, and ramen but don't eat the pho.  It is nasty. They need to hire the cook from Rio to make it.\n7. There are many more stuff that you won't find in other buffets.\n\nI took off 1 star for the long azz wait. If you come for dinner show up at lunch time. Bring a portable toilet, chair or sleeping bag...you will need it!  Or you can do what I do. Find a high roller and have them bring you in.

I know for what you pay you could get a really nice meal, but what can I say I like buffets.  The Asian station was whatever but the meat and seafood is delicious.

The presentation was nice but the flavor lacked a punch. \n\nThe service was good:waiters and waitresses were very polite, our beverage glasses stayed full, one waiter even stood watch over our plates as we went back to try some other foods. \n\nWhen u walk in they take your group's picture then later on try to sell it to you for $35. $35?! After the wait we had and the $50 we paid to eat this food that's just one step above golden corral they should've given everyone that damn pic for free. \n\nThe buffet at the Bellagio is MUCH better!

S'60 bucks! Well worth it. I was tired of spending $30 average on restaurants for just 1-2 entrees. So I said lets do a buffet! This buffet was great all around. Service was excellent as I didnt have to wait in line. I a vip guest. Cut right to the front. Haha. There was about 30 people in line. Service was great. Food was excellent. King crab. Huge shrimp. Raw oyster. They had a Hispanic selection. Asian selection. Sushi. The sushi was standard. The asian food was very good. Even the fried rice was delicious. They also had dim sum. The desserts was good. So much macaroons! Over for $60 I think its well worth it as so much variety with great quality not just quantity. Give it a shot. One of the the better buffets in vegas and I tried many. Come extra hungry.'

S"Selection was over the top!!!! But that's all I could say super positive about it!!! Bakery selection was good\nHowever, quality of food was questionable, I felt sick after.\nCrab legs were to silty, seafood was ok, I have tried better. Meat has not been done well enough. The bottom line, for this price , you would expect better quality. I don't think it's the best buffet in Vegas!!! Surly not!!!"

S'Having tried the M  , Rio , Paris and Wynn buffets just to name a few , Bacchanal Buffet is the best by a LARGE margin. We went here last September when it was still brand spanking new...so the lines were INSANE...But we were fortunate enough to know someone who not only let us go to the front of the line, but gave us all free buffet passes.\n\nThe wide selection alone makes it one of the best buffets ever, but the quality of the food really sets it apart.\n\nFrom the carving stations, to the chinese food section, the italian food , dessert station and so on, the quality of the food will not leave you disappointed.\n\nNo wonder there was a 2 hour line outside\n\nWill definitely comeback'

S"Came here during dinner in a busy holiday weekend.  This is far the best buffet in Vegas, with the variety of food offerings and the quality of the dishes to the nice setting inside.   I tried breakfast here before and it wasn't as good as the dinner but still a better option than a lot of the other buffets out there.  Every time I come to Vegas I come here for at least one meal and I'm not disappointed.  A must try."

S"This place is a solid four stars, we did have the perks of seven stars so we didn't have the long line everyone else went through.  \n\nThe food was fresh, well most of it. Some of the things near the meat station were a little dried out I'm assuming because the line blocked people from seeing what was available.\n\nWe had a really nice meal and the staff was all fast and friendly."

S"Second best buffet in Vegas.  I think Wicked Spoon edges it out, but this place is fantastic.  There are a lot of interesting dishes and they're all good.\n\nPersonal favorites were the kobe sliders and the dim sum buns.\n\nAll the strip buffets are priced about the same, so you know what you're getting yourself in to going in.  If you decide to do a strip buffet, this is a fine choice."

S"I came here this past weekend after reading some great reviews for this place. My brother and his girlfriend were visiting Vegas from Hawaii, so I met them and took them here. We got there around 10:30 am, as breakfast was ending and lunch was starting. For the three of us it was around $63, not too bad.  \n\nIt definitely lived up to its hype! \n\nThey had the standard breakfast fare like eggs, sausage, pancakes, and various juices. These were all pretty good. They also had some more interesting dishes. Of the breakfast foods, they had huevos rancheros, croque madames, corn beef pizza, steak and eggs red velvet pancakes, and chicken and waffles. Unfortunately most of the breakfast foods were not great, except the chicken was delicious.  \n\nHowever, the lunch and Asian foods were really really good - I'm not talking Chinese buffet quality, but much much better. They had dim sum, and not just spring rolls, but soup dumplings (WOW!), sticky rice (good), and har gau (which I don't eat). The noodle station had amazingly flavored ramen. And the Peking duck was some of the best I've ever had.  \n\nThe charcuterie and salads rocked, especially the prosciutto. Who doesn't love prosciutto. The prime rib was also really good and a perfect medium rare for me.  And the sliders were definitely a winner too. \n\nThe desserts were good but not spectacular, but I am rarely wowed by desserts anyway. The macaroons were especially delicous"

S"i'm not sure how you can find out the prices without calling caesars palace. we paid $54.99 each for a non-holiday sunday dinner. lots of vegetarian options. crab legs were adequately defrosted. nigiri and roll sushi were passable--excellent by buffet standards. i think this has surpassed the wicked spoon in terms of the best vegas buffet, with bellagio and wynn close behind.\n\nhighlights:\nmushroom polenta\nbeet salad...ok, hard to go wrong with this one\nmochi ice cream...ditto\ndo it yourself congee, with all the toppings...dried pickled radish, 1000 year egg, fried garlic, wonton strips, green onions...the whole shebang! \n\nfor those who care, the carving station included:\nindividual lamb chops in a sweet marinade\nprime rib\nbrisket\nchicken sausage\nanother type of sausage\n\nbathroom was outside and fairly small--this was annoying."

S"Came here on a Saturday around 1pm. To my surprise no line, but wait... They have a new system where you go to a screen touch computer and input your info (name, phone number, and # of ppl in your party); the computer then generates a time for you to come back to pay. Personally, I like this better than waiting in line for over an hour. Pretty smart for the hotel also because while you wait for your time chances are you are playing, so the hotel makes more money. \n\nWe had a party of 9 people and we were given a time for 2:45pm, so over an hour wait. That's pretty typical for this buffet, at least we didn't have to stand waiting in line. They will text 10 mins prior to your  designated time and you just go straight to the hostess and she then directs you to the cashier to pay. We waited about 10 mins to get a table after paying. Not bad! \n\nFor the food... Great selections; definitely better than other buffets on the strip. Make sure you come hungry because there will be plenty of food for you to choose from!"

S"Pros: atmosphere and appearance, accepts credit, dessert customizability (shaved ice, and ice cream selections),\nCons: food looks better than tastes, hard to get waiter's attention, $$$$\n\nThe Bacchanal is very expensive. I think it was $50/person when my family and I went for dinner. You would think that for that price, the food would be delicious and the experience would be amazing. I won't say it was completely bad, but it definitely wasn't worth $50. My family and I had to wait maybe 10 minutes after paying to be seated. I didn't like how low the salads were. It was a little inconvenient to get salads because of all the physical barriers that I had to overcome (ie position on low counters, and far from edge, window guards make it hard to reach in). I really only enjoyed the chicken and waffles, the salads, and the ice cream/sorbets. Though there were tons of things to choose from, and after sampling everything, I can live without most and that's why in the end, I felt that $50 was way too much. It is a little lower on my scale of Vegas buffets, just below the Wicked Spoon."

S"This is by far the best $50 I've ever spent on a buffet in Vegas. The selection of food, desserts, and unlimited mimosas make me want to come back to Vegas just for this place. \n\nHere are a number of things I thoroughly enjoyed during my three hour stay:\n1) King Crab Legs - you can get them steamed, just ask the chef. Additionally the seafood bar comes with a number of sauces you can dip this in\n2) Mussels, Clams, and unlimited oysters (dinner time) - can't go wrong with anything in the seafood section\n3) Sushi - great quality and selection is different from what other buffets serve\n4) Manchego cheese - delicious!\n5) Mochi ice cream - served during dinner time, multiple flavors and can't go wrong! Taste is similar to what I've had a numerous Japanese restaurants\n\n\n...Ok so I honestly cannot remember what else was good but you cannot go wrong with this place! I'll be back at the end of the month :)\n\nAdditionally, they automatically charge gratuity if you're planning to sit 8 people or more together, I suggest splitting your group up into 4 maximum people to get seated faster.\n\nOn a last note, why 4 stars since I raved about it so much? Because my only complaint is the servers. They took forever to get our drinks and our table had to ask multiple times..but it's only because they seemed understaffed that day."

S'Ahhhhhh someone please take me back!!! And I apologize in advance because I know this review is going to be very long...but it is a HUGE buffet so don\'t blame me, blame Bacchanal :) \n\nIf you are short on time just know..this buffet is WORTH VISITING. I was pretty skeptical by all the great reviews and the yelper\'s never lie..now for the people who would like to know what there is to have at this buffet: keep reading! \n\nOk, I swear I\'m not all over it because I\'m asian but I can say i was genuinely impressed with the selection of asian food they had. The dim sum, multiple different soups varying from rice porridge, miso soup, hot and sour, won ton soup, ramen, and a curry type soup. Not only was the selection huge but the quality was great. I was really excited when I saw the korean bbq but it was a little tendon-y for my taste...\nHighlights: seaweed salad, roast duck, rice porridge, and all the dim sum items.\n\nLarge assortment of deli meats that I didn\'t get to try because I was stuffing my face with other things. Same thing apples to the italian/pizza station. I did try some of the meatballs and the tortellini. They were both tasty but neither "wow-ed" me. \n\nNext to the mexican station were probably 20-25 different types of salsa, yummmmyyyyy\n\nOk, the meat station...they probably need more than one guy working this station but I was one of the lucky gal\'s that tasted the brisket...man is that brisket the best brisket and meat and fat I have EVER tasted. Not that anyone has to convince me to go back to Bacchanal, but I would go back for the brisket period. I also had the ham but the ham was nothing compared to the brisket. On my next visit I hope to see chicken breast instead of whole chicken where you pick your pieces. I just try to avoid bones when possible...\n\nThe next station was carbo-junk food galore. Little baskets of sweet potato tater tots (please don\'t get me started), regular tator tots, fried chicken and french fries, don\'t remember the rest because I was too busy with the sweet potato tater tots. \n\nThis is also really random...but the grilled asparagus was delicious. I am a fighter when someone serves me asparagus but I willingly got up for a second serving of asparagus here.\n\nUnfortunately, the seafood station is another one that seems understaffed. I didn\'t try much of the seafood besides the crab because there were SO MANY PEOPLE! But, the crab was much too salty for my taste.\n\nBefore I end my praise of how great Bacchanal Buffet, PLEASE visit the crepe station and have one for me. In my visit, I ate 3, and its not because the crepes were small, unfortunately. I literally could not stop myself. There is an assortment of fresh blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and nutella, caramel, chocolate, freshly whipped whipped cream, etc. This crepe station alone is what sets Bacchanal aside from the others. \n\nHowever, there were a lot of things I was flat out not impressed with: \n1. The pathetic fruit selection. Not only was the selection pathetic but the presentation was not up to par with the other things in the buffet. Simple things like the pineapple...they didn\'t even remove the rind. My school dining hall serves the pineapple with rind. An upscale buffet where people are paying $45+tax and tip for dinner shouldn\'t have to do more work with the simple PINEAPPLE. Ok, enough with that. Onto the next thing\n2. The Mexican station...I thought this station could use some improvement. First of all, the shredded beef or whatever meat they served definitely has way too many chunks of fat in it. That is all. The tamales, tasty but not enough meat. \n3. I understand that everyone is adapting to the "small plates" trend but I am not a fan..some of the items like the curly fries or other fried items I wanted to try ONE of but since they were pre-portioned, I couldn\'t! Sometimes the buffets end up wasting more through this method. Thats more of a suggestion than a complaint but whatever.\n4. This place didn\'t have macaroons on my visit. But there are pictures on Yelp saying that they have macaroons. They either need to have macaroons everyday or not at all. (angry emoji)\n5. Lastly, they need a bathroom inside the actual buffet. The bathroom is right outside where you pay but its inconvenient having to share a bathroom with everyone in the casino/hotel along with the buffet customers.\n\nOf course, no buffet is perfect so I\'m afraid I have to give it a solid four stars. I hope to see continuous improvements on my next visit! (and hopefully not another price increase)\n\nPS. I didn\'t think the servers were as slow as people made them out to be. Within 2 minutes we had our initial greet with our server to take our drinks. By the time I brought back my first plate, the drinks were there. Just an FYI!'

S'Bahk-uh-null or BACK-ANAL?  If it wasn\'t for my friends saying the former, I\'m sure I\'d pronounce it as BACK-ANAL Buffet.\n\nWe got there around 1pm with a part of 5.  The wait was a little more than an hour, not as long as I thought.  During busy times they\'ll have a kiosk where you input the number of your party (which includes an estimate time wait).  They ask for your name and number, and they will text you when your table is ready.  Also, you will be given a ticket regarding the information you just inputted.  The texting idea is great because my friends and me were able to roam around for a bit as oppose to waiting in line.\n\nAt 2pm we got our text and headed over.  You check in with the hostess and pay immediately.  Everyone can pay together or separately.  At 2pm it was still the Brunch time and our total ended up being around $48.  The cashiers will give you this little rubber things to prevent you from getting burned when picking your food, but it isn\'t necessary unless you are sensitive to heat.  They had us wait in another line before seating us where someone asked to take a photo of us.  I later found out, they will try to sell you the picture.  Like really, it\'s not a theme park so no thanks.\n\nEventually another hostess led us to our table.  Because it was our first time, she had the opportunity to tell us where everything was.  As you enter, everything is on the left in the following order: Seafood, American, Mexican, Italian, and Asian food.  The dessert is in the middle-right of the area.  This place was surprisingly not as big as I thought.  When we sat down we immediately ordered mimosas.  Unforutnately, the mimosas were lacking.  As others have mentioned, it did seem like those concentrated orange juice you find in the freezer aisle of grocery stores.  If you let your mimosa sit, you can the concentrated orange juice and champagne separate.  Geez, for $48 you\'d think they would use fresh orange juice.\n\nFinally, it was time to dig in.  I decided to work my way from right to left.  To keep thing short here were some of the highlights for me of each area:\n\nAsian Food - Chinese food was good (but please, I can get that for cheaper and just as good in Chinatown).  Sushi and the other noodle dishes were on point.\n\nItalian Food - You can tell the ingredients like pepperoni were bigger and tasted more high end.  Here you also got your steamed crab legs.  If you give them an empty plate of it, they will fill the whole plate with crab legs so brace yourself.  The steam crab legs are worth getting here as oppose to the frozen crab legs in the Seafood section.\n\nMexican Food - The tacos were freaking amazing, and they make it for you right there.  On the adjacent part of the mexican section, they have fresh Horchata, Guava Juice, Mango Juice, and Tamarind Juice.  All come in this cute milk jug shape container.  Try all of them!  They were definitely made fresh and sweet.\n\nAmerican Food - Meat, meat, and more meat.  I gave them an empty plate and asked for some Brisket and Prime Rib.  They literally filled my whole plate with it.  I felt like I needed to balance all that meat so I got a small corn on the cob.  Both the Brisket and Prime Rib were flavorful, meaty, and juicy.  It did not taste as good cold, but there was so much I couldn\'t finish it while it was still hot.\n\nSeafood - Muscles, oysters, clams, crab legs, and shrimps galore! All were great, but they kept running out of hot sauce.  People kept taking them otheir tables and not returning them back. Grrrr.  The hot butter is on the corner in the beginning of the line, so don\'t forget! \n\nDessert - I think the dessert area purposely serve small portions because you will be full by the time you get there.  There is someone making fresh crepes for you.  Grab one, pour some strawberries, drizzle some nutella, and add a bit of powder sugar and you got yourself a tasty treat.  Creme brulee was nice and sweet, while they had an assortment of chocolate covered strawberries.  My favorite one was the white chocolate covered strawberries with strawberry coated rice treats.  Lastly, they had ice cream where you can also make cute little ice cream sandwiches with them.  The person scooping your ice cream will ask if you want 1 or 2 scoops.  My friend and I concluded, no matter what combination you say (for example Mango sherbert and Chocolate), she is still bound to say "oh that\'s a good/popular combination." Haha.\n\nOverall, I along with my stomach were satisfied.  I would suggest going there around 1pm to get seated around 2pm.  At 3pm, they beging circulating and changing their menu for dinner.  For example, I had the crab eggs benedict during the Brunch hour.  But as soon as 3pm hit, they were no longer serving those items.  If you want to experience everything that would be the best time to go.\n\nJust remember to pronounce this place correctly.'

S"This place is HUGE! And they have a giant selection of food. The crab here are already split in half so you don't have to break them! There are two rooms, at first I thought there were was only one room, but you just got to turn a corner at the end of the Mexican station and BOOM! Whole mother room with Italian, cold cuts, salads,  and Asian food. They even have dim sum ( for dinner!). Most off the food was good, there were a few selection from the meat station that was a bit too salty. The desert station was the best, it is centered right in the middle of the main room and had every imaginable desert you can think of even mochi! The waiter suggested to get the peach green tea here, and it was soo good, I had like 4 of them, because they are so good. The price is quite expensive here at $50 a person, as well as the line being very long at dinner time. My friends and I waited for about 2 hours until we were able to be seated. Overall this was a good place, with good food."

S'There are lots of hypes about this buffet so we checked this one out! The line was crazy! It is totally worth it to buy the VIP ticket to bypass the line. So, first, you need to get in line to get ticket. So it said it would take an hour to have your number called. We thought it should be OK because we could go shopping around. But after that, you had to stay in another line to pay for your tickets and another line to be called. It took us 3 hours and 30 mins to be seated! \n\nI think the food was OK or a little bit above average but nothing was too special or I had to have it. The fresh oysters were the best I had there. For king crabs, go to Italian section to get the hot and steamy ones. They do taste better. \n\nI went there once and it is one time deal for me. That is enough!'

S"I rate this as one of my top 5 buffets here in Las Vegas! I was truly amazed on the presentation of the buffet. The this was an international gourmet buffet that pretty much completed all the common international foods such as Asian, Mexican, American, and Italian.\n\nI must warn you you will wait for about 2 hours in the regular line and i believe lunch during the time I went it was $50 a person.\n\nLuckily my high roller friend was a seven star player we didn't have to wait that long in line and we got seated right away.\n\nIf your looking for a quiet ambiance, forget it! you will be stressed out with all the loud noise and all the Asians from outta this country pushing and shoving.. ( I am guilty as well and played the i'm a foreign Asian card).\n\nThe food selection was endless with over hundreds of items to choose from. You can even get fresh juice in those milk magnolia bottles which impressed me but i guess im dorky like that!\n\nOne of my favorites was the roasted pig they had. I do not know any buffets in town that has roasted pig.\n\nI also enjoyed the presentation of the french fries and their kobe burgers. I love how this buffet is smart with portion control with their buffets but still we have a bunch of people pushing and shoving like a gang of hungry wolf packs!\n\nOverall i enjoyed eating at Bacchanal. Love the artistic decorations and the food presentation the most. I would highly recommend checking it off your bucket list."

S"In the past, when we wanted a good seafood buffet, we used to head to the Flamingo for their Friday night seafood buffet.  The price wasn't bad and the seafood, although not great, was better than you could find at the other buffets in town.  Unfortunately, the price went up and the quality of the food went down.  We checked out a other places, but few had a decent selection of seafood.\n\nWe heard some good reports of the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars and decided to check it out.  Once we navigated our way through the casino to find the buffet we were greeted by a long line waiting to get in.  Although there were probably at least 100 people in front of us, the line moved rather quickly and we didn't wait that long.  The price was about $45, but you can spend another $15 to move to the head of the line.  \n\nOnce in and seated you see the size of the serving areas--at least twice as large as any of the others we've been to.  They claim to have over 500 items on the menu.  We didn't stop to count them all, but that number probably includes all the sauces and different flavors of gelato.  \n\nWe tried sampling as many of the different dishes that we could.  Here's a quick overview of the different stations:\n\n* Seafood - this is what we came for.  Lots of choices including the standard shrimp and crab legs.\n\n* American Comfort - really good sweet potato tots.  The onion rings were ok, but nothing great.\n\n* Italian - Some good pasta and pizza choices here.  Didn't eat a lot since I tend to overstuff myself when eating pasta.  \n\n* Deli - lots of choices although some are the standard Tillamook cheeses I can pick up at Smith's.\n\n* Salad - large selection of greens and toppings.  Also a good selection of fruits and prepared salads.  Although we like salads, we tend to avoid them at buffets since they fill you up and don't leave room for the other items.\n\n* Carving - lots of choices, but the good stuff goes quick and you have to go back multiple times to see what's available.  Unfortunately, this was the worst station in the buffet.  Most of the meats were served cold and the ones that weren't were dried out.\n\n* Mexican - didn't try since neither of us is a fan of TexMex.\n\n* Sushi - tried a couple of the items (the tuna and salmon sashimi).  Ok, but not really our style.\n\n* Oriental section - My favorite station.  Everything I tried here was fantastic.  Hit this station multiple times.\n\n* Dessert - this is probably where most of their 500 items are.  Lots of cakes, pies, gelatos and other desserts to choose from if you have room left after eating everything else.  I had the red velvet cake (dry) and the bread pudding (better at Golden Corral).\n\nHere are some of the high/lowlights of some of the individual items that we sampled:\n\n* King crab legs - the ones on display are cold and you'll probably find a few that are still frozen.  Not much fun biting into a crabcicle.  They will cook them for you and we'd recommend that if you like your crab warm.\n\n* Shrimp--wow, they're already peeled.  They are on the large/jumbo size so they can have a mealy texture at times.\n\n* Clam buckets - not bad, but most of my clam shells were missing their clams.  Had to get multiple buckets to get all the clams I wanted.\n\n* Steamed Mussels - Ok, but after they're cooked they put them on ice.  They're just not as good that way as freshly steamed dipped in butter.\n\n* Oyster shooters - best to avoid.  Something just doesn't smell right with them and some folks have complained about being sick after trying one.\n\n* Oysters - they're west coast oysters, so there not as good as we could get in DC. They weren't bad, but we wouldn't recommend them unless you really have a craving for oysters.\n\n* Crab cakes/croquettes - very good\n\n* Wagyu sliders - delicious, although try to grab them when they're first put out; otherwise the rolls tend to dry out.\n\n* Prime Rib - sorry, I prefer my cooked meat warm, not cold.  That may have had something to with the texture of the meat.  Had better at The Feast at Santa Fe Station.\n\n* Lamb chops - delicious.  I probably ate more of these than anything else.\n\n* Chinese ribs - ok, but not that tender.  The meat should almost fall off the bone if they're done right.\n\n* Har Gow - a Chinese shrimp dumpling served in dim sum.  Never had one of these before and they were fantastic.  I'm not sure how many times I went back for more, but I grabbed some every time I visited the station.\n\nOverall, it wasn't bad, but it really wasn't great either.  There's a large selection of items to choose from so no one should go hungry.  Is it worth $50 per person?  I didn't think it was that night.  Maybe they just had an off night on the carving station.  The meats looked good, but just weren't cooked right--this was what knocked the rating down to 3 stars.  We'll probably try it again, because even if you avoid the carving station, there are still plenty of other things to choose from."

S"Maybe that is the problem with high expectations...\n\nI've heard for a few months now how I had to try the Bacchanal Buffet and how it was the best in Vegas.  I understand the days fo the $9.99 buffet are over and I have no issue shelling out $40-$50 for a premium buffet...but when I do so, I expect premium food and service.\n\nHonestly, I didn't find the food to be spectacular, or at least enough so to make me forget about the horrible service.  There were many items I enjoyed throughout my many samplings.  Overall, I was just perplexed at time by the set up and extremely frustrated by the service.  Maybe someone can help me with this one.  You have a long line building for crab legs (rightfully so) but why put the drawn butter at the beginning of the line...with no cups or other dishes to hold said butter.  Should i just lather it on an empty plate?  Upon further review, perhaps the crab legs should have been the START of the line and the butter the end...this would also explain why lemons, tartar sauce, horseradish and cocktail sauce were AFTER the chilled shrimp.  If this is the case, then why isn't there someone directing traffic?  I mean it wouldn't hurt to have people using the buffet the way it was designed instead of lining up the wrong way and getting in the way of the staff trying to go in and out of the kitchen and dodging swinging doors and carts.  The lines were going completely backwards.  You'd expect a place dubbed as the best to operate like a well oiled machine.\n\nAnother perplexing thing is how the line to get in is so incredibly long to get in but then inside the place is half empty and seemingly understaffed.  I'm looking around at waiters standing around, managers setting tables, dirty tables, and I can't get a drink order filled.  Our original waitress disappeared for awhile after serving us initially before I spotted her standing around doing nothing in another section.  I asked two different people and waited roughly 20 minutes for a drink towards the tail end of the meal before we decided to get up and leave.  This was all after we sat around for 10 minutes before a waitress even came by to take the first drink order.  Two beverages in 60+ minutes and nobody walking around filling up waters seems a bit unacceptable.  In addition, nobody came by to clear used dishes and glasses until we were almost forced to turn around and put them on an empty table just to make room.  I mean this seems like Buffet 101 type stuff to me...when people get up to get another plate, you clear the previous plate and/or bring a drink.  I don't know if we caught them at a bad day/time but $52 and a 30 minute wait is a bit too steep for me to run back and find out, especially with other good options down the street.  When comparing to Wicked Spoon in terms of price, food, and service, I would choose Wicked Spoon every time."

S"I've been to this buffet four times this summer, and it's stellar every time. For some reason, I've been extremely lucky in that I haven't had to wait in line longer than 15-20 minutes. I've heard horror stories from friends saying that the line can be over an hour long, if you come at the wrong time. Try to make it for brunch, when they serve all-you-can-drink mimosas or champagne. \n\nNevertheless, each time the food has been great. They have a great selection of asian cuisine, which ranges from sushi to dim sum to steamed fish to Korean BBQ.  Their seafood is really good, including hot and cold crab legs, jumbo shrimp, raw oysters, muscles, crawfish, and more.  I can honestly say that I've never tried the taco, salad or cheese area... because once I finish 3 plates of crab legs, sushi, and steamed fish, I go immediately to the prime rib, brisket, and lamb chop area.  The lamb chops can be a little salty, but the flavor is so good that it doesn't matter.  \n\nAfter 10 plates of entrees, make sure you visit the wide variety of desserts.  They have anything you can possible think of!"

S"3.5 Stars\n\nGood selection of seafood and desserts, expensive.\n\nThought we'd try this place out for dinner with a group of 7, it was $65/person?  In order to be seated your entire party must be present.  \nThe decor is nice and trendy and the food selection is pretty good, but really, only 2 hours to stuff myself?!\nI really liked the seafood and dessert sections, everything else was aright.  They even had ramen/pho but I'd rather go to a place that focuses just on those soups.  I was hooked on the horchata and aguas frescas though.\n\nI prefer Caesars buffet still."

S'No lines at 8:30am on a monday morning.  The breakfast price is $24.99.  I love this place.  Variety of cusines-American, Italitan, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican.  I had ham, slab of bacon, smoked brisket was moist and delicious.  The chinese food-rice porridge, noodles, dim sum, chinese doughnut was yummy.  Also their red velvet pancakes was moist not dry.  No complaints here.  I had no room for dessert which I was bummed about.  Next time.  In addition, they state 2 hours limit on the receipt which is nice to know.'

S'Ok..so the food really deserves a 3.5 or 4 star for a buffet.\nBUT.....bait and switch alert people.  BAIT AND SWITCH.\n\nOk...I came here about a month after opening for a Yelp Elite event.  It was free.  It was glorious.  Now it\'s chalk full of problems.\n1) No Monta ramen.  For tourists, this is a local ramen joint that is very popular with the foodies.  They hired someone from there to help them with their ramen.  It was close to the real deal.  Last night?  Gone gone gone.  At the Yelp event, they even had the head buffet chef walking around bragging about how much trouble they were to for the ramen.  I believe him.  So what happened?  Good thing I didn\'t pay $50 for this buffet expecting this ramen.  Oh wait...$50 it was!\n2) Whoever manages this buffet needs a demotion, stat.  At even the premium buffets in town you expect to wait for seafood.  Crab legs, etc.  Mostly the crab legs take a lot of work and it\'s a bottleneck.  Fine.  \nAt Bacchanal, they had combined the seafood and carving station lines into one, gigantic line.  GIGANTIC. Moved slower than molasses in the winter, too.  Not only did that make carving station only patrons wait a VERY LONG time for some meats that were ready to go, the long line obscured about 25% of the buffet\'s offerings.  And most of the "good stuff" if we\'re being honest.  Basically, if you wanted fried chicken, or any of the potatoes, any bread, a whole host of things - you had to squeeze your way in between the dirty looks of people who thought you might be cutting in line.  How\'s about separating the lines?  Oh wait...they DID end up separating.  After I complained to a manager and was told, I\'m not kidding, "Just go ahead and walk up to the carving station and ask for what you need.  Just bypass the line."  Whatchu talkin\' bout Willis?! Despite my misgivings,  I tried that assuming the people were all in line for seafood.  They weren\'t.  I almost got murdered by the people in line. \nOnly my cat like reflexes saved me.  \nAlso, they had 1 chef at the carving station - all the while a huge line was continuing to build.  Here\'s a hint - have another person there carving while another person takes orders and serves it up?  The lady in front of me literally took, and I timed this, 3 minutes to get 3 different kinds of meat.  With like 30 people behind her and growing.  The line is long and the meat is not going to sit there more than a minute if you cut it early.  It\'s already rested - it\'s fine!  Good thing I didn\'t pay $50 for this buffet.  Oh wait...I did!\nWhen I went before, they obviously had separate lines.  It took ME to get them to separate it despite the seriously angry patrons.  And no surprise things went much smoother afterwards.  Hey Caesars Palace - where\'s my paycheck? I managed your buffet for one night, Gary Loveman(CEO of Caesars).\n3) No fresh fruit except for blackberries.  They used to have great chocolate covered strawberries.  We were told they had been out since 2 days ago.  Thank God I didn\'t pay something outrageous like $50 for this buffet only to have them run out of the most popular fruit in existence.  Oh wait...I did pay $50.  F$#k me!  Great I\'ll get some rasberries.  No?  No rasberries either?  Well...we are in the desert.  At least I didn\'t pay....\n4) Dishes at the table took a good long while to be cleared.  Not the biggest deal in the world - but when your table is full it does get a big messy.\nOn the positives:\n1) For our group, we paid $15 extra each to skip the line to get in.  Well worth it if you\'re willing to shell out the $15.  Looked like at least an hour wait if not more.  Wish other places would have that option.\n2) The carving station meats were pretty good.  Sausage was spicy and delicious.  BBQ ribs were tender and flavorful.  And the ribeye was solid.  The brisket, however, was awful. Dry as a bone and really overcooked.\n3) Desserts were nice.  I didn\'t eat much but the Kona Coffee mochi was very very good.  One of my friends had a crepe and she thought it was one of the best she\'s had.  So big thumbs up for the dessert stations.  Oh yeah..and no wait.  haha\n4) Temperature was fine in the buffet.  Also, no fire, flood, nuclear explosion, etc.  Hmm....struggling to think of things to come up with in this section.  No terrorists!\n\nIn a nutshell, if you\'re already at Caesars and $50 isn\'t a ton of cash for you to spend then go for it.  It\'s perfectly fine.\n\nIf you\'re making a special trip to a buffet then I\'d recommend Bellagio or Wynn over this one.  \n\nJust disappointing to see them pull out all the stops initially to generate that good publicity.  Then just bend you over and stick it in rough like this.  It\'s brutal.  Really, I should give this kind of crap the 1 star treatment.  You know what?  I will.  Dropping to 1 star. \n\nHonestly pays.  Dishonesty shouldn\'t.  John H. OUT!!\n\nEdit: Let me add one thing. Bleu cheese dressing constantly gets stuck in opening of hard plastic bottle. Can\'t squeeze it.  Thus, it\'s unusable. LOL?'

S"The decor was beautiful.  We were seated in the back corner but I love how it doesn't feel like you're in a buffet room.  The decor was modern and everything was just beautiful.  I heard great things about this buffet. I was planning on going to wicked spoon from rave reviews from my friends.  But were wowed from this place.  What makes this place apart from other buffet is that quality and variety.  We went for Sat brunch at 43$ with unlimited champagne or mimosa.  We were greeted and the host gave us a tour of what was available on all stations.  This is a first for me at buffet. Usually they just seat you and that's it.  Over 500+ ...how can one person try everything. Of course, I have to plan to return.  We tried to get little bites of everything. All super fresh and most stations have ready to made order.   I expected a bit more variety for desserts though.  I love how they have unique gelato flavors.  I had the fig and balsamic and it was delicious!! Then my friends found macaroons. OMG..the flavors were amazing!  And they have ramen or pho! Wow...every station has amazed me.  I dont know how other hotel buffet can top this..Bravo Caesars!!"

S"We went for breakfast at 9:30 on a Wednesday morning.  There was no line so we were seated quickly.  The price was just shy of $30.  There were lots of yummy options, eggs benedict, chicken fried steak. croque madame, breakfast pizza, red velvet pancakes, chicken and waffles the list goes on and on.  We were seated close to the buffet so we were able to grab a couple small plated items and put them on our table and go back for more.  That was nice cause they are so cute but take up a lot of room on your plate.  Most of the stuff we tried we split in hopes of not filling up after one round.  The food was good but not amazing..not even special really.  It was good for a buffet I guess?  I was really looking forward to the fresh juice I had seen pics of.  They only had tropical and by the time we left were completely out.  I am surprised they don't restock, especially at breakfast.  Service was lacking.  Plates were not cleared and drinks not refilled, which wouldn't have been such an issue if they would restock the damn juice.  It was not busy at all.  So we should have been able to get better service.  The dessert section was nothing special.  I hope they put out better desserts with lunch and dinner.  There was crepes, pastries, cookies and candy in jars and gelato.  That was it.  We got some gelato on a small cone on the way out.  I would try again if a friend wanted to go for lunch or dinner.  I'm over breakfast though."

S"Spread, spread, spread is what makes the newly renovated buffet at Caesar's phenomenal. The new layout and revamp of menu will give the Bellagio and Wynn a run for their money. \n\nComing in for breakfast, I was impressed. It left me wondering what dinner was bound to feature. Near the entrance, in the morning, the cold bar is stocked with fresh juices. The beautiful display of colors draws the eyes in and my hand started grabbing. Orange, grapefruit, watermelon, and carrot were available for the taking. Fresh fruit and parfaits contain tropical fruits such as starfruit sit above.\n\nThe next line had many forms of bacon including turkey and three different kinds of pork. Eggs benedict come in a traditional form, but the one using the potato cake was way better. The chiliquiles were soggy since they were constructed ahead of time. The small portions in skillets give the perfect serving of most dishes. The little frying basket of maple tots were drool inducing. Plated servings of regular and red velvet pancakes are placed out as guest take them. Beautiful, the red velvet flavor was not present. Although this concept of single serving goodness is not new, Bacchanal does it much better. \n\nMoving on, there was an egg station which would prepare your eggs any way you wish or just pick from the rolls, pizzas, and quiche on display. A whole line was dedicated to bagels, lox, and spread. Some are made in advance, but you could easily make your own. \n\nContinue on for the thinly sliced prosciutto and other meats, then comes the cheese selection. At the very end there is an Asian section which includes the dim sum. I was not impressed with this offering. My friend and I paced ourselves because desserts are essential no matter what time it is.\n\nBetween two of us; we got a blackberry cobbler, four kinds of ice cream, a berries and nutella crepe, and waffles. I used the infused honey near the bread station instead of maple syrup for my waffle and it was magic. \n\nFor $16.99, you will not find a better deal for breakfast."

S"Our experience at the Bacchanal was amazing.  I had high expectations for this buffet and it lived up to it.  The wait seems to be a problem but they do have a line where you pay an extra $15 dollar a person and you get to skip to the shorter line.  If you are in a rush then I would say paying that extra amount is still worth it.  Even though I wasn't able to eat as much as I wanted to.  I tried my best. I got to sample a variety of food and I must say most of the items I tried were pretty good.  For the price, it is worth it.  We were seated in a little area sorta felt like the VIP area since it was the only table for 10 in that section.  Our server was tentative and kept bringing our drinks and taking away our plates.  Will definitely be back to attempt to try out the rest of the food."

A bit pricey (around $48) but the food is so good you want to keep eating and eating! They have everything you can possibly want for brunch. Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Seafood, etc...We ate so much food we really didn't have room for dessert but they all looked amazing! Next time we are in Vegas we are definitely coming here"

S'=The Facts= \n-December 7-9, 2012: "the off season", per our server.\n-Friday AND Saturday night 8pm: ~10 people in line, seated in 5 minutes.\n-Sunday just before noon: ~75 people in line, seated in under 30 minutes.\n\n-8pm offered dinner items. \nAt least 95% repeat items between Fri-Sat-Sun.\n-12pm offered 20% breakfast items / 80% dinner. \nI say dinner instead of lunch, because they were the same items that we saw at 8pm on our previous visits.\n\n95% of the food we tried was, for the lack of a better term, "restaurant quality", opposed to "cafeteria quality". The quality you would expect from your favorite local (insert ethnicity here) eatery that\'s been in business for 20 years, and not a chain, precooked and packaged after thought.\n\nThere\'s a battle being waged in Las Vegas, The Battle of the Buffets, and \nThe Bacchanal is currently winning. I love this trend. As long as the quality of food and price stay in line with each another, and I think they have for the most part, I will continue to look forward to the next contender. \nMeanwhile, The Bacchanal Buffet is the place to eat.\n\nPRO TIP!: If you have the constitution to pull off more than 2 visits in a 24hr span, you will likely benefit from the Buffet of Buffets 24hr Pass. Assuming you go 3 times, the savings equal \'buy two get one free\'.'

S"I've been waiting for weeks to eat here. Even more than that, I've been waiting to mark my 5 stars and add Bacchanal to my list as the best buffet in Vegas. Unfortunately I didn't get to do any of those. There's not a lot I can say bad about this place. Overall, it was a good experience, but it wasn't the best there is. \n\nFirst of all, I parked in the garage and found it difficult to find once I was inside Caesars. There were no signs to the buffet until you're almost there. We asked four employees along the way. One person didn't have a clue. Once we got there, a long line awaited us. On a positive note, we only had to wait 25 minutes. We got there on a Monday at 10:00. I can't imagine what the wait is like on a weekend. The great thing about getting there after 10 is that they start changing the food line at 11. You get the end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch. Hmmm...I believe that is called brunch. Oh....there is a big price difference between breakfast and lunch. \n\nThe facility is beautiful. It is large enough to walk between tables without disturbing others. Yelpers comment about how expensive it is, but I think it is well worth the money. The food was very good. I was stuffed when I left. For breakfast I had bacon (greasy and fatty), red velvet pancakes (just OK), sweet potato tots (scrumptious), biscuit (OK), scrambled eggs (runny), shrimp and grits (OK). I tasted my partner's french toast and it was very good. \n\nFor lunch I had dim sum (all that I tried was very good), paella (good and an unusual dish for a buffet), BBQ spare ribs (smoky). I didn't bother waiting in line for the very small salad bar. I tasted my partner's very good fried chicken. There were a lot of food choices and the food was a little above average for a buffet. There were no signature dishes that would be unique to Bacchanal such as some of the dishes you will find at the Wicked Spoon. Actually, the way that the food was displayed and served makes you think that the designers spent a lot of time checking out the Wicked Spoon as they were designing this place. Unfortunately, they didn't bring over the chefs.\n\nLastly...the desserts. I only had the red velvet cake and carrot cake. They were both very good. I usually hate the nasty carrot cakes at buffets, but the bakery stepped up to the plate and hit a home run with the carrot cake. My friends had different desserts and said that they were all fabulous. The coffee was good. \n\nI don't like to do buffets because I tend to overeat. I can't imagine that I would ever go back to to this one unless I was with someone that insisted upon going there. I'd much rather go the the M or the Wicked Spoon."

S"Hmmmm... where do I start? Ah yes... the infamous buffet, Bacchanal buffet. To begin, I'm not the type of guy to stuff my face for hours and hours until I have to be rolled out like Homer Simpson.  After doing some extensive research, I decided to try Bacchanal and was not disappointed one bit.  \n\nHighlights:\n-Definitely come here before 3pm to get lunch prices ($35/pp), they begin to roll out the good stuff after 3pm\n-Different stations, seafood, cured meats, asian, italian, mexican, american and desserts\n-I really like the lamb chops and prime rib. The wagyu sliders and lobster corn chowder was pretty good too.  I also like the oysters here as well.\n\n\nTo sum up, after a 2.5 hr non-stop feast for kings, I left with my stomach stuffed, face happy, and a double chin to come with it.  Yea, I'm pretty happy. =)"

S"This was my first opportunity to eat at the Caesars. I was told it was ranked number one in the city of Las Vegas. the last bus fare of this caliber I tried was at the Wynn by Steven Wynn. I was thoroughly impressed with their standard of excellence in every dish. But I was curious to see was Caesar's Palace better?\n\nI arrived for brunch on a Sunday at around 10:30 a.m.. The lines were not too long and I was seated within 15 minutes. The price of the buffet was 45 99. That included my endless mimosa. The decor was very contemporary and chic. As my hostess took me to where I would be seated, I was able to get a glimpse of all of the wonderful treats that we're in store for me.\n\nI first started at the meat section. I had the prime rib which was a great choice. Your other options were chicken New Mexico sausage, hot links, slab bacon if you prefer. The staff at the carving station were very friendly. My prime rib was medium just like I like it however it wasn't as flavorful as I expected. The New Mexico chicken sausage was zesty in flavor but cold in touch. This was disappointing but it also was a telltale sign for what I had to expect for the rest of my visit.\n\nI also enjoyed chicken and waffles. They were in an individual basket. I think it was the best thing that I ate. The chicken was crispy and juicy. And the waffle was flaky very good. When I got to the seafood table, I tried the snow crab and a lobster bisque with corn over a biscuit. The lobster bisque taste great however the potato that was in it was under cooked. Disappointed. I enjoyed that all the snow crab was warmed if you wanted it warmed in front of you.\n\nMy mimosas kept coming and the coffee was hot fresh and delicious. I ended my meal with a slice of Pizza and a side salad with mozzarella and tomatoes and mushrooms. Overall I enjoyed the food however, with the price that I paid I would expect that everything would be near perfect and it wasn't I was not impressed by anything they serve on the dessert menu either."

S"Recently went for lunch, and it was good.  Bacchanal is basically the best buffet in Vegas right now.  Yes, it's a little pricey, but it's in Caesars and thus, somewhat expected.  More importantly, its worth it for the quality and selection of food.\n\nEven though the line for lunch looked worse than the line for Space Mountain at Disneyland, I timed it, and it was about a ten minute wait time.  It was $30 for lunch, or $36 including tip, which you can add at the cash register.\n\nOne of the things that I like about this buffet is that they do a few dishes for each type of food, and they do them (mostly) well.  There isn't that sense of trying to offer every single dish known to man (Rio buffet, I'm looking at you!) at the expense of the quality of food.  The other thing that I really like (okay, love) are the desserts.  The desserts are plentiful, and taste like they're straight from a bakery.\n\nMy highlights were the pesto pasta (REALLY good pasta), chorizo with potatoes, beef sliders, and the sorbet.  The sweet potato fries also deserve special recognition for having just the right amount of crispiness.  (Not to be confused with the sweet potato tater tots; those had a weird glaze on top that tasted too sweet.)  I also LOVE the watermelon fruit juice, which oddly, is located in the seafood section.  \n\nI've also heard that the Pho is awesome here, but I didn't get a chance to try it on my last visit.  Overall, I think it's a great buffet, but some people may be disappointed simply because that tends to happen when other people rave about a place, particularly a buffet."

S'wicked spoon may have come up with the individual serving idea, but bacchanal executes far better - each dish tastes like it was prepared to order.  the tacos were great and the ramen tasted better than most ramen shops in SF.  great shrimps, carving area with huge selection - like brisket and ribs.  one let down was they ran out of sushi...well, make some more. the ticket line system is cool too. you hold your place in line through a machine and you get a text when you are in front of the line.  so you can gamble while you wait instead of standing in line.  mimosa was also cold which makes it delicious.'

S"I came to this place for dinner buffet over labor day weekend wtih my family and everything was delicious!  I had been to other buffets in Vegas but it was my first time here.  The others I had been to were okay, nothing amazing, but I will definitely say that this one is now at the top of my list.  \n\nSurprisingly, we arrived at 7pm on a Friday (of a holiday weekend) and only had to wait 25-30 minutes to get seated.  That was awesome because I was STARVING.  Upon walking inside, I was already overwhelmed by all the different food options.  I ended up trying as much as I could and honestly liked pretty much everything I tried.  They have a huge range of things to choose from- soups, sushi, tacos, oysters, crab legs, fish, meats, etc.  I personally tried a few of the chef special hot dishes and liked them a lot (although I don't know what they actually were).  The ox tail soup they had was also perfection, along with the mushroom truffle soup.  Aside from the main options, they also had a humongous assortment of dessert- macarons, cakes, pastries, crepes made to order, and gelato!  I ended up sharing with my brother and essentially trying a bite of everything.  I'd definitely recommend doing this if you have expand your stomach enough to do so ;).\n\nIn the end, I walked away feeling super full and regretting my life decisions (like eating that last mousse, or going to buffets in general)... but after recovering from that, I'd definitely go again because I just can't pass up all the deliciousness that is there :P.  This is most definitely my favorite buffet on the strip."

I am a little confused at why we had to wait so long, there were still plenty of tables available when we were finally seated.\n\nIt was $50-ish (including tip) and included champagne/mimosas. I don't care for alcohol when I am at a buffet, so I only had a glass. It was pretty delicious and a good mix. Subsequent glasses that my friends got were more champagne than orange juice - score! \n\nAs Lilly Q. mentioned, the popular foods (meats and seafood) have people lining up. I found myself avoiding those lines. I buddied up with a friend and shared nearly everything. My favorites were the corn, wagyu sliders, fried chicken, potatoes au gratin, tater tots, meatballs, flan and gelato. Everything else was okay. I kind of expected everything to be amazing, but of course the law of diminishing marginal utility kicks in and nothing really tastes that great after your second plate of food. I'm super sad that I was too full to have oysters, which were brought as I was unbuttoning my pants.... :P\n\nAll in all, there are definitely some solid dishes.

S"Dude, anyone who says that the quality of the food at Bacchanal does not match the steep price of entrance is a VERY confused and disturbed child. The quality and creativity of the foods available at this buffet completely puts other casino buffets to shame. Because every dish is made in small batches and constantly replaced, the quality and freshness is never compromised for any guest. \n\nTheir seafood station is an absolute dream for any true seafood lover. They have huge fresh oysters, incredible smoked trout, and a gazpacho with crab that's toe-curling good.\n\nThe gourmet and impressively fresh salad and vegetable selections won both my dining partner and I over. I highly suggest that you grab the chicken and waffles as well. I didn't eat the waffles as I only grabbed the dish because I was in the mood for fried chicken. The Bacchanal makes good fried chicken that didn't leave an oily residue on my finger tips at all! It was crisp, juicy, and everything I wanted out of fried chicken.\n\nAnd as other reviewers have raved, the dessert station is something you just need to see and experience for yourself. Stupendous, top notch selection! They have green tea cookies, chocolate cookies, espresso tarts, mousses, cheese cakes, cupcakes, cake pops, everything! Usually when I go to buffets I'm not one to gorge myself and I usually just stop eating when I'm comfortably full (I know, I'm unusual..) but the Caesar's Palace made me want to leave a little bit overstuffed and I feel great about it."

S'So I come here on my birthday thinking it\'s the best Buffet in town. (A little pricey for me  )but it\'s NOT! Well the food was good. The false advertisement took me by surprise. I called the Buffet around 6 pm to make sure they had snow, king and stone crab and the Buffet said they sure did. For $50 per person I thought that was great. So decided to try. Side note I\'ve been going to the Bellagio Buffet for $29 mon - thurs & get a king and snow crab. They have it complete separated. Ok now back to Bacchanal Buffet. I ask the chef at the crab station where the stone crab was and he looked at me like I was crazy. He said we don\'t have stone crab and the king crab is mixed with the snow crab. It was like looking for a needle in a hay stack. Started out disappointed. Talked to the front person seating guests and they apologized for not having stone and assured me they have not had it or ever had it and that king was not really available. They said "Michelle" the manager on duty would come over to my table and explain. Well "Michelle" never came. The front lady came again to my table & apologized for Michelle not coming and said would have the main dinning restaurant serve me some king crab. So they did. And it was good. But the quality of the king crab was no where near as large or tasteful as the Bellagio Buffet for less money. I\'m not coming back here for this price.., rather go elsewhere!'

S'Oh how I wanted to give this place a GREAT review with 5 stars. But I\'d simply be buying into the hype of this buffet if I did that. \nPros: the meat/BBQ section, the home made soups, the different Asian cuisine and the amazing presentation \nCons: the seafood, the price, the wait, the hype \nLet me elaborate! When I first heard of this buffet, I seen it advertised for $25 with a list of items including souffl\xc3\xa9 and king crab. Neither of which were offered the day I came, nor was the price $25. I wasn\'t too worried about the cost, if it was up to par. \nThere was a wide seafood variety and I\'m sure many will not like that I seen this section as a "con"  but IMO, if you offer King, then don\'t have it, at very minimum offer steamed snow crab! There were oyster shooters, clam bakes, and different variety shrimp, salmon and halibut. None of it blew me away. \nI luckily arrived at around 5pm, in about the 3rd week of opening, so I personally did not experience the crazy wait times others have mentioned. Buying a line pass on top of an overpriced meal just doesn\'t float my boat. \nAnyways, on to the good. \nThe BBQ section was on point, and I loved tht they offered lamb. I also remember seeing duck at one section as well. Nice variety. \nThe desserts tasted homemade, although I was disappointed in no souffl\xc3\xa9. I had a handmade crepe with fresh made whip cream & strawberries and it was ideal. I also had creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, and cheesecake lollipops that finished my meal perfectly. \nThis place wasn\'t bad by anymeans. I\'m sure tourist of all over will absolutely love it here. But for a born n raised vegas foodie, it just didn\'t do it for me. But hey, neither did wicked spoon and it was voted best in vegas! Maybe buffets just aren\'t my forte :)'

S"I felt like this buffet was mediocre at best. The chinese section isnt even worth mentioning. I think I'd rather eat panda express. Seriously. The meat selections were so dry and reminiscentof other typical buffets. The Desert section is decent. The best part of this buffet is the King Crab Legs and the shrimp. But if you think about it, It is pretty hard to screw that up considering they just buy it in bulk and freeze em. For the same price and less wait time, you would have a better experience at the M buffet."

S"This is an awesome buffet. We had dinner here and it was great. Line was long and it was getting close to closing time so watch that because they will stop bringing out new food. The chefs work each of their stations so you can ask them about anything they are serving. It's all made right in front of you. Seafood station had nice big shrimp. Crab legs were small and not much meat. The meats were good especially the sliders. Mashed potatoes and fried broccoli with cheese were my favorites. Italian station was Ok. Lots of cut meat and cheese but I didn't try. Japanese station was good with sushi and pepper beef being my favorite. They desserts are amazing. Cheesecake lollipops and the gelato were awesome. We tried the Bellagio buffet the next day for lunch and it doesn't even compare to this one."

S"Can I say jaw dropping, salivating mouth and let me stuff my face with endless delightful, good looking and grand variety of feastful food!?!  \n\nYES and most definitely YES!\n\nWhile my girlfriends and I were walking to the table that the hostess was directing us to, I was looking left and right on what the whole buffet place had to offer!  While at it, pre-determining on what to get! \n\nMy eyes were on the savory selections of meat and seafood haven side!  I loved the prime rib, lamb chops, garlic string beans, king's crab legs (were a bit on the salty side), shrimp and oxtail broth with topped green onions served up on the side!  Those were to name some of the highlighted favorites that night!  Don't get the creamy mussels and clams!  A few had a bit of crunch sand to it and I felt like my tooth chipped a little from the grinding of it!  Their oysters didn't look fresh, so I didn't get that.  I dislike the grogginess down the throat when swallowing raw oysters that are not freshly shelled!\n\nI did leave space for macarons!  My all time favorite dessert!  They had ice cream, creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e and more!\n\nIf you are unlike me with carnivor-ing, seafood-ing, then I would suggest the salad bar, dim sum, sushi, tacos and/or pasta bar!\n\nI would say one of the best buffet (costed $65, it better be) quality restaurants - especially in Vegas!  I also do like the machines that take your reservations so you won't have to wait.  It didn't give us a concise estimate wait time because it over estimated from 90 minutes to an actual 20 minute wait time frame.  A margin difference, I would say. \n\nI would surely be back for more nom-ing, nonetheless!"

S'The name of the game here is excess, folks. I mean, it is called the BACCHANAL BUFFET. If you don\'t hate yourself at the end of the meal, you didn\'t do the place justice. \n\nMy motto is "come for lunch; stay for dinner," and that is exactly what my group and I did, for three hours on a friday afternoon. \n\nBacchanal highlights: \n*My bro and his wife loved the burger sliders. They said it was the best thing they had there.\n*I really enjoyed the congee. It was freaking amazing!\n*Macaroons were a-freaking-mazing!\n*Charcuterie was great. Wonderful selection of meats, cheeses, dried fruits & nuts. They could add some more bread and cracker type things. \n\nBacchanal MISSES: \nOYSTERS were disappointing. They were sandy & icky. Come on now, Caesar\'s. \nCRAB was also disappointing. They had them pre-cut & sliced down the middle, and sitting in big pots of what seems like just plain water. Crab came out really bland-tasting.\nSERVICE was hit or miss. The lady we had at first was rarely there. When it was time for her shift to end, she came over, opened the check presenter (i ordered wine and paid at the table) to, i assume, see if i included her tip, and when she saw that there was no tip in there, said, "I\'m off in ten minutes," and handed it back to me. After I put her tip in there, she disappeared! I had to hail a random person to ask if I could get plates cleared. \n\nTip: Am glad I came for lunch instead of dinner that friday. for an extra 20 bucks, dinner came with crab, buckets of mussels & clams, and not much more that couldn\'t be missed. Go for lunch and save yourself some $$ for the tables!\n\n***oh, and they also had mochi, but i saw the person refilling them & they came out of boxes (mikawaya brand)!'

S'Um, yes please! This is now mine and hubs\' favorite buffet in Vegas. Really top notch stuff going on here. We made sure to get here early like around 5-6pm so that we could avoid the lines. They say there\'s a 2 hour limit, but they don\'t really check so if you get there early you can "stay as long as you want". \n\nBefore I start to talk about their delicious food, I\'d like to comment about the service. I saw that a few Yelpers complained about not getting enough attention - no one checked on them or refilled their water. Well, this was not the case for me. The busboy waited on us and was super attentive. It was great that he pitched in since we barely saw our actual waiter. I think our waiter was too busy with all the other tables he was in charge of. Water, tea, and drinks were a plenty for us and our plates were promptly cleared! \n\nThe food. OH THE FOOD! \n\nBefore I grabbed anything I walked around to see what kind of foods they offered. So much of everything. I was impressed with their Asian selection. It\'s not the best, but it\'s a few notches higher than what other buffets offer. Also, their cheese station!! DROOL~ So much seafood! \n\nTo get my money\'s worth, I avoided the Asian, Italian, and Mexican stations! I only hit up the seafood, meat carving, and dessert. I did try some cheese though because I couldn\'t help it. I also got a scoop of veggies just to be healthy. \n\nCrab legs and oysters were fresh. They had some miso glazed seabass which I got several plates of. Really yummy! The lamb chops were really good too. Everything was high quality and well made like you could get at a fine restaurant. \n\nI would probably make a whole meal out of their desserts if I could. Everything I tried was tasty but not overdone. The pandan cake was my favorite. \n\nThis is now a must when I come back to Vegas!\n\nWeekend dinner was $58.'

S'Being the first grand opening weekend, I was surprised by how many people knew about this place even though they didn\'t advertise as much. I only found out because one of the girls in our group read it somewhere from USA Today (Food section)! As we got there, the line was already rows and rows filled so we decided to suck it up and wait the 1.5-2hr wait. When we finally got in, we paid the hefty fee of (45$ each) and got seated. We quickly ordered our drinks and ran to the buffet lines to see this "extensive" menu. I couldn\'t believe my EYES to see SOOO much food available. I made my way towards the seafood area which had snow crab legs to shrimp cocktails and even oysters. After that, I wanted to get some surf & turf so I went to the red meat area which I got my brisket, sausages, prime rib, etc. I thought that would be the end until I saw another room around the corner that had Italian, Asian and even a noodle bar where the chef made fresh Japanese ramen (which is to DIE for and surprisingly very good for a buffet), pho, and udon. This new buffet is literally the land of gluttony and our table was no exception. This buffet did remind me a bit of the Wicked Spoon for their aesthetic designs of their dishes such as their fried chicken and waffle came in vintage baskets and pots. \n\nEven after consuming all these savory dishes, we had to try their dessert menu; There\'s ALWAYS room for dessert! The dessert menu however wasn\'t as extensive as I thought it would be but they had some delicious gelato selection. The one that stood out the most was their strawberry. It literally tasted like the strawberry gelato that I had in Florence, Italy! It was that comparable. They also had macarons, crepes, assorted candies (swedish fish), and tiny cake pops.\n\nMy expectations for Vegas buffet are not that high for 1 main reason: Too much different food doesn\'t equate to good refined food because there\'s too many different options plus when you mass produce food, you skimp out on quality. But rest assured, this buffet offers QUALITY. I\'m just hoping that the quality of the buffet wasn\'t at its best just because it was the opening weekend. I hope this quality is here to STAY!\n\nAnother nice plus was that the President of Caesar\'s sat right behind our table making sure that the buffet was operational at good standards and even greeted our table and introduced himself and bought a round of drinks for us. NOW THAT\'S SERVICE!'

S"Came here based on a recommendation made on Yelp.  This is a new buffet at Caesar's Palace and looks like they spent a pretty penny creating this place.\n\nI waited about 25 mins in line and noticed there were a lot of young 20-something asian kids.    To me that was a good sign as my fellow yellow brothas and sistas and I have similar food tastes (haha generally speaking).\n\nI sampled the goods before I committed to anything and surprisingly a lot of the food I ate was pretty good.\n\nThe woodfired pizzas were actually surprisingly good (I mean who the freak eats pizza at a AYCE buffet?).  I also sampled the prime rib which was cooked well and to my liking.\n\nEven the fried chicken was pretty good.\n\nThe dessert bar is amazing here... you can eat everything from gelato, to cheesecake and they even have freakin jelly bellies!!!\n\nMy fellow asians and I were hoarding the crab legs as well... \n\nThis buffet costs about 49 for lunch and is more expensive than your typical AYCE LV buffet but the quality level is definitely a notch higher than most.\n\nMy only gripe is the crab legs weren't as good as other buffets... just my 2 cents."

S"This place rocks!  17 million dollars spent making this the best buffet on the strip.  I used to joke about Sleazars Palace and the sorry buffet they had called Lago.  \n\nNO MORE!!!  OH my gosh, I am in heaven after eating here.  This is the gold standards of all buffets.  It's a bit pricier but you will know it's for better quality food.  Everything about this place has been redesigned.\n\nSometimes the line is a bit longer but well worth the wait.  There is only a couple of issues i had with the place.  The music a bit too loud.  Why do you dim the lights so dark for dinner?  Too much salt on your St Louis ribs.  Too much salt on some of the dishes.\n\nThe seafood station rocks.  Fresh king crab legs.  Delicious fried chicken.  Great chow mein noodles (a lot of buffets gets this dish wrong).  The Chinese spare ribs are the bomb.  Just like how my mom used to make them.  Noodle station could use some work.  I didn't like the Pho that much and the Udon was so-so.  Maybe you can fix that for me?\n\nI wish I had more time to try this place for breakfast.  My love for buffets has been   rekindled.  Thank you so much Caesars!  Finally, you have a buffet worthy of your casino (the one that Celine built).  You heard our cries for good food and got rid of that Lago. \n\nWe got great service from William.  The dessert bar was out of this world.  Great red velvet cakes, cookies, carrot cake, creps, ice cream, sorbet.  Everything here just looks so good."

S'It\'s already happening...the quality is going down.   Came here on a Tuesday night for dinner around 8:45 pm.  A 15 minute wait to the point of being seated; not bad. My appetite was building as I waited in line looking at the raw bar and the crab legs. I didn\'t get that the last time, because I came for lunch. \n\nWith a bigger crowd than my lunch visit, I got a better feel for the weaknesses of this buffet when it is "packed".  The waiter was far less attentive than last time, he was missing the first 15 minutes after we were seated.  I waited to order our drinks and let my fellow diners go get their food.  However, my husband had a meatball accident...and the waiter brought a rag and club soda.  That was nice although it took him about another 15 minutes to get it.\n\nNow about the buffet...\nAgain I love that for the most part they pre-portion food, so it "grab and move along".  However, the seafood bar is really not set up correctly.  The condiments and sauces are first, then the plates and then seafood.  People waiting in line (and there is always a line at the seafood bar) get down right angry cause it looks like you are cutting in line, but all you want are your condiments.   So about that seafood; I got oysters this time, and they were good but not great.  I guess I like a different type.  The crab legs....holy SALT! And I like salty, but I guess that is how they stop you from taking more than one plate.  So disappointing.\n\nMeats- Impressed they had lamb chops, but they were, unfortunately, well overdone.  The prime rib was also a medium-well done; i prefer it rarer and asked for a med-rare piece but that was the piece I got.  \n\nMexican- I pick here and there.  Taking they carnitas, hot sauces, salsas and guacamole.\n\nItalian/Pizza/Mediterranean-  I don\'t eat any starch, but it looked decent.  Hubby said pizza crust was a bit soggy though.\n\nAsian- yeah. I finally made it this far, but none of it was impressive, but it was decent, better than most take out Chinese. Sushi- generic, but like they still offer it. \n\nHonestly, I think my favorite thing was the salad bar and cheese selection.\n\nI actually walked away this time, not stuffing myself. That is a first. Anyway, I STILL think this is the best buffet on the strip, but I think I won\'t be back unless any out-of-town guest ask to go to a buffet.'

S'We went to Wynn as well, but not nearly as good as here. If I live in Las Vegas, I will be here every weekend. \n\nA great selection of food, especially for my Asian taste. My favorite dishes include ramen noodles, dark-chicken soup and a white fish probably sea bass. But almost all dishes are executed very well. Nothing I saw look generic and each dish can easily go to a restaurant and be served individually. Think about it. It is actually a very high bar for a buffet place. Comparatively, a lot of items from Wynn probably can only be served at buffet or lower end restaurant. The food item options are quite limited as well.

My husband is not so much of a seafood fan and he found it difficult to find food he thought was more than just okay.

S"Le Village Buffet at Paris is le fail. \n\nExpectations weren't that high considering I already knew Wynn, Bellagio, or Studio B buffet would trounce this place any day of the week, even on an off night.\n\nThe breads just sucked, no flavor and questionably stale. Insulting to the French culture to serve bread that just isn't good, and calling themselves Paris Las Vegas. I've had better at Hue Thai and Baguette Cafe. \n\nThe fettuccine alfredo just tasted like watered down alfredo mix. I know this is a buffet, but how can you fail so badly with fettuccine alfredo? The pesto sauce spaghetti helped to redeem them.\n\nThe mussels weren't even remotely fresh, with a strong fishy taste. A sign that it wasn't very fresh. \n\nMy experience was the mussels didn't make me want to chance it with the sushi. I didn't want a dose of lax with my meal. The other person in our group confirmed its suckiness, and he isn't as hard of a reviewer as me.\n\nHalf of the chicken was very moist since it was near the skin, and the other half was dryer than Vegas on a summer day.\n\nOne of the saving grace of the meal was the crepes and waffle station. It amazed me how the chef was just making the crepes with ease. This and the waffles tasted great.\n\nThe first round of prime rib was a little dry. Round 2 and 3 were much better, but they were also very rare. It would make even Dexter faint. I could have loaded up on this all day, but a little too early in the day to do this.\n\nThis place does have snow crab legs and claws, but its such a PITA to eat because they don't crack it open nicely like the Wynn. I'm sure there are people who would have loaded up on this, but it wasn't worth my time.\n\nThe champagne was a poor quality. Don't bother unless you just want the free alcohol. Just go play at the penny slots and get yourself some free drinks instead.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try the desert, but the others in our group says its good.\n\nOur group got a nice cozy and quiet room, but also got a rocky table. We McGuvyer'd it with a bunch of sugar packets on the base of the table.\n\nService from our first waiter just wasn't good. He forgot which drinks we ordered. Carding me for the champagne even though I didn't want any, couldn't even recognize the birthday on my Nevada ID, and still pouring the champagne into my glass even after I said no. Even interrupting our conversation just to pour the champagne in front of my face. Just either walk around to pour the glasses or just take the glass off the table to pour. I know this isn't a 5 star place, but a little common sense goes a long way. Our second waiter was more attentive, clearing our plates in a timely manner and refilling our drinks without asking.\n\nBut $30 for mediocre to below average food for lunch when I can spend a couple of bucks more at the Wynn and get dinner, makes this place already lose a star. Had it been a little less, it would be understandable. \n\nGo to the Studio B buffet if you're coming from SoCal, much better stuff and cheaper prices. Otherwise, spend a little more money for the Bellagio or the Wynn. You're on vacation, spend the extra couple of bucks to get a better meal."

S"You'll first notice the huge hour plus line while walking through the Paris hotel. If you're good with waiting, you'll be presented with a decidedly French themed buffet.\n\nWhat I liked most is that you can get a crepe made in front of you. You'll get a choice between three types, cherry, blueberry and a fruit of the day. I'm a big fan of the cherry variety, so I ordered that. They also have a dark cherry topping you can add along with hazelnut bits. There is a large salad bar area and a slightly smaller dessert section.\n\nI think there might be better options when waiting in line this long for a buffet in Las Vegas. If you like French themed food like crepes, there are a couple of other good dishes here too. Thanks to Caesar's Entertainment Corp for supplying me with a buffet wristband to test a few out.\n\nI would like to try the Champagne Brunch, as others have suggested, which might add an extra star to this buffet."

S'I was very excited to try the Paris Buffet because I heard it was pretty good... but NO GOOD! \n\nFood was very salty. Meat is extremely dry. I didn\'t eat a lot of the stuff on my plate because it just wasn\'t good. The crepe bar was nice, but that\'s a given considering we\'re in "Paris". Very average buffet that I probably would not go to again.\n\nHowever our server was extremely friendly and kind. +1 for that =) I didn\'t think it was worth the price for the dinner buffet.. I would think it\'s better for a lunch/brunch. It\'s probably worth a stop if you buy the Buffet of Buffets (~40 for 24 hour buffet pass at 7 buffets) which is what I did the next day.'

I like how they serve very distinctively different food from different regions and make ALL of it good instead of, say, focusing on one of their main dishes (prime rib) and only making that good. \n\nTheir seafood area is awesome :D ... love love love.\n\nDon't like the long lines however, if you start standing in line after 1:00 PM ... good luck ... haha ...\n\nTheir champagne weekend brunches are definitely worth the wait though!"

I mean, I get it from a practicality standpoint - keep em full - but isn't there a health code violation somewhere in there? I don't get it.\n\nDessert bar looked amazing but I didn't get to try anything because a) it was 1pm and I am not an orca and b) there was nothing glutard-friendly aside from some ice creams and other dairy-esque things that I was not brave enough to try before my drive back to LA.\n\nBetter than most. If you've got time and some options, choose this one. I think I ate like 12 whole sweet potatoes FTW."

S"This past weekend, there was a deal for all Harrah's players card owners...$34.99 for access to 7 of the 8 Harrah's casino buffets.  With that said, the lines were even LONGER than usual, but it's Vegas, the lines for the buffets, except for breakfast are always long.  For some people, people don't like to get up for early morning buffets; probably still recovering from the previous night of partying/gambling/dabauchery :)  \n\nVegas is Vegas; so parking - enough said; and Service - well, it's Vegas, just like with gambling, the house has the edge and it's hit and miss for us patrons :)\n\nSo now onto my FOOD reviews...\n\nVery easy to access(being btwn the walkway to the Bally's and Paris casinos), this is one of my preferred AYCE locations.  The line for this buffet seems to be one of the longer ones; ranging from an hour to 2 1/2 hours long.  Has been rated one of the best buffets around, and the long lines seem to be reflective of that.   Anyway, probably one of the ones I liked better than the other buffets on the same range(btwn the $25-35 buffet range.  It's different when you go to the Bellagio and Wynn buffets...that's like comparing a regular old cherry to a reineer cherry.  Definitely not as many options as the Rio World Buffet, but it has a decent selection.  Skirt steaks and the desserts make this buffet very enjoyable.  I particularly liked the pasta options.  Again, try a little of everything - and you'll find what you like and what you don't like, but I'm sure you'll find something. =)"

A bit biased for breakfast buffet cause I'm a big fan of breakfast buffets. So this review is solely based on breakfast and my bias. \n\nDrink: Juice/milk/coffee/tea. Coffee is disgustingly watered down. \n\nService: Below average. Ask for juice/coffee and plates were cleared a bit slow. Came back to dirty plates after a fresh round. \n\nCrowd: I swear no one eats breakfast buffets but old people and me. That was seriously the crowd. 100 retirees and me (and my girlfriend who I dragged down)."

S"This was my second (and unfortunately final) stop on my tour of Buffets that never really happened (I'll elaborate on my review for the Buffet of Buffets). \n\nAs all of you know I like to get the negative details out of the way first before I talk about how much I love a place so: The line was ridiculous. Granted, I did go on Christmas day (and I thought by doing this I would actually BEAT the crowd. The reason I went out on Christmas instead of staying home was because I wanted to do something different. I always thought most people still prefer to stay at home during the holidays?), but it's really hard for me to say the wait was worth it if the line is almost 3 hours long and I'm not even exactly hungry anymore. Also, this is quite possibly the worst layout of a buffet I have ever seen. There's no obvious exit, most of the tables are placed way too closely to the buffet stations and there's barely any space to maneuver from station to station in the buffet. I really don't think I have ever felt more claustrophobic.\n\nThere, done griping. Anyways this is one of the best buffets I have ever been to. Not gonna lie, when I first looked through the buffet before picking out my food I thought it was going to be disappointing due to the lack of diversity because I'm still kind of under the impression that a buffet is only good if there's loads and loads of international variety. (Unless we're talking about the neighborhood Chinese buffet) I'm accustomed to buffets offering stations for Chinese, Mexican, Sushi, Italian, etc.... so I was really thrown off when I saw this buffet was set up more like a French grocery store. However, once I made myself a plate, I realized that the food was of very good quality. This was basically my introduction to French food, and it's good to see that the legend about French cooking being essentially small pieces of meat swimming in fancy sauces isn't true. There also are some international options if you look (for example, in the grill (or is it rotisserie?) section there's pita bread and hummus next to the beef and lamb slices, so there you go, you can make yourself a gyro). Word of advice: This is definitely not a place to take a vegetarian. I mean, of course the typical buffet is hell for any non-meat eater but other than 2 or 3 big bowls of salad and bread there's pretty much nothing here. \n\nI also fell in love with the crepe section. This was actually my first time having ever eaten a crepe, I've been wanting to try one for a really long time but never seem to get around to it (and it's somewhat hard to find a place that makes them in Vegas to begin with) and it was SO good. I got a strawberry filled one with powdered sugar and caramel syrup on top. I so would have grabbed another one if I didn't mind feeling like a masochist, but alas, I'm getting more self-conscious about my weight these days. Oh well. \n\nSo basically this is not a buffet to go to if you're looking for variety in a non-specific sense, but it's a very high quality one regardless, I'll go as far to say it's even better than the Bellagio, and at regular price it's about $15 less. I would go here again just for the crepes. Just remember to get here shortly before or right after each meal has begun and definitely don't go during a really busy time such as a holiday or else you will practically have to get in line on the bridge to Bally's."

S"God, what happened to the Paris buffet? This used to be my favorite 10 years ago and on Sunday the food was not even recognizable any longer. Went for breakfast, the deal not so bad, about $35 for two people. The food selection, absolute crap. Don't even bother or waste your time, it was just cafeteria food. The only reason to go is the crepes but even that wasn't great. I saw in another review someone comparing it to Hometown Buffet, that's an insult to Hometown. Ha! Somebody else said Sysco food, and bingo, that's it. I think this whole Buffet of Buffet thing has ruined them. In putting my business acumen to work I would speculate that all the hotels involved in the B of B got together, buy a bulk of food at a nice discount, and then just distribute it amongst themselves. That's why it doesn't stand out and that's why the quality has eroded. The toppings look old for some reason, no better way to describe it. The workers there seem miserable, I don't know exactly why. If a crepe is what you seek, go across the hallway to the crepe baker and save your time waiting in line for this place. Never again, especially after having the Wynn. How sad."

S'Our first "attack" straight off the airplane was a trip to Le Village Buffet as recommended by Christine T.  We arrived in Vegas close to 9AM.  We dropped off our bags at Ballys and proceeded to Paris.  Line was short since it was around 10 when we got there.   I LOVE breakfast, it is my favorite meal of the day!!!\n\nFor some reason, these chefs knew exactly what my favorites are, as if they were cooking for me!!!  LOL! Bacon - nice and crispy, exactly the way I like em, hashbrowns and red potatoes with herbs and stuff - I just have to get them both.  Eggs, scrambled all fluffy!  I could list more, but EVERYTHING was delicious. I mean EVERYTHING, even the COFFEE was brewed perfect! Not too strong or too weak (for me, sometimes the coffee can make or break the breakfast place).. \n\nWhat put me over the top was the made to order crepes!  I ordered a crepe with banana and nutella with drizzled with chocolate syrup. Thinking about it makes me salivate. ha ha\n\nI love the decor of the little town!  I think it is so cute!! Our waitress was very attentive. She knew exactly when to check up on us.\n\nI know there are TONS of buffets in Vegas, but I will have to come back to this one.\n\np.s. dont forget to try the bread and brie (I heard it\'s the BEST) but I forgot at the time (so I\'m writing this now so I won\'t forget next time).  :)'

S"SO DISAPPOINTED. The food was so mediocre. I literally couldn't get some things down my throat .. and I'm extremely easy to please.\n\nFirst off, I have to say their sushi selection is pitiful. They had sushi rolls with a piece of cucumber + rice. No real fish. And a california roll (Avocado so old it was brown). But fine fine.. this is a french buffet.. so lets critique the french food. I think the only thing that was good was the ratatouille, some of thier pasta, quiche, and the shrimp. Otherwise this whole buffet was a disappointed. Food was SO bland. All the food was luke warm and had been sitting out for so long. Most of the times you couldn't even tell what you were scooping up because nothing was labeled!!!\n\nMaybe it was a slow night? It was a Sunday night and there were NO lines and lots of empty tables for a 6pm dinner!!! So I think the food was sitting out for a long time. The most disgusting part was the piles of cold, burnt,  grilled vegetables soaked in oil. \n\nI can say thier desserts were a bit better. But after tasting bouchon's bakery (Venetian) - I  was utterly disappointed.\n\nMe and my friends actually did not eat very much because the quality of food was so sketchy we didn't think it was worth trying\n\nI heard the champagne brunch is good on Sundays. Maybeeeee I will try that. Price wise, one of the cheaper buffets in Vegas. Only $25 for dinner."

S"First buffet I had upon arriving in Sin City.  Keep in mind I am reviewing their breakfast buffet, which was pretty mediocre at best.  The selection was very scarce...I am a person who enjoys variety, and there was not much to choose from during breakfast.\n\nI got in line for the crepes with pretty high expectations, thinking that since this is a breakfast buffet in a Parisian themed hotel and casino, their crepes should be pretty awesome.  But no, I was only met with disappointment after waiting in line for 15 minutes.  I could not believe that a Parisian  themed buffet could not afford FRESH fruits for their crepes.  Are you kidding me?  They were using strawberries soaked in what was probably high fructose oh-so-bad-for-you syrup!  Even the bananas and blueberries were swimming in some kind of syrup.  I ended up only eating about three bites of the entire thing.  What a waste of my time.\n\nSome other things I ate:\n\n- Eggs Benedict: These were the only highlight of my entire breakfast.  They were pretty good, so I ate two.\n- Prime Rib: I've had better. It was very bland and lacking flavor.\n- Roasted Beer: I thought this tasted better than the prim rib.  It was nicely seasoned.\n- Spinach and Cheese Quiche: BLEGH! It was so disgusting and hard when it should've had a nice and flaky crust!  I took one bite and had to force it down my throat.\n\n\nI wish they had a better selection of desserts and sweet pastries, considering it IS a Parisian breakfast.  Maybe I should've gone here for dinner so that I could've tried the amazing Creme Brulee that everyone raves about.  I am a huge sucker for desserts and have a major sweet tooth.  (LOVEEE Creme Brulee!)  Oh, woe is me!"

S"As a proud glutton, here's a tip: come for breakfast at 10:15am and you can stay for lunch.\n\nWhen I go on a trip, first and foremost, I need to know that my tummy is going to be taken care of. I don't give a hoot about scenery, I just want to eat. Maybe it's the Filipino in me, but I need breakfast, snack, lunck, snack, dinner and then after maybe something to tide me over till bedtime. Buffet of Buffets takes care of that and this is our first stop. \n\nWe line up around 10am and it takes about 20 mins to get to the cashier. It's like Disneyland: you wait in line and just when you think you're inside, there's another snake-y line. So we pay and since I have a Total Rewards Card, a) it's cheaper by like $5 and b) I don't get to wear a bracelet all the live long day... you see this, you think it's for a club... no, it's for a buffet... ahahaaa...\n\nOur server is such a nice guy. So happy, so full of life... totally happy to help us get enough coffee, juice, pop (for me) and water... it must have been because he was off soon because another woman who looked really unhappy became our server. Still brought us our stuff, but I felt bad asking her.\n\nI started out with bacon and sausage... I picked up some macaron-y looking things and some yogurt with mangoes. Obviously, the meat was good. Who can screw up bacon? The macaron-y things were wonderful. I got two to start in case they were weird, but they were really crispy chewy with lemon curd in the middle. The mangoes were under ripe. My only complaint. Why can't I find good mango anywhere? Before breakfast was over, I ran and made sure I got a biscuit with country gravy. You wanna do this right? Get a bowl from the yogurt area to allow for maximum gravy on your biscuit without getting it all over your macarons.\n\nThen, the change over! Like a mad dash, all the people in the restaurant clamor to get in line. I have a slice of prime rib. Wow. The meat is cooked to my liking- rare and it's so tender. To go with that, I get some of the truffle mac and cheese. I wish I had gotten more. It's so creamy and the flavour is dare I say, AMAZING! So good. I've googled how to make it, but I don't even want to attempt in case I sully the good memory of this mac and cheese. Of course, I grab more desserts, but this time it's two creme brulees. The sugar was crackly... sometimes at buffets, the tops can be sub-par, but not here. \n\nYum!"

However I have to say that I was disappointed with their range of food.\n\nIn my opinion, they have strange food and when I walked around to fill up my first plate of food; I struggled to find anything that caught my eye. I guess the type of food that they offer is very french/European and not very mainstream. Also the King Crab legs here are very tinsy winsy compared to some of the more popular places in Vegas. When I spotted another table with larger crab legs that I managed to obtain, I asked my waiter. He replied that they have some kind of high rollers card, and it turns out that Paris only serve larger Crab legs to people who gamble a lot. Go figure!.. \n\nI wouldn't dine here again, unless I got the discount coupon that they give when you sign up to be a member of the Casino =)"

S'I have been to Le Village buffet a number of times but it has always been for lunch or dinner.  Today, I met some friends from the East who I was taking hiking at Mount Charleston and we decided to have breakfast here.  It was a good choice.\n\nWe were there when it opened at 7 AM, and we were the first at the omelette/fresh egg station.  I got an omelette made with mushrooms, spinach, jalape\xc3\xb1os, and cheese.  The omelette was quickly done by the cook and it was very good.  I also had a few slices of bacon.  It was not crisp nor limp but somewhere in between.  Now it was time for dessert.\n\nI walked over to the cr\xc3\xa8pe section.  I studied the list of cr\xc3\xa8pes and decided on the second one, the cr\xc3\xa8pe made with fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.  The cook poured the batter, spread it around the griddle with his little cr\xc3\xa8pe plow, evening out the batter so it was a thin pancake on the griddle.  He turned it and then filled it with the fruit listed above.  After folding it expertly, he topped it with some fresh whipped cream and then spread some raspberry coulis on the whipped cream.  The cr\xc3\xa8pe was so hot, the whipped cream slid off as I walked back to the table.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed breakfast here.  Service was good and the individual stations had great choices.  I could go back again and have several completely different things.  \n\nThis is a very strong breakfast buffet!'

S'"A-Ok" if you come on a groupon deal and just want to chow down on some sliced snow crab legs with minimal effort while downing a bottle of wine included in the deal.\n\nThis place used to be on the elite end of buffets a while back alongside Bellagio, but they too have joined the ranks of mediocrity.\n\nThe prime rib was overdone and nothing special (buffet at Aria still has the best buffet prime rib).\n\nThe highlight of the meal would be the crepe station at the end, but forget getting a "savory" crepe that would have cheese meat and veggies as the lady cooking the crepe is in such a rush to get your crepe done and go on to the next, that the cheese inside the crepe hasn\'t melted even 1%...it\'s like eating a fork full of shredded cheese out of a bag at the supermarket...so go for the sweet crepe for dessert and skip the savory as any part of your meal.\n\nEverything else wasn\'t worth mentioning. \n\nThe ambiance is nice but the food has really slipped. I would kick myself for paying full price.'

(Ghetto, huh? =P) They had crepes, eggs, sausages, eggs benedict, waffles, pancakes....very satisfying for those breakfast lovers. I have to admit it is decent for breakfast. The best thing they had there was the Nutella & Banana crepes (you have to special order it from the chef). You have to eat that! \n\nBreakfast lines can be viciously long! Be sure to come early or you may have to wait about an hour to eat!\n\nDo not eat their lunch if you don't have to. There are better buffets like Planet Hollywood's. Dinner was not that great either!

The only different thing I tried which was really good was the grilled vegetables, like tomato and eggplant, and the crepe station. \n\nThe real star of the show here is the desserts. I just don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I didn't actually try out any of them. But luckily the two girls I was with got a collection of some and not only were they pretty, but they looked so good, that it almost convinced me to go up there and get some myself. Trust me, that takes alot! \n\nThe biggest drawback really was the line. We got there on a Sunday at 12 and we waited for almost 45 min to get in the place. Thats ridiculous for a buffet, but I guess thats what you get for having such good desserts."

S"First of all, if you have a smartphone, check in to Paris Casino on Foursquare because you'll get a $5 off voucher to the buffet.  Considering that the buffet is $19 per person, the discount is pretty substantial. \n\nWe went for lunch on a wednesday around 1, and there were no lines.  The cashier lady was nice enough to extend my one $5 off voucher to my boyfriend as well, so we really saved $10 in the end. :) :) :) I WAS SO HAPPY. We thought the buffet would be our splurge meal! \n\nOn to the food... THERE IS SO MUCH FOOD. I know you're only supposed to take a bite of everything the first time around, but I was too distracted by the roast duck. It had some sort of sweet fruit glaze on the outside; I took double helpings-- bad idea. http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6993.jpg\n\nThe shellfish wasn't too great, and I'm a little sad I wasted precious stomach space on them. Focaccia roll? Nice and chewy. Roast mushrooms? Perfectly seasoned. Tri-tip? Nice and pink in the middle. Buffet food is typically pretty meh, but how can you miss out on a Vegas buffet? This was one of the better buffets I've been to during the last 10 years. $15 well spent.\n\nRound 2: http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6996.jpg\nMore mushrooms! Caesar salad + plain romaine (pre-mixed salads are often so heavy on the dressing!), creamed spinach + artichoke (YUM), sole, marinated tomato and mozzarella balls. \n\nMy tips would be to go easy on the pasta, get the duck and roast beef, get veggies (minus the asparagus), and don't get shellfish.  The fish is alright, the mediterranean section's got great sauces (pesto aioli! :D), and SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!\n\nObserve: http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6994.jpg\n\nAnd that's only one side of the dessert island!  I tried a little of several desserts...\nhttp://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6996.jpg\n\nMacarons. So Frenchy and so good! I also heard the creme brulee and custard were good, but I was SO full I couldn't even think about putting creamy, heavy food into my stomach. However, I did squeeze in a little bit of space for a childhood favorite.  The apple crumble was divine-- hello, childhood memories! Paired with a dollop of soft serve, it was fantabulous! http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6998.jpg\n\nThe bf and I were stuffed for the rest of the day; we made use of a groupon on our way home, but took home most of the food. I legitimately thought I was going to die of fullness. Standing up straight was definitely an issue, but boy am I glad I went to Le Village! I did a little research beforehand on best buffets on the Strip, but ended up choosing Village over Bellagio due to the reviews for the dessert bar. ;) Sweet tooth win."

S'I could eat crepes in this little parisian village all day long! \n\nMy two favorite things about this buffet:  the crepe station and the atmosphere.\n\nI\'ve eaten here twice, but the first time was on the last day of my bachelorette party years ago and I don\'t remember a whole lot... ;)  This last time we went during our Buffet of Buffets experience (which I promise I\'ll review...soon) and I\'d have to say it was my favorite buffet of them all.\n\nWe went for breakfast and I\'m not a big breakfast person, so they had already started off at a disadvantage through no fault of their own!  We stood in line for a good while but once we got close to being seated and I could take in the full effect of the ambiance, my mood transformed!  How cute IS this place?!  The food is set up at little village "cafes" where you can choose from the selection of food.  We were seated in a little "cottage" off to the side...adorable.\n\nThe food selection ranged from your basic breakfast buffet foods...eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, various types of potatoes etc.  There was an omelette bar, which I did not take advantage of because I was quite happy with my egg, mushroom, tomato scramble.  After my first plate of "typical" breakfast choices, I headed straight for the crepe station.  The line was substantial (I started to worry our server would clear our table thinking we\'d left), but I was entertained by watching the crepes being made (now that\'s a talent I\'d like to master!).  There are many choices...to make it easy to order, they organized the menu into savory (hearty meal-like) and sweet (more dessert-like).  You can also customize your order if none of the menu items tickle your fancy.  I went with the fruity berry one and my husband went with the banana and Nutella one.  Both were magnificently delicious!  Pretty too!  I\'ll have to search for some pics that I took...\n\nOur service was decent.  Honestly, I was up and down so much getting food I didn\'t really have much need for anything.  She kept my juice replenished and I have no complaints.\n\nThe real experience was just the summation of it all.  It\'s hard to put my finger on it...but I felt a certain degree of "special" from this place...and that\'s why it gets the 5 stars from me.'

My favorites were the breads, the lamb, the creme brulee, the chocolate rimmed ice cream cones, the crab legs, the salad, the goat cheese, and last but not leas the Hummus! Yeah, I know, you say who eats hummus at a buffet?  Well, this was the best hummus I have ever had, and I don't even like hummus, AND I'm Greek...so there...eat hummus at this buffet.  I went here 2 days in a row, I don't usually do buffet twice in a weekend but my friend wanted to.  The first time we went for friday night dinner there was no line and I paid about $20 cause I got 5$ off from a reciept that I had from lunch at the hotel that day.  Saturday and Sunday they have champagne brunch even though they don't really advertise it...$26...and the line was huge.

I used to like this place because they had some pretty high-quality and tasty dishes but during this last visit, everything seemed to have gone downhill.  Maybe it's due to the economy but you can definitely tell that quality has been sacrificed.  The meat you get from the carving table was dry and tough.  Presentation of dishes were a mess since food was strewn all over the place and nobody seemed to care about cleaning the little messes.  Oh and the crab.... Such horror...  I didn't even dare to touch it because they were gray in color and looked like they've been refrozen multiple times.  Such a shame because this used to be one of my favorite buffets."

Soon after, we were seated at a table with no silverware and no one taking our drink orders. When we asked for assistance, Mindy came to the rescue.\n\nShe is a doll of a person, a happy-go-lucky lady with the swagger of a G6, sashaying through the tables with her trusty bottle of champagne. Thankfully, she didn't mind that I would finish the champagne before she finished refilling the table, thus getting second helpings.\n\nThe food was top-notch. I died on crab legs. Their sausage was so good too, as is their chicken, duck, buttered broccoli, and mashed potatoes. Skip the french onion soup. It looked gross and tasted bland.\n\nHowever, the hat is tipped to Mindy.\n\nThank you Mindy for encouraging us to get the most bang for our buck when it came to 3:30 and the last round of champagne has come. Your Grace Kelly charm and Tina Fey wit was not unnoticed, as well as all the strings you pulled to make our buffet experience beyond all buffet experiences.\n\nThat little extra effort makes all the difference, and the $$$ in tips.\n\nThough I have thus returned back to my suburban enclave, I've left my heart in Las Vegas.\n\nJe t'embrasse"

(we were leaving that day)  all the buffets i called prior to calling paris only served them with dinner.  when i called paris to see whether they had crab legs for breakfast or lunch, i was told that they don\'t.  then i asked what time the crab legs came out (because i really wanted to eat at paris before leaving)  and lorenz said they came out at 11:30 or so.  \n\nME:  "Um, i thought you said they weren\'t served for breakfast or lunch."\nLORENZ:  "They\'re not.  king crab legs are served during brunch"\n\nREALLY?  are we playing word games here?  \n\nbasically, had i not asked what time the crab legs came out, i wouldn\'t have known, and we would have eaten elsewhere.\n\nwhat an arse'

We made it suffice for 3 meals!\n\nParis buffet was the second we went to - the wait in line was okay, but as a few of us girls were on a time restraint to make it to Tao so we only got to eat for like 15-20 minutes once we got seated. It wasn\'t much of a problem as we were all not too hungry having had Caesars Palace buffet earlier for lunch.\n\nIt\'s pretty cute that the employees are dressed up in accordance to the theme of the restaurant.

S'The Paris lunch buffet is awesome and one of the best in Vegas.  If not for the Wynn, I would have named this buffet as the best in Vegas.  I love their set-up and how they cateorize each section by the different areas of France.  Being able to sit in a "village" setting under a faux blue sky was nice, but I think that they could have increased the lighting since it seemed a bit dark.  \n\nIt was my first time there and I had some things not usually found at other casino buffets.  They had a really delicious roast duck with a sweet glaze...it was just the tiniest bit dry, but it was still good enough that I had two breast pieces and a leg.  I also liked their salmon in the creamy leek sauce.  The salmon skin was crisp on top and it was surprisingly tender in the center.  Unlike many other buffets, the salmon was not dry and over-cooked.  The best dish out of the entire buffet, though, was the mussels in saffron sauce, which was amazingly good.  Even with all the food I had just eaten, I had two full bowls of these mussels.  Dip the sauce with their fresh bread (yes, its the cardinal rule of buffets to not fill up on carbs, but the bread here, was fresh and delicious) and its out of this world.      \n\nI also liked their fresh crepe station, though I wished that they had savory as well as sweet fillings.  Strawberries and bananas were missing as filling options (though they did have blueberries and some really gross, gooey apple filling), though they were VERY generous with their nutella.  Having a nutella crepe with whipped cream and slivered almonds on top was the best way to end a meal here.\n\nI can\'t remember the dessert section too much, since my dessert consisted of the crepe.  I think I might have had some creme brulee there, but it wasn\'t anything that stood out in my mind.  \n\nOverall, an excellent buffet.  Service was good, though a little slow.  The line wasn\'t too long when we went and we were seated fairly quickly.  Le Village Buffet has a good selection of interesting foods and its definitely one of the buffets I\'d return to!'

S'I came to Bachi Burger after seeing many great reviews, and some not so great reviews.  Bachi Burger proved to be a great restaurant, with very unique features that make it better than the average restaurant.  \nI actually went out on a limb and took some friends from out of town to Bachi Burger to show them some unique, but still familiar food in Las Vegas.  \nWe started with the sausage plate, fried chili chicken, and the truffl-parmesan fries.  The sausage plate had two types of sausage, both good, but not great; one of the sausages made from kurobuta pork.  Both had great texture, but the flavor was good, but very traditional.  The fried chili chicken was the best appetizer we had, and the chili-garlic sauce was what made it so special.  The chicken was lightly breaded, fried, and coated with a light chili sauce.  The sauce was a little spicy, but the dominant flavor is toasted garlic.  The truffle-parmesan fries were very good, and were served with a porcini mushroom cream on top.  It is also served with a creamy dipping sauce that is very good.  Maybe a little more truffle would have made it better, but the fries were very good nonetheless.  \n\nFor entrees, we had the Rhonin Burger, the Kiki Burger, and the Steamed Duck Buns.  \nThe Rhonin Burger was very good, served with a soy glaze, asian style cole slaw, and a very good yuzu-citrus aioli.  The yuzu aioli made this very unique, and brought great acidity to the burger, balancing the boldness of the soy.   \nThe Kiki Burger was the best thing, served with two types of mushrooms, and a garlic-chile aioli.  This was the best overall because it worked best together as a burger.  Each bite had layers of flavor, and got better each bite.  \nThe Steamed Duck Buns were also very good, with the Duck being the highlight of this dish.  The Duck was very moist and flavorful, and worked well with the five-spice hoi sin, boiled egg, and soft steamed buns.  \nWe tried the Junmai cold sake, and was very impressed with how it went with the food.  Red wine would also go very well with the burgers, and they said that they will serve it very soon.  The thai iced tea was pretty good, but the texture seemed watered down.  A very minor flaw in a overall great meal.  \nFor dessert, we got the Walnut Bread Puding, which was served hot, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  They said they had their own pastry chef make everything fresh daily, and you could tell.  The bread pudding was soft, and very flavorful, and worked perfect with the crunch of the toasted walnuts.  Great dish!\nOverall, the flavors that Bachi Burger has in all of the dishes we had were very unique, and worked perfectly.  It is very affordable for the food you get, and it a must try for anyone who lives in Las Vegas.'

S'Well... this didn\'t start off on quite the right foot. We arrived at 10p on a Saturday night. Upon walking in, we noticed that there was plenty of seating around, so we didn\'t expect to wait- and we didn\'t. However, the host sat us at the first table, right by the door, crammed against the wall with a view of the host stand. Um...\nSo, we asked if we could be moved. We were, to the back of the restaurant. Only slightly better. This wasn\'t going well... The whole seating situation there is a bit of a CF, though, all of the "booth" dining is WAY too close together, which we found out when a group of rather large individuals were crammed right next to us (and as a reminder, there were plenty of tables available).\n\nOkay... lets move past that. The service overall was fine enough, although we ended up having two servers because one took his break while we were dining. \n\nThe food.... Not bad. The truffle parmesean fries were delicious! I ordered the "Kiki\'s" burger and was overall pleased with it, it had a lot of flavor, was juicy, and I loved the bread, but the sweet onion marmalade overwhelmed the burger. I could barely taste the mushrooms, and couldn\'t taste the egg or cheese at all.\n\nSo, all in all, it was pretty close to a 2 star review, but I\'m feeling a bit generous.

S"Can you say over rated. I have noticed any place that's featured on a tv show like diners  dives and drive ins is avoid. The restaurant was busy and waited about 20 min during lunch rush. I didn't like the place as soon as I walked in. It felt like a night club with the music blaring. I don't mind some mood music but when I have to shout to have a conversation then there's a problem. \n\nLet's get to the food, ordered the oxtail chili with very little meat for $15 it was decent but not $15 good for some fries and chilli.\n\nThere was three of us and we all ordered different burgers. The problem with the fish burger was that the fish fell apart as you ate the burger so the fish was basically falling off the buns. The mr ho burger had way too much sauce on it and my grandma couldn't eat it. The problem with these burgers were that they were way to busy, multiple sauces that conflict with the burger itself. \nI felt for the price the burger could have been bigger. Lunch for three over $60.\nI also thought their non alcohol specialty drinks were way over priced."

S"So we arrived to vegas a bit late and craved burgers. I've heard good things about bachi burgers and the pictures have always made me drool. Finally we got to try it and I wasn't disappointed!\n\nI'm not sure why so many people had such bad service, but we must've came on a good night. The service was great for us and the guy was really funny. \n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries - Definitely loaded w/ black truffle flavor! It was enough to share between the 4 of us. Nice and crispy, not oily at all\n\nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Their most popular item, presented beautifully! The over easy egg on top made everything delicious. Again, fries were cooked perfectly crispy, but I do wish they added more oxtail. Not that the fries were bad, but I actually prefer the truffle fries.\n\nShogun Burger - $25 for a burger?! My bf ordered this and I got to steal 1/4 of it. It sounded like the ultimate most delicious burger ever w/ all the ingredients listed: wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, miso butter, peach YUMM. Unfortunately though the flavors were all lost in translation to me. The only thing I could taste the whole time was the unagi...This burger isn't worth $25 imo\n\nKiki burger - I love shrooms! (I know it's vegas, but I'm talking about food here people not the other kind of shroom lol) There were 3 kinds of mushrooms in this burger: shiitake, enoki, and eryngii. Instead of angus beef, I paid extra to get the wagyu beef patty. The caramelized bacon and mushrooms made the burger stand out. This was my 2nd favorite burger\n\nMiyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - My 2nd favorite burger!! Again, that fried egg w/ the oozing yolk made this burger taste its best. The crispy onions & furikake added the extra oomph to it. For first timers I would recommend getting this to start!\n\nSpicy Miso burger - It's not spicy at all. The burger wasn't bad, but flavors didn't pop or stand out compared to Kiki & Miyagi-San.\n\nThe patties here were all requested to be cooked medium rare and they came out good/juicy. I really like the taiwanese sweet buns here which makes the burgers unique. However, after trying Gordon Ramsay's BurGR in PH, I believe the burgers there are a lot better. I wouldn't mind coming back though next time I'm in vegas and craving asian fusion burgers"

S"Tried the following: \n\nRonin burger -- Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, and Yuzu citrus aioli.  Not bad but not spectacular either.  We ordered the meat medium done but it came closer to medium well done.  Personally I think there's too much going on with this burger.  Too many condiments for my liking.  When mixed together, the flavors become confusing and messy.  \n\nMiyagi san burger -- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  Delicious!  The meat was juicy and tender.  The burger was huge because of the layer of crispy onion rings.  Couldn't fit it in my mouth so ate some of the onion rings first.  I'm a fan of onion rings so this was my type of burger.  \n\nOxtail chili cheese fries -- good but nothing special about it.  To me taste pretty much the same as any chili cheese fries, but just with some minced oxtail meat. You could taste a hint of oxtail but for the most part the chili flavor overshadow the oxtail flavor.  \n\nOverall, good burgers.  I I would come again to try other items on their menu.  Next time I'll try the steam bao sandwiches."

S"So tonight was the second night within the week that I have visited Bachi Burger.  \n\nWednesday Night\n-Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries with a fried egg:  one of my friend, Spanky who didn't order any fries, could not stop eating this yummilicious fries.  \n-Ronin Burger-talk about explosive flavors from a bite of this burger...how amazing is this?  Was a very creative and innovative burger.  Spanky, who had ate dinner earlier, had to order this burger because it sounded so freakin awesome.  He down half of that burger in literally 3 bites, AND the burger was a decent size.  I shared this burger with my other friend, since he wasn't too hungry.  However, he said he should have gotten his own burger since it was so good.\n-parmasan truffle fries-I could definitely taste the truffle and the sundried tomato aioli made it so much more better.  We had to order an extra ramkin of this yummy sauce.  It cost .50 cents though.  Sure it doesn't break my bank account, but I think they can easily bring in the bucks with this because it is just that yummy.  But I have to say, the oxtail chili fries made this one forgettable. \n-I end the night with the rootbeer float.  They gave me so much icecream!  nom nom nom...\n\nFriday Night\n-Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries-What can I say...YUMMY.  This alone is quite filling for 2, note to self.\n-Kiki burger:  well, i honestly thought the star of this burger are the different type of mushrooms that are in it.  When we got the burger, i was unable to taste the mushrooms :(  The bacon was overpowering everything else.  Still, a good burger.\n\nService:   Wonderful\nAmbience: Contemporary Nice Feel\nFood:  GGGGREAT!!"

S"Went for Lunch today, Sun, @ 1:30pm. Place was about 1/2 full and there were 3 wait staff working. This is the 2nd time I am here. The first time, I had the Ronin burger. OK, but a bit over the top for me with a bunch of stuff on it. In my past review, I gave it a 3 star. Today, I am going simple. BBQ Bachi Burger, medium, sweet potato fries, and chicken kara-age.\n\nLike the last time, despite the fact that there were 3 wait staff, the service was somewhat slower than at many other restaurants. 3 times, I had to flag the wait staff down to ask for things. -1 star for slow service.\n\nThe Chicken Kara-age came first, average portion for $6. The visual was not what I expected, the kara-age very dark in color and not the golden brown I'm used to seeing, so immediately, I was a bit skeptical. However, it turned out to be pretty good. The color is dark because they seem to marinade the chicken some type of Teriyaki type sauce which is giving it not only the dark color, but a sweet, salty taste as you bite in. It comes with some sort of chili mayo dip which has some kick to it. Not Bad.\n\nThe sweet potato fries and the burger came together. The swee potato fries is one of the best I have had so far. Very tasty. It is sprinkled with what they say is a Kaffir Lime Hawaiian Salt (OK, I never would have known if it was not on the menu) and ground peppers. The sweetness of the potato, the salt, and the pepper gives a nice balance of taste. The yuzu citrus aioli gives you an option of adding a bit of citrus taste to the combo.\n\nThe BBQ Bachi burger was awesome. Done perfectly to medium, with tons of juices flowing. The slight sweetness of the bun goes well with the BBQ burger. By the way BBQ is not the tangy type of BBQ sauce, but rather more the soy type like a Teriyaki BBQ. I prefer this burger over the Ronin that they have.\n\n4 stars this time around for what I had. I wish they would improve on their service."

S"This place is a MUST GO whenever you visit Vegas. I wish they had one in Cali. \n\nMy boyfriend and I always get top notch service here. This is our second time here in two years. They are so tentative and made sure we were happy throughout out meal. \n\nLet's start with the basic. \nOh dear lord. THE BURGERS!!  The first night we touch down on Vegas we came here! Boyfriend and I had the kiki burger and miyagi San burger with a side of salt and pepper fries. Everything was made to perfection. I felt like lord Jesus Christ came down and blessed my burgers. It was truly  amazing. All the ingredient mashed together and made sweet love in my mouth. \n\nThe fries!! We usually get the truffles but the salt and pepper was to die for. With some jalape\xc3\xb1o sprinkled on it? Ingenious. Simply ingenious. And the portions were a hefty amount I wouldn't be surprise if they used an entire ox in my fries... \n\n The last night we were in Vegas we wanted to go out with a bang. So we had the shogun burger with ox tail fries. I personally like the salt and pepper fries but the ox tail was good too for you meat lovers. \n\nPeople probably be like damn girl. You paid 26 dollars for a burger? You bet. And id do it again in a heart beat. \n\nI don't know what they did to their burgers but oh my oh my, your in for a treat. If your in Vegas, you have to try this place!! It's worth every penny. \n\nJackiee approved."

S'I got to say I was not impressed.  My husband and daughters have dined here in the past, but last night was my first experience and it was not good.  We took 6 people there from out of town and it was around 8PM.  We were seated rather quickly and then the troubles began.  My guests ordered the tapioca drinks and the rest of our party ordered beers and cider.  Beers and cider were brought to the table quickly, but halfway into receiving appetizers, tapioca drinks were still missing.  I said something to the server and then a little while later those drinks came out, dripping all over the table and it was quite a mess.  I was stunned that no one in the kitchen had the sense to wipe and clean the glasses off.  On to appetizers.  We ordered shrimp chips, no cigar.  They were out of them.  Truffle fries were just so so.  The Oxtail fries were not the greatest.  The beans were far too raw. I am not talking al dente, rather RAW.  Now come our burgers.  I ordered the Kiki, medium well.  It so happens I get the mid rare. When the overly zealous manager came to check on how everything was I showed him my not so cooked burger.  He took it away.  15 minutes later, everyone else at the table was done eating and my burger appears.  Not a newly fired one, but the one I took a bite out of.  I thought they should have redone my order, not try to recook it.  All in all, I was very disappointed and somewhat embarrassed taking some very important people there.  And, our tab was in excess of $120, which, in my opinion, is a little pricey for what we got.'

S'I\'ve been here before and had the Shogun burger and Oxtail chili cheese fries. I Remember both being so incredibly AWESOME I had to come back, so we did.\nMy wife and myself weren\'t all that terribly hungry, but it was kind of a "to do" list on the way back from Vegas.\n\nWe walk in at about 10pm on a Thursday night. It\'s slow and there\'s a lot of staff on hand. We get seated by a guy who seems entirely indifferent about his job and just life in general. You may be wondering how I know this about a simple \nhost /  hostess???? Because he was our waiter also. There were TOO many people working and only two other tables seated to get bad service. Not that bad service is ever excusable, but there are times when you understand to some degree. \n\nLike I said, we weren\'t that hungry so we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and a side salad; which sounded decent in the description. Micro greens, some kind of walnuts, avocado, and an orange vinaigrette. \n\nThe fries come out first and the first thing I notice was the fries to chili ratio. Way off. Too much fries and not enough chili. Not a big deal cause there\'s no way we\'re finishing them. We start to dig in and holy crap is there a TON of salt on there. Enough salt to start my own mine if i was feeling  entrepreneur-ish. We didn\'t complain because fries don\'t save well and we were already full.\n\nThe house salad then comes out. Being a MAN, I feel a certain sense of obligation to conquer this small salad, even though i already feel like a glutton (first world problems, I know). So I take a bite.....  GOD DAMN!!!! Did a salt grenade go off in the back or something? Not only were the fries too salty, but the salad? Maybe someone in the back just discovered how great salt can be and was of the mindset "more is obviously better"? Enough about salt. The orange  vinaigrette was good. The avocado was pretty much non existent (two small chunks), but the walnuts were delicious.\n\nMaybe my memory deceives me, but i could have sworn I LOVED this place when I came about a year ago. Bachi has a unique twist on the whole burger thing, but that twist isn\'t good enough to keep me coming back'

S"My friend Kevin told me about Bachi Burger when he was last here.  He said it was worth the drive of going all the way to the Southeast part of town.  Got here on a weekday lunch after 1pm and the place was still pretty packed.  I guess these must be the employees of the local companies.  Decor-wise, the place is very minimalist, a few paintings of Japanese theme to set the mood with white walls and standard track lighting.  \n\nI got the Ronin burger, parmesan fries, and the iced matcha green tea.  From least favorite, the matcha green tea was not sweetened and I didn't really get a strong matcha taste when drinking it.  It just tasted different as the tea I got from formal Japanese restaurants.  As for the Ronin burger, it was polished off...quickly!  The slaw, egg, and the burger really mixed well.  The only thing I wished for was maybe for a crispier bun.  The bun was a fresh, soft, warm bun but if I do come back here, I may ask them to toast my bun if possible.  The parmesan fries were also great!  I didn't even need the ketchup looking sauce that came with.  I did try it and the sauce really didn't help to enhance the flavors of the fries. \n\nExcept for a few things that I nitpick about, I'm ready to sign up to Bachi Burger's fan club.  They have a large beer list but all of them are bottles including Hitachino which has been a favorite of mine lately.  Lastly, the prices are a bit on the pricy side but the quality and the uniqueness of their product is worth it in my opinion.\n\nMemo to Bachi Burger owners:  any chance of coming out to the SF Bay Area to open a branch?"

S'To ALL burger buffs, meat hounds, Asian flavor fanatics, diner devotees and to just-plain ol\' hungry human beings:\n\nI dedicate this experience to you all!\n\nIt all started one cold Saturday evening in February 2014 when the bf and I decided to pop our Bachi Burger cherry. Wait time: 25-30 minutes. Though medium-to-large groups lingered in and around the restaurant, these groups were diminishing at a pretty impressive pace. Names were being called from left to right. It didn\'t take long until the hostess finally said what I\'ve been yearning to hear for the past half hour..."Rachel."\n\nOnce seated, the menus eagerly flipped open and the bf and I were enticed to such great heights. The selection of starters and burgers were bountiful but after careful consideration the lucky winners went as followed:\n\nOx-tail chili cheese fries:\nThis appetizer should be a REQUIREMENT when dining here. A large, hot plate stacked with crispy thin fries immersed in generous amounts of salty and savory chili, shredded ox-tail AND crowned with a perfectly fried egg--tell me what\'s not to like? This portion is perfect for 2 adults with a tenacious appetite.\n\nKiki burger (my choice):\nI knew this burger was calling to me when I first read caramelized bacon and sweet onion marmalade. The words \'caramelized\' and \'sweet\' being the major deal breakers. Unfortunately, that\'s where the courtship between Kiki and I comes to an end. Though the meat patty excelled in juiciness and the bacon maintained its candied glaze, it fell short elsewhere. I was underwhelmed by the not-so-sweet-non-existent-taste-of-onion marmalade and the slight bitterness of the greens. But it wasn\'t a total fail for my appetite. Like a short-lived romance with an ex--we shared some good moments and also some bad--but in the end, I never really saw any great potential. Kiki just wasn\'t meant for me.\n\nRonin burger (the bf\'s choice):\nAny burger with a fried egg is pretty much en route to the bf\'s belly. There\'s no way he\'s going to let it slip on by. The only problem with this burger was that it was HIS and not mine. We cut both our burgers in half and traded so we could sample each others but deep-down inside as soon as I sunk my teeth into this burger I was hooked. Ronin grabbed a hold of my taste buds and never wanted to let go. It was love at first bite. So many wonderful things were happening in my mouth that made it nearly impossible to ingest. An orchestra of flavors and textures that was beautifully executing a rhapsody. I wanted to salvage the juiciness of the meat, the sweetness of the caramelized onions, the tang and crunch of the coleslaw and even the saltiness of the fried egg. Bravo Ronin. Bravo!\n\nIf my experience doesn\'t make you want to feed the beast then you\'re completely and utterly missing out. Bachi Burger is a MUST try when in Vegas. Their Asian-fusion/Asian-inspired take on the classical American burger is pure genius.\n\nDon\'t believe me? Then just listen to what your inner soul is saying because I\'m pretty sure it sounds something like this...\n\nGO. TO. BACHI BURGER.\n\nNOW!'

One thing they are famous for is their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and it is delicious! The meat is well cooked and it serves as a great appetizer. The next thing to get is their burgers. I've tried their Ronin Burger and the Miyagi-San Burger and they are also cooked to your liking and tastes very good.

S'Disappointed seeing grown men argue and the mistreatment of employees!\n\nI was initially excited to watch the 3D episode talking about this spot and the same feeling followed me as I was on my way to the spot too but after I parked the car and was seated within 4 minutes flat it all came to a screeching halt! - I visited the spot with 2 others in which they also saw what I saw and felt awkward for being our first visit and after viewing the same episode on TV. together and venturing from Los Angeles.\n\nHere is the stressed out drama that we encountered.\nWe arrived, greeted, seated, handed the menu, offered choices all going smooth with a smile from our server. Our server was "Lisa" she was very nice, very intoned with us and very affected by the experience we and many others were forced to watch while sitting in front of the kitchen/podium area, after placing our order for the same dishes that Guy Fieri featured on 3D we had our beer served up and then boom! "The Stressed Out Drama" - While sipping on our beer we encountered a tall Caucasian cook yelling at another gentlemen on the opposite side about doing their job right but what struck us as weird was watching one of them being handled to a back room because it started to get loud and some cuss words. We later found out that the people involved were the actual owners/partners of the spot, very disappointing to experience for being our first time.\n\nAfter the experience we all decided to leave but your waitress, Lisa talked us down and asked us to stay and apologized for the experience and in seconds brought over our order, and although she seemed bothered about what had happened with them she still gave a wonderful smile.\n\nI gave your location a two stars and these are the reasons why:\nYes, you have a wonderful The "Banh-Mi" Burger, wonderful Truffle Parmesan Fries w/ Sundried Tomato Aioli & Drizzled Porcini Cream Sauce and a knock out Duroc Pork Belly Steamed Buns with Hoisin BBQ Sauce, would\'ve been better with a Blue Moon beer but you were out that day but all in all, the food was phenomenal, hands down!\n\nI gave you the second star because of your server Lisa, she shined like a star 100% when you couldn\'t.\n\nNOTE: to the Owners/Managers\nmy tiny group and I agree that although you have problems no matter how big, never! bring them to the spot and especially never! demonstrate to your patrons how negative, ignorant and disrespectful you can be towards one another and your employees not to mention the children present. You guys have wonderful food, don\'t taint it by your actions.\n\nI hate doing reviews like this because I know you work hard to be top restaurant in your genre - I attempted to speak with you face to face but that went unanswered. Good Luck in your future ventures.'

Packed with major flavor and super exquisite! I highly recommend getting a taste of this one.\n\nWe also ordered the Crusty Crab and Kalbi Burger. Both which were tasty as well.  I loved the authentic crab on the Crusty Crab and the sauce on the Kalbi Burger.  We went with the eggnog creme brulee with gingerbread cookie.  There were comments of the rum flavor being strong, but I hardly tasted it.  The gingerbread man cookie was cool with powdered sugar on it and tasted perfect.  They also featured a treat all the way from Hawai'i called the Tako Toffee.  It's toffee with a thin layer chocolate and almonds.\n\nAnother great experience at Bachi deserves another 5 star rating!"

S'I\'ve been looking forward to coming here since I made plans to go to Las Vegas a couple of months ago. Since I\'ve been waiting for so long, my expectation has been building up so high. When I get to the restaurant it\'s anti-climactic. Not today, Not here. \n\nYou can smell the burgers from the parking lot. If the smell is half what it taste like, I was going to be happy. It was and more. \n\nWe got here at 3pm on A Thursday, only a few customers were present. We got seated immediately. \n\nHere\'s the rundown:\nGrilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage - delicious, almost like a JapaDog but skinnier and smaller. It was served with some whole grain honey mustard, perfect pairing. Yum!!\n\nPork Belly Steamed Buns - OMG Delicious. You get 3 per order. The steamed bun was airy. The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. Hoisin sauce made for a perfect little bite. My only quibble would be the boiled egg, which didn\'t add anything to the dish. A sunny side up quail egg would have been just over the top good on this, but that\'s just my take on it. It\'s still a very very good dish. \n\nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries - another winner. A huge portion of perfectly cooked fries (crunchy outside, soft inside) topped with Garlic Aioli, Stewed Oxtail and a Fried Egg. The oxtail by itself was so good, but adding everything else was just superb. Must order for sure. \n\nShogun Burger - talk about a decadent burger. The burger is made with Wagyu Beef topped with Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach & Arugula. It was salty, sweet, bitter, peppery, savory deliciousness. Is this what they call "Umami" if not I have a word for it "Delicious!!" It\'s got a hefty price tag, but well worth it. \n\nMy son had the Grilled Cheese w/ Fries, Carrots and Apple. It was served with a B\xc3\xa9arnaise sauce on the side. My son is a picky eater, but he devoured that grilled cheese. The adults devoured that b\xc3\xa9arnaise sauce, oh so good. Anything with that sauce would be good. \n\nUsually reality out performs our expectations, not in this case. Reality out performed my expectations and it was high to begin with. Incredible meal. \n\n5 Star Plus\nI\'ll definitely be back.'

S"Came here on a Saturday night around 8:30pm, and the place was pretty packed. It's a casual burger joint, with a Japanese twist. We waited about 15 min for our table, there were three of us. After ordering, it did take about 50 minutes for our food. I ordered the Bachi Caesar Salad, and Sweet Potatoe Fries to share. My friend ordered this Pesto Burger and said it was excellent! I can't remember what my third guest ate, but he said he hadn't had a burger that good in a while.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it took 50 minutes to get our food (we noticed, because we were especially hungry that night). Also, our waiter and the water filled guy kept checking in with us to make sure everything was alright.... AFTER WE HAD RECEIVED OUR FOOD.

Some bites were overly sweet, but the mushrooms added a good savory touch. I had the garlic fries--average. They trick you into thinking you're getting an f-ton of fries and you're getting about a handful.\n\nAlso, their hostesses kept seating people directly next to us, too, which was kind of irritating considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Twice the other diners asked to be moved so they weren't joining us for our meal.\n\nI'd have to be dragged back---to me, it's not worth a revisit."

S"This place is home to my new favorite off-strip hamburger in Las Vegas. My husband and I both had the Miyagi-san. He added cheese (Gruyere) to his but I left mine as-is and no additions were necessary. The meat was so flavorful and delicious and the toppings worked together perfectly- the furikake is an awesome touch. The truffle parmesan fries were also crazily delicious; service was friendly and prompt. I can't wait to go back!"

S'The hype on Bachi Burger rose to new levels for me after my friend michael m\'s review of this place showed up as Review of the Day.  So I was expecting great things when we rolled in here yesterday.  \n\nFirst of all, I was surprised that it was Asian-influenced burgers - I thought this was going to be a better version of Fatburger or something.  (Sorry Mike, I didn\'t actually read your review.)  Somewhat skeptical, I ordered the "banh mi" burger and the garlic salt/pepper fries.  I was not disappointed with how tasty it was.\n\nYou can read the multitude of other reviews created by more polished writers than myself to get a sense of the food.  Despite being in a typical Vegas strip mall, the decor makes for a "hey this place is pretty cool"-type meal with friends or maybe a casual date.  There are some nice stylistic touches like the silver cup used for the french fries and pint glasses that have a sold feed to them.  \n\nSuffice to say, I\'ll be back to try the other burgers.'

S"the Kiki burger is fantastic. \n\nshitake mushrooms, greens, nice and squishy bun.. sweetness. i didnt even need ketchup! and i put ketchup on almost everything!!!\n\nthe salt and pepper fries tastes like crab. you know.. the asian crab thats boiled and is seasoned with salt and pepper? exactly that. it was the weirdest thing ever. but delicious. \n\nthis is a gem thats off the strip and is definitely worth the drive.  its not even that far.. but i would highly recommend coming here on your way home from vegas.  \n\nI wasn't even hungry.. but after the first bite, i couldn't stop.. and then the fries!? jeez... so much for trying to get fit and lose weight!!"

I must comment that this restaurant is super.  The waitstaff was more than courteous and accommodating . She explained a lot of the menu and we made our selections based on her selections which were spot on. The burgers were terrific and the salt and pepper fries luscious.  The Arnold Palmer was so so but we weren't there for the drinks anyway. Bachi is well worth your time if you are in Vegas."

I am a sucker for fried eggs on burgers.  Tastes like a fru fru version of Smashburger.  Pretty pricey for a burger but a must try!  Oxtail fries had a tangy bbq taste and very filling.

S"Very unique burgers off the strip. It's very ironic but I usually only come here after late gym sessions since they're open late lol. I am very mixed with this place, there's some items I really love and some items that I really hated.\nI really love the different options and burger combinations but some of them I feel are seasoned weird and kind of a mish mash of flavor. For example, I really didn't enjoy the crusty crab, black & green, or kalbi burger but I seriously LOVED the kiki and ronin burger. All of them were cooked perfectly and looked beautiful but something about those first 3 burger's seasonings were a little off to me.\nTheir truffle parmesan fries and sweet potato fries are alright, both of them are extremely overused in almost all specialty burger restaurants, and they didn't make them in any different way, so nothing special but still tastes good.\nTheir boba was also the worst I've had, very grainy with hard tapioca pearls, however their red velvet drink is quite amazing! \nSo as you can see, I'm very split, so three stars!"

S"I guess since I'm the Duke of Bachi Burger (as of 9/11/2014) I should relinquish my duties as Duke, whatever those might be, to finally write a review of this place.   It took 60+ visits for me to come on here and officially proclaim: Bachi Burger is the best burger joint in town.\n\nI read all of the 3 star and below reviews and I feel sad for those reviewers.  Not because they don't have good taste, but because they clearly haven't experienced the Bachi that I've come to know and love over the years since it opened.  I will say that even though I am blessing it with 5 stars, I've definitely had moments where I questioned that rating, be it from visits where I experienced awful service, undercooked burgers, or the terrible, terrible practice of their writing down my credit card info every time I make a take-out order.  All of those are forgiven though for me due to the 85% of the time when everything is flawless.\n\nI've had almost everything on the menu.  My absolute favorite order is the Black and Green burger.  When they nail it, they absolutely nail it.   The Wagyu beef, bacon, blue cheese, spinach and mushrooms all form together like Voltron to make one of the best burgers I've ever had.  But there are 70 other reviews where you can read about that.   I also really like the Lonely Bird when I'm not feeling like red meat, which isn't too often.   Miyagi San, Banh-Mi, Ronin, all solid as well and belong in my rotation.   \n\nOne thing I rarely see mentioned or see people take advantage of is the build your own burger feature.  I've actually had several times just a straight up Bachi Burger with a Wagyu patty which comes standard with Lettuce, Tomato and Onion and anything else you want, but it doesn't even need anything else.  It's nice to know that they're not just putting lipstick on a pig, or in this case, a cow, and that the meat can stand on its own.  \n\nI hinted earlier at undercooked burgers and I will say that in my experience Bachi tends to cook on the lower end of the spectrum.   Medium-Rare which is how I would normally like it has come out too rare for me and Medium often comes out the way I'd normally expect Medium-Rare.   So I stick with medium for the most part. \n\nFor fries they do a decent sweet potato fry, and oddly enough I just don't get the hype over the oxtail chili cheese fries even though I've had them 5-6 times, once done over sweet potato fries which I think is a special order type thing.   Fries, oxtail meat, and egg sounds like my death row last meal, but each time I found them underwhelming and prefer to just go the Salt and Pepper Garlic french fry route.   The fries aren't at all what keeps me coming back here and I'd like to see them experiment more with different varieties, but it seems to be the same ones from the first day I went there and I'm guessing that won't change anytime soon.\n\nDrink-wise they do a mean sake sangria which I find irresistible, although pricey and they have Rogue Hazelnut ale, so I'm normally happy either way.   \n\nService can be inconsistent, usually due to how it's ALWAYS BUSY, but there are several very solid individuals who work there at the moment and they treat the Duke with respect, as they should."

S'So I recently completed my 2nd trip to Bachi, this time with the ever-popular Gordon H, and while the restaurant didn\'t change much, it turns out that my opinion did. When I originally sat down to write this update, I thought my overall impression had not changed from my first review, but, as I was writing, things developed a little differently. \n\nFood: This time I had the "That\'s Cheesy" or whatever they call their grilled cheese. It sounded awesome on the menu, but in practice it was maybe so-so. There was a pretty good amount of cheese, and it was made well enough, but it just wasn\'t very tasty. Without a veggie burger on the menu, this is pretty much the only meat-less entree choice - so I definitely couldn\'t bring a vegetarian here. Gordon had the Kikis, and, after an initial wave of too-much-garlic, found it to be enjoyable. \n\nService: The service was better than Yelp might lead you to think. Adorable Waitress was not serving many tables, which is probably a good choice for Bachi overall, but definitely not as far as I\'m concerned. Consequently, we got Generic Asian Waitress. Her service was rendered adequately, but only adequately, and totally devoid of any charm. Say what you want about the flaws of my precious Adorable Waitress, but I\'ll take the more flawed service that comes with some personality over a technically-superior but totally bland serving automaton. Especially at a small, independent restaurant. Which brings me to: \n\nNew conclusion: Bachi totally needs to up their game. Yes, the burgers and fries are pretty damn good. Yes the food is unique. But the decor is generic and effectively-identical to the numerous Asian restaurants we have in town, the service goes from simply horrible to presentable but lifeless, and the prices aren\'t exactly cheap. I already find myself bored with the menu after 2 visits, and there really isn\'t anything else about the place that makes it attractive. One reason I prefer independent establishments is that they FEEL LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT!  Something other than the faceless ownership and bland environs of Chain Food Hell. And when an indie place falters, aspects like cheap prices or awesome service can bolster them. But Bachi lacks nearly all of the positive traits of a small business. Personality? None. Bargains? Zero. Service? Conspicuously lame. So that leaves the food. And while it\'s admittedly good at Bachi, it\'s not *that* good.\n\nPRO-TIP: Another for the establishment. MANAGEMENT: Take a page from your competition and BE PERSONABLE! You\'re a brand new restaurant that only gets by with word of mouth AND you have a unique concept....so why isn\'t the owner or manager greeting customers when they walk in or sit down, introducing himself and the concept for the restaurant? Not only does it help to better sell the place, but it makes it easier to give you the benefit-of-the-doubt when something goes wrong.'

S'Let me just start this review out by saying I love burgers.  Although I enjoy eating salads and tons of veggies I can usually create a reason to go grab a burger at least once a week.  That being said when the opportunity to grab a burger people rave about pops up, I jump on it.  Now I don\'t want you to get the impression that I\'m a burger snob, or a connoisseur of fine burgers.  I just love a great tasting burger that doesn\'t cost an arm and a leg.\nBachi Burger is that and a little more.  What sets this burger apart from other burger joints is its japaneezy flair. Each burger has a good amount of japanese zing that really differentiates itself from its all American counterparts.  One thing I would like to say is that usually when a restaurant decides to do a fusion/mashup theme there is a tendency to lose the first element in favor of the second.  For example it would be easy for a japanese fusion burger place to lose what makes a burger special so that they can cram in the japanese element.  A lot of times I\'ve tried these fusion places only to find that they are only blending things together to be hip and cool not for flavor reasons.  I\'m glad to say that when you bite into a Bachi Burger the japanese element is not overdone and you still get what makes a good burger a good burger.  \nI usually get the Ronin or the Kiki burger, as the first one has an egg (yes yes yes) and the second has my favorite ingredient (a ton of mushrooms).  Both burgers are great and are examples of fusion food done right.  All the elements of the Ronin blend together nicely and taste like a perfect balance of america and japanese cuisine, kind of like if the Fat Burger and Hamada\'s had a food baby.  The Kiki burger I feel was made for me  it has three kinds of japanese mushrooms Saut\xc3\xa9ed Shiitake, Enoki, and Eryngii Mushrooms (what! yes please).  Enoki mushrooms are a really under utilized mushroom and they are great!  I\'ve been waiting for somebody to put them on a burger for a long time.  In fact if you put anything with Enoki mushrooms in front of me I will plow through it like a mad animal.  \nBottom line if you\'re looking for a fusion restaurant that is about taste and not about gimmicks this is a great place.  The only reason I\'m going to give them a four star rating is because when they used to be the only japanese fusion burger on the block they were the the top.  Now, however, I think that they have lost their crown to Fuku Burger both in terms of price and taste.  This might seem harsh, but I don\'t think you can ignore the fact that Fuku Burger came out swinging, and took the title of best japanese fusion burger away from Bachi.  Does this mean that you should go to Bachi Burger for your burger needs.... NO!! it\'s a damn fine burger, but it\'s like that 80\'s movie highlander taught us "there can be only one".'

S'I FINALLY got the opportunity to check this place out!!!  As a passionate Yelper, I don\'t know why it took me sooo long to visit a place with over 1000 reviews with an overall rating of 4 stars.  To me, that sounds like a GREAT place.  A good friend called me to go to dinner and this place was a great choice.  I was stoked!\n\nWhen we arrived, I found out the wait was 35-40 minutes which didn\'t bother me because it told me this place was popular.  The waiting area was a little small with not a lot of seating.  I was relieved to see that the employees were really quick about cleaning off tables once diners left so we weren\'t waiting very long.  Our party saw an area at the bar and decided to just sit there.  Total wait time, around 15 minutes :)\n\nThe place is a nice, quaint venue.  You have the exposed air ducts and lighting.  The walls were painted grey to look like concrete walls.  The overall feeling was a warehouse/loft look which ultimately made for a modern feel.  I love it!  The bar top was filled with very comfy stools, dark top with an opaque glass wall with different colors illuminating the bar:  purples, greens and blues.  \n\nWhen we first sat down, the bar top was not clean had a fishy egg smell to it. We ended up asking the hostess to wipe it off. BTW, the hostess, was soo sweet!  From the greeting to the dinner service, she was super attentive and really helped her servers out.  Top notch!  The bar server was also a cool guy.  I think he was definitely in a managerial role, he just had that aura about him.  I felt like he was from Hawaii.  He kept using "brah" when he talked to me, which made it feel like a family place!  Alright, onto the food!\n\nWe started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries for 11.50. I saw this dish featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and NEEDED to try it!  First of all, what an amazing and beautiful dish.  Start off with crispy shoe string fries, chili filled with shredded oxtail meat, topped with a garlic aioli, cilantro, sliced jalape\xc3\xb1os and a  fried sunny-side egg. WOW, I\'m in heaven.  This dish is savory, little spicy from the chili and jalape\xc3\xb1os, packed with flavor. When you get this dish, you must first take a photo for Facebook, then break the egg yolk and mix everything together.  The yolk coats the chili and fries and brings the dish to a whole new level!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish :)\n\nFor our main course, we decided to get two different burgers, cut them in half and share them, so we could asses more than just one!  The first burger was the Ronin burger for $11. This burger was Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, topped with a katsu bbq sauce, miso type dressing and accompanied with a Yuzu citrus aioli.  This burger is my favorite of the two we tried tonight.  The burger was super juicy (make sure you get it medium done...only way to go!), the slaw offered a crunchy texture, enhancing the burger, love me some fried eggs in a burger so there\'s that.  The sauces really brought the dish together.  SOOO Good!  The second burger was got was the Kiki burger also for $11.  This burger is also made with a juicy patty of Angus beef.  What enhanced the burger were the sauteed mushrooms:  Shiitake, Enoki and Eryngii.  The burger also had caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, onion marmalade, arugula and accompanied with a garlic chili aioli.  What I noticed right off the bat was the super smokey taste of the burger!!!  Then you get a sweet kick from the marmalade.  This burger is packed with different textures:  crunchy arugula and dense chunks of mushrooms.  The garlic chili aioli really makes the burger a star, so do forget to use it!  All these burgers are held together by a Taiwanese sweet bread, super light and fluffy.  Soo good!\n\nSo I know my review was super long.  If you are one of the few folks that reads this entire review and finds it through the 1000+ reviews, I\'m hoping that you\'re mouth is watering like a faucet.  You NEEED to get your butt down to Bachi burger and try their food.  This place is absolutely amazing and you will NOT regret it.  So what are you waiting for??  They\'re open late!!'

S'The oxtail chili cheese fries are awesome - had to eat first then take pic!\n\nWe had seen this place on DD&D and despite sometimes having mixed results when following their recommendations Bachi Burger just looked fantastic.\n\nWe shared an order of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries as an appetizer & they were fantastic - somehow the fries didn\'t go soggy when smothered in the chili, the addition of a fried egg and cilantro just added to the depth of flavor from the excellent meat/texas style chili.\n\nWe then ordered the Kiki and Ronin burgers to share with an order of onion rings.  The burgers were cooked very well (nice and pink in the middle), very juicy and the toppings were fresh.  The buns were good - kind of "sticky" like a steamed bun - but the onion rings were the stand out.  They were like tempura onion rings and I highly recommend them.\n\nWe also got a side of the pineapple ketchup with was great with the onion rings.\n\nI would for sure head back here to try more of the burgers on the menu and also get an order of those chili cheese fries that i wouldn\'t share!'

S'The Las Vegas WEEKLY Magazine had an article on Burgers.. This place showed up, more specifically their "Kalbi Burger". So, I got another mission.. A burger mission!\n\nCame here on a week night, place had a bull pen open layout and only a had a few vacant tables in a pretty decent sized space. Server was Kind and told us that everything they offered had asian inspired/influenced.\n\nTo Start:\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries: This was Shockingly much better than I would of ever expected. Not much going on but it was cooked just right, seasoned with the right amount of everything and the creamy/slightly tangy dip was Great!!\n\nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries: Shreds of oxtail, fries, chili, cheese, garnished with slices of jalapeno with a fried egg right on top!! Too good to be true! Geez, now this is one of those "get down and sloppy" type of dishes!! Unfortunately, I did not like the flavor of the oxtail, nor the chli.. The fries and the Egg were Nice but, everything else was a disappointment!\n\nI was so exctied I didn\'t order the magazine featured burger but  went with the first "Specialty Burger" on the list:\n\nRonin Burger: caramalized onions, japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, sweet bread bun, yuzu citrus aioli on the side for dipping (taste like horseradish blue cheese). I subsituted the regular Angus with their "Snake River Farms" American Wagyu Patty. Overall, I did not like the many different flavors put in this burger, especially the bitterness of the red cabbage.. I think there was way too many things going on at the same time. I did love the richness of the patty and the buns were shiny, soft and super scrumptious!!\n\nI will give this place another try. Next time, I will try the critically acclaimed burger. Plus I will try a plain custom burger just with the patty, lettuce, tomato and amercian cheese (no distractions from other supporting additions).  Service was really good, Pricing was ok I really enjoyed their Very Innovative Menu.'

S"If you are looking for a standard burger, be warned, you will not find it here; the burgers here are upscale and Asian-fusion inspired.  This place is also a bit small, so get here early because it fills up quick.  The service here was great, and the food was even better - the pork buns we had for an appetizer were outstanding; as good or better than I've had elsewhere in Vegas.  The burger (I had the Miyagi-san) was great, although if I got it again I would leave off the fried egg. The salt & pepper garlic fries were amazing, as was garlic chili aioli that came with them (I could put that on cardboard and still enjoy it) - and just a note, the fries are big enough to share between two people.\n\nYou can tell Bachi Burger went out of their way to be a little different, and they have succeed, and impressively done it without being cheesy. If you're looking to spice up you're typical burger, you can't go wrong with Bachi Burger."

S'I have such a wonderful friend that lives in Las Vegas, knowing that I was traveling alone (not uncommon for me), she brought me some food from Bachi Burger.  Although I don\'t mind eating alone in a restaurant, it\'s always more fun eating with a friend.\n\nI had the Kalbi Burger, which consists of: Ground Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee and Ko Chu Jang Mayo.  Got all that?  If you\'re from Hawaii, you probably didn\'t even bat an eye when I mentioned all those things because you knew exactly what I\'m talking about.  But if you\'re not used to Korean food, you\'re probably scribbling frantically to go and Google the words you don\'t know, right?  OK, so go Google and come back.  I\'ll wait for you here.  *pause*\n\nNow that you know what all the ingredients are, here\'s my review.  Oh wait, let me give you my disclaimer first.  I\'m not a huge burger fan.  Your occasional Mickey Dee\'s or grilled poolside burgers are great.  But I\'m not a burger seeker outer.  With that said, this burger was magically delicious!  Not in the Lucky Charms kind of way but in the it\'s-so-non-typical-it\'s-almost-like-eating-a-plate-lunch-with-bread-instead-of-rice kind of way.  (Plate lunch:  A mixture of different food items, laid out on one plate and usually includes rice, macaroni salad - did you know that Hawaii has the highest per capita of people that have diabetes?  Now you know why.  We eat starch with our starch and then put more starch on top)  Where was I?  Oh yeah, it\'s like a mini plate lunch but in sandwich format.  The beef was delicious, the sauce was good and the sweet potato fries gave it a nice compliment.  All I needed to go with it was a Korean bar lady saying, "Buy me drinky?" and I would\'ve had the full experience.  \n\nIf you\'re open to trying new types of burgers, this is the place to get one from.  ^_^'

Skipped the appitizers and we split the following\n-Pork belly steamed buns-Served like sliders, 3 in an order. they were amazing.The egg was a perfect addition to a mouth watering pieces of pork belly and the side of hoisin complimated the sandwhich\n-Short Rib steamed steam sand.- My favorite. The right flavors from the grill cooked the ribs to perfection and the side of Horseradish Yuzu Aioli was so kick ass!!!\n_Ronin Burger-Another great choice. Again the burger was full of flavor, love Japanese  Cole slaw with the combination of carmalized onion and a fried egg, Oh Yeah!!\n-Really busy and I wouldn\'t say service was slow. There was enough time between the steamed buns and the burger to enjoy the meals in little sections. One of the owners, Aaron(spelling) made his way to each table to talk to the custumers and was very friendly. The server was also friendly and even was talking requests on any alcoholic items that we might like to see on the menu in the future....My new favorite Burger Spot!!!'

S'Innovation should always be rewarded. \n\nAnd that certainly applies to Bachi Burger; a restaurant that combines inventive cuisine and the best ingredients available.\n\nThe "classic hamburger" may be the perfect food, but pretty well everyone from "In & Out" to "Bradley Ogden" does it essentially the same way.\n\nBut not Bachi Burger!\n\nThey are pushing the envelope. They are thinking outside the styrofoam box!\n\nHere are but a few facts about BB:\nHamburger buns and chinese steamed buns are from a bakery in Chinatown. \nThey grind their own meat.\nThey make in-house pinapple ketchup, yuzu citrus aioli, and garlic chili aioli.\nThey have Garlic and Pepper french fries, and Truffle-parmesan french fries.\nYou can choose a burger made from angus, wagyu, crab, chicken/turkey or beef/pork/shrimp. \nThey make fresh boba tea drinks and milk shakes.\nThey have an amazing dessert line-up including Portuguese donuts with Vietnamese cinnamon.\nThey have wagyu short ribs on chinese steamed buns.\nThey have a grilled cheese panini with gruyere, fontina, camembert and mezzo secco.\n\nLordy, I\'m getting hungry again just thinking about it....gotta go back to try some of the other wondeful creations. Next for me is Peking Duck on Steamed Buns with boiled egg, chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin sauce.\n\nNeed I say more?\n\nEven thought the location on Windmill is less than ideal, it\'s very much worth the trip.\n\nLook out Burger Bar....you\'ve been outdone.'

S'Best burger I have ever eaten in my life is the Shogun burger. I think that says a lot for anyone who has eating many burgers in their time living in the USA. This thing was mind blowing. All I have to say is if you have doubts of spending $26 on a burger you will quickly feel like you just got the best deal ever.\n\nThe Shogun burger consists of Wagyu beef burger topped with foie gras, unagi, poached Asian pears and miso butter. AMAZING!\n\nThe only negative is we ordered two burgers, the Shogun and the Kiki, and made the mistake and ate the Shogun first. The Kiki was just normal after eating that full flavored Shogun. So if you want to try something else while sharing make sure to try the Shogun last.\n\nThe pork belly buns and the garlic edamame were also really good. Good eats!'

S'Bachi Burger can be really good; then again, sometimes it isn\'t. Consistency doesn\'t seem to be something I get from this place.\n\nI\'ve been here twice so far. First time, I got the turkey burger. It wasn\'t very good. It had a flavor that was really strong (not in a good way), which probably put its sodium through the roof. Plus, I couldn\'t stand the minty sauce that came with it. Thankfully, I got to sample the Ronin burgers that my buddies ordered, which were delicious. Second time, I went for the miso burger. The sauce that it was marinated in overpowered the dry burger completely. It was almost like it was doused in soy sauce. A complete mediocre meal. It didn\'t help that the matcha green tea that I ordered smelled like sea water. Almost made me nauseous.\n\nNot sure if I want to come back to this place again for a third chance. It\'s rare that I walk out of a restaurant angry. I walk in expecting something wonderful from the raving words that I hear about this place. 2 out of 2 times I was disappointed. The second visit was far more worse than the first, though I must admit that the service was consistently good.\n\nWho knows? Maybe I just ordered wrong during my visits. I hate that these items even exist on the menu to tempt me. There shouldn\'t be any "wrong" items to order on a menu in the first place.'

S'The food has been consistently fabulous. Most recently, I tried the Vegetarian-friendly NO MEAT HERE... "BURGER" and it was good. It wasn\'t amazing (like their other burgers), but the fact that they had a well-constructed and thoughtful dish for Vegetarians was awesome enough for me. It featured a shiitake mushroom patty, Japanese eggplant, tofu, red bean, mixed greens, and chili lime vinaigrette on a wheat bun. Pretty cool. I also LOVE their TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES and SALT & PEPPER GARLIC FRIES. The toppings are amazing and the aiolis are addicting (especially that Garlic Chili Aioli, drool). The other burgers I\'ve enjoyed several times are the RONIN BURGER, KIKI\'S BURGER, and SPICY MISO BURGER. Serious drool action all over the board. I\'ve had the OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES once and they\'re pretty amazing too. Basically, I haven\'t had anything bad. I do enjoy the boba milk tea drinks as well. They\'re not the best boba drinks, but decent for a craving. The BACHI SAKE SANGRIA is really great too and unassuming.\n\nThe SHOGUN BURGER is really great! Loved the pan-seared foie gras and although I couldn\'t distinguish the Yamamomo Peach and Asian Pear really well, it added a nice sweetness to this rich sandwich. The Wagyu Beef was delicious as well. The Unagi seemed unnecessary though; it didn\'t add anything significant for me - taste or texture - and it kind of took away from the two main ingredients (Wagyu and Foie Gras). I also tried the SWEET POTATO FRIES for the first time along with my two favorite staples and it was okay. I liked the freshness and it not being salty, but with other amazing fry options, this doesn\'t come close.\n\nWe did have one bad customer service experience where we ended up leaving without dinner and going to another restaurant. It was a rather busy night (and I\'m sure they have lots of those) and the communication with seating availability was horrendous. Especially since I had called ahead. There was lack of organization and the gentleman that appeared to be the manager poorly handled the situation. It was really disappointing. Very "off-putting" and since I\'m a regular, it wasn\'t a complete deterrent, however, for my friends, it was bad enough to not warrant another visit. Not a way you want to lose customers! Otherwise, the service is just okay. Which is a real shame with food so delicious.\n\nUpdate: I haven\'t visited this location for over a year because of my last experience. I have been to their Summerlin location a few times and prefer it MUCH more. The service is substantially better and it\'s not as crowded (no tourists!). I would stay away from this location.'

S"The wait was 20 mins long when we arrived on a Sunday at noon. We ordered a spicy miso burger, ronin burger, and a side of sweet potato fries. The burgers definitely have an asian flare to them. I can definitely tell that the restaurant provided us with fresh ingredients. I think we inhaled the burgers in less than 10 mins.

S"Restaurant was full house so I've waited 15 mins befor getting seated. Everyone works for the place was super nice and friendly. I actually didn't feel like it had been 15 mins. Our waitress, Melissa, welcomed my group with big warm smile and explained menu items in detail since we let her know it was our first visit. We probably waited more than 20 mins for our food. However, its well WORTH the wait!! After my first bite of spicy miso burger, it made me want to sing at the table... yes it was just that good!! Angus beef was cooked perfectly. The medium cooked patty was very juicy and tender. I enjoyed the balance flavors between Japanese shishito peppers, egg and Angus beef. My salivary glands kick in overdrive when I tried to picture that burger and write this review. I also sampled Kiki's burger and Bachi house salad. They both tasted pretty awesome. I liked my Spicy Miso burger better. I was pretty impressed with their house salad. It came with pretty good portion and had mixed greens, avocado, walnuts and yuzu orange vinaigrette in it. This place has truely won 5 stars in my Yelp book with its mouthwatering food, friendly price and supreme customer services. I will be back very soon to try Shogun Burger (wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared miso foie gras, poached Asian pear, yuzu butter and yamamomo peach)"

S"I randomly read about this place on Yelp and since I was going to be in Vegas, I decided to try it out.  It's nice to eat off the Strip sometimes.  It is definitely oddly located, and we missed it at first.  It was pretty dead for lunch, so we didn't have to wait long to get our food.  So we asked about the beef, and it turns out that the beef comes from Kansas and some other corn states.  The waiter had to ask someone in the back, but he said that the cows are grass fed.  They ground all the meat in-house.\n\nPrices are definitely on the pricier side considering the portions.  In fact, my friend had to order another burger to split w/ someone bc he was still hungry.  All the burgers had a similar taste - I think the patties were glazed with some sort of sweet sauce, but the toppings made a difference.  We tried three burgers, and all were good, though I liked the Bachi Burger the best.  \n\n-Bachi Burger, Kalbi Burger, and Bahn Mi Burger - I'd recommend all of them, though the Kalbi Burger was nothing special.  The kim chee they use is not spicy at all and is made from regular cabbage.  \n-Pork Belly Buns - Good but not filling at all.   You get two tiny buns.  Nice for a snack, maybe.\n-Truffle Parmesan Fries - Shoestring crispy fries.  Yummy!!  We also asked for a side of the pineapple ketchup - they should really bottle that stuff.  \n-Hawaiian Sea Salt Coffee ($3.50) - This had an interesting taste bc the whipped cream was made w/ salt.  It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked but it was definitely different.\n\nAnother friend came later and ordered the turkey/chicken burger, but it never came.  Apparently the waiter forgot, so she ended up canceling it after waiting a long time.  The bill came to about $51, not including tip.  Our waiter, who reminded me of Jimmy Fallon but taller, was nice and did his best to answer all our questions.  I'd definitely come back my next trip to Vegas, though I wish the portions were bigger!!\n\nPS:  The website says they are open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. but they had a sign on the door stating they close at 10 p.m. on Sundays.  Not sure which is true, but I'd go with the sign!"

S"Oh my goodness is this the best thing I've ever put in my mouth?! YES! I came here after reading other reviews and I have to say it blew my expectations out of the water.  I'm slowly working my way through the menu but my favorite so far is the Kiki burger.  What I like about Bachi is that they take a lot of very powerful flavors such as bacon or blue cheese and mix it with more delicate flavors of mushrooms or miso and you can taste every single ingredient and they compliment each other so beautifully.  It's a balance of flavors that few chefs are able to accomplish. The burgers are so moist it almost seems a shame to put the sauce they make for your specialized burger on but you must! It makes all the flavors pop.  Once you're done, you wish you had room in your stomach for more.  My usual appetizers are the peking duck buns or the pork belly buns.  You can't go wrong with either and they both are so tender and savory you'll be licking the plate it came on. My usual sides are the parmesan truffle fries.  I had the oxtail fries and they just didn't do it for me.  They were heavy and I felt they had this odd almost bitter taste to them.  They looked like chili cheese fries. \n\nThe service is always excellent when I go there.  The servers are all nice and want you to have the best experience possible.  During my last visit there, I had a server who was just recently hired and wow! They train their staff well because she knew all of the menu items and she was personable and attentive.\n\nPS! I went there while they were filming the kitchen segment for Dinner's, Drive In's and Dives.  Although they weren't officially open, they were kind enough to allow my friends and I to order out.  I HOPE MY BURGER WAS ON THE SHOW!  Also, you better go there now before the episode airs in about 6 months because after that, you wont be able to get in the door."

I wished that more people came with us so that we could have ordered a wider variety of food to try but there's always next year! \n\nWe started with the duck baos, which were tender, juicy, and flavorful. We also got an order of truffle fries with spicy dipping sauce to share. For burgers I got the Kalbi burger, fiance got the Kiki, future-bro-in-law got the Shogun. I think the Kalbi was the best of the three. The Kiki was good but a little too sweet for a burger. \n\nOverall, we'll be back for sure, especially for the oxtail friese! See you again next year!"

S"No problems with service here. Our server, Dan, was super friendly and worked quickly to get us everything we needed. \n\nThe wait was about 30 minutes. There were quite a few empty tables, so it seems like the wait comes mostly from lack of staff to serve all the tables, not necessarily from quantity of people.\n\nFood was delicious. We had the truffle parmesan fries, Kiki's burger, and the Ronin burger. Kiki's burger was angus beef, shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrooms, caraamelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli. The taste wasn't as mushroom-y as I expected, was was nice. And since I love sweet and salty, the marmalade really made the burger. Ronin was angus beef, caramelized onion, japanese cole slaw, fried egg, and yuzu citrus aioli. Also, very good."

The entire staff was extremely nice, my server (Joseph) was way nice and on the ball making sure we didn't need anything....loved him!\n\nThe food was BOMB! I'm not a fan of craziness in my burger so ordered a plain and simple 7oz Bachi Burger. The angus meat was cooked well, just as I ordered, AND still was juicy. The bun was perfectly warm, fluffy and ingredients were just the right amount. \n\nOnly thing about this place is the ridiculous add-on's. For these burger prices you would think they would come with Cheese, to the least. No. It's extra. Lol. \n\nThis is my choice when I miss In-N-Out's 1:30am cutoff. :-D"

S"Get your sweatpants on and your oversized pajama shirt ready for this feast because you'll be needing the extra room to fit this baby--burger baby specifically into your belly.\n\nThe food is absolutely delicious and heavy. We started out with ox tail french fries and pork belly steamed buns. The ox tail portion resembled more like sauce filled with shreds of ox meat blended in there to give it the goopy texture. I've never had ox tail like this and I'd highly recommend this item if this was the only time you could go here. \n\nI ordered the Kiki burger and despite not being hungry, finished the entire patty and the contents inside. The buns were only for my visual pleasure. The patty was a heavy Angus beef  with saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli. And when I say, heavy, you can feel the weight drop on your hand.\n\nOn the scale of gourmet burgers, it ranks very high. For its price, you get the comparable weight of two Big Macs. I may not appreciate that as much, but boy, was it delicious."

I'm already a huge fan of french fries as well, but these were extra delicious! My friend ordered the chicken & waffles - VERY heavy for a brunch (especially if you're feeling a little hung over given the gravy and other sauces), but otherwise super savory!\n\nWe also ordered the dessert platter (ordered 6 of the 7 desserts) they had on the menu. My two favorites were the bonbon (ice cream cream puff-like) and the creme brulee!!!!

We put our names down, were told it was a 30 minute wait and had a seat in the lobby. There were these mini almond cupcake things to to munch on as we waited.  30 minutes seemed like forever with an empty stomach.\n\nWhen we were seated, I noticed that the floors were a little dingy and the velvet seats were a bit run down and itchy. Maybe they were going for that old school vintage look. Who knows? I ordered the hibiscus cocktail, which had an actual hibiscus flower in it. I was told by our waiter Aaron that it was edible, and I do have to say that who knew flowers were so tasty? The free side of bread was nothing to rave about. It was served warm, but it was hard and really chewy on the inside.\n\n The chicken and waffles were TDF!!! The chicken was roasted, but still had crunchy skin. The meat was juicy and tender. The waffles had bacon pieces throughout, which made them savory and sweet with the syrup. It was also served with vanilla bean butter, which I pretty much devoured with my first waffle. I didn't care too much for the gravy. Too salty and took away the taste of the chicken. \n\nThe corn beef hash was also good. It was a good amount of food. Good ratio of corned beef to potatoes. Corn beef wasn't too salty. Two eggs were mounted over this pile of yumminess, which we got over medium. The egg yolk added that extra richness to the dish.\n\nOur server Aaron was the final touch to our experience here. The wait times were a little long for the food, but he assured every one of his tables that the food would be arriving soon. When our meal ended, he took the time to chat with us and tell us about their 3 bakeries thorough out the casino. (Tip: if you take your bill to the location facing the strip, you get 15% off your pastries.) All in all, I had an amazing experience here. A little pricey, but oh so worth every penny!"

We were hugely disappointed to find out that things were not the same on weekday mornings as they are on the weekends.  First, no complimentary pastries or bread (like was raved about).  Also, no specialty items like chicken and waffles.  Service was ok.  Waiter seemed a tad slow on things.  We ordered the french toast (great as always), the smoked salmon lox, corn beef has, and a few other pastries.\nThe smoked salmon lox was really good.  You just had to assemble it yourself (cream cheese, onions, tomatoes, etc.).\nI thought the best dish was the corn beef hash.  The corn beef was really juicy, meaty, and tender.  Probably one of the best ones that I have tasted. Would definitely order that dish again.\nAll in all, a good experience, just bummed that we were not able to enjoy the weekend brunch items and experience.'

I ordered a quiche, and the crust was flaky and light, and the custard melted in my mouth.  It felt like a very light dish, though I know it must've been butter laden.  The homemade apple cider donuts were also very yummy, as well as their chicken sausage and croque monsieur, which had the perfect amount of sauce.   The coffee was fresh and just strong enough, and their flavored tea was very good.  Just thinking about this place makes me want to go back!  Worth every penny.

Incredible.\n\nA nice selection of creamy goat, sheep, and cows milk cheeses finishes the meal.\n\nService is French casual and Vegas friendly.\n\nShort but very well chosen French / domestic French style wine list.  $100 average bottle price with few selections below $65.\n\nOh yeah, "Pay up Frenchie".  He did; in Euros.  Ugh.'

S"Decent restaurant, nothing really special.\n\nI had the Steak Frites. The Steak was seasoned pretty well, and the butter on top really didn't add anything. The butter was seasoned by some dried basil, though the flavour didn't really contribute to the steak overall\n\nThe steak was oozing out juices, this meant the chefs didn't care enough to let the meat rest for 5 minutes, this left me pretty disappointed and it was very messy to eat because of it.\n\nI liked the frites texture, it was perfectly crisp on the outside an so fluffy on the inside, but the problem was it was WAYYYYYYYYYYY too salty. I had to drink a cup of water with every 1 fry I ate. Another problem was the crispy texture I really liked on the fries disappeared when steak juices oozed out and made all the fries soggy\n\nOverall pretty decent place, food was ok"

S"We came here to eat because my friends wanted to eat here. They tried to Bouchon bakery up north and love the macaroons there. The wait was quite long almost an hour so I would highly recommend you to reserve ahead of time on open table. \n\n\nordered:\n*I ordered how half a dozen oysters [$18] which is simply delicious. I would highly recommend it to any of your lovers. \n*I also ordered a quiche [$13.50] which add cheese bacon and onions. It wasn't bad very soft it just in while me. I have definitely had better quiche before. \n*the steak frites [$33.50] comes with fries. we specifically ordered it medium and it was made perfectly medium but lacked in flavor. Which I know they are not a steak house therefore I can't complain at the steak is in that out of this world. *My friend really enjoyed the special of the day which is the wild eggs benedict. He said that the egg was cooked perfectly. \n*My girlfriend had the Gravlax [$16] which came with smoked salmon with a petite baguette, chive cream cheese, red onion, tomato & capers. she enjoyed it however complained because it took too much of her time to have to put everything together. And she's used to eating a salmon lox. everything came separate so you'll have to put it together yourself.  However the salmon is definitely smoke in house as it was not that salty.\n\nOur waitress was awesome!! we have to wait a long time for are oysters and she made sure to tell her manager that we had to wait. basically her colleague messed up and we got the oysters after our food came out. I was able to get us half a dozen oysters for free without of complaining that i had to wait a long time Which is definitely great service. \n\nprices are kinda on the high side. i really wanted to love this place. I can't give it 5 stars because honestly everything was great [decor, outdoor setting, staff, menu selection] but the food was just average. The best part of my meal was the oysters.\n\ntips: \n*It is located upstairs.\n*cash and credit accepted. \n*There's indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating is very limited. \n*They have cute little Tabasco sauce bottles. \n*There is a Bouchon bakery downstairs.\n*they give free samples of their baked goods.\n*the waiting area has newspapers you can read.\n*you can reserve a table on open table to cut the wait time. \n*located at the Venetian\n*causal attire"

S"This is a breakfast review, so be prepared for baguettes...\n\nThere's no better way to start a relaxing day in Las Vegas than with a magnificent breakfast at Bouchon.  The space itself is vast, yet warm.  Huge vaulted ceilings were eye-catching and beautiful in the natural sunlight that poured through the windows.  The service was excellent, with a pair of friendly hosts greeting us and an excellent waiter taking care of us.  Her recommendations were delivered painstakingly and with pride.\n\nI started with a cheese danish that ranks as one of the finest I've ever eaten.  I then moved on to a nicely presented smoked salmon and baguette platter.  The portion was generous and of high quality.  I washed it down with tea from their vast selection, and walked out refreshed and ready for a day of burning through my savings.\n\nBravo to Bouchon.  You're exactly what you should be."

S'Bouchon is a beautiful bistro, decked out in handsome dark wood decor and a buzzing atmosphere to match.  The service is fairly formal but friendly.  Dinner at Bouchon is a casual affair but rich with a vibrant Vegas feel and some excellent food.\n\nMy dinner at Bouchon was with my family of five, and we indulged in a manner befitting a meal in Sin City.  We started by ripping into the epic epi bread placed directly on our table along with good butter and a little jar of mustard.  The bread looked like a well-sprouted branch, and the little yeasted knobs that came off of it were delicious with a satisfying crust.\n\nWe ordered an array of appetizers and passed them around like a good Asian family.  The table favorite was the salmon rillettes, which were presented in a sealed mason jar opened at our table.  The rillettes were superb, with plenty of salmon character along with lots of fat and moisture.  We spread them on crunchy baguettes.  We also got the small assortment of shellfish, which came with a few varieties of oysters along with shrimp and lobster.  Everything was great - the oysters were fresh and briny, the shrimp sweet and snappy, and the lobster plump and meaty.  The assortment came with cocktail sauce, dijonnaise, and a shallot sauce, all of which were put to good use.  For something green, we ordered an heirloom tomato salad with pesto.  This was simple and lovely with bright, refreshing flavors and some gorgeous tomatoes.  The only appetizer I didn\'t especially care for was the escargot.  I don\'t mind eating snails, but these snails were a little bit boring.  They were served with little puff pastries and garlic butter, but somehow the result was unexciting.\n\nThe main courses were on the whole less impressive than the appetizers, but they were still very solid.  I ordered the braised beef short ribs special, which came with sweet carrots, potato confit, roasted bone marrow, and sauce bordelaise.  The beef was very good, tender and tasty, and I loved the softened carrots as well.  The bone marrow was fantastic smeared on everything, adding smooth velvet to each bite.  The sauce, though, was kind of overwhelming, deep but rather sweet.  The steak frites was a great, simple dish.  My brother ordered his steak medium and it was a nice even pink, with plenty of juice, and garlic butter on top.  The fries were spectacular, thin cut and crispy on the outside.  My other brother\'s croque madame and mom\'s mussels also came with these fries.  The croque madame was delicious but very decadent and hard to eat more than a couple bites of.  This was a fried egg and ham and cheese on toasted brioche, and would have been just right but for a smothering dose of mornay sauce.  The fried egg was a thing of beauty.  The mussels were the only item that I actively disliked.  The broth was fine but the mussels themselves tasted like that overwhelming garbage-like smell that mussels can sometimes have.  My dad\'s roasted chicken was a high point.  It was moist and juicy, served with caramelized figs, chanterelle mushrooms, pickled ramps, and chicken jus.\n\nFor dessert we split the vanilla creme brulee and the "bouchon," which was three little brownies with coconut sorbet, butter pecan, and peanut butter chip ice cream.  The creme brulee was decent, though fairly standard, with a pleasant crackly sugar crust.  The "bouchon" was also straightforward but had a lot more sparkle.  The brownies were delicious, with a little bit of crumble but nice dark chocolate density.  The accompanying sorbet and ice creams were also great.\n\nWhen the meal was over, we were stuffed, with plenty of good food as well as a nice bottle of wine in our systems.  Overall I would say that I wasn\'t blown away by Bouchon, but I enjoyed our meal and might go back again.  The food wasn\'t fancy or innovative especially given the price point, but almost everything was precisely executed.  There\'s a Bouchon where I live and if I\'m craving a classic bistro meal, I\'ll probably check it out.'

S"This review is for dinner.  My girlfriend and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night and we both ordered the Steak Frites.  We weren't that hungry so we just ordered a main course.  Our waiter refused to have us sit and wait for our food with nothing to munch on so he gave us a complimentary Rillettes aux Deux Saumons.  It was absolutely delicious.  It's a fresh and smoked salmon dip that we literally probably indulged in way too much bread because the dip was delicious.  Anyways, by the time our steaks came out we were stuffed but still managed to eat majority of our meat!  Overall, a good experience and we got very good service.  We almost make it a tradition to come to Bouchon every trip now.  If you're staying at the Venetian, I believe you get a little card for 10% off the meal!"

S"I used Opentable app to make reservations for dinner. This was my first dinner at the Bouchon Las Vegas Restaurant and it was absolutely wonderful. \n\nThe restaurant is hidden on the second floor of the Venetian. You have to walk to the check-in area, take the elevator to the second floor. Then take a left when exiting the elevator. Apparently, there is a sign, but it isn't very noticeable. \n\nThe order was:\n* Oysters on half shell $18 and Clams $1.95 each. There were multiple oyster choices to choose from, but at the end, we choose kumamotos. The oysters were small, sweet, fresh, but I really didn't like their condiment choices. It was either ketchup or balsamic vinegar. I would have preferred some mignonette dressing and/or tabasco sauce and/or raw horseradish. Clams were also sweet and fresh. No complaints there.\n* Steak Frites $36.75 (4 of 5) - pan-seared prime flatiron, caramelized shallots & ma\xc3\xaetre d h\xc3\xb4tel butter, served with French fries. Traditional steak and fries done perfectly.\n* Gnocchi \xc3\xa0 la Parisienne $26.75 (5 of 5) - saut\xc3\xa9ed gnocchi, with a fricass\xc3\xa9e of garden vegetables & brown butter sauce. Amazing!!! The gnocchi tasted like clouds. It was light when you bit into it but heavy tasting in the belly because of the butter sauce. The complimenting vegetables were tasty and balanced with the gnocchi perfectly.\n* Sole Marini\xc3\xa8re $36.75 (4 of 5) - saut\xc3\xa9ed fillet of sole, caramelized baby artichokes,\n Manila clams, oyster mushrooms, & coco beans.  The sole was delicious pan fried. It had a crispy outer layer and a soft inner layer. The sole was fresh and very tasty. \n* Moules au Tolouse $28.75 (4 of 5) - Maine bouchot mussels steamed with white wine, Tolouse sausage & tomato oil. The mussels were fresh. The mussels were steamed in a strong white sauce. I absolutely adored the pot it was served-in. There was a metal mesh on one corner of the pot and you could dip your bread into that corner, without brushing the mussels to the side. It was a minor detail, but it was obviously very useful. Rather than having to take all the mussels out or finishing the mussels to get to the white sauce, Bouchon created a nook to dip the bread. And, it doesn't hurt, their complimentary bread, is none other than, their popular Epi Baguette. Yeah for free yummy bread.\n\nI actually like Bouchon Las Vegas more than Bouchon Yountville. I like their restaurant spacing & menu selections in Las Vegas. If you are in the neighborhood of Las Vegas strip, I strongly recommend brunch or dinner at Bouchon."

S"(This is for the restaurant, not the bakery.)\n\nSeriously one of the best breakfasts I have ever eaten. SO good!\n\nMy boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday morning. There was a wait so we decided to just sit in the bar area. We sat at a high top for at least 10 minutes and no one came to our table. So the bartender invited us to sit at the bar and offered to take care of us, which she did!\n\nWe started with an order of the beignets. We wanted the special raspberry ones but they were sold out so we went for the standard spiced. They were good but not the best I've had, which was surprising. I expected them to be better. But the rest of the food made up for them!\n\nI had the French toast - which had a seasonal pumpkin flavor with fresh cranberries. This is definitely French-style French toast. It's more like bread pudding than bread so it's very dense. It was melt in your mouth delicious. \n\nMy boyfriend had the croque madame which came with French fries. It was delicious as well. The bread was fresh, the egg cooked perfectly and the ham was flavorful. The fries were thin, crispy and yummy. We ate every bite of both breakfasts.\n\nSo even though we had a little bit of a rough start, in the end we left very satisfied. I would highly recommend Bouchon!"

S"Thank you Thomas Keller.  A birthday dinner at Bouchon, who could ask for anything more.  Now mind you, I am not much of a fancy pants eater, but this place was pretty awesome.  I went there on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend and his grandma.  We didn't have a reservation, didn't need one, and got seated right away.  The cool thing is that the elevators take you straight from the parking complex to the restaurant, another awesome addition.  I did think it was odd that they throw the bread on the table, yet goood bread and better butter, in a cute little serving dish.  They also serve pistachios, which is my favorite nut, so I was happy.  After hearing the specials and looking over the menu, we decided on Duck Confit, Scallops (me), Short Rib (bf), and a watercress/endive salad (gma).  My bf also ordered a half bottle of wine, which was very good, but I forgot what it was.  The duck confit was amazing, I had never had it before.  Make sure that you get all in one fork full, the cabbage, and the grapefruit, yum.  My scallops were great, cooked perfectly with a good sauce.  My boyfriend's short rib was good, yet he thought it should have been braised longer.  Grandma enjoyed her salad and her coffee.  We didn't have room for dessert, but the choices were interesting.  dinner cost about $230 with tip, which wasn't too bad.  Overall, a really good restaurant, and I would love to eat here again."

A lot of their pasteries are seasonal, so ask the wait staff for their recommendations. I've never been steered wrong. The specialty menu is listed on chalk boards throughout the restaurant and always has amazing options. The regular menu, which also changes per season, has never disappointed either.\n\nLOVE:\n- Strawberry croissant\n- Pecan chocolate croissant\n- Gravlox\n- Duck confit: light, perfectly prepared\n- Chicken & Buckwheat waffles: vanilla bean butter was a little too sweet\n\nWhen in Vegas, this place is a MUST TRY!

S"Rarely, if ever, do I feel compelled to start a review by talking about how amazing the service is. Bouchon is just exemplary. The entire staff dishes out 5 star service without a side of snootiness or stuffiness. Everyone is polite, present, knowledgable, patient, approachable. Whether you're wearing shorts and a tee shirt or a three piece suit, you're treated like royalty. Despite this, the restaurant effortlessly balances what could easily become a very formal meal into a relaxed and enjoyable experience. \n\nContinuing the top notch theme, the food is smart and special. There were interesting concoctions all over the menu from sweet to savory, and it's all incredible right down to the butter!\n\nBouchon is a Vegas must, particularly if you're on a culinary quest. On a final note, my husband is an iced tea connoisseur and undoubtedly dubs Bouchon's as the best in the country. Something about it... and now I'm thirsty."

S"Bouchon again! After checking into the room, we decided our first food destination should be Bouchon. We had such a great experience in Bouchon at Napa Valley that we wanted Bouchon again. It's great how we only need to walk a little to get there (we were staying at The Palazzo). My recommendations:\n- duck salad (very small portion): I don't think they have this everyday but if they do have it, order it!\n- coq au vin: this one's a classic - it's a little on the saltier side though\n- steak frites: another classic - steak was nicely cooked and they give you loads of french fries (make sure you pack the left over fries to go because it'll be good drunk-food)\n- truite amandine - superbe!!! This one is a must try! Fish was very buttery, topped with fresh haricots verts! \nI paired my steak frites with a glass of champagne - perfection.\nHow can I forget dessert!\n- Bouchon brownies (can't remember the exact name): this is not on their usual menu: it's warm brownies with melted chocolate inside topped with peanut butter ice cream and garnished with candied nuts - another must have!\n- ile flottante: this one's okay. I personally don't quite like meringue unless they have the texture of Pavlova\n\nBouchon has never disappointed me. Our server was great - explained everything in detail and that was a perfect opening dinner to our Vegas trip, even though my wallet has already started to cry (our total came to around $350 for a party of 5). sigh. It is Vegas afterall."

S"Yummm! Finally went to grab a bite for breakie at Bouchon. I was completely satisfied. Great restaurant tucked away in the Ventia Tower. I had the beignets which were a little different than New Orleans beignets (these were more like cinnamon warm donuts) - they were quite delish though! I also had my usual non fat latte and the hash and egg whites. My friend ordered the bread pudding french toast, it was SUPER decadent in a bread pudding french toast kind of way. OMG! I was so full, I only had one bite but if you are looking for sweet, that's the way to go. Service was good. This is a great stop in the morning before you start your day. I can't wait to return. If you aren't looking for a sit down place or in a hurry catch Bouchon Bakery (my fav!) on the other side of the hotel, near the other towers elevator bank."

S'I LOVE YOU HEAD PASTRY CHEF CHRIS HERRIN!\n\nOur party of 9 came here for brunch since it was convenient and I liked my dinner experience here. Our group ordered a multitude of items: croque madame, 3 egg omelette, spinach quiche, salmon baguette, sausage,  and chicken and waffles. The croque madame was definitely the winner - over easy eggs with melted cheese on top of a brioche, sandwiched in between was layers of ham. Came with fries and it was SO DELICIOUS! The other winner was the spinach quiche. \n\nSo towards the middle of our meal, we see the table next to us have the head pastry chef come out and present them with this dessert concotion (SECRET!). We knew it wasn\'t on the menu and knew that the table knew the chef somehow, but we requested from our waiter if we could possible order that dessert. The waiter said he wasn\'t sure but would ask the chef for us.\n\n5 minutes later, the waiter, "I\'m sorry, the chef isn\'t able to make you that since it take a day to make, but he wanted to send out complimentary rasberry ice cream popsicles". Imagine our excitement as these were vanilla ice cream popsicles NOT on the menu with rasberry filling. HOW LUCKY were we with this free dessert?!\n\n1 minute later, the chef himself walks out and presents us with the dessert concotion and says, "Next time you\'re here, just let me know and I\'ll make these for you." SO EXCITED! We took pictures with him and shook his hand for his generosity.\n\n30 seconds later as we were excitedly commending our good luck since we got 2 free desserts, 2 busboys come out with 3 creme brulees, compliments of the chef. WTF?! ARE YOU KIDDING?! :)\n\n1 spoon into the creme brulee, we\'re presented with the Mousse au Chocolat Noir (dark chocolate mousse) and the Pot de Creme (infused custard). OMGOMG we are freaking out.\n\nHalfway into the mousses, a waiter comes out with the Creme Glacee/ Sorbet Aux fruits (3 different types of sorbets) - the lemon sorbet was DELICIOUS!), AND the Profiteroles (vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce, which had this breadlike thing on top of the vanilla) and the waiter had to pour the chocolate sauce for us. We were ESCTATIC!\n\nLITERALLY 10 seconds later, another busboy (who has sensed that I was the MOST excited out of everyone, or perhaps I was just the loudest), put next to me, the Tarte au Citron (lemon tart), and a flan. By this time, I have NO IDEA what to eat and am confused as to what I tasted.\n\nThe last dessert that they gave us, was the Ile Flottante (meringue with vanilla creme anglaise). This was the only dish I didn\'t like because it was a creme that was very light...sort of the cappucino creme, that didn\'t appeal to me so much.\n\nBill came with no charges to ANY of the desserts. BEST DAY OF MY LIFE! THANK YOU PASTRY CHEF CHRIS HERRIN for making a group of 25 year olds have one of the greatest memories of their lives. :)'

S"On our last trip to Las Vegas, we decided to finally give this place a try. I had read and heard amazing things about Bouchon for brunch. Being a Sunday morning, I figure we would be waiting a good amount of time to be seated but the wait was bearable, only 10 minutes. \n\nThis place is pretty big and has plenty of wonderful lighting coming from outside with some windows having the view of the Venetian gardens. During our wait we decided to go roam around and check out the beautiful pool and hot tubs in this area.\n\nFOOD:\n*French toast $12- I love that this french toast wasn't like your typical french toast slices. This stack is bread pudding style with some sweet apples layered in it along with some custard. The french toast was soft with just the right amount of sweetness.\n\n\n*Pastry Basket $13- Beignet, apple crisp, almond and chocolate and muffin. The beignet was alright (I've had better.. ahem disneyland ahem). It was a little on the tougher side rather than being soft and fluffy. The apple crisp was good but it didn't blow me a way. I wish it was a bit sweeter. The muffin was probably one of the bestest muffins I've ever had haha. The almond and chocolate pastry though, amazing!! Totally loved it. The roasted almonds, just enough chocolate hints in the delicious pastry to make me swoon. \n\n*Coffee: not as bold as I would like it but it was refilled a good amount of times by our server. \n\nWould love to go back and try out their omelette or maybe even their croque madame which is a grilled ham, egg and cheese sandwich. \n\nThe reason why I deducted a star was the service. Although our server was on top of our order, I felt like they were a bit distant and not as friendly as I would think they should be during our brunch, she was extra nice to the table next to us though which made me feel like she didn't value us as much. Would this hold me back from coming here again? No. I would totally love to come back and get some more bread love in me."

S"While in last Vegas I had 3 different dinners at 3 different locations. This was probably the worst of the 3. The food is very average which is very surprising knowing the chef behind the restaurant. It is a copy of a French brasserie but I would have expected better food.  We had the special soup (yam) which was delicious but that was the only dish that was above average. We also had soup a l'ognion, mussels, gnocchi and the special veal. The waiter did a good job at selling the specials and we expected a better quality food ( we had dinner at Scarpetta the night, now that was outstanding). The place is overpriced, the wine list although extensive is way overpriced and the service is awful. The waiters kept on dropping plates and silvers on the floor, it happened at least 4 times during our dinner, and the busboy poured water into our wine glass. The sommelier was unshaved and in a suit with no tie. It was not a good experience and will not recommend it."

S"Yum yum yum, this place was wonderful.\n\nBouchon is everything you expect from fine dining, without the pressure of acting snotty and getting super dressed up.  It has the kind of service you'd expect when paying approximately $50 per person.  I never had an empty water glass [they leave a bottle of water on the table, but you never have to fill it yourself.... they keep coming to fill up your glass].  They clean the bread crumbs off your table between courses.  They make suggestions for food and drinks without pressuring you or up-selling.  All in all a wonderful experience.\n\nThe food--exceptional.  My fiance started with their onion soup and then had their entree special, braised short ribs.  It was served with some kind of potato gratin or something, which were wonderful!  The short ribs had some kind of glaze that gave it a very rich flavor without being overwhelming.  I had their tasting plate of cheeses [sadly, I didn't pay enough attention to find out the names of the cheeses] which were different, but all good.  For my entree, I had their croque madame which brought me back to Paris.  I felt like I was back at that little cafe next to Notre Dame.  Yum-o.  Sadly, my beau and I were too stuffed to try their desserts, but we would definitely come back, so maybe next time!"

S"We celebrated my friend's birthday at Bouchon.\n\nDown to what really matters, what we had..\n\nDRINKS:\nBouchon & Nirvana - both were okay. My friend wasn't too impressed with her Bouchon, but I liked my Nirvana. Tasty froth that reminds me of Orange Julius. I can't find their drink menu so I can't tell you the ingredients.\n\nFOOD:\nMACARONI AU GRATIN (6.50) - Superior macaroni. Baked just so the cheese is slightly crisp, the pasta perfect. I could've eaten that all night.\nHARICOTS VERTS (6.50) - Kids, eat your veggies. But these were overcooked, therefore, sat untouched for a while until I realised I needed to be eating greens.\nSTEAK FRITES (33.50) - Well seasoned, nicely cooked and perfectly paired with frites. And dang, those were some seriously addictive fries, but then again, I am a french fry addict.\nMOULES AU PISTOU (27.50) - Whoa. Talk about mussels. Tons and tons of them which were sweet and delicious. I love seafood drowning in white wine. And more pomme frites. God help me.\nCROQUE MADAME (18.95) - I thought it was tasty, but my friend thought it wasn't as good as other croque madames she's had. Again, more fries. Thank goodness our waiter talked us out of getting another side of them. Whew!\n\nDESSERTS:\nPROFITEROLES (9.50) - I thought the puffs were a bit hard, but they were fun to eat. I liked the ice cream a lot but I think it was more that it felt good in my mouth.\nBENEIGHTS (?) - These aren't on the menu but were a special for the night. Yummy. They reminded me of malasadas!\nPETITS FOURS SECS & FLAN (complimentary) - Because it was my friends birthday, Bouchon gave us a plate of petits fours secs and flan. We liked the petits fours a lot. Every single one had a fun texture and light taste. The flan was yummy. Not too heavy with a really smooth consistency.\n\nSERVICE: We were promptly seated as we arrived at our reservation time of 8:30pm. Our waiter (I forget his name) was attentive, knowledgeable and quick. He brought my friend and I navy blue linens instead of going with their house white, he explained the cheeses to us which we were going to have for dessert but ended up going with major sweets, and he didn't linger or not come around enough. Our water glasses were always filled, we didn't want for anything as far as service went.\n\nBouchon didn't disappoint I'm glad to say. I am looking forward to French Laundry, someday. . . ."

S'Bouchon, you\'re so fancy with your decor and your little sauce holder thingies for ketchup and your tiny tiny tobasco bottles and serving oysters at 11am (who eats oysters at that hour? fancy people). We should have known when we walked in that Bouchon would not be the appropriate brunch spot for a bunch of hungry grad students with a limited budget. But we were enticed with free samples of very yummy bread and a friendly host that changed our wait time from 20 minutes to "we can seat you shortly." \n\nOnce we were seated, it didn\'t take us too long to figure out how out of place we were. Then we took a look at the menus and I can only speak for myself by saying that my jaw dropped a little. I mean, this is the level of fancy that you let your boyfriend take you to because you know he\'s paying. The night after Vegas partying I could have been satisfied with the dollar menu at MickeyD\'s.\n\nOur waiter neglected to bring us our bread until we had to ask. This might have been partly our fault because we were waiting on two more people to join our party. I find it partly ironic that the bread is eaten on the table. Do fancy people really allow their white linens to have crumbs all over it?! \n\nI had the corned beef and it honestly wasn\'t anything to write home about. I liked that it was the chunky kind rather than a hash, but the diced corned beef was dry. It came with potatoes and topped with an egg whatever way you like it. \n\nI wish the food at Bouchon would have blown my mind and I would be yearning to come back on a more appropriate occasion. Unfortunately, I just can\'t say that. Plus, for a place that\'s supposed to have amazing baked goods, their bread was hard and didn\'t taste all that fresh.'

S'No trip to Vegas would be complete without a trip to Bouchon :) Came here for Sunday Brunch and left completely satisfied!\n\nMe and my friend shared 2 dishes: "Chicken and Waffles" ($25) and the "French Toast" ($12).. both were DELICIOUS!\n\nI\'ve never had chicken and waffles so I don\'t have much to compare this against, but this is one of Bouchon\'s most popular dishes, and it is clear why.. the chicken was VERY moist and flavorful, and went nicely with the crispy skin. The dish also came with 4 slices of waffles. I was a little thrown off by the bacon and chives baked INTO the waffles, but they were still good because of the fluffiness. The 2 sauces really completed the dish - savory gravy for the chicken, maple syrup for the waffles. HUGE portions - can\'t really see anyone finishing this on thier own... \n\nFrench toast - presentation was beautiful!!! Hello french toast tower!!! Layers and layers of french toast with cooked apples squeezed in between each layer! Just a warning - small portion and very sweet!!!\n\nBetween the 2 of us, this was the perfect amount of food! Going to Bouchon\'s is always such a nice experience and definitely my favorite restaurant in Vegas :)'

S'I was expecting a lot more from Thomas Keller.  While my meal here was definitely enjoyable, it was a far, far, cry from transcendental.  I avoid chicken dishes like the plague, except at French restaurants, and the Poulet Roti was fine, but just fine.  Nothing really popped out: the chicken was just fresh enough, the flavor was just inspired enough, and the presentation was just interesting enough.  Eh.\n\nService was great, however, and so were the oysters.  But the meal was too expensive to warrant these positive impressions...'

S"What a hidden gem! My bff and I made 6:00pm reservations for two before the Celine Dion concert. We got to Venetian by 5:50pm, but had no idea where Bouchon was located. We walked to Bouchon Bakery, only to find out from the security guard that the restaurant was located on the 10th floor of the Venezia in it's own little nook! \n\nAfter scrambling around, we got there at 6:05pm to  find out the restaurant was rather empty. We sat down and had a beautiful view of the private Venezia pool for guests staying at their suites. \n\nOur waiter came and offered us a drink menu along with bread placed directly on the table. We didn't have plates for it... is that normal!? \n\nWe ordered:\n\nSalade Mara\xc3\xaech\xc3\xa8re au Ch\xc3\xa8vre Chaud - Shared a plate of this salad. It was pretty much a mixture of argula, herbs, red vinegrette, and a large chunk of goat cheese which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nMoules au Safran et \xc3\xa0 la Moutarde - For $26, I got a laaarge basin of mussels steamed in white wine! It was delicious. I probably had over 30 mussels in a short span of 35 minutes (considering we had to RUSH dinner to catch our show at Cesar Palace). The trick is to take the fries and dip it into the mustard & saffron broth. Delizioso!!\n\nPoulet R\xc3\xb4ti - Our waiter recommended the roasted chicken since we were at a French restaurant. I had a bite and the chicken was tender. $29 was a steep price for chicken though.\n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was very helpful at choosing out my drink (a cocktail with gin and blueberries. Yum!) and our entrees. \n\nI wish we got to eat slower and enjoy everything, but overall a wonderful place and experience. I gotta check out brunch sometimes, but I'll leave that to the Napa location :)"

S"Brunch here was amazing! I ate here dinner about 2 years ago and it wasn't very memorable, but their brunch is worth getting up early for. We ate here on a\nTuesday morning and there was no wait but I'm pretty sure there is a long wait on the weekends. I would wait to eat here though, it was that good.\n\nThe scenery is also great. We ate outside on the patio and it was perfect. \n\nWe started out with a pastry basket and coffee. The coffee is served in the cutest little cups. The pastries were delicious but very filling. I just got a standard bacon, egg, and toast breakfast because I didn't want anything too sweet. But it was amazing. My boyfriend is very indecisive so he ordered two things. He got the french toast which was extremely sweet but good. I wasn't able to have more than a bite and that enough. \n\nHe also ordered the waffles which stole the show. Amazing. The waffles come with this amazing vanilla bean butter and strawberries. I'm seriously craving their waffles right now! So good. Worth waking up early and a good place to nurse that Vegas hangover!"

S'Ate at Bouchon twice on last trip to Vegas. The first time was was solid, though service was a little indifferent and unattentive. The second time we had dinner at the bar. The bartender was so nice we decided to eat at the bar. She seemed only to be concerned with us and make sure we enjoyed our dinner, though it was clear she was busy handling drink orders for the entire restaurant. She made great recommendations for both food and wine -- set the perfect balance between making sure everything was perfect and not being too intrusive. The food was excellent, but she really amplified all of the positives and made the experience really memorable.'

S'After meeting Chef Keller at a book signing and reading all the cookbooks, I was super excited to have made reservations to dine at Bouchon. and the experience will go down as one of my best meals of the year. the service was on point and the food was just yummy galore. started with escargot and was happy to see little puff pastries on them. I had a slow smoked brisket and my best friend and the short ribs and we both were so pleased with the tenderness of the meat and flavors we did not speak for a while as we both were eating. ordered up some different sides, pomme frites were pretty good as expected as well as the glazed carrots were standard and tried the hen of the woods which we both liked. of course you must have dessert at Bouchon and so we went with the profiteroles and we were so happy we barely made it out of our chairs when we were done. very very good experience for any foodie to make if you cannot make it to the french laundry. good starting point for a nice preparation for the pilgrimage to french laundry.'

I had the Breakfast Americaine which consited of two eggs, bacon, saysage, toasted brioche a pastry with oj AND coffee. Presentation wasn't what I was use to for breakfast food. I'm use to it just being dumped on my plate. This was done nicely. The other person I was with had the Croque Madame which is toasted ham and cheese on brioche with a fried egg with mornay sauce and pommes frites. I had some of hers and I wished I ordered that instead. \n\nAt the end, we were happy and we gave a large tip to our waiter who was really grateful."

S'I went there for 10th year anniversary because we saw Anthony Bourdain poured wine on the table after he tasted their fries on his Vegas episode. Was disappointed, at $7 a pop it was not worth the money. I ordered the fish dish but it has bones in it and was not very tasty at all. Would rather spend my money at my favorite Chinese restaurant, the chef at least knows how to cook fish... And for the money I paid, I could have ordered for 10 people if I ate some other place. If I paid that kind of money, the food better be so good i will never forget the experience. But really, the food is mediocre. Gave it 3 stars because my husband enjoyed his dish and the service is very good.'

S"*Saturday Brunch Review*\n\nOh goodness gracious, this place is just lovely.  I'd probably give 4.5 stars if I could because my main menu item choice didn't entirely blow me away, but it was really really good.  I initially gave four stars, then wrote my review and upon reflecting, realized I needed to change it.\n\nI'd DEFINITELY recommend you go here for brunch.  I've heard the Wynn buffet is also a must for breakfast, but if you're not going to a buffet, I'd say make this place your next stop.  It's really easy to find from the self-parking garage elevators - just follow the signs.\n\nI came alone (business trip) on a Saturday right at prime brunch hours at 11:30am.  Seemed like couples/groups were getting seated right away no problem, and there were plenty of open seats in the bar area so I snagged one for myself. (fyi they don't take brunch reservations).\n\nI was promptly asked if I wanted anything to drink, and subsequently checked in upon every 2-3 minutes by 3 different servers behind the bar - not annoying, quite pleasant and kind actually.  Finally I was ready to order!  The breakdown:\n\n-Coffee - it was good.  I wouldn't say anything to write home about, but nothing wrong with it either.  Bottomless cup is nice.\n\n-The Beignets - oh holy shit the beignets.  These DID blow me away.  Two large sugar coated doughnuts literally BURSTING with fresh, house-made strawberry jam.  I picked one up and was shocked at how heavy it was.  I tried to break it apart - not so much - jamsplosion!  But seriously, I inhaled them.  They were so so so good.  An absolute MUST if you're a sweets-for-breakfast fan.  The jam is really really incredible.\n\n-Speaking of jam, I asked about it because I'd heard they make it all in-house, and the server mentioned their jam of the day didn't come with my meal choice, but he would bring me some.  I was under the impression everyone gets baguettes/jam/butter after they order, but maybe not for brunch?  Maybe only if you order specific items?  I'm not sure, but I also didn't care because a) I had beignets, b) he was bringing me their peach mandarin jam anyways, and c) I don't prefer hard breads.  The peach mandarin jam was incredible.  INCREEEEDIBLE.\n\n-I ordered the Chicken & Waffles (bacon and chive).  They were both very very good, but I've had better (in the northeast, surprisingly).  The tahitian vanilla butter was a nice touch, and I'll say I definitely tried every combination of chicken-waffle-vanillabutter-syrup-peachmandarinjam that was exponentially possible.  The chicken was juicy and moist with crispy skin on one piece but not really on the other, and the waffles were light and flavorful, although the last two i got two ended up being kind of soggy for some reason.  Interestingly enough, the standout of this dish was the mushroom sauce.  Mushroom sauce?  WIth syrup and vanilla butter and waffles?  Weird, I know.  And no, I did not combine it with any of those.  But what I DID get to do was switch between mouthfuls of savory and sweet, and for someone for whom that choice is a CONSTANT dilemma in life (#1stworldproblems), this dish is pretty close to heaven.  But for real, that sauce was essentially the best gravy I've had in my life.  I will likely be dreaming about it, and will try (and likely fail) to recreate it at home.  I might write to Bon Appetit to get the recipe...\n\nI ordered a cheese danish to go cause a fellow yelp friend said it was amazing - haven't had it yet though.\n\nBottom line - a really great breakfast experience, in a nice atmosphere, with delicious food.  I'm glad I went, and I would highly recommend it (if you couldn't tell already)."

S'Visited for dinner on a Sunday evening, July 8, 2012 (sorry, long overdue review!)\n\nI expected to be wow\'d a little more, having high expectations of Thomas Keller, my favorite chef if I had to pick one.  But, I think he dropped the ball on this location.\n\nI really had to examine the pics I took to refresh my memory of that dinner, as it was not very memorable.  Let me start with the good:\n\n- a chef friend loved the puff pastry escargot\n\nShit, I\'m at a loss! I just sat for a good 5 minutes scrolling back through pics to put something good down about that dinner, avoiding the obvious "in good company" (we were celebrating a friend\'s bachelor party that weekend, so in high spirits).  But I really was unimpressed.\n\nThe carpeting seemed drab, though the lighting was a warm yellow glow.  I got sleepy just looking at the pics of dinner.  I am careful not to say romantic though, cause it didn\'t feel that way to me... more like "old."  Yea, if I was 62 and wanted to enjoy a quiet, civilized dinner with my wife, this is the spot.  Until then, I think I\'ll stick to hip trendy spots filled with girls in short skirts spilling out of their top.  Oh God, I need to return to Vegas soon.'

S'I recently went for brunch due to hype from one of my co-workers.  I did not like much about my experience.  It started with what I think is an obscure way to get to the restaurant, to the wait, to so so food.  I am certain the Illy coffee downstairs is much better than what I had upstairs.  The breakfast was basic fare and included what I considered a overbaked chocolate almond croissant.  My girlfriend did like her waffle.  Ultimately, I left undazzled by ambiance, food and service.  I went back downstairs thinking maybe I should have just tried a chocolate croissant from the bakery.'

S'Bouchon is one of those select restaurants that makes me want to be a "foodie." It\'s the kind of restaurant that\'d you\'d definitely want to go back to and the type you\'d recommend to anyone.\n\nAfter watching Top Chef: Las Vegas for the first time ever, it got me wanting to explore and learn more about the culinary world. Then in my multi-task mode I went looking for places to eat in Las Vegas for my recent trip there. The words "Thomas Keller" and "Michelin rated" came up and so I was sold on Bouchon. \n\nWith more than 600 reviews I\'ll just add some nice things for when someone else is on a similar search for nice places to eat in Vegas in hopes that a Yelp review will steer them in the right direction especially if you\'re not feeling eating buffets all the time...this is a nice change of pace. \n\nBrunch is excellent here. It\'s relaxed but at the same time you\'re experiencing some fine dining. I\'ve had people tell me after I went, that every time they come to Vegas with their family, they go to Bouchon.  \n\nI like pastries and with so many choices I just decided to go with an assortment of four pastries in the Bouchon Pastry Basket. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=mHIby3_tPU4T_b9Jubc7fg\nThey\'re all good but filling. Another instance where I was eating with my eyes and not with my stomach.\n\nI had the Chicken and Waffles and they were the best. Roscoe\'s Chicken and Waffles is great too but Bouchon delivers it like no other. \n\nThe Croque Madame was as good as advertised and the pommes frites were delicious. Leave it to the French to make great French Fries. \n\nIt was all so filling that I couldn\'t possibly fit dessert. But then I saw the table across from me all come in just to eat dessert and I cried a little bit when I saw the various dessert options. Then they proceeded to savor every bit as if to rub it in my face. I tried to focus on the fact that we had a table overlooking the pool in the Venetian or that our waiter had been especially helpful in providing an excellent dining experience but none of that puts amazing looking profiteroles in my stomach. \n\nI guess I\'ll just have to wait until they open the Bouchon in Beverly Hills later this year. But if you\'re in Vegas and want a great place to eat for anytime in the day then Bouchon is a can\'t-miss restaurant.'

S'My favorite restaurant in Vegas... every time I visit I will go there once.\n\n(I would love to make Robuchon my favorite but that\'s just impractical on the wallet. =))\n\nBouchon has that perfect ambience to me... a leisurely bistro feel yet without the dingyness. High ceilings, graceful deco with lovely peaceful garden view. Not to mention the whole Venezia hotel is a piece of ultimate luxury.\n\nI am a huge Thomas Keller fan. He rarely shows his face on TV and he doesn\'t open 40 garbage restaurants like so many other American prima donas these days. I am talking to you Wolfgang, Boulud, Flay, Lagasse...\n\nBouchon is a restaurant that does what it does the best - cooking good normal food. It doesn\'t try anything fancy... you won\'t find molecular food "deconstruction" here, you won\'t find strawberry turned into a slimey foam by some genius scientific machine here, and you won\'t find some tiny $500 truffle that only grow at XX and flown to Vegas within YY hours here...\n\nOk, going back to the food.... \n\nLamb shank: oh so good and giant piece of lamb shank. Stewed hours to make it perfectly moist and tender. Oh so good 10/10!!\n\nFrench Onion Soup: to be frank this one is a wash... the soup is a little salty and I\'d love more caramelization on the onions, but the cheese is solid and it still tastes good, just not heavenly. 7/10.\n\nSturgeon with grilled bacon and snails: this is the largest piece of sturgeon I had for a while, grilled to perfection, sauce is tasty too. Best fish dish I had for this Vegas trip. 9/10.\n\nMussels in white wine butter sauce: it\'s almost surprising that they can make something so normal taste much better than everyone else. Go order it. 10/10.\n\nSince I wrote a review, I have to specially mention the chicken waffle at their brunch menu... everyone should try it as it\'s that good, cheap too at $25. 10/10.'

My boyfriend and I went for brunch on a Sat. We ordered chicken and waffles, steak frites, 1/2 dozen oysters, and cocktails.\n\nJust briefly...\nBread and butter: awesome soft butter...hard bread\nOysters: really fresh but specify what types of oysters you want to your waitress\nChicken and waffles: pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary\nSteak frites: good\n\nMy only compliant, which isn't really a complaint because the staff was really nice...is that I wish we were served by one person only so that's it's more consistent and timely. We had our waitress and different servers who delivered each of our items. Our items came at odd intervals. There was a big gap between the bread and butter and our oysters, our main dishes didn't come at the same time...and when I asked the waitress if my drink was still coming after we had started our dishes, she seemed genuinely surprised it hadn't. Maybe it's because the bartender delivers the drinks himself? I'm not really sure, but that would be my only suggestion, one person to take care of everything or better communication."

The custard like filling was a little different from a standard quiche, but very good.\nMy hubby ordered the corned beef hash which was really good too, although, he wished he had ordered the egg over easy/medium instead of scrambled.  The Brioche toast - SO GOOD.  At our table we also had Chicken and waffles - also tasty, especially with the Tahitian vanilla butter! As well as the "white" sausage. YUMMMY!\n \nI\'m kind of picky about iced tea - I love my iced tea fresh and brewed strong - Bouchon has an excellent iced tea!  \n\nThe atmosphere is a little reminiscent of Bottega Louie in L.A., but more French and much more decor.

S"I seriously need to thank this place for providing such stellar service. After a nightmarish meal at an Italian restaurant in the Miracle Mile, I was thrilled to come here and feel more welcomed. *high five*\nBouchon has never disappointed me. This is only for brunch though, I can't say anything for lunch or dinner. I've tasted the pomme frites, chicken and waffles, croque madame, profiteroles, brioche and jam and hibiscus drink. \nThe pomme frites are crisp to perfection. The bread on the croque is nicely toasted and tastes wonderful with the gooey runny egg- however, I prefer mine with a fully cooked egg. The chicken and waffles are probably my favorite. Compared to Roscoe's, it's a different experience all together. You don't have to use the syrup because the waffle has this nutty flavor alone. Topped with a piece of chicken and a smear of butter and you're good to go! The chicken is beautifully fried with all the flavors coming from the meat itself, not the batter. \nI love bread and Bouchon has the BEST bread and vanilla bean butter on earth!!!! Everything is better with butter- lemme tell you! Just remember that the vanilla bean butter only comes with the Chicken & Waffles dish and may cost extra if you order it alone. Also get the profiteroles which are tiny fried pieces of dough (fancy donuts if you will)."

And yes, it's worth the 20+ min wait time......waiting was not bad though because we had bloody mary's to keep us entertained.  OMG, they have THE BEST bloody mary's --- i had to order 3 (yes, 3 at 10 am... ahem, only in vegas?).  The service was great... i kind of forgot what i ordered but remember it was tasty.  :) (just kidding).  I ordered the hash brown and potatoes -- it was really good and fresh! would def order it again.  oh and their bread was amazingly fresh ---- mmmmmmm.

But I\'m getting ahead of myself.\n\nExcellent sazerac, served neat, as it should be.  And I have to complement the tap water, which was soft and sweet.  Dont bother with the bottled water.\n\nWe tried the special appetizers for the day.  The escargot, served with mini puff pastries and swimming in a lovely garlic, butter sauce, were very tender.  The carrot soup, served with creme fraiche was light and sweet.  And the oysters were very fresh and briny. \n\nPortion size on the entrees is not uniform.  The special entree for the day, scallops and gnocchi, was a perfect size, but the standard sauteed gnocchi menu item was HUGE.  It was good, but I dont know how anyone, no matter how hungry, could get through even half the plate.  And the menu description was a bit deceptive.  The dish was described as being accompanied by a fricassee of vegetables, but the only "veggies" were sliced potatoes (which seemed an odd pairing with potato gnocchi), pimentos, and thinly shredded and blanched greens.  Not my idea of vegetables.\n\nAnyway, the dessert was fantastic--a coffee flavored pot de creme, served with some butter shortbread cookies.  Yummy!  \n\nService was pretty decent, not spectacular.'

S"Bouchon continues to be one of my favorite restaurants. It is quintessential French bistro and carefully walks the fine line between casual and fine dining. But to be certain, this is fine dining without snobbery. Plan to spend a couple of hours here, and the experience will be better. All ingredients are top of the line, fresh & well prepared. We started with the cold petite seafood platter. Fresh and top of the line shellfish.  The entrees were excellent.  Mussels were served in a cast iron pot with fries.  The steak was mouthwatering and was served with fries, The trout was prepared in an all clad pan and served that way with croutons that weren't to be believed. In all, outstanding."

The gravy for the chicken was what made it good. As for the waffles, vanilla bean butter and maple syrup... Ahhh heaven! My fianc\xc3\xa9 took a bite of my chicken and thought it was kinda dry.\n\nHe ordered the American breakfast: bacon, eggs, sausage, brioche toast, choice of a breakfast pastry & coffee. All for $22. I think that's awesome considering everything else was so pricey in Vegas. \n\nThe food was good, but I don't think we would come back here for brunch.

Below is my earlier review, written after many dinners there. Mr. Keller, I am disappointed in what\'s happened to what used to be one of my favorite restaurants here in Las Vegas.\n\n"Okay, this is our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. First, the food\'s just grand, though the service can be a little slow at times, but the food\'s great so who cares. \n\n"Moreover, it\'s reasonably priced for a venue of this calibre. My wife and I have always gotten out of there for under $100. The caveat here is that we don\'t drink there.\n\n"One of these days we\'re going to try it for brunch, though it\'s a tough reservation, or used to be."'

S'BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT EVER! My mother and I returned along with one of her friends from England. What I thought was the Croque Madame, from my previous review, turned out to be the Gratin that is changed on a daily basis. So we would not have been able to order the same thing as our last visit. The waitress did a poor job of trying to explain the menu and ended up with a regretful mess. Our hearts sank as these plates arrived with a giant mound of French fries and a small bland sandwich with an egg on top. All three of us were full and unsatisfied after eating this Croque Madame and only a few of the fries. The only saving grace was the coffee, with breakfast, and the pastries, from downstairs, at the Bouchon Bakery.'

S"When you can't see much inside a restaurant because of its very dim lighting, then you know you're in for some upscale dining among fine individuals with night vision (read: Predator).\nTucked away in what seemed to be another time zone in the behemoth of a casino, Bouchon indulged me with French fare in an intimate, classy setting.\nMy party of 3 were seated promptly and we started off with escargot (perfectly buttery and chewy).  \nThe house bread and PISTACHIOS are bomb diggity.  I love anything bread and butter so I was in heaven. The pistachios were a bonus ;) C'mon, where else can you get pistachios?!  Indeed, I am a sucker for novelty. \nI ordered an iced tea and our server brought it out in a carafe, which I thought was and refreshingly...refreshing.  My only gripe with it was that the carafe was not large enough, as I am a bottomless pit for tea.\n\nI have had their lamb so I tried their steak frites, prepared medium rare.  I forget the cut of the steak but I will say that it was one of the best cooked steaks I've ever had!  The center was pink and juicy (no innuendos here!) and every bite of it left me wanting more!  I didn't care too much for the fries; I wish I had substituted it for  something else. What a waste of fries...\n\nMy only gripe with the establishment would be the cramped seating between tables.  It can get extremely awkward taking my seat, wiggling my rotund derriere in between tables to get to my destination.  Most of the time, the company directly next to me are not within earshot; but, when they are, then I'd find myself biting my tongue, trying not to spew out my vernacular of special four-letter words. \n\nOur server was superbly nice and accommodating and our waters were always filled to the brim.  I've always had a great experience here.  The wait staff had greeted us on the way in, which set a precedent for great service and food.\nOh, Bouchon, I will be back."

S"Ok, so I was definitely disappointed with Bouchon in BH so I wanted to go back to Vegas and see if it was just a bad location...\n\nDisappointed again. To start, we had the Petit Plateau and the Tomato Salad. We ordered the Trout, Pork Loin, Truffle Sausage, Tartine du Jour (tuna nicoise) and the Chicken.\n\nFirst off, the the Petit Plateau was nice. Oysters, lobster, clams, mussels - it's $65 but it can feed 3 people easily which makes it definitely worth it. Everything was fresh although I still felt the Kumamotos at CraftSteak were a bit better. The Tomato salad was pretty good - good flavors and with the added goat cheese (something my waitress recommended), it balanced my meal very well.\n\nThat's sorta where the awesomeness stopped and the disappointment started. Pork loin was meh - though juicy and tender, I felt like I could have eaten this anywhere half-way decent. Tartine was just tuna salad on baguette with a side of fries. Truffle sausage wasn't anything spectacular and didn't have the richness usually associated with truffles. Chicken was... well, chicken. And the trout was probably the best tasting dish with a good presentation but again, nothing that blew me out of the water (pun intended).\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a custom cake from the Bouchon Bakery - chocolate with light vanilla frosting with strawberry sorbet. Unfortunately the sorbet was the best thing about the cake in my opinion. While the cake itself wasn't overtly sweet, it just felt like it was missing something. In fact, the entire meal felt like it was missing something.\n\nPlus, our waiter was TERRIBLE. He made awkward, TMI conversation with all of us and couldn't even remember the specials. This was right after he extolls the virtues of himself as a superior waiter. #Fail.\n\nOn the upside, ambiance is quaint and cute (like the BH location) and the Epi bread is to die for... but that's about it."

We had their New England Clam Chowder to start.  Lots of spices, pretty thick.  My husband really enjoyed it.  They brought some breads, and I personally really liked their peach jam.  Yummy.\n\nOur main dishes were signature the Croquet Madame and one of their specials (my french is awful, but it was scrambled eggs on a housemade puff pastry with spicy sausage).  Both dishes were delicious but H-E-A-V-Y.  Don't think I'll be craving either dish again any time soon...\n\nWaiter was very friendly, but service was a little slow.  Great ambiance.

I had to croque madame which was really good, a little heavy on the sauce over the sandwich but other than that no complaints. It comes with a ton of fries so if you love fries like I do you'll love it! The service was ok, could have been better. We were waiting there and had to ask for the bread when there was people seated after us that already received some, and no plates for the bread either! c'mon! I don't know if it's because we had a pretty large group but still. An upside is while you wait  to be seated they offer little samples of their pastries and free bags of caramel corn when you leave!

The p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 was creamy and had a lot of flavor. Spread it on the brioche toast points they give you with some of the Dijon, radish, watercress, and cornichons, Delicious. The gateau was really good. It was layered with duck confit on the bottom, foie mousse in the middle, topped with a blood orange gelee. Also had a blood orange gastrique on the plate, it was really, really good. It was on the Valentines Day menu. The wife's favorite dish of the night.\n\nSecond course was a potato leek soup and an endive salad. The soup was creamy and delicious. The endive salad had an awesome walnut vinaigrette that went very well with the endive and the bleu cheese. \n\nEntrees were phenomenol.  The wife had the steamed mussels with chorizo and fennel with a side of frites. The mussels were very fresh and the broth was very flavorful. I had the short rib Bourgogne with hand made pasta and glazed root vegetables.  It was the best short rib I have ever had. The flavor was deep, the veges were cooked perfectly and the pasta was fresh. The best thing about the whole dish was the sauce, so rich and flavorful. \n\nThe dessert was a Valrhona chocolate cake and raspberry gateau, with raspberry coulis , milk chocolate sorbet, and yogurt pearls. Great way to end the night, not too heavy, very good flavor. The sorbet was awesome."

S'OMG TAHITIAN VANILLA BEAN BUTTER!! Can I get it to go? Please?\n\nI am so glad Anthony Bourdain came here on an old episode of No Reservations. He was right; they have AWESOME French fries here. When a chef says another chef has better [insert dish name here] you have to try it. Not having enough time to come here for dinner, we ended up eating brunch here. Note: they do not take reservations for breakfast or lunch; only dinner (and go to OpenTable.com).  We arrived around 1pm and was quoted a 20-minute wait. After a few minutes in the foyer and some free Madeline cookies, we decided to sit at the bar instead. We figured the service would be faster and we could watch the bartenders make drinks and the oyster shuckers work their magic. Unfortunately, our order was placed at 1:23pm and we did not get our food until 2:10pm. The bartenders that put in the order were baffled as well on how screwed up the kitchen was. They kept looking at the receipt (that is preprinted when the order is placed) and at the clock above the bar then disappearing into the kitchen, only to tell us it would be a "moment." Aside from this, the food was fantastic.\n\n+ Croque Madame - ham sandwich with an egg on top and a MOUNTAIN of fries\n+ Lobster Bisque - I loved it because it didn\'t have the distinct white wine taste and you can see the lobster; also they add apples to it. Weird huh?\n+ Sourdough Waffles - didn\'t taste like sourdough but it was wonderful! Fresh strawberries, powdered sugar, vanilla bean butter and syrup?! Nothing was wrong with this dish.\n\nNotes: the restaurant is located in the Venezia Tower (go towards the guest rooms\' elevators and take it up to the 10th floor and walk across the sky bridge.) You can request outdoor seating when you\'re making the reservation. The attire is pretty casual. The people next to us were in swimsuits underneath their clothes and I saw someone else in PJ bottoms.\n\nI can\'t wait to come back for dinner on my next trip.\n\n\n12/26/10 update:\n++ chicken and waffles - omg yummy\n+/- beignets were okay, I mean what\'s not to like about sugary donuts with jam and/or chocolate syrup, but it was a bit much (even for 3 people to share)'

A 20 hour brining and roasting process made the skin really crispy and flavorful - he's particular and couldn't stop talking about this.  My dayboat scallop special with the mushrooms and swiss chard and a special vinaigrette were also exceptional.  The french onion soup was a little disappointing but only because it was made with white wine and we prefer the flavor of dry sherry.

We finally made it to the long time coveted brunch at Bouchon and it did not disappoint. \n\nWe started with the special of the day appetizer: salmon tartare, good but not the best we've had.  Loved their bread with house- made butter and silky smooth jam. Caveat: don't overeat on the bread. Unfortunately, we made that mistake. \n\n I had their special of the day entree, an omelette with shrimp, mushroom sauce over a house made puff pastry. Yummy.  We also had the chicken & waffle which was delicious. It comes served with a vanilla bean butter and cinnamon maple syrup. The roasted chicken was moist and delightful in flavor and the waffles were light and scrumptious. Thomas Keller definitely does his chicken right. (Although nothing compares to the fried chicken from Adhoc.)\n\nMy friend had the croque madame which was covered with a mountain of frites. The frites were good but lacked the crunchy texture I usually like.  The brioche was of course drenched in butter but balanced with the salty flavors of the ham. We felt like it needed a citrus component. It wasn't our favorite dish of the day. Next time we may just go with 3 entrees among us 4. We were overly stuffed. \n\nWe will return again for dinner!

I ordered the Champagne Cocktail which had a sugar cube in it, but it didn't taste like any special champagne or cocktail. They started us off with some bread and butter/jam. The bread was hard and bleh. I was expecting much better bread, but I loved the jam! Me and a friend shared our meals. I had ordered the Crepes du Jour and she ordered the Croque Madame. And they were both delicious. The Croque Madame came with a mountain of fries. Not sure why they give so much, but it really was too much. \n\nOur waiter was good.

S'One of the top restaurants I have to dine at before I die is Thomas Keller\'s French Laundry.. but since I can\'t go to Yountville, I was dying to go to Bouchon in Vegas.  I honestly did not expect to go there this weekend since I was spending my MLK weekend with a bunch of college students on a budget (myself included - and I am even more broke now) but after debating, we realized we did want to eat at a nice restaurant - I was thrilled.  However, I was also super nervous since not only were we all on a budget but I was with a bunch of boys who can\'t stand small proportions (they didn\'t complain thankfully). Naturally, Bouchon was completely booked so we showed up at 5:00 and crashed in the lounge.  It was actually kind of comfortable, we just hung out on the couches and snacked a little until we were hungry enough for dinner.\n\nAfter nibbling on some of the bread (so good! warm and fresh), drinks, and the smoked salmon terrine (amazing! - they also brought out more croutons for us), we finally ordered dinner. Wow, the fries were so good. I usually don\'t eat fries but I was munching on everyone\'s fries around me.  I shared the trout with a friend, it wasn\'t too oily and the green beans were nice and tender.  I got to sample some of the steak, gnocchi, and mussels as well and all were superb.  I didn\'t get to try the salmon but my friend and fellow yelper, Doug K, who is normally a quantity over quality kinda guy said it was so good that his meal was definitely worth the quality over quantity.\n\nOverall, service was pretty damn good for being a group of boisterous college students who weren\'t even seated at real tables.  I had a bad cold so they kept coming by to refill my pot of hot water which was really sweet :)  Our waittress came by to check on us several times to make sure we had enough space and whether or not we were ready for our food.  We were honestly there almost 3 hours just hanging out and they were super nice and made us feel very comfortable.  I can\'t wait to go back again except hopefully, I\'ll be able to get reservations next time.\n\nEdit: Went here again with the boy WITH RESERVATIONS THIS TIME. It was amazing. Again. Lamb dish was a little too small but the duck confit hors d\'oeuvre was incredible. As for the dessert, our waiter brought us something "off-the-menu" (Bouchons) and we gobbled it up in 30 seconds. absolutely delicious. I want to go back.. again, but there are so many other good restaurants in Vegas I have yet to try.  I suppose twice is more than enough.'

Their brioche because the instant you step foot into Bouchon, you\'re slapped in the face by the smell of fresh, high quality brioche.  The aroma is heavenly.  Their fries because Anthony Bourdain said so.\n\nWith this in mind, I decided on the Croque Madame.  It\'s basically a fancy French eggs benedict but with brioche and morney sauce instead.  It also came with a side of pommes frites, a fancy term for French Fries.  Because everything is so fancy, you end up paying fancy prices.  And if you pay fancy prices, you expect to get fancy tasting food and fancy service.\n\nThe Croque Madame was good.  Everything came together nicely.  The ham was savory, the egg perfectly cooked, the morney sauce was rich and creamy, and the brioche was buttery with a flaky crunchy crust.  Very fancy!  Now Mr. Bourdain, about their fries.  It was way too salty for me.  I still think McDonalds and In-n-out have better "pommes frites".  But since I\'m a pig, the saltiness didn\'t stop me from eating every single stick.\n\nPerhaps our waiter was having a bad day but he was absolutely horrendous.  It seemed like he brain was on vacation.  While the other waiters/waitresses were hustling, trying to provide speedy "fancy" service, our waiter was strolling around like he was in a museum.  And he was so freaking inefficient.  My wife ordered coffee and he would bring coffee, no cream or sugar.  After we asked for cream and sugar, he\'ll just bring the cream and 5 minutes later, the sugar.  My butt cheeks were flexed because he was making me so antsy!  Our brunch ended up taking 2.5 hours.  I don\'t care so much about the time but if I\'m dishing out $20+ per plate for breakfast, I want better service.  That\'s not too unreasonable right?'

S'I had the most lovely brunch at Bouchon during my Vegas Christmas wedding weekend. They offer very, very tempting brunch selections like chicken and waffles which looked mouthwatering. However, on this chilly Vegas morning I was slightly hungover and craving a more traditional (non traditionally late) breakfast. The "Breakfast Americaine" fit the bill. It came with crispy bacon, the best breakfast sausage I\'ve ever had, eggs any way you can imagine them, and toasted buttery Brioche. In addition, it came with a breakfast pastry, juice and endless coffee.\n\nThe chocolate croissant was the best chocolate croissant I\'ve ever had, besides of course ones I\'ve made in my pastry career and eaten fresh from the oven. The banana muffin was very moist and very delicious. The coffee was amazing and overflowing. Our waitress constantly warmed and refilled our cups. The service was great. I will be eager to return, next time for dinner!'

Eggs cooked to perfection. \n\nI am deducting points for the waitstaff. I felt they were sort of cold & rude.

S"My bf and I came here to check out the famous Bouchon after seeing it on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations.  Anthony made a big deal about the duck fat fries, and really, I was so full from my earlier buffet, that we were good with just sitting at the bar, ordering a couple drinks + the famous fries.  My bf got a beer, nothing special, and I got the absinthe drip, which was very entertaining to me, as I have been playing around with absinthe lately.  (If you're curious, the absinthe drip is when they place a slotted spoon on top of a glass of absinthe.  A sugar cube is placed on to the slotted spoon, and ice cold water is dripped via a dispenser on to the sugar cube to dissolve it into the absinthe.  Very cool.  No fire though.)  The duck fat fries really were to die for.  They were thin cut, crispy, and flavorful.  (I had McD's later and wanted to cry they were so awful in comparison.)  The ambience was very classy and the service was top notch.  I'd come back for a nice dinner if I ever am in town again."

S'I absolutely loved this buffet.  My friends and I chose the option that gave us unlimited mimosas in addition to the buffet, and we could not have been happier.  The food was incredibly fresh, and the presentation was beautiful.  Some of my favorites were the macaroni and cheese, truffles gratin, shrimp miso salad, lamb/ricotta gnocchi, and the french toast.  All phenomenal.  In terms of dessert, it was lovely.  Almost too pretty to eat!  My favorite was the coconut panna cotta in an egg shell.  A wonderful way to end the meal.  I will definitely return here.  Plus, you get the opportunity to walk through the uber-chic Cosmopolitan hotel on your way up to the buffet!'

S'I\'m not a big fan of buffets but when your in vegas you need to at least go to ONE buffet! so we decided to try wicked spoon because several of my friends were raving about wicked spoon and how yummy it is. And boy am I glad we did! This might just be my "go to buffet" when I\'m in vegas. Everything had so much flavor and for a buffet that\'s hard to achieve with so many items in their menu. They had several different types of food ranging from Mexican food, to Asian food to even a cheese bar! my favorite section was the desserts ESP the gelato ice cream specifically the Thai tea one! The only downside of this place was that it was a bit pricey. We went during dinner on a weekday and we paid $43 each person. The price does vary though depending on the time of day that your there! oh and be sure to try and come here before the dinner Rush cause the line can get pretty long!'

S"$54 for brunch buffet and bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's! All 10 girls were GAME ON! \n\nWe arrived on Saturday pretty late into brunch (it IS a bachelorette party, who gets up that early!!) but there was still a good amount of people there. We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks which arrived at the table strikingly fast. \n\nI was overwhelmed by the variety of food and how beautiful each dish was presented! I loved how each dish was portioned for one person to try. I tried the salads, muscles, chicken wings, cheese and bread, mac and cheese, while mushroom spaghetti, and a few other dishes. Every dish was delicious. There was not a dish that I tried that I did not like. The flavors were rich, so super rich.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and got all our drinks on our table in a timely manner. Those girls kept ordering the mimosas and the drinks kept on coming! The buffet area was super clean and everything was presented so neatly and pretty. Every dish sparkled. Not really but to me everything in Cosmo sparkles :)\n\nI wasn't feeling well the day I came here because I was running off a total of four hours of sleep in two days and I had nothing but Crown and greasy junk food in my system. After my second small plate at Wicked Spoon and only my third glass of mimosas, I threw down my napkin. I was really; really SAD I didn't get to try EVERYTHING. That's what happens when you play too hard, you miss out on GOOD food!! :("

S"Wicked Spoon, like the Cosmopolitan Hotel it is housed in, is a welcome breath of fresh air in the culinary buffet scene.  While buffets like Wynn and Bellagio have long dominated, Wicked Spoon does things entirely differently....and succeeds.  It is easily the best new buffet in years.\n\nFor $29 ($37 with unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, and champagne), the weekend brunch presents the following:\n\n- selection of cooked items across more ethnic cuisines than any other buffet can match.  Fried chicken, korean short ribs, Vietnamese Shaking Beef, Thai curry, and dim sum to name a few.\n\n- excellent presentation and an attention to flavorful and delicious food, not just quantity\n\n- the best dessert selection of any buffet.  Rather than soft serve ice cream like many places, they have a full on gelato bar here.  Wow.\n\n- Prime Rib, slab bacon, linguica, Rack of Lamb, and Prime Rib Bone are just a sampling of the excellent carving station\n\n- more high-end pasta dishes and artfully presented in small metal pots than I've seen anywhere.  If you like pasta or carbs, Wicked Spoon will clearly win you over.  Gnocci, butternut squash ravioli, Smoked Mac and Cheese and Cavatelli are among the top choices.  \n\n- great salad and fruit bar, again with innovative and new items like gazpacho puree, blt salads, endive salads, and dipped strawberries that look more like a high end restaurant than a buffet\n\nThe only thing keeping Wicked Spoon from 5 stars and possibly not clearly being the top buffet in Vegas is the following:\n\nSushi - California and spicy tuna rolls.  No nigiri, no other rolls, and no sashimi\n\nSeafood - they had cocktail shrimp and smoked salmon, but no crab legs, jumbo prawns (Aria, Bellagio), or lobster claws or any other notable seafood\n\nSoups - could only find a miso soup.  Missed the rice porridge from Bellagio (for the Asian high rollers) and other soup options.  \n\nOverall, I was thrilled with the value and the variety of Wicked Spoon.  I will clearly be coming here again, but for true seafood lovers, I can see them liking Bellagio, Wynn, or Sterling more.  Nonetheless, while not every item was great, so many things were done right and so differently that Wicked Spoon will be one to bookmark for a long time.\n\nWicked Spoon accepts credit cards, including American Express.\n\nMy Buffet Rankings:\n1) Westin at the Bund, Shanghai - $60/person and an excellent selection of sashimi, seafood, roasted suckling pig and fresh hand tossed Chinese noodles.  \n2) Hakone, Oahu - all-you-can eat toro, uni, kobe beef, and amaebi, $60/pp.  \n3) Sushi House Goyemon, Las Vegas - great nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked appetizer and dessert selection for an unbelievable $26/pp.\n4) Navio at The Ritz Carlton - only down a slot secondary to the astronomical price ($88/price) but made up for with a spectacular view, top notch service and great food.  \n5) Wicked Spoon, Las Vegas - great cooked selection, variety, and high end presentation.  Unmatched desserts and gelato. $29/pp\n6) Bellagio, Las Vegas - congee, prime rib, shrimp/crab, sushi $35/pp"

S"This is my favorite buffet place in Vegas and here's why:\n\nFood display - The appetizers, entrees, desserts are each individually served in their own little bowls or containers. Even though it's still mass produced, the feel is like it's a high class specialty restaurant where you serve yourself, and each dish was thoughtfully put together for you.\n\nVariety & Quality - We're talking bone marrow, fig appetizers by the salad, sushi, crab legs, prime rib, dim sum, gnocchi, shepherd's pie, bbq pork sandwiches made with steam bao, and even a custom mac & cheese bar!  Really something here for everybody, even for those who don't like buffets because they think the quality sucks. The quality of the food is better than some restaurants. Yup!\n\nDesserts - This is one of their biggest selling points, the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  They have beautiful pastries including macaroons and a gelato bar which is incredible!  Numerous varieties of cheesecakes and sugar free items too.  Just an awesome display that looks like a display advertising a French cake shop or a movie set.\n\nOverall, it's such a good foodie experience here it doesn't compare well with other Vegas buffets.  It's more like a fine tasting event where you get to go back for the food you really liked, and there's plenty of that."

S"On my to-do list for Vegas, eating at one of the highly-recommended buffets was a must.  Since we stayed at the Cosmopolitan,  that was the buffet we decided to try. I must say that the buffet is definitely a lot better than buffets I've experienced back home; however, it didn't exceed my expectations. I might have either expected too much or it just wasn't that great. They had a dessert section, but there wasn't anything spectacular- chocolate-dipped strawberries, gelatos, cookies, etc.. I was expecting tiramisu, cheesecakes, pudding, macarons, etc.. What a downer. \n\nThe food selection was OK. They had a ton of salads to choose from- but who goes to a buffet to eat salads? They also tried to be diverse by having Chinese and Japanese dishes (BBQ pork, sushi..) but we all know that non-Asian places never serve great Asian dishes. Their pasta dishes were pretty good, but it's not worth the price we paid.  I heard the buffet at the Wynn was better and wished I had tried that instead but after this disappointment, I avoided all buffets."

I tried bone marrow for the first time. That's what's cool about this Buffet..they have more random things than other buffets.  They also had some duck ravioli. Really cool. Service was there too. Drinks always refilled and the plates were taken away quickly. They have crazy good gelato. My all time favorite of the night was the freshly made prosciutto roll. Don't ask.

S"seriously, this place is my new favorite vegas buffet.  the food is great and there is a ton of variety.  the things that pop out as most memorable to me are the mac and cheese bar (you can seriously have them make almost whatever you can imagine for mac and cheese.  blue cheese, cheddar, bacon, they can do a ton).  they also had a really good pasta section and pizza section that didn't have a ton of choices, but what they had tasted great.  they had chioppino which was really good too, and the extra sauce made it really good to dip other items into.  crab legs were tasty and were already cut so getting the meat out was nice and easy and they also had little dishes of butter for dipping.  the sushi was alright, i think the bellagio is still the winner in the sushi department.  however, they have a korean bbq part here and it has the kalbi ribs which i loved, along with cajun cooked shrimp.  they also have stuff i have not seen at other buffets such as big beef bones cut in half for those who like marrow.  the shrimp cocktails were very good, i probalby had like 20 of those alone haha.  the dessert bar here is absolutely amazing.  they have your typical cakes and stuff, but then they have little plastic shot glasses with mixes of stuff from fruit creme, to mousse, to fudge, to solid chocolate tops with a variety of toppings from fruit to gold leaf and they were all presented very well.  they have a gelato bar that blows the one at the mirage away which is always a big selling point of the mirage buffet to me.  but there are like 10-14 flavors here and the PB&J one is great, along with salted peanut and pistachio, but you can't go wrong with any flavor they offer\n\nonly things i did not like about this buffet are that it seems to be in the very back corner of the cosmo so you literally have to walk half a mile through the casino to get there, and they try to promote signing up for the players card there, but the card they give you is useless until you go to the actual players cards stations in the casino and have them activate a card for you.  but the buffet is excellent, and i will probably be back there when i am back next month"

Mac n cheese bar, if you're in to that and lots of pretty desserts. Nothing was amazing. The best thing I had was the espresso-$6 on top of the $50 per person.

I had other items such as shrimp cocktail in a shot glass, kale salad, cake desserts, etc but I'd say go for the crab leg, prime rib, and chocolate covered strawberries.

S'It\'s funny. I had breakfast here a few months ago. The food was fine, but I walked out thinking that the staff just seemed....well, dickish. My server brought me one water and I never saw him again. I stopped a different server to ask if perhaps my guy was on break. He said, "no," and walked away. Not, "I\'ll get him for you" or even the ideal answer: "How may *I* help?" \n\nBut Wicked Spoon has a bunch of solid reviews, so I held off on writing mine until I could go back for a second opinion.\n\nToday was that day.\n\nI walked in with three friends and approached the cashier shortly after 2pm. Her greeting to us? "Did you hear what she told those people?" \n\nHuh? Did we hear what who told whom?\n\nRolling her eyes to the next cashier, the bundle of hospitality sneered, "she SAID we\'re closed. We close at two." \n\nWell excuse the flying fock out of us. Maybe someone could post a sign to that effect at the entrance? Maybe you could get off your lazy ass and click the velvet rope thingy across the entrance to the zig-zag waiting line chute? Either of those would work since you clearly do not have the personality necessary to communicate the information verbally.\n\nI hadn\'t told my buddies about my first impression of the service here. But every one of us left with a lasting impression this time. \n\nThe cashier could have used fewer words and, frankly, done her JOB by simply being, oh, I dunno...polite. She could have said, "I am so sorry, gentlemen. Buffet seating ends at 2pm daily so we can begin setting up for dinner service. Please come back and see us." But she\'d rather be a bitch. No, not just a bitch. A bitch who was so goddamn lazy, she tried to get us out of there by relying on the other cashier\'s verbiage to some other guests that we never saw.\n\nCosmopolitan? My ass.\n\nActually, I\'m sorta happy things went down this way. The bitchy clerk managed to confirm everything I walked away feeling the first time. And I didn\'t have to blow $25 on the buffet this time.'

After reading these reviews and looking at the pictures I was beyond excited to go here.  We went on a Sunday night around 6:30 and waited in line about 30 minutes.  It was due to shortage of staff though, not the amount of people there.\n\nI had many things I was looking forward too and sadly most of them were not offered on Sunday nights.  There was plenty of options but I had my heart set on a few items that were not available.  The presentation is the best part of this buffet.  It is absolutely adorable.  Everything was prepared with such effort, you could just tell.\n\nSome of my favorite items include: lobster ravioli, Chinese noodle salad, cioppino, and the salty peanut gelato.  My least favorite were the dried up Chinese dishes and the crab legs.  Def do not go here for the crab legs, they were small and not very tasty.\n\nI doubt I will come back, while it was reasonably priced there are just too many other places in Vegas!'

S"Very easily one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. 4 of us had decided to go with their Sunday brunch since I had read pretty good things about it on Yelp. Let's get the qualms and cons out of the way before I start praising the place.\n\nQualm 1- You pay first before you start waiting to get seated. There are two lines for payment - normal guests like you and me, and the diamond VIP guests that pay a lot of $$ to get that status. Very often, people don't read the signs and line up in the diamond line. After you pay, you wait in line. Our wait was about 40 minutes [it would be worth it]\n\nQualm 2 - Our server was a nice and sweet middle aged lady. Problem with that was that she was slow and very not sensitive to our plates piling up and our drinks always going empty. We started playing tetris with our plates to make room for new ones.\n\nQualm 3 - The 'galbi'. The 'Korean beef ribs' were mercilessly overcooked and straight up jerky. Whoever crafted the sauce also made it wayyyy too concentrated and extremely salty. There was so much sauce it was almost chalky. I attempted to take one bite, could even cut the meat off the bones, then left it to be picked up.\n\nThe great things:\nI love the design of the plating and presentations. Mini-pots to hold the heated foods, lovely little plates and cute bowls for the small, chilled dishes. I will agree with some folk that the cute presentation and plating of the foods make for difficult carrying, as only a few dishes would be able to fit on your plate. But you know what? That means more exercise. Walking back to the buffet lines = more calories burned. \n\nThe short-rib eggs benedict was AH-MAY-ZEEENG. The short rib was tender and well seasoned, the eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise sauce was just mild enough, but a great mixture to cohesively blend all the flavors and textures together. Sooo delicious. I went back for two!\n\nThey had flat flat flat thing crust pizzas so that the dough didn't take up too much space in your gut. The BLT salad was very tasty and seemingly light. The pesto gnocchi had a very cheesy feel to them yet they weren't too dense or heavy. Very delicious.\n\nThere were 12 flavors for gelato for dessert, chocolate covered strawberries dipped in crushed oreos, dipped in Heath Bar crumbles, and white chocolate covered marshmallows, along with an assortment of flavored fudges. As simple and common as it was, their peanut butter cookie was super duper delicious. You can tell they didn't hold back on the butter, but boy, was it delicious.\n\nFor a $29+tax brunch, I'd say, the selection was very good, the overall quality was there, although there were a few misses on the dishes [i.e the 'galbi']. I saw that there was slab bacon at the carving table that many were asking to be freshly grilled. Something different and new that I've never seen.\n\nI think the Wicked Spoon made its way to my 'must have' list for my 'things to eat when in Vegas'. Loved it."

S"Just for some background info, the buffet at the Wynn is by far my favorite one in Vegas, and I actually had not been impressed with any other one I had visited (yuck no Bellagio buffet for me). With that said, I decided to check out the Wicked Spoon due to the positive reviews and my desire to stop going to the same places to eat every time I am in Vegas. \n\nI was very pleased with the experience. The service was a little meh, but that's to be expected from a buffet. The food was not outstanding, but it was definitely good for a buffet. The presentation was great, and I didn't feel like the joint was overly crowded, even on a Sunday. I don't know if I'd go again, but I'd say it's definitely worth checking out."

Wine on the table (and also displayed for you to choose from, taste, half glass, full glass, bottle).  Waiters that suggest their favorite dish.  Very modern and clean look to the decor.\n\nFood - includes crab (already cut in half so you can skip the hassle of cracking legs and getting all messy) platters of cheese. fresh fruit. salad bar. mac and cheese. shrimp and grits. many dishes coming in little skillets or platters for easy portion control. \n\nDessert - the biggest array of dessert I have ever seen at a buffet.  French macaroons. cheese cake. gelato for crying out loud! \n\nBy far, the best buffet I've ever had and well worth the cost."

S"I believe this place is a bit overhyped, but I'm gonna give the weekday brunch a try next time. \n\nFor an early Saturday dinner (6:30), I was thanking the heavens above that there was no line. We literally paid and got a table in seconds. Yay! We were starving from walking from Aria and getting lost looking for the place, but what was most disappointing was the variety. I felt like there wasn't as much stuff as Wynn and M Resort buffets. And even though all the dishes were made well, the dessert bar was also underwhelming. I saw all this delicious stuff but everything tasted mediocre. The only things memorable were the sauteed shrimp that's made to order, the risotto, and the gelato. The snow crab legs were cut so thin, and the bone marrow was pretty much all fat. I couldn't get myself to eat more than 1 bone marrow, so that was a bust. Also, the macarons from the dessert bar were too sweet and the texture wasn't right, either. I actually preferred the savory stuff over sweets this time, and that never happens at Vegas buffets for me! Their shrimp was definitely the highlight being so juicy and plump! They give you like four choices of butter to saute in, and ALL of them are amazing!\n\nOverall, I just had really high expectations for the dessert bar, and I was sorely disappointed. However, $22 for a weekday brunch sounds pretty good since their food is pretty fresh, and the only thing I love more than dessert is egg. It's worth giving it a try, but I prefer the M Resort buffet for dinner."

This buffet was in fact one of the best that I've been to anywhere.  It's like a high end restaurant and elegant dining experience, at least again as far as buffets are concerned.  The best part is the small plates and the individual servings to that you can sample lots of different foods, not feel guilty about wasting anything, and not have that buffet feel of scooping out of a big bowl or tray of food.  Lots of choices and everything tasted great."

S'I heard great things about Wicked Spoon for their brunch buffet and decided to try them out.  They are just located inside of Cosmopolitan hotel, and it can be a bit of a walk coming from the LV Blvd entrance.   Buffet is always a good choice when you have a group of indecisive bunch. \n\nThe wait was not too bad compared to the buffets at the popular hotels on the strip.  You can add a few bucks for brunch drinks like mimosa too.  They have pretty much everything from Asian to European for brunch there, and I would even say anything you could think of in brunch would be there.  Totally wicked!  They also have plenty of dessert as well.  The service was decent too.\n\nKnowing Vegas, the food item will probably be different I visit them again, so until next time.'

I stayed away from the prime rim having a small taste from my wifes ... it was really good ... i was there to try everything just a little bite ... i tried my daughters mac and cheese ... i have to say its the best mac and cheese i have tasted ... had bacon in it  ... the potato and truffles was very tasty, Salmon was good, crab legs good, shrimp cocktail good, I didn't try the Korean BBQ ribs ... but my son did he went back for seconds ... the sushi was ehhh ... but its a buffet ... i would skip this and save room for something else ... forgot the names but all 3 types of pizza was good very thin. great many varieties of salad and breads. I like the Louisiana section of the buffet all the dishes was good seafood was good as well. They had bone marrow skipped that looks good though i mean real good like blow your diet good ... ok this is the best part ... if your going to blow your diet ... do here goto the desert bar ... yummy chocolate some of the deserts were like ehhh ... but when you find the one you like you just keep gong back for more :)  ... if you got the cash to blow try it ... but don't do what i did ... ate everything and forgot to take pictures of the food again."

And desserts....I ate macaroons until I literally couldn't breathe anymore.  I've decided to swear off Brazilian grills in favor of Wicked Spoon...with the abundance of options and similar price...I say pick Wicked Spoon.

Cost about 36 dollars for our group although its actually a little cheaper normally cause gratuity was automatically added for us (group of 8).\n\nFirst off, I don't know why but I found the orange juice to be so delicious so def get on that. Standouts for me were the mac and cheese, the little asian bun with some banh mi like ingredients inside, and the desserts. The kalbi was very disappointing, lets hope it usually doesnt suck that bad. I like that they put things out in small portions, prob decreases wasted food. But for the carby things (spaghetti, mac cheese) I wish the portions could be even smaller cause just two servings of that can be really filling already. \n\nThe desserts deserve their own paragraph. The red (velvet?) cookie is bomb as well as the fruit in a chocolate cup. I frickin love chocolate covered strawberries but they also had ones with oreos sprinkled on it, shit is amazing trust. Oh and the gelato is a must, I tried the mango and the mint and both were fantastic. Comes in a tiny cup, great serving size that will allow you to try multiple flavors without overdosing on it.\n\nFood is ok, desserts are the highlight. Would come back next time I'm in vegas."

This allowed me to literally try a little bit of everything, without feeling bad about wasting it if I didn't like it. \n\nI was pretty impressed with the dessert selection, having such a huge sweet tooth. A full gelato station, chocolate covered strawberries and marshmallows, cookies, mini cakes and pastries, and so forth, all presented so beautifully!

They serve it until 2pm.  That is awesome.  We have no desire to wake up early while in Las Vegas.\n\nThere are endless options.  None of which are generic.  Each has a unique touch.  The caramel pancakes were excellent.  The cheesy hashbrowns were also quite good.  They also freshly sliced thick cut bacon.

S"I have tried just about all buffets in Las Vegas and I know the good ones from the bad ones!\n\nHere are the pros...great customer service, great ambiance, descent food, cute way of packaging food items (see pictures through Yelp), interesting and intriguing desserts.\n\nHere are the cons...expensive prices for what they offer (they raised the prices effective the date I went on June 14, 2013).  Lunch is $26 and kid's lunch is $16.  Not all the food is great.  Desserts are overrated!\n\nI personally believe that everyone should try this place at least once.  The style and layout are unique and intriguing.  I talked with one of the managers named Nicholas, who told me that this buffet is the first place to put items in individual containers.  Nicholas also told me that Cesar's Palace and Aria buffets have copied this style.\n\nStay away from the Asian noodles, which tasted really poor in quality.  The sweet potato dish lacked flavor.  The pizzas were doused with salt.  My personal favorite item was the braised beef dish.\n\nThe food did NOT wow me at all and there are tons of buffet places with better quality food.  Besides the food, everything else about this place wowed me, but I did not come to pay $88 for my family to be wowed by customer service and decor.  Its all about the food and I think this place lacks good quality.  My wife and I agree that half the dishes are good and half the dishes are bad.  That is 50%, which means the price should be at $13.  We will never be back, but it was definitely worth at least trying once in a lifetime.\n\nThe location of the buffet is tucked away on the 2nd floor in the way back of the casino.  I believe as a result of this, the buffet will fail to thrive and they will keep raising prices to compensate for this.  I also think the cuteness of the way the dishes are packaged will die off and more people will enjoy going to Cesar's and Aria buffets more."

S"3125 reviews, 4328 photos, & a 4-star rating of the Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan of Vegas. I loved what I read & the pics that I saw of the many upscale-type offerings + their unique presentations.  I was looking forward to trying this AYCE, as my expectations were based on high standards from similar previous buffet experiences at Bellagio, Wynn, & Paris.\n \nHowever, I was so disappointed in my dining experience at WS for the following reasons:\n\n- Changes in the buffet offerings.   Many of the buffet offerings were not reflective of early Yelp reviews/photos posted since it opened in Dec. 2010. Foods were at one time presented in unique eye-catching servers in small portions so that you could try as much as possible, i.e., samples in mini pots, serving spoons, & bowls. While there were a few creative servings, e.g., noodles in Chinese take-out containers, fried chicken in mini fryer baskets, & boiled peanuts in paper cones, most of the food items are in large serving trays; just grab a serving spoon& serve yourself, just as in any buffet. Perhaps it proved to be too labor-intensive to offer so many individualized portions. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=VkwXpPWxl7tN4yK8ETxjLA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=J9VUSLI3495TZ2MFxhpgvA \n\n- Many of the foods were not palatable. For example, the Chinese roast pork had crispy skins, but they were so tough that they were inedible; the snow crab legs were served cold, & they were the tiniest crab legs that I have ever seen w/ more shell than meat. Food items were simply overcooked, dried out from standing under a warmer for a length of time, & just plain tasteless. (Must give WS credit though, for offering upscale items, e.g., bone marrow, blackened fish, mac & cheese bar, kale salad; but they also had many items similarly offered at other buffets, e.g., pizzas, breads, teri chicken, beef ribs, potatoes, etc.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=-D60mxtVvUjwZ68IBp0YhQ \n\n- No lines to get into the buffet.  The top buffets in Vegas always have long lines that zigzag like you're waiting for a ride in Disneyland.  We walked right in for dinner at 6pm on a Tuesday evening w/ no lines whatsoever.  The dining room was not crowded. There apparently wasn't a demand for this buffet.\n\n- Buy one get one free offer was not available. Prior to leaving for Vegas, the local newspaper had an article re United Airlines offering a BOGO coupon for the WS on its Vegas flights; Yelp reviews also made mention of it. As I was flying on UAL, I asked the flight attendant on the Vegas leg re the coupon, & she/other attendants didn't know anything about it; never got the coupon. While we were at WS, I asked the manager, who said that the coupons were given out on only certain flights, such as those coming from Newark, NJ, but he was uncertain as to which flights. Although we had our UAL boarding passes, he said he could not honor those & could only honor the coupons if we had them. Then he told me to bring this to the attention of UAL, as they should clarify as to which flights had the coupons, while thanking me for bringing this to his attention so that he could alert his marketing people. \n\nYou would think that giving one BOGO coupon as a goodwill gesture would hardly make a dent in its profits. No deal.  Plus, wonder why they're even giving BOGO coupons - is it because there's no longer the demand of people flocking to it?\n\n- The price is high considering what you get. We paid $38/person for dinner on a weekday night ($47 on weekends). While the service is adequate, the quality of the food items does not justify this price. \n\nThe saving grace for this buffet is its dessert station.  They had a wonderful gelato/sorbet bar (loved the Thai iced tea & salted peanut caramel flavors) & heavenly huge chocolate-covered strawberries garnished w/ oreo cookie bits or Heath crunch bits. The extensive dessert station included chocolate molten lava cakes, pretty decorated cakes, raspberry/chocolate coffee rice krispy treats, red velvet cookies, parfaits, apple strudel, panna cotta, white chocolate mousse cones, macarons, etc.  Most of the desserts were excellent, but I would not pay $38 just to eat their desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=6PSAjVXFwaLgYS3mN4I30Q  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=m4V11SUeP5XB1V3q9j_WNg \n \nAt least I can say I've dined here.

S'What I hate about buffets, the scary amount of food and food touching each other on the plate. Wicked spoon is awesome because its like tapas style, so everything comes in smaller individual portions. Granted, you might have to make multiple trips but thats part of the fun when it comes to buffets. \n\nI loved how all the food was portioned and you can try everything and always go back for more. You can avoid wasting food! All the main hot food had better presentation that it almost felt like I was at a restaurant and not at a buffet where im scooping food onto my plate like at a school cafeteria. \n\nEverything was so good. I had some great gnocchi, ravioli, filet mignon strips, crap cocktail with lemon. \n\nCons: there were some food that came in such tiny portions and it was hard to eat lots of it without looking like a compulsive hoarder. \n\nI say come here for a non traditional buffet experience. Everyone goes to the Wynn and Bellagio and trust me, it gets really old fast.'

S"Swanky, bougie, beautiful, & yummy pretty much describes the Cosmopolitan when I first stepped foot in this hotel and coincidently, these are the words that describe the Wicked Spoon buffet as well!\n\nAt $19 for a lunch buffet, you're paying for eye-candy, creative displays of food, and a taste of around-the-world! Korean, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, American cuisines & moooore! I especially loved that foods like mac n' cheese & chicken pot pie came in a mini-metal pot that kept them warm and fun to look at and eat. Heck, even water at each table came in a tall glass bottle. Sweet potato fries came in a mini-fryer and the desserts? OH MYYYY! My absolute favorite part of my lunch! Gelato, milk & white chocolate covered strawberries & mini apples, macaroons, cute little cups filled with cakes, alll YUMMMY...and aphrodisiacs ;]. My lunch definitely entertained my eyes and tummy.\n\nSadly, aside from all of the glitz and beauty of it all, what knocks off a star would be the lack of SEAFOOD during lunch. Where's my fish? Salmon? Oysters? Crab legs?? These were probably all available during dinner, but I wish I had em' for lunch!! Nonetheless, even though it wasn't tooo big of a buffet, I'd experience Wicked Spoon again at the price of $19! You'll most definitely be eating with your eyes here."

The food wasn't spectacular, but good enough for me to finish everything I brought to my table. Disappointed with the crab legs. Otherwise, they had some items to make me consider coming back next time. The price was reasonable. The suite I stay in and the style of the hotel are what attract me here. And the buffet is convenient. The ambience at the buffet is appealing and somewhat unique. They think outside the box to some extent and it works.

Lunch was only $19.\n\nThe decor is very clean.  The food is laid on fairly well.  There is a sushi/sashimi section (with other Asian food such as pho, dim sum, etc.).  There are lots of small pots with beef, chicken, port, etc.  There is a carving station for turkey, prime rib, ham, etc.  The salad bar is also very nice.  Overall, the selection, cleanliness, and quality of food was top notch.\n\nI knocked off 1 star because the dim sum area was under a heat lamp that severely dried out the food.  It's really annoying trying to eat shrimp har gow with a paper dry skin.\n\nThe dessert was AWESOME!  The gelato station was great and i especially loved it because they have sorbetto.\n\nThe chocolate is the good stuff and top quality.\n\nThis is a great addition to the Las Vegas buffets and is my new favorite."

S'This used to be our "go to" for buffets.  The boyfriend and I decided to try it out when they first opened, and found that we enjoyed the pre-divided portions.  (Mind you, not everything was like that.  There were also food served the traditional buffet way.)  Apparently, you either love this particular serving style or you hate it.  We loved it.  Food and service quality were definitely up to par.  They have a variety of food and have choices available that aren\'t your typical buffet fare.  They also have a mac and cheese bar, which I loved since I am a mac and cheese feign.  I think the thing I enjoyed most was the desserts.  I\'m not a big sweets person so I chose the French macaroons and the white chocolate dipped crab apples and strawberries.  However, for the people with a sweet tooth, they have a variety of gelato, fudge, cakes, and whatever else.  \n\nUnfortunately, we\'ve heard that the food isn\'t the same as it was before so we haven\'t been back.  They also raised their prices (it used to be $29, I think).  It\'s now $35, which is a bit steep if I\'m not guaranteed amazing food.'

S"***This was my first visit to a Las Vegas buffet in over 5 years; I had the breakfast buffet at Wicked Spoon (in The Cosmopolitan) and the quality varied with some items being surprisingly good while the majority of food was in the decent to mediocre range (a few of the items were below average)***\n\nIn terms of Las Vegas buffets, I've only been to the Bellagio Buffet and that was just for breakfast.  Wicked Spoon in The Cosmopolitan became my second trip to a Vegas buffet (also for breakfast).  This trip though yielded both breakfast and lunch and dinner items (I do not remember the Bellagio Buffet offering many dinner items at breakfast, but that was a long time ago).\n\nThere were a wide variety of lunch and dinner items.  There were several stations I did not try like the sushi and Chinese food.  I did try some more of their New American offerings though.  All of it was kind of just okay.  The crispy chicken wings were crunchy and crispy and well seasoned, but they had been sitting around too long.  The duck confit ravioli was not bad, but it was really kind of a just okay flavor--heavy and not that interesting of a cream sauce.  The beef short rib was decent--moist and tender.  The tri-tip (sliced to order) was just okay.\n\nIn terms of breakfast, their selection was impressive.  They had several breakfast pastries, breads and muffins available.  Some looked better than others.  The pain au chocolat was not bad for a breakfast buffet.\n\nThere was also a good number of cold items from fresh fruit to several salads.  For more heartier breakfast items, Wicked Spoon had about every dish you would expect to find at one of those all-day breakfast places.  There were many egg dishes (as well as eggs made to order), pancakes, French toast, and several breakfast meat offerings.\n\nThe breakfast meats stood out the most.  There were two kinds of bacon.  The first was crispy strips of bacon (piled up in a traditional buffet serving dish).  For breakfast buffet bacon, this was pretty good.  The bacon was crispy but not burnt and there was a decent meaty chew.  There was also a smoked bacon that they sliced to order, which had a meatier and more tender feel to it (closer to braised pork belly than traditional breakfast bacon).\n\nThe chicken apple sausage was good--moist and nicely seasoned with a decent amount of spice.\n\nThe French toast was also good--light and fluffy (with a good flavor).  The pancakes were fine.\n\nThe eggs Benedict was just okay.  The hollandaise sauce was too thick and the meat was thickly shaved ham as opposed to Canadian bacon.  I also tried an omelet made to order and it was not that good.  It was not that fluffy and the cheese was not melted at all.\n\nIn addition to their many savory offerings at breakfast, Wicked Spoon also offers a wide variety of desserts.  There were cakes, housemade marshmallows, chocolate molten cakes (though not that molten), and gelato.  The flavors of the gelato were very good--a nice caramel and a distinct pistachio flavor.  The gelato was creamy and smooth but a tad too soft.\n\nService was okay.  The staff was quick with getting drink orders in, but they were kind of slow in taking away plates.\n\nThe price was right around $25.  I think that is about what you would expect to pay at breakfast buffets at similar Las Vegas hotels.\n\nThe dining room is comfortable enough though I remember the Bellagio Buffet having more booth seating.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet offers a great variety of food for breakfast.  Some of their offerings (like their breakfast meats) are quite good, but most items fall in the just okay or maybe slightly below average range.  Still, if you like buffets because of the great amount of choice they offer, Wicked Spoon seems like a good option.\n\nI know The Cosmopolitan offers free valet parking.  I think this hotel also offers free self parking."

S'A SOLID 4 stars. Why? \n\n1. Food is bomb. Talk about upscale variety? Wicked Spoon is the place to go.\n2. Plating is onnnnn point. They\'ve definitely conquered the whole "presentation is key" thing. It\'s impressive and makes this place seem fancy shmancy.\n3. The desserts are just too cute. \n\nBUT, I\'m not too keen on the pricing for this place. It\'s SO expensive and there\'s not a real good selection of seafood (unlike the Wynn Buffet). You\'re basically paying for the presentation and the "new hot spot." (Everything in the Cosmo is new and exciting! Woo! So the prices are sky high!...).\n\nOverall I was impressed with the food here. My top buffet in Vegas? Not quite - I still much prefer The Bellagio :)'

The serving areas were dirty and didn't see anyone cleaning them.

There was no way we could try it all. From the custom Mac and Cheese bar, to risotto, to scallops, prawn cocktails, roast meat section, Korean BBQ section, make your own Ramen noodles, Sushi and not to mention the amazing desserts.

S"Wow, I was so utterly blown away about how disappointing this buffet was. I was expecting so much, but I was so let down. Maybe it's cuz we went for brunch... Maybe it was because my palette was all messed up..\n\nREGARDLESS, the only thing good was the dessert, and even of the desserts, the gelato was good, the little cups of chocolate layered mousse and stuff was tasty, and ... that's it. The chocolate covered strawberries could have been better but I guess since strawberries aren't in season, they were meh.\n\nThe service was pretty shitty. We were in a group of 13 or so, and so they tacked on a gratuity fee onto our charges. I guess that's they they didn't clear our plates as quickly we would've liked. We came back with more food to find that we had no places to put our new plates. \n\nUgh.. i'm going to the Wynn buffet next time."

The chinese dishes are a bit underwhelming but their miso glazed chen is actually pretty good.   They serve some of their food in tiny pots which make it look more appetizing.

Had it not been so early, I would have, but something about sushi so early is not appetizing to me.

S"I went for both brunch and dinner. My first time impression of brunch was Wow, as presentation was excellent. They had macaron at dessert section. It was all about dessert for me since I love dessert...who doesn't?\n\nHowever, when I went for dinner recently, my whole impression of this place changed. I do not plan to return for dinner, ever, if anything maybe for brunch if it's suggested. Definitely over rated, over priced for what they offer. It was $35 for dinner and supposed to be gourmet but I couldn't find any item that can be considered gourmet. Almost no seafood (They had mediocre, lack of flavor salmon, cod, crab legs) and their overall selection was not good at all. I couldn't find any single dinner item that I liked. I'd rather spend $35 at somewhere else that eating mediocre food. However, I had at least hopes up for dessert as they left good impression when I went for brunch months ago... and it failed too. Their dessert was not as good as before, lack of flavor, everything was just so sugarly sweet. \n\nAs mentioned not sure if I'd return here. If anything, yea, maybe for brunch........"

S"Friends and I decided to give this new buffet a try after hearing all the great reviews.  I had gotten no more than 5 hours of sleep over the course of 48 hours (combination of work, partying, gambling, and attending a conference).  After Monday's seminar headed back to my room at the Palazzo and decided to find some food.  I wanted to dine at L'Atelier but my buddy isn't a huge fan of French and wanted to dine at a casual restaurant.  We couldn't come to a conclusion as to where to go so I threw out Wicked Spoon.  \n\nValet'ed the car and proceeded to look for the buffet.  There are some signs that point you in the general direction but of course we got lost.  Ended up asking the security guard where the place was and we were told to back track and head up the escalator (they need to have more signs for new visitors).  Was surprised to find the place fairly empty (perhaps it was due to the fact that it was a Monday and we were eating at around 6:30).  \n\nI was told by various cab drivers that the food quality is just so so but they really do spend time on the presentation of all their dishes.\n\nTried various dishes and found some that I liked and others that were just average.  My complaints for the night were with a few of the desserts and also with their roast beef/prime rib.  The beef served was tougher than what I'd find at Norm's and had virtually no taste at all.  I did fall in love with their bean sprout dish (seasoned with seasame oil, vinegar, and soy sauce..i think).  Their gelato/ice creams were average but they had these huge chocolate covered strawberries.  \n\nServie was ok and noticed our waiter only taking away 2-3 plates at a time...homie needs a bigger tray or hire more people to help clear the tables.  There were several times where we had stacks of plates just sitting in front of us while the server just casually walked around carrying drinks or just 1-2 dishes on his tray.  As others have stated, this buffet is very affordable at $35/ person.  Will go back again if I'm ever in the mood for a buffet."

I also love that you have put little entertaining pieces along the way such as ginormous shoes, statues, and telescopes where I can take fun pictures with my friends.  \n\nAlthough the price to get through to you was almost $40 on Memorial weekend, I think you were worth it for the ENDLESS mimosas, the excellent service you gave me and my friends and the AMAZING quality of your food.  \n\nI loved how your waiters were super efficient and anticipated the needs of my whole group.  Your cute presentation of each dish is a genius idea and the portion is just perfect.  The variety of food you gave me made me oooo and ahhh as I made my rounds.  The pasta and mashed potatoes were so creamy, the meat was melt in my mouth tender, the dessert station and especially the cookies and cream ice cream blew my mind as you tingled my taste buds left and right.  I had one crazy food session with you!\n\nI left feeling full and completely satisfied by how good you treated me.  And!  If you're wondering if I'll come back to you for more?

Luckily, we didn't have to wait in line since one of us was a platinum member staying at the cosmopolitan hotel.  Food was mediocre...presentation was cute but the food was not good. It was a waste of $36. The presentation was nice, the 2 pieces of fried chicken wings came in a little fryer. The mac n cheese came in a little pot, 2 cocktail shrimps in a shot cup, edamame in tiny to-go boxes, like I said it was all looks. The taste of the food should have been better. They did have a good selection on desserts, but even that wasn't enough to make up for the taste of the food. Great selection on gelato! I didn't see any macaroons. Feta sprinkled watermelon was amazingly sweet! No crablegs here! Not for lunch anyway, not sure about dinner. Overall, I wouldn't return for another meal..not worth the wait or my money."

S"Simple is beautiful (sometimes) and this is where Wicked Spoon gets it wrong. \n\nChocolate covered strawberries mmmm.. but wait.. chocolate covered strawberries with oreo crumbs?! Mm no thank you. What a disappointment. I came all the way to Wicked Spoon for the unlimited chocolate covered strawberries only to find them covered with all kinds of big sized chunky crumbs. If the crumbs were significantly smaller and crumbier, then maybe it would go better, but they weren't. Chocolate covered strawberries by themselves are amazing, so there really isn't any need to add anything else to them. \n\nAs for the rest of the buffet, well, Wicked Spoon went simple with the selection, and that is why I added sometimes to my comment above. Simple isn't always best, especially when it comes to the selection of food at a buffet. There were very little choices. They had like one item from each food group, which I guess is fine for those who don't eat much, but um this is a buffet. \n\nWicked Spoon should spend less time sprinkling crumbs onto their strawberries and more time expanding the food offerings.\n\nTips for the lines:\n     - They have two lines, one to pay and one to be seated. I'd recommend having half your party stand in the pay line and the other half in the seating line. That way when you're done paying you don't have to wait in line all over again.\n     - You could just stand in the to be seated line and say that you didn't know the two lines were different. We did that the first time we went here and they just let us pay really quickly and seated us. Though, we actually didn't know the lines were different."

But one can only eat so much bone marrow before feeling like you've just been sucking the fat off a bone.. oh wait... \n\nI laid off most of the carbs wherever I could and set my sights on proteins prepared in different, interesting ways and then concluding with a rather large plate of desserts and gelato :) \n\nThe food was definitely beautifully presented and quite filling.

They were offering Personal Omelets, however I just wanted a thin layer of egg, crepe style. I tried to tell the cook that, but he thought that he knew better and proceeded to make it his way and then gave me a lecture as to how an omelette is made. What is the point of having a personal cook when they don't listen to what you want. I was so put off by this, I almost lost my appetite. Almost, but the thought of the dessert station help sooth my tummy.\n\nI would have given this place 4 stars, but I must remove one for the attitude of the cook at the omelet station."

Their salad station was excellent. I loved the caesar salad and the kale salad, and really appreciated that they had brie, cheeses, and fruits. Oh! And bagels with smoked salmon! I also got to try bone marrow for the first time (I always think that buffets should be an opportunity to try lots of new foods!), and the fact that they had chocolate dipped strawberries was all sorts of fabulous. \n\nI would skip their lava cake because it's not lava cake... take it if you want a chocolate cake though.

S"The Wicked Spoon has to be my favorite buffet in Vegas.  It's an experience to go there and that's why I enjoy it so much.  I wanted so badly to give it 5 stars, but I could not due to just a few shortcomings.\n\nThe Food:\n\nWicked Spoon has some amazing selections.  Their salad bar is top notch.  They always have quite a few selections.  Everything tastes fresh and good.  They have the delicious staples of any high-priced Vegas buffet, such a prime rib and crab legs.  Both are delicious of course.  Other highlights include the pork tostadas and any fish dishes they have.  Although it wasn't out this time, I really enjoy their General Tsao's Chicken.\n\nThe mac and cheese station fails in that the mac and cheese oddly enough comes out too cheesy.  No one who got something at that station liked it.  Unfortunately, I think they fail with many of their unique and obscure dishes that you probably wouldn't find at other buffets.  They put out these dishes in hopes of being different and appeasing to different tastes.  Unfortunately, the food is usually not too good.  And the fact that these dishes and rarely touched and pile up in the buffet line goes to show that not too many people are interested.  Most of the unpopular dishes can be found in the italian/pasta area.  I would hope that they track the popularity of their dishes and adjust accordingly.    They could come up with tastier offerings.\n\nThe Dessert:\n\nDelicious!  The cookies are great.  The chocolate-dipped strawberries are good as well.  Although, I think they offer too many of the mini-cup desserts.  I'm sure those help them keep costs low, but they don't taste good.  \n\nThe Drinks:\n\nI like that they leave the giant water bottles on the table and that they're cold.  They have a huge alcoholic beverage selection and also feature happy hours.\n\nThe Service:\n\nLacking.  We had the 18% auto-grat added as we had a party of 11.  I'm totally cool with paying that, as it's the norm everywhere in the US.  Unfortunately, the service did not match.  While our busser/server was pleasant, she rarely came by.  Our dishes would stack up and non-water drinks would get empty.  I think I saw for our area of about 50 tables to the right of the dessert station, there were only 2 bussers/servers.  This was a Saturday night AND St. Patrick's Day.  They were way over worked.  The buffet was busy but did not have a line to get in, so maybe that's why they were a little understaffed.  That would not keep me from coming back.  I am a water drinker and don't mind the dishes piling up.\n\nThe Price:\n\nFor $35, you get what you pay for.  I also liked the fact that they didn't jack up the price for St. Patrick's Day.  The M Buffet was $50!  Really?\n\nOverall, I like this buffet a lot and would recommend everyone try it at least once."

You choose what ingredients you want, cheeses, veggies, meats, they melt it all together, throw in the pasta, and BAM! YUM YUM YUM!\n\nThis buffet is a very cool concept and the food is very good, but it does not feel like a buffet!  With all the food in individual dishes, I felt like I was limited to amount of what I ate (Fat American syndrome)!  It is all you can eat, but who wants to put four mini pans on their plate?\n\nLuckily I didn't pay for this buffet.  Why you ask?

S"Lunch was a huge letdown. We've been before and loved it. This time TONS of breakfast food. I asked if they would be putting out more lunch offerings since it was after 12:30 - they said no. No prime rib, meet selection extremely average. I don't care for seafood, so this review may not be meaningful for people who love that. For me, they had a small selection and it was a big letdown. Staff was very nice and room well appointed. I just think that on a relatively quiet day, it should still be good and it wasn't. Cesars was 1000% better. More small plates of yummy things and more variety. You may want to see what they put out before you pony up the $. Very disappointed. If you want breakfast the huge servings as the Hash House a go-go while not a buffet are much better."

S"So Wicked Spoon eh....\n\nDont know what the hype is about this Wicked Spoon Buffet other than that it's new and in the Cosmo and has a price tag of about $40 for dinner. \n\nI'm gonna start off with the layout and presentation. The Cosmo hotel itself is every small and cramped and that is pretty much what the buffet looked like as well. Much of the food served was is these small tin cans ? Felt like I was in the Slammer being served jail food through my cell...  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=eqiFJ7qkX5dgwgooJ4SdGg&select=6QNDRT0wDwyala6eJ7fiFg\n\nFood: Blah !  I've tried WAY better. (Such as the M Resort Buffet) You would think since its a new Hotel that they would ante up higher on the quality of food... but no. \n\nCrab legs - looked more like shrimp legs\nKorean short Ribs - since I am korean, any short ribs away from my  house or koreatown bbq buffets wont compare. \nMeats- very small selection \nSalad- I did enjoy the ceasar salad, also served in small jail cell tin cans. I would take 2 bites and get another tin can, Thats how small the jail cell tin cans were.\n\nOverall this buffet is a mess. I came along with two of my close friends and they agreed as well as we were discussing it while all sitting in the bathroom stalls taking our load off from this nasty food. I mean for the price tag you would expect alot more. I would rather go to hometown buffet than wicked spoon.... wickedly nasty\n \nYou want a real buffet in Vegas ? go to the http://www.yelp.com/biz/studio-b-buffet-henderson"

Nothing ever really wows me or makes me mouth water so for me to find even one food item that I actually like is surprising. At Wicked Spoon, I found three.\n\nMission Figs- Blue Cheese and Candied Bacon\nWild Boar Sloppy Joe\nDuck Ravioli\n\nI really don't like bacon and blue cheese but man, the figs? So impeccably sweet, tangy, and salty with a bite. Amazing- I could probably gorge myself on just this.\n\nWild Boar Sloppy Joe- it had an interesting flavor that I can't really describe, only it was pulled meat and oh-so-good.\n\nDuck Raviolo- again, really interesting flavor. I really liked it though. It was extremely creamy and flavorful.\n\nThese three items alone would make me come here again. Buffets never really make me happy or excited except- maybe this one.

S'Back home on the East Coast, planning for my Vegas trip, the Wicked Spoon had become almost legendary in my mind. The reality was... well, almost as good.\n\nI came at lunchtime on a Tuesday and there was no line. The buffet is a little smaller than I expected, but still, you will be well fed. They have a lot of unusual items that make your meal an interesting one. The surprises, to me: duck wings were particularly memorable, as was the polenta with escargot, porcini, and garlic butter reduction. At buffets I always think of potatoes and polenta as the cheap foods they try to fill you up with, but that was some seriously delicious polenta. And the bone marrow is a great feature of this buffet... risking a heart attack, I got it again each time I got up for a new plate. I\'d never had it before but now I will crave it.\n\nWicked Spoon is especially well-known for its desserts, and maybe this is just because it was lunchtime, but I really didn\'t think they were that impressive. The gelato selection is great, and they have a lot of chocolate-covered strawberries... but most of the options were skip-able to me. It\'s definitely way better than most buffets in this aspect, however.\n\nMy server was excellent (African American lady, nose piercing-- I don\'t know her name, but if management sees this I\'d like them to be able to identify her!). She was attentive and treated customers with respect-- and by that I mean her vibe was "you\'re a person to me, not just another table I have to deal with." \n\nWhile I was in Vegas I ate at both this place and Bacchanal. Honestly if you\'re going to choose just one I\'d go with Bacchanal, but it\'s a close match. And, there\'s an Art-o-Mat machine right outside it-- a converted former cigarette machine that sells unique art at $5 a box!'

However, I was highly disappointed. \n\nI tried a little of everything they had to offer  - fried rice, spicy orange chicken, Korean  style pork, crab legs, fish & chips, Mac and cheese, salmon, another type of fish, and a bit of the salad bar offerings.. All were mediocre at best! \n\nDesserts were good, and they had plenty of choices.. But again, nothing spectacular. \n\nWe paid $35 for dinner. For this price, I'd recommend going to Bellagio..

S"This buffet is not like any I've ever been to before.  They plate servings of their food on individual plates; you won't find any large trays of food sitting above blue flames here!  Also, every item of food sounds like something that could be on a menu at a nice restaurant.  Between me and my girlfriend, we tried a lot of the dishes, and I found that around 50% of the things I tried were delicious.  The other 50% were usually either too bland or too salty.  That being said, this was my first time at the Wicked Spoon, so I didn't really know what was good and what to avoid.\n\nMy favorite was the gnocchi, which was rich and creamy (almost ricotta status) and came in a creamy meat sauce.  The crab legs were cooked in lemon, butter and thyme, and it was very tasty and well cooked.  I had heard about the wonderful bone marrow, and I definitely love myself some osso bucco, but honestly, bone marrow by itself is not my cup of tea.  Maybe if I had thought to spread it on some french bread, my opinion would change, but alas, I did not think of it at the time.  General Tsao's chicken was good for the diner who doesn't like to stray from his/her Panda Express-comfort-zone.  Despite high expectations, truffled potatoes were just potatoes to my palate.  Green gazpacho was too acidic; I would forget the novelty and use red tomatoes next time.  I don't remember which pizza I tried, but ignoring the slightly stale-tasting crust, it was quite delicious; would definitely want to try this freshly baked.  This is all I can remember right now; if I remember anything else, I will add it on later.\n\nI was disappointed that I didn't read all the reviews about the wonders of the dessert bar beforehand, because we didn't allow any stomach vacancy for sweets.  We meant to... but I'm a savory guy at heart, and it's hard to stop myself when there's so much to try.\n\nBottom line:  I don't know if $35 is high or low for a nice, Vegas buffet, but (once my next paycheck gets cashed) I would hop right back in line at the Wicked Spoon, and go straight for the standouts from my last visit.  AND, I would save room for dessert!"

S"I went here on recommendations from several friends who swear by it. The plating is great. They use small pots and pans to serve the food. Its very novelty, but functional as a way of portion control. I went on a friday for lunch\nUnfortunately I didn't find the quality of food acceptable...\nI grabbed a piece of fried chicken and discovered upon returning to my table that there were still feathers in the chicken...battered, fried and all. Not just one or two, but about a dozen.\nAdditionally, the water they server is a filtered water delivered to your table in a glass bottle-- It had floaties. It looked like someone had backwashed into the water they were serving us. \nAlso, just something that irked me was at the dessert counter. The plates (as with the rest of the buffet) are kept warm under heat lamps. Unfortunately when you grab a piece of chocolate or some ice cream, it instantly melts. Not very gourmet to slurp lukewarm ice cream sludge. A room temperature plate would have been nice.\n\nAfter all of this I spoke to the manager. I explained the problems one at a time. His response was to give us complimentary cocktails. A nice gesture, and it cured my sour mood, but this is not a fix to the problem. He offered no apology or explanation, nor did he make any indication that this would be fixed. \n\nMy opinion of this establishment is that they care more about appearances than quality. It would definitely recommend AGAINST eating here."

S'The hype is that it\'s "organic" which I\'ve been hearing from people\'s mouths is not why it\'s popular...it\'s the fact that the dishes are different from other buffets. Red velvet pancakes, food served in small pots, foie gras...just stuff you wouldn\'t see at other buffets.\n\nFor $35 and quick line movement, this place is a def must stop if you\'re in vegas. I didn\'t want to go here in the beginning because I thought the hype would make this place a long wait, but for a group of 10+, we didn\'t wait more than 20 minutes. They didn\'t have crab legs, but I thought the food itself was worthy of $35. My favorite was def the pesto mashed potato, the red velvet pancakes, and the eggs benedict (i went back and got 2). They even had seaweed salad which costs about $7 at the supermarket for only 3 chopsticks full.\n\nThe reason I gave it a 4 was because when we went they weren\'t making red velvet pancakes, but they were available upon request. The waitress who served us got irritated with us because we requested it and said that we were, "wasting her time and to ask the chef to make it" even though the chef had asked us to ask the waitress. I thought it was rude and was going to complain to the mgr, but I think the waitress heard us wanting to complain and then became very nice to us all of a sudden. Of course one waitress shouldn\'t be a complaint to the establishment in general, so I would go back.'

I particularly liked that their cocktail shrimp, which came in shot glasses so people aren't digging through a pile. That can get a little unsanitary in a hurry. I loved their carving station. Their beef sirloin was one of the best that I've had in a while at a buffet.\n\nService: For a Vegas buffet, they have the best service! They were constantly clearing our table of our empty plates and filling our drinks. I have not seen this level of service at all of the other current top buffets including the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace. All of their food stations are also kept very clean.\n\nLocation: It is located in the Cosmopolitan next to the elevators to the hotel rooms. Very convenient if you're staying at the hotel.

You go into 2 lines.  One was to pay and I thought that was it. No, you have to wait in the seated line which took us 5 mins to wait and get a seat...when there was no one there expect my party in line.   All that is fine.  The problem I had was our waitress. Older woman who was very sarcastic to us.  She asked what we like to drink and we all wanted water....she said "really, that\'s it?" and then several times when she picked up our dishes she said, " You guys are the best people I have waited on." Now we barely talked to her or said anything that would make her act like that. One girl in our party made it a mission to be super nice to everyone that served us! Which she did!

S'The Wicked Spoon Buffet is located on the 2nd floor of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.  Just take the escalators nearest the check-in desk to the second floor and follow the signs......or the aroma of food, I\'m sure either one will lead you to this food mecca.\n\nMy friend and I decided to to skip any breakfast completely and went to directly to Wicked Spoon for their brunch buffet.  Priced at $22.00, the brunch buffet is available Monday thru Friday from 8am till 2pm.\n\nThe selections for brunch were quite diverse, and I truly appreciated that since it was 10am....a little too late for breakfast, but perhaps for some, still early for lunch.  Breakfast foods included sausages, fruits, cheeses, breads, bagels, and parfait.  Other standouts and favorites included the sushi, pizzas, ravioli, and fried chicken.  \n\nThe food was very satisfactory, but for me in particular there wasn\'t that "wow" factor that took my breath away.  However, I think Wicked Spoon makes an impression with their presentation, such as the fried chicken served in miniature deep fryer basket, whilst the ravioli was served in tiny fry pans.  \n\nBEST:  The most memorable part about brunch:  dessert, of course.  I wish I had saved more room for dessert because the choices and selection would have satisfied any and all sweet tooth cravings.  Not wanting to over indulge, I made sure I chose only what I knew I would finish.  I ended up with 2 raspberry macaroons, 1 cheesecake, and 1 pecan pie.  Loved dessert.\n\nSERVICE:  Good.  Not excellent....but good and satisfactory.  The server was friendly enough, but we had to wait for what seemed like a century before we got refills for our soda.\n\nBottom Line:  I thought the price for brunch was reasonable and the selection was satisfactory.  I wouldn\'t rule out another visit to Wicked Spoon, but perhaps for dinner next time.'

We were getting a little frustrated because there were obviously empty tables inside but they were just not filling them for some odd reason, AND we were dying of thirst. We were so dehydrated and just wanted some water. So when we got towards the front, we complained to who I'm guessing was the manager because he was wearing a suit and dressed differently from the others, and he actually brought us cups of water to sip on while waiting in line! SO nice of him! I really wasn't expecting that.\n\nAs for the food, it was GREAT! I actually liked the food better this time around more than my first trip here when I came for dinner. This time, they didn't have the bone marrow or crab legs, and only one kind of mac & cheese though... but everything I tried was delicious! I really liked the shrimp cocktail which comes in shotglasses with the cocktail sauce in them already. The tritip was pretty good too! I even loved the edamame because it had this addictive seasoning on it. This buffet is unique because everything comes in small portions already and you can just grab the little plates to place on your tray. No scooping necessary, which is AWESOME.\n\nTheir gelato bar is so cute and a must try! The scoops and bowls are super mini so you don't feel so guilty trying all these different flavors. ;)"

They aren't greasy at all).\n\nThe buffet was especially pricey on President's Day Weekend as well. I was expecting much more. Overall, I would say avoid the buffets in Vegas. While the idea is cool, none of them delivered or met my expectations."

S'Buffets are a true part of Las Vegas culture. Whether it be from the old town Vegas from the likes of The Golden Nugget to the heights of the new strip at the Bellagio, the buffet is a must visit in between the gambling & drinking...\nIn saying this, The Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan is a must. From the decor within restaurant, to the cute little little ways of serving their food & most of all the quality of the food. \nYou may be paying a little more than your average Las Vegas buffet, however your taste buds will thank you for that little extra on you credit card. You name it, you can virtually get it at the Wicked Spoon, however be prepared to lose your wife & kids to the dessert bar...'

S"I came here for lunch last weekend. It was my first time there and the line didn't look too bad when we came around 12 for brunch. What we didn't realize that there was another line you stand in after you pay to get seated. My party was originally a party of 10 so we thought that if we split up our group we would be able to find a table quicker. FALSE it was actually much faster for us to get seated because they only had tables for parties of 10 available. The only catch was we had to pay 18% gratuity which wasn't a problem. The cashier was very nice and helped us figure everything out and let us all split our checks. We got seated 5-10mins after paying. \n\nThe food was pretty freaking good even though I wasn't feel well I enjoyed most of my food. Next time I'm in town I'm definitely coming again but for dinner. The only thing that I didn't like was that at most buffets they have a lot of bus boys/bus girls who come by and take away our plates. It wasn't really like that here. We had so much stuff that wasn't take away stacked on top of each other. The funny thing was that we were seated next to the place where they put plates but no one came to our table."

Obviously you are at a buffet, so the ambiance kind of sucks, but there is a huge selection, and the people watching is worth the admission price. We were sat directly across from the seafood area. Let's just say the human body can ingest a lot more crab claws than I though possible. It's not cheap ($27 a person for dinner) but it's high quality food in huge quantities."

And at the premium price point, you\'d expect some crab legs or a big seafood station but not here nor there was it found. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA#gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA\n\nIt was definitely the worst "fancy" buffet in Vegas I\'ve been to.'

S"Wicked Spoon Buffet is by far the best buffet I've ever had in Vegas. For a long time I thought the Wynn  Buffet was the bomb but Wicked Spoon is sooooo much better. We came there right when it opened at 5pm the line wasn't  long. \n\nThe only thing that was annoying was they charged us gratuity for our party of 10. How are you going to charge gratuity for a buffet???? Its not like the waiters/waitress's served us or anything. Minus one star for that.\n\nThe food is really good. Everything I tried tasted really good. I had the prime rib, truffle potatoes au gratin, mash potatoes and the crab all are delicious. There is also a section of the buffet with salami and cheese never seen that before, great idea! The desert section is amazing! There was gelato, cakes, cookies everything you can imagine is here."

S"Went to this buffet (gorgeous d\xc3\xa9cor by the way) two weeks ago and although it was great, it's not the best buffet I've eaten at.  I do have to agree with the other reviewers that the options were poor.  The quality was good and the portion control in individual containers helped but other than that, I'd say this was more like a three star place.  Luckily I didn't do the weekend $40-/+ buffet that most mentioned.  We went on a Monday during brunch time and it was about $22 I think.  Not bad for an all you can eat place in Vegas as it kept me full all day, but I felt the lack of options bored me and was done within 45 minutes.

S"I was hoping for amuse-bouche, but instead I got big little bowls of bleh.  If you want to sell food for more money, you give it a fancy name, and people will perceive it as delicious, because it's expensive.  But remove the pricing from your perception, and this buffet is just another pile of food you can get anywhere else.\n\nWe went Saturday at 6pm and the line was surprisingly short. The waitress was very friendly and the table was cleared often, until the end when we went for dessert and the dinner plates never left, even for the half hour we sat talking over coffee.  But these things do not go into my rating, because I went there for the food, after seeing enough friends posts on Facebook that this place rules.\n\nUnfortunately, I was underwhelmed. For this kind of money, I would rather go to Paris, Wynn, Bellagio, Mirage, or even Yama Sushi for AYCE.\n\nI was frustrated with the tapas-style portions of food, because I don't want eight gnocci in a bowl of lamb sauce -- let me pick out one noodle to taste first and then I'll decide if I want a whole serving.  I don't want a cup of fries to go with my fish n chips -- I just want a piece of fried fish. So many things I wanted just a taste, but were only served in portions that meant a table full of wasted food.  Am I the only weirdo who walks around the buffet first gathering literally ONE BITE of things, and then I go back to get more of what I liked?\n\nWe finally figured out the key is to share the first round of bowls with the whole table, so everyone gets a taste and then goes to get what they liked for themselves.\n\nThe second frustration was that things kept running out.  My friends would bring back dishes, I'd go up to get some, and they were gone.  I never saw the prime rib, and the pork shoulder I got instead had five-spice on it, which I loathe.  The crab was served in open shells, which probably explains why it was so watery and void of flavor.  The sushi was grocery store quality.  The bone marrow tastes like something my grandma would scrape out of her cast iron skillet before doing dishes.  It's funny how people run out of fancy ideas, so they circle back around to the garbage that used to be fit for peasants and leftovers, and they call it a triumph with a new price tag.  Chopping a dozen cherry tomatoes in a bowl with a crust of bread is a sad version of cheap-old bruschetta, and left me with a bowl of tomatoes to deal with when the bread ran out two bites in.\n\nThe best thing in the dessert area was the blood orange gelato, so sweet and tart.  The red velvet cookies were also lovely.  But there were no macaroons, my favorite thing on this planet, so I was super bummed the rumor turned out false.\n\nWe stuffed ourselves sick, and then enjoyed walking the Cosmo's hallways of beautiful art and people.  It's such a great property, but the buffet falls short of those otherwise excellent standards."

S'I can say this is one of my favorite buffets in Vegas. Great variety of dishes from around the world. I appreciated that they served out the portions so that it was just enough for a taste and to help with wastage. Lots of fresh food, but some did end up sitting there for a bit like the dbuokki (sp?). \n\nThe best part was the gelato station! \n\n$36 for lunch on a weekend.'

S"Came here with the fabulous Jessica Y. (see review below).\n\nFirst off..I totally understood why there was no wait on a Saturday night. This place is located in a really random section of the hotel. Maybe people got lost trying to find the buffet?\nDinner was $27.99 which is a little cheaper than say Bellagio or the Wynn.\nThe first thing I noticed was the swanky interior. It matches the hotel in that everything is very modern.\n\nI knocked off a star for the food selection. I really thought there was not enough options. I usually go to the Bellagio or Wynn buffet and I usually come back with a FULL plate every time. At the Wicked Spoon...I kept staring at everything and just thought....meh.\nThey give you little pots/pans instead of letting you scoop things until you realize you have 3 little pots/pans on your plate and no room for anything else. Those suckers take up space and they slide around your plate.\n\nI knocked off another star cause the food I got...I didn't like.\nI like my buffets with a mix of familiar and gourmet...but this place tried to be all fancy schmancy and failed at making the food taste good. The pizzas particularly looked really flat and unappetizing.\n\nI knocked off another star for their desserts. I am a girl and desserts mean everything to me when it comes to meals. No matter how full I am I will always have a FULL plate of desserts. All the stuff they had though was just so....safe and boring and repetitive. Chocolate covered strawberry or apple. Ice cream. A few cakes. How boring. How lame.\n\nIn all my years coming to Vegas I ate the least here. I couldn't find anything and the dessert area made me sad."

S"I would give this place a 2.5 for dinner. I heard so many good reviews about this place and friends talking about it but when i went to eat here it wasn't anything that I had expected. The food quality was just terrible. The crab legs were really soggy and not as tasty as other ones I've had. Some of their little dishes were also lacking in terms of quality but for the eyes they were visually appealing. I feel like this place tried to do too much without any real substance. The price didn't really help since it was $35+ pp. After doing the Buffet of Buffets for Harrahs I have to say I'm more impressed with some of their buffets than other ones like this and the Wynn buffet. However, I do want to try their lunch buffet since they have the red velvet pancakes (or so I heard) and unlimited mimosas. \n\nThis dinner experience was so bad that my friend that won a free buffet at the New Member Spin wheel gave that up for $10 in slot play. haha"

S'After reading the reviews and hearing people talk about the Wicked Spoon I was excited to eat  there.  \n\nThe experience was pretty fun over all.  And yes, the food is pretty good.  The way the food is set up does not make you feel like you are a one of those buffets where the food is just pilled up.  Everything is served in individually on plates or small bowls.\n\nThe desert bar is amazing.  They have all kinds of sweets, chocolate covered strawberries,cookies, cakes, pies, and ice cream.\n\nOver all great place to have brunch.  It is a little pricey on weekends, but well worth it.'

S"The dainty portions of this buffet meet one of my buffet dining rules - eat small servings.  I like that they are served in little dishes or containers...fewer potentially diseased scoops or tongs to handle.\n\nWicked Spoon also meets another of my buffet dining rules - unusual food that makes it worth the risk of stomach explosion.  Yes, I tried the bone marrow (blegh), salads (yes, salads), gelato, desserts (some were too sweet, but they're only a bite); skipped the bacon, bread, fresh fruits, and sushi (who eats that at $25 for brunch?).\n\nAnother buffet rule of mine is eat slowly.  Yes, I'm at that table while you are waiting in line, there while you are scarfing down your fresh fruits and bacon, and still there after you left.  No rush from the server, though.  She cleared our plates promptly, but I did have to ask for refills on our drinks.\n\nI do wish for more seafood with a Wicked Spoon twist to them...maybe that's at dinner, I don't know.  As with a previous review, don't get that pork riblet in the Chinese takeout container.  it looks cute, but tastes gross."

I wasn't prepared to be as impressed as I was, but the pretty food -- yes, pretty! -- kept on calling my name and encouraging me to have *just* a little more.  I enjoyed everything I sampled: prime rib, kalbi, sushi, veggies, pasta....I didn't find anything overcooked or undercooked.  The desserts were also good, which was actually a relief.  Too often, I find that desserts at a buffet LOOK amazing, but fall short on taste.  Not here, at least to my tastebuds.  \n\nWeekday lunch to dinner turnover starts at 2pm, so don't expect more food to be brought out to the stations after 2pm (for lunch, that is)."

They had everything for breakfast in "tapas" style servings (small portion). \n\nI really like the atmosphere and the food was really good.\n\nOur server told us that the Wicked Spoon buffet makes all the food from scratch and not already pre-made and then put in warmers like other buffets.\n\nThe water on the table was first sold at $5 a bottle for something like 5 stage filtered water, but now it comes with the buffet and is very clean tasting water. Probably the best I\'ve had.\n\nOverall this is a 2 thumbs up Buffet! Give it a try!'

If you didn't know its a part of the Marriott resort family, therefore, being a Platium member they gave me and my boyfriend Brunch Buffett for two each night we stayed at the hotel for free!  Can't beat that deal.  They had a separate line where we didn't have to wait to pay/be seated.  The staff / hostesses were super friendly and remembered us each day that we were there.  The dood was very good and fresh.  Alll their dishes are served on small plates, which is great because you can try a variety of food.  Plus, I feel the food is presented better this way than out of a typical buffet platter.  \n\nDefinitely try the mac and cheese - Delish.\nEggs Benedict - Amazing\nFrench Toast - one of my favs!\nTo my suprise the Sushi was great!\nThey also had this Swiss Cake Roll lookalike thing but it was made with Red Velvet Cake.  It was to die for.  \n\nMy boyfriend loved the General Tso's chicken.\nAlso, the brunch buffet came with Mimosas, Bloody Mary, or Champagne.\n\nDefinitely will be back next time we are in the Vegas area!"

S"Oh, Wicked Spoon. You are worth the hour plus wait my friends and I waited while we were still recovering from a night of debauchery and no sleep.\n\nLocated in the beautiful Cosmopolitan, I FINALLY got to try this particular buffet on my most recent Vegas trip. Last summer when I attempted to eat here, my girls and I found out that they close til 5 to set up for dinner and seeing that we were starving and in no mood to wait, we headed to the Bellagio buffet instead. Well, this time around, we were determined to wait. We got there at 4:10 and there was already a line forming and true to their words, the staff did not let us start paying for our dinner until 5. Even after paying, we still had to wait about another 15 minutes to be seated.\n\nAt about $38 a person, I expected the dinner to be AMAZING and omggggggg, the food was incredible. They had an array of dishes - different kinds of foods for whatever mood you're in. The thing I loved most was the mini individual portioned sized foods they had. Perfect so you won't over indulge. My friends and I were pretty gluttonous and tried a bit of everything. No shame. It was our last night in Vegas and we didn't have to dress up for any pool parties or clubs. Forever fat. The desserts looked sooo good. They had this huge display of gelato ice cream with different flavors. The mint chocolate chip was freaking bomb.com - so rich and creamy. I was pretty stuffed from dinner, so the only other dessert I tried was the apple strudel thingy they had. Tasted like apple pie. Delicious. \n\nOverall, the Wicked Spoon Buffet is amazing. The food definitely makes the wait worth it. The atmosphere and decor is pretty nice. I would definitely come back and end my Vegas trip here."

S'I am very selective when it comes to writing up a 5 star review for a restaurant. Usually this needs to be earned through multiple visits, but I have to say that I was blown away by this buffet. It is not just your typical buffet where selection is the key factor in its success. \n\nThe Wicked Spoon earns its stripes due to the stylishness that it presents its dishes. You feel like the offerings here are items that could be served a la carte at a great restaurant, as opposed to being just one choice in a buffet line.\n\nFirst off, the ambiance in the RESTAURANT sets the tone. You actually have placemats for your plates and water is presented in a large glass bottle.\n\nI went to Wicked Spoon for the dinner buffet ($29) and was amazed by the menu offerings. I like that this place does not stick to a certain menu. If the preparation for a dish is not good, they are willing to chuck it in favor of something else. \n\nBut what struck me is that this place may take something as simple as mac & cheese and jazz it up with a gourmet spin. It also helps that they serve it in untypical individual pot dishes. It makes you feel like it was made specifically for you. A departure from those large buffet servers.\n\nThey have a variety of cuisines offered here. Asian, Italian and Creole notably are featured. Again, I like the little touches here. I love that they put the curry tofu into a mini Chinese takeout box. This place also introduced me to the concept of charcuterie which I was familiar, but yet to try. And I have to say pork rillettes is one of my new favorite food things.\n\nNothing at the Wicked Spoon seems typical. That would be obvious by the offering of a selection of chocolates and gelato at the desserts table. When have you ever seen gelato at a buffet? I love the Wicked Spoon because it makes me feel like I am dining at a great restaurant rather than a buffet.'

S'Good but not great.  Lets face it,  Las Vegas is known for its endless selection of buffets,  most of what are meh, not great.  The appeal of this buffet is the small portions prepared fresh.   Unfortunately the selection is more about appearance than flavor.  The beef marrow bones are good but most people seemed to avoid trying them. Many of the dishes looked nice, but tasted like typical Vegas buffet foods.  The best part of this buffet was the dessert selection. But even then, spending the equivalent amount of money in a regular restaurant will always deliver better flavors and quality of dishes. This buffet is more about the Vegas experience.  If you want to feel fancy while wasting money, this is the place. If you want great food, visit a well reviewed restaurant.'

S'Wicked Spoon was our last stop before heading home to Vegas. We needed some food and wanted to eat at a buffet. Since we were staying at the Cosmo and the buffet had good reviews, we decided to try it out. Good choice on our part. The buffet was $35 per person, which I think was pretty good considering the cost of some buffets in Vegas. We got seated near the front of the buffet, which was good since we got seated near the food. We were on super heifer status that day! I went and got a bunch of everything. I think I had three plates filled and then sat down to try some of everything. It was all really good and exactly what I wanted when I thought of eating at a buffet. The French toast and pancakes were soooo good. I think I had three of each! Our waiter was really nice too, he brought us drinks right away and was just very attentive.

The selection was so diverse, yet everything seemed to be made with same level of care and attention. Unlike some buffets, the staff was noticeable and helpful. There were people rotating the food to make sure it stayed fresh, discarding of items that may have aged or appeared unacceptable. And for brunch... the mimosas are quite powerful. At one point, our host brought us a glass of straight champagne because she said our mimosas were too watered down. I will make this buffet a regular stop on my Vegas adventures!'

S"We made it barely before closing (no line!)- I didn't expect a Vegas buffet to close at 2pm, especially when that's when many are waking up after a long night. The brunch buffet comes with a complimentary glass of champagne or mimosa, which I thought was nice. \n\nThe items here are much daintier and interesting that the Bellagio buffet. I'm personally not excited by waffles and scrambled eggs, and they had more lunch items on the line. There was a great (but salty) house cured thick slab bacon, cute little skillets of goat cheese ravioli, cold salads of asparagus with tarragon vinaigrette, neat individual portions of smoked salmon, and Moroccan chicken. \n\nThe best part was the dessert section. The desserts were actually good! They had macaroons (yum!), little cups of desserts (the one that looks like tiramisu with crunchy bits in the middle was pretty decent), chocolate covered strawberries, and an entire case of gelato that they serve, not a machine. Don't be shy here- they give you a cute little scoop spoon, so you can try more flavors. \n\nI'd probably say 3.5 stars, but I rounded down because the carving station guy was terrible. He was grumpy and rude when asking people what they wanted. He expects your plate to be ready to catch the sausage... mine wasn't, and he ended up flinging the sausage at my shirt leaving a stain."

S"One of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas.  It's centrally located and provides a nice atmosphere with a great variety of food.  I will say that the buffet is a bit tucked away so it's a bit of trek from the casino floor and other restaurants. It's closer to the convention rooms than anything else.\n\nSome of the really good stuff I've had here were the ceviche, waldorf salad (w/ truffle oil!), prime rib, gelato, mussels.  Lots of the standard buffet stuff too but all done at a higher level than other buffets in my opinion.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and the service is the same.  Nothing overly stuffy about this place.\n\nAnd of course the one stand out is how they present the food.  Most everything is individually sized.  Great for tasting a little of everything!"

S'I went here during Cosmopolitan\'s opening week for lunch.  Like many things Cosmopolitan, it\'s a typical Las Vegas experience, but with a little twist.  In this case, some of the foods are served as prepared plates instead of the food sitting in a tray.  The decor is beautiful like the rest of the Cosmopolitan.  Like most Las Vegas buffets, this buffet is multicultural, which basically means it serves Italian, Japanese, and Chinese food.\n\nFood choices ranged from mediocre to really good.  The salad bar was a bit lacking, especially in fruits.  There were, unfortunately, no oysters or crab the day I went.  The sushi selection is, like at most Las Vegas buffets, very limited, but I was glad they even had sushi there.\n\nThey had six different "big meats" to choose from, all of which were forgettable except the roast lamb.  Maybe it was because I got the 2nd or 3rd cut of it, but it was some of the best lamb I\'ve ever had at a buffet.  It was extremely juicy, cooked well and carried that distinct lamb taste well.  Definitely save room for the lamb if you\'re a fan.\n\nThe desserts are quite good.  I had a bit of the crepe with bananas foster which is a nice treat I\'ve only otherwise seen in Wynn\'s buffet.  The rest of the dessert section is composed of small tarts and sweets, varied chocolate-dipped apples and strawberries, and a gelato section.  The gelato section contains some unique flavors like "peanut butter and jelly," which was delicious.  Stay away from the apples.\n\nService was friendly, but poor.  Our waiter sat us down, took our drink orders, and then disappeared.  We only had one refill on drinks and had plates stacking up at the center of the table.  I remember there being two major spills from the staff, one of which was a tray full of sodas.  Once the staff become a little more accustomed to their jobs, things will be really good here.'

S'A couple of friends are in town for a convention and they wanted to eat at a top notch buffet. So that means its either the Wynn or the Bellagio. The past few times this situation presented itself, my friends all decided on the Wynn. This time around, this particular group of friends let me decide. "Well, the past few times its been the Wynn, so lets mix it up and try the Bellagio.", I suggested. "I mean how bad can it be?"\n\nWe stroll up to the buffet on a Monday at around 7:30 and was pleasantly surprised not to see a line. Now in hindsight, is that a good thing or bad thing? Anyways, my friends bought my dinner so I didn\'t catch the price. I figure it was close to about $30. The nice hostess leads our party of five to a table that normally seats 4. She pulls an extra chair and puts it at the head of the table. Seriously? I can understand if we had a kid in the party, but we are all adults. Cant we all have our own little space?\n\n"Excuse me miss, can we get another table?"\n"Sure, this way please."\n\nSo I was expecting they would bring us to a table that seats 6 and have an extra chair open. I guess thats what I get for assuming. She leads us to another table that seats four and pulls up an extra chair. Wow. This must be the five diamond/5 star service I was expecting. I can understand if the place was packed but it seemed like 1/3 of the tables were empty. Whatever. We deal with it and head for the food.\n\nWe grab a plate and walk the selections to see what delicious offerings they have. Dish after dish I didnt see anything I was too excited about. Everything just seemed normal. If they blindfolded me and brought me here, I would of guessed we were at a $12.99 buffet somewhere. I think I would of been happier eating at the Planet Hollywood buffet and saving a few bucks for gambling or drinks afterwards.\n\nSo for our first round, I start out with crab legs, peeled shrimp, cold smoked salmon, salmon sashimi, and some spicy tuna sashimi. Maybe it was my high expectations, but I didnt enjoy the food as much as I thought I would. The crab legs dipped in the warm butter was fine. Not spectacular. The peeled jumbo shrimp tasted like the ones I bought from the Albertsons seafood counter. Normal. The smoked salmon tasted fine. The salmon sashimi was decent. Now here\'s my gripe about the 1st plate. Spicy tuna sashimi... I couldnt even get past two bites. It was soooooo spicy. Are they trying to cover up the lack of taste? Seriously?\n\nFor the 2nd plate, I chose a slice of shrimp pesto pizza, rare prime rib, duck leg in peanut sauce, calamari salad, and scallop ceviche. I love duck. So the duck leg was yummy. The prime rib was good because I asked for a rare slice and the carving station guy pulled a whole prime rib slab and cut me a piece straight from the middle. It was worth it.  The pizza was ok as well as the calamari salad and scallop ceviche.\n\nSo far I enjoyed 3 out of 10 dishes. I take another lap and didnt really see anything else I wanted to eat. So I head for the massive dessert area to fill the void I was feeling. I select the carrot cake, flan, creme brulee, and a chocolate covered brownie. The best one was the carrot cake. Wow. That was very tasty. Possibly the best thing I tasted all night. The flan and creme brulee were delicious as well. the chocolate covered brownie I could have done without.\n\nHere\'s another thing that bothered me. I ordered some tea. They had a great selection of about 5 or 6 teas. That\'s a good sign. I ordered some Green Tea and my friend orders some Earl Grey. While we wait for our beverages, she mentions that she should of asked for some lemon and honey for her tea. "Those always come with the tea.", I confidently stated. Boy was I wrong again. I\'m not doing well on assumptions tonight. They bring the tea and of course there\'s NO lemon or honey. Cmon now. Even at a lowly 24 hour cafe/diner they bring you lemon and honey with an order of tea. Seriously.... SERIOUSLY?\n\nThroughout this whole evening, the only thing that kept running through my mind was... How come I didn\'t choose the Wynn buffet? What else could go wrong? I had one too many drinks so I had to use the little boys room. When I walk in, there were about 5 guys in line waiting to use the urinals. Seriously.... There are two urinals and one regular toilet stall IN A BUFFET? SERIOUSLY? Now I know how the ladies feel.... Waiting.... Waiting....\n\nWould I go back? Not anytime soon. Wynn or Bellagio Buffet? WYNN. Hands down. The food just tastes better there. You can truly taste the quality there. Do you have any pictures Leo? SURE DO! Check them out!\n\nI was torn between 2 or 3 stars. If I could, I would of given them a 2.5.'

S"Over the years I've been to many Las Vegas buffets and I would say my all time favorite is the one at the Bellagio.  With a well rounded selection of foods, I find the Buffet at the Bellagio the best restaurant to hit up when I'm absolutely starving and want to take down copious amounts of delicious food.  Prices are a bit high, but the food is worth it.  And after a long day or night of having fun, a smorgasbord of food is just what one needs."

S'I checked out The Buffet at Bellagio on a Friday night. The group I was with were looking for the right combination of a good buffet and a reasonable price. The Buffet at Bellagio, based on a few online reviews I read, seemed to meet those requirements,\n\nThen I walked in.\n\nFirst of all, they charged me a $47 "holiday rate" because of Columbus Day weekend. Columbus Day is a horrible holiday for many historical reasons in my view, but that aside, I was there in a Friday. Columbus Day was on the following Monday. Why would they gouge customers for $47 three days before a random holiday? \n\nAnyway, that wasn\'t a good start to the experience. But I want to review this place irrespective of those shenanigans and provide an unbiased assessment.\n\nThe food was decent and diverse. They had a couple meat stations - one which was serving prime rib and corned beef, and another which was serving goat shanks and lamb chops. The corned beef was really flavorable as was the lamb shanks. Those who tried the other options had a similar assessment.\n\nThey had a few seafood stations, one which had shrimp cocktails, another with several different types of crab legs, and a sushi station. The crab legs were sliced in half vertically, making it easy to eat. The shrimp was okay. The sushi was underwhelming (especially the sashimi). \n\nThey had a pizza station which was pretty good. They had a few different kinds of thin-crust pizza, and I appreciated that.\n\nEverything else, for the most part, was pretty "meh" for a buffet - nothing better than you\'d have in your average buffet in other parts of the country. \n\nThe one thing I will offer specific praise for is the dessert section. They had several different options - cheesecakes, brownies, flan, cookies, creme brulee, ice cream, etc. After trying a bite of a few different options, I can say that they were all good except for the flan.\n\nUltimately, when factoring in even the regular, non-holiday rate, I\'d say that it isn\'t worth the price when there are several better dining options nearby. It\'s definitely not worth $47. Ridiculous.'

I was also impressed with the Sushi and Chinese section. Very tasty, satisfying and CLEAN!

A time of night that I NEVER get to be apart of because of my medical condition. Lame Lame Lame...\n\nI decided to tease myself by strolling around their Dessert Buffet Selection to see what I could have been eating if I didn\'t have this sucky lame condition.

S"Absolutely the best buffet in Las Vegas. Yes, better then Wynn. IMO at least. Arrived on a Saturday around 12PM, the wait was about 30 minutes from the end of the line to the time we were seated. All the food items were seasoned perfectly. I feasted on pizza, sushi, pasta, bacon, and cookies. I was craving a potato dish, but didn't find one to my liking. \n\nThe lines were a bit long for the omelet station, I didn't want to wait. Well let me rephrase, I was waiting and the women in front, a older-older woman was having difficulty selecting her ingredients (perhaps because of her eyesight) so a nice patron was telling her what the ingredients were and it was still hard for her to listen. I left shortly after that :/ I hope she enjoyed her omelet!\n\nWill I be back? Hell yes! I love getting my grub on!\n\nP.s.

The steak tartare tasted like bland mush (serves me right for trying it at a buffet, I know). The creme brulee was too eggy. \n\nMaybe my expectations were too high and thus I felt let down.

Maybe it was over-hyped and my expectations too high, but I don't think I would return to this one.  I heard this buffet has steadily declined since Steve Wynn sold the place.

It was blend, but eatable. \n\nThey even had Alaskan King Crab Legs, which is the most expensive crab legs out there. I spent most of my time, eating the King Crab legs and not the Snow crab legs since you can find snow crab legs for dinner at every buffet in Vegas.\n\nI didn\'t get any sushi, but man, the lines were looong to get some made to order sushi roll.\n\nDeserts were abundant. They even have Macarons. I saw one diner got a whole plateful of Macarons, I\'m assuming they going to stuff that into their purse to take home.\n\nService was good.

Although I have to say, if anyone who has been to the buffet at  Barona Casino in San Diego, you'll have a better time there at half the price!\n\nThe Italian portion of the buffet: most of the pasta was over-sauced or dried up, but that's always the issue when pasta is left out for a while. Japanese side? Sushi is decent, but again, I've had way better. Their side dishes were over salted or overly spicy, which made the dishes seemingly unauthentic. I have to say though, the seafood was fresh, but there weren't any crab legs when I was there so I only grabbed a few shrimps. Fresh and sweet! The American side: mostly the prime rib to critique. It's a small slice and I was pleased it was small because I wouldn't have eaten anymore of it. It was difficult to cut, especially since I was cutting with what felt like a butter knife. Seasoning was lacking, but cooked to a nice medium rare. And as for my favorite part of buffets, the desserts? I was happy with the variety, but unhappy that they looked better than they tasted. I sampled about half of the options, and most of them were too sweet or too creamy or too dry. \n\nI know that this is one of the more affordable buffets in Vegas and as a poor college student, we always try find ways of cutting corners and saving a bit. But if you're looking for a real Vegas place, skip this place. I still have yet to find THE best buffet in Vegas because no one ever wants to go to the clubs bloated afterwards.

S"I go to Vegas about once a year and have been since the days of Comdex (remember that one, kiddies?), and The Buffet at the Bellagio is still the best in Vegas, fighting off challengers like Wynn and Cosmopoitan (Wicked Spoon). Here are the two main reasons why:\n\n1) For $38 for their weekend gourmet dinner, you get an immense selection of relatively high quality food. Go to a very ordinary non-buffet restaurant on The Strip and Vegas and $38 gets you a very mediocre steak and maybe an appetizer. At the Bellagio, you get an unlimited amount of relatively expensive foods like prime rib, Chilean sea bass, Kobe beef, sushi, Peking duck, etc.\n\n2) The selection is more plentiful and higher quality than at Wynn and The Wicked Spoon. Sure, if you like a smaller selection of lower quality food *but* in small, expensive containers that's made in France, go to The Wicked Spoon. That actually adds negative value for me as the superfluous containers takes up previous space on my plate!\n\nAfter all these years, the Buffet at the Bellagio is still the best."

Compared to most casinos on the strip this might stand out as a nicer place to dine but besides the food selection there isn\'t really much going for it. \n\nTo enjoy food you need more than just food tasting good. You need to have ambiance, the plate design, the smell, the lighting, and of course the flavor, but what\'s more is the service. The buffet at Bellagio had the selection but lacked flavors in most dishes, the lighting was dark and gloomy, the ambiance was dated, and the service...omg the service was horrible. One of the guest that sat behind us knocked over his water glass and shattered on the ground but none of the 2 wait staff, 3 hosts, and 1 bus staff bothered to assist him. I was shocked that some look at him and then just walked away as if nothing happened, not one of its "classy" staff even bothered to ask the client if he was hurt.\n\nThe Bellagio might once be the bar for class and sophistication in Vegas but now is where the blue collared workers from different parts of the world migrate to get a little taste of luxury but unfortunately they ended up forming a John Deere convention at the Bellagio. \n\nIf you want to stay at a upscale place then try to Four Seasons or the Wynn resorts. You will noticeably recognize the difference in the client-el.'

S"Not a huge fan of buffets so not really sure why I came... the wait to get in was ridiculous as usual (40 min?) on a Sat morning. This is probably one of the better buffets in Vegas and definitely decently priced (Wynn is $35, this is $25) although the selection isn't as large."

S"I gave it 5 stars because I've eaten at several buffets in Vegas and there's only one other that compares (Bachanal Buffet at Ceasar's Palace). I'm going to include this at the top of my review: IF THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF YOU...DO NOT WAIT IN LINE. Go to the front and ask to sit at the bar. The wait was over 45 minutes, but thanks to another reviewer, we read that smaller parties can sit at the bar and jump the line. Just ask the hostess to check for you. Our entire meal lasted almost 2 hours and we were the only two people sitting there so we got to know our bartender and had a great time. \n\nWe went here for dinner and even though it's over $40 per person for dinner, it's cheaper than two people eating at any of the high end restaurants in the Casino. Some of the pasta was a little over cooked, but the selection was great and the desserts were awesome. Mini creme brulee, eclairs, tiramisu, soft serve ice cream, Frangelico cups, macaroons, carrot cake, etc The dessert bar at Ceasar's is definitely larger, but the Bellagio's was still impressive and everything on it was great. For dinner, there were two types of fish, two types of crab legs, cocktail shrimp, several meat carving stations, mid grade sushi that I didn't try because I'm picky and there were things that looked better, salad, pizza, and pastas. The bread selection was good with several artisan breads and our service was great. I forget her name, but she was just the cutest southern lady and we had a great time talking with her while we ate."

S'What\'s being the so call "best hotel" in Vegas if it doesn\'t have the best food right?  So here we go, the buffet at the Bellagio... the long awaited review for one of my favorite buffets of all time!\n\nFirst of all, I love the clean look of the place.. nothing fancy or spectacular but being what it is and where it is located, you just feel like this is no ordinary buffet.\n\nThe buffet lines is wavy designed starting from the right side to the left side of the facility.\n\nI usually skipped the first section and go toward the hot food sections instead... (I\'m not a big fan of cheese/bread and I feel that having salads at buffets really is not worth the price I\'m paying and defeats the purpose -- especially in Bellagio)  So I just cut to the chase...\n\nRack of lamb:  Juicious maximus!  Love the tenderness of their rack of lamb!  But sometimes the chefs can be stingy and only gives out 2 pcs or so... I\'d usually have someone help me get a couple more so I wouldn\'t have to make the additional trip.\n\nPrime rib:  What do you expect?  It was cooked perfectly and juicy as well!  If you want it bloody, they got it.  If you want it well done, it\'s available for you as well.. anyway you like it it\'s pretty much available to you just have to tell it to the chef.  (they will try to accomodate as much as possible)  \n\nBeef Wellington:  Delicious beef wrapped in bread... did I mention "buttery" bread?  Oh yeah.... it was buttery alright....YUMMY!\n\nWhat\'s this?  Many variations of fresh made pizzas?  Not the basic kinds that you would find at the lower end buffets.. all the great stuff that is up to the caliber of CPK and other fine pizza establishments!  I had a veggie pizza and it was wonderful!  (But didn\'t want to fill my stomach up with useless carbs.. keep moving forward please...)\n\nSame goes for pasta dishes.. looked absolutely wonderful.... but has to pass due to the carb regulations... no can\'t do sir!  Only sampled here and their and it was wonderful!\n\nAsian food:  I\'m asian... usually not too excited about getting asian food at buffets unless it\'s like Makino\'s or Midori\'s  (pls refer to my other reviews) So took a few bok choys just to fill some void in the veggies column... that\'s all...\n\nSeafood... ok.. took almost everything here because of it\'s cost and it\'s taste.. all seafood were great as there were many to choose from... but most memorable was the sea bass... SUPER BUTTERY like you are eating butter straight up!!  (I wonder if that was actually butter carved into looking like sea bass?  Regardless... melt in your mouth like a chocolate yet it\'s fish!  Go figure!)  This is a must and hopefully they offer it when you are visiting this place....  (sometimes they leave it off the menu for some reason.....(sad days)\n\nSushi:  Not a great selection as it\'s not known for that but it\'s got some basic selections, but their tuna ahi poke sashimi was super jammin!  Chunky pieces of ahi marinated in vinegary soy sauce with seseme... awesome sashimi!\n\nSoup:  Cream of corn was heavenly.... It\'s like drinking liquid gold! \n\nFinally, the dessert!  Way too many selections to choose from!  Bellagio buffet also have one of the largest sugar-free sections so it\'s definitely a plus!  Everything is good here!  No additonal explanation necessary!  (Just try them all!)\n\nLastly, service was impeccable.... what do you expect?  It\'s Bellagio!  Drinks were always topped, servers has always been wonderful and courteous, and the staff overall was great!  (we took a long time there and they never once ever rushed us out even though there is a long wait outside for seating!  And they asked us if we wanted coffee!  Awesome!\n\nI can\'t say enough good thing about this place... it\'s an experience you must have for yourself....I never had a bad time here and hopefully you will get to enjoy what I\'ve always enjoyed here.. a perfect ending to a long day in vegas.....\n\nI\'m Bellagio biased..... and will always be!'

S'If I had reviewed this buffet the first time we went, which was a few years ago, I would have easily given it 4 or even 5 stars . Still had happy memories of the panzanella salad, the tapenade on crostini, Kobe Beef Wellington, and Rosebud\'s crushing disappointment that the tray of chocolate macarons disappeared immediately and was never replaced, but was made up for with really exceptional little cr\xc3\xa8me brulees. \n\nSadly, none of these items were available this trip. I realize you takes your chances with  a buffet menu, especially when you wait so long between visits. (And speaking of waiting so long, the line was surprisingly lengthy for our mid-afternoon arrival, but I suppose we were not the only cheapos who figured on paying the lunch price just before they switched over to dinner. We were successful by a nose, and managed to save about $14 each. This eased the pain a little bit).\n\nThey did have a little individual salad station; Caesar was ok but nothing special. Crab leg were served cold, which is fine by me, especially when I saw the eye roll another diner got when he asked the line cook to have his heated. Not one interesting item at the bread station - guess they want you to fill up on the expensive stuff, so we did.\n\nThe prime rib was like butta, and the brisket was also pretty tasty. They were carving a large roast of what was labeled Wagyu beef. Now, I am of the understanding that this particular meat draws its signature tenderness from a pampered life of massage and  a high carb diet. I think the guy they carved up for this one had been sneaking off to the gym to work out at night. It didn\'t save his life, but he put up a great battle against my knife. \n\nThey had a pretty decent variety of desserts, but not the macarons. At least. that\'s we thought at first. Turned out they had some they were "going to put out later". In other words: when the place was full of full-price dinner patrons. But, they did spring loose with them, but they were raspberry and therefore a disappointment. Also, they broke out some pretty tasty chicken masala when we were too full to enjoy it.\n\nSo, it\'s pretty much like most buffets in that you can find more than enough items that you like to put you in physical distress, but it\'s not as good as it used to be.'

S'My girlfriend and I visited this place a couple of days ago. Overall, a good lunch, but "good" is not what I expected from the Bellagio. In fact, I preferred the desserts more than any of the other dishes. \n\nThe sliders didn\'t have much flavor, and the buns were too dry. The turkey, too, was dry, and I thought the lamb tasted a little gamey. The mashed sweet potatoes were way too sweetened with (I think) cinnamon and maple. It took 5 minutes before we got our first drink, and we had to flag down the server to get a refill. \n\nAgain, I would have to say this was a decent experience overall, but the various little problems still left me feeling disappointed. Yes, it was lunch on a Thursday, but shouldn\'t a place like the Bellagio be on top of its game everyday?'

S'We definitely beat the system and got in line just before the increase in price for dinner kicked in .... I\'m so glad we did because I personally did not think it would have been worth the $40-some dollars.  Maybe I\'m just pickier than most but I would much rather get a delicious meal that I chose and was individually cooked rather than huge platters cooked and left in a buffet line (I was outnumbered doing a buffet haha so don\'t hold me to the "why did you go then?").  I was extremely disappointed by the crab legs, which were all split and put on ice ahead of time so they were frozen and water-logged.  The meat was okay (except the Kobe beef, which was inedible) .... I definitely enjoyed the fresh fruit and desserts the most, which is a shame when you pay so much.'

It was so long last time we had went that we jumped out of line and went somewhere else to satisfy our hunger. My recommendation is go early or go before you get hungry so that way when you finally get seated and reach the buffet you are will be ready to eat.'

S"BIG 4 BUFFETS ON THE STRIP\n\nI came here yesterday for dinner. This buffet is considered one of the Big 4 Buffets on the Strip: Bacchanal, Wynn, Wicked Spoon, and Bellagio. Including Bellagio I went to three of them. Last night was the first time I went to the buffet at Bellagio. I learned from my previous buffet there's a strategy when you eat at buffets. You need to approach them as if you're eating at a tapas eatery - get three items on a plate. I ended up having 8 plates. Instead of naming every item I ate I will mention the highlights. The chorizo sausage and pork and chicken sausage were tasty. The smoked salmon, ceviche, and calamari salad were fresh and clean. The prime rib was cooked rare to my liking. The baby back ribs had a sweet glaze taste. The chocolate and vanilla \xc3\xa9clairs were light and sweet. The rice pudding was also a nice filling for desert. There were three things I didn't like. Even though the pepperoni pizza came out of the oven the crust was chewy not crunchy. I found the snow crab legs to taste a little salty. I wish they served the bones of the prime rib. They're the tastiest part of the prime ribs. Overall The Buffet at Bellagio is a decent buffet. In terms of the Big 4 Buffets at the Strip (I haven't been to the Wynn yet) I would rank in order Bacchanal Buffet, Bellagio, and Wicked Spoon (at this buffet I went at the worst time on Saturday brunch and may go back at a better time)."

S'Wynn\'s Buffet beats Bellagio\'s Buffet for my taste!!!  Wynn\'s venue is much nicer and decorative compared to bellagio\'s also.\n\n Waited about 30 minutes at Noon time on a Sunday..There was a lady waiting in line behind us that was really annoying... I guess some people don\'t know the concept of space.. she was like all up on my back waiting and such.. it really annoyed me.. me being passive aggressive I try to be slick and just kinda walk back lean back like I don\'t notice her.. or try to stretch which makes her step back a bit... Seriously though? do you not see you are literally on someone?!?! We kept looking back so she can get a clue.. but i guess not.. then her friend joined.. did the same thing! and talked as loud as ever.. like they were in a hurry to pay and run off and eat...i mean different countries and backgrounds but still.. BACK OFF OLDER WOMEN YOU!! :I\n\nBellagio does have a wider selection on food compared to the Wynn.. But i Must say that the QUALITY of Wynn\'s food is ten times better than Bellagio\'s....\n\nPrime rib at the Wynn.. i can\'t even explain it because it was soo juicy and delicious.. Bellagio\'s prime rib made me disappointed.. it was just a small piece of well cooked prime rib.. it made me sad looking at it that I barely ate the whole piece that I asked for!\n\nseabass selection was not too tasty..\nsmoked salmon and alaskan crab legs pretty good.. a bit too frozen for me though.\ndessert selection is a bit more.. i enjoyed the ice cream and fruits.. the flan was bad.........\nsushi selection.. the usual: california rolls/hand rolls/vegetarian spring rolls/rice/noodles\npasta was delicious though. the crab ravioli!!!!!!\n\nSome people would say..

S'Food was really good especially near Christmas!  But first, they have great customer service.  I have a special needs son and the wait was going to be two hours.  I spoke with one of the service people and they got a manager to speak with me.  He was able to get me to the head of the line and a discount for him.  The person (Marianna) in charge of the line was extremely nice and brought tears to my eyes.\n\nAnyway, try the crab legs and shrimp cocktail (better than Bacchanal), the duck breast, grilled duck legs, and of course, the goose.  They had great grilled lamb chops, prime rib and sushi.  Selection is not as vast as Bacchanal, but it is a lot cheaper and we found that my son likes the chicken mole sauce.\n\nReally, really good was the grilled sea bass.\n\nThe Kobe beef was so so, but the other meats make up for it.\n\nDesserts were OK but the fresh fruit was excellent.\n\nThey have free beer and wine by the glass.\n\nWill be back.'

It's an escape, and a decadent food orgy. I'm not talking about your run-of-the-mill-all-you-can-eat pasta, salad and cupcakes. I'm talking a variety of fresh fish, filet mignon, Alaskan King crab, gourmet desserts, etc. etc. All you can stuff! It's like a food hedon haven. I swear I talk about this place to this day. And when I'm there I drag everyone to go there. It's a steep $37, but well worth it. My mouth is salivating on my keyboard as I type. Love it, go there."

I would expect such junk as DRY stir-fry noodles over at the Excalibur buffet for $15, but for the $25 Sunday Brunch? At one of the most expensive hotels on the strip? Gross!\n\nI suggest skipping the Bellagio buffet all together and heading over to the Wynn - a better buffet splurge (even though it's $5 or so cheaper). See my review for more info.\n\nLooking forward to maybe plunking down the $85 for the Bally's Silver Buffet or whatever it's called on my next trip!"

I was worried about having enough options since I usually don't care for buffets, but figured that if I had a mimosa at all times, everything would be okay.  \n\nThis ended up being my favorite buffet of all time.  Laura, our server was AWESOME.  She was very friendly and made sure that our glasses were always topped off.  She filled my glass so many times that I started to suspect that she was trying to take advantage of me.\n\nSome of the highlights for me were the pesto mashed potatoes and the pineapple fried rice.  I had many other things that I can't think of at the moment that were also yummy.  I couldn't have the waffles, but my boyfriend and friends loved them.  I think the desserts were a mixed bag in speaking with my group.  There's always soft-serve if all else fails.\n\nI agree with everyone who said that this is MUCH BETTER than the Wynn.  The Wynn is very overrated and overpriced.  I was surprised that this buffet was as cheap as it is.  I would have gladly paid more.\n\nWill DEFINITELY return on my next visit to Vegas."

Yeah, its just a buffet, I agree, but when you have 99cent buffets and other nonsense like that out there then you have to give props to those who deserve them.  I personally hate the buffet concept because I don't want to serve myself when I'm in a restaurant (lazy, I know) but since the 'rents always ALWAYS only do buffets in LV I've had no choice over the years.  The Bellagio buffet always has a great variety, fresh seafood and salad stuff which I like, and just good quality food in general.  The only unfortunate thing is that the line sometimes gets long, and I hate waiting in that little cave of an entry that they have before you get to the cashier.

However, some of the food just did not taste so great. The lamb shank and the bone marrow I had was good. But the steak i had was so chewy and dry. I almost choked on it. The asian options were also a little limited. The sushi quality was really good I miss admit.\n\nMy favorite dish when i can here was actually a sea bass dish. The fish was moist and not overcooked.'

My buddy and I almost had to be carried off in wheelchairs. 2 years later, after 5 hours (brunch, lunch, and dinner) of eating, another buddy and me didn't even know how we got back to San Diego. This place was the king in Las Vegas until the Wynn opened up.

In fact, I wanted the food to turn into a baby alien and rip out of my stomach and kill me. That's how gross I felt.\r\n\r\nWe got seated next to a table of five coked-out bleached-blonde girls and a metro guy, who seemed to be having even less fun than me. I forced myself to get up and go get some food. And I was glad I did, because it is a pretty good buffet.\r\n\r\nPlate 1:\r\n- shrimps w/cocktail sauce: standard\r\n- prime rib: tough and overcooked\r\n- fake kobe beef: tough and overcooked and not that tasty\r\n- grilled asparagus, carrots, and garlic thingies: excellent.\r\n- tuna nigiri, ca roll, tuna hand roll: decent but awesome that they even had it\r\n\r\nPlate 2:\r\n- crab legs: standard but good\r\n- bowl of congee, Taiwanese style: Hellyeah. \r\n- sweet potato mash: so good, must-eat\r\n- chilean sea bass: BEST DISH IN THE WHOLE DAMN PLACE\r\n\r\nPlate 3:\r\n- more chilean sea bass\r\n- more sweet potato mash\r\n\r\nDessert plates:\r\n- don't remember what I got. What I didn't get but should have was the Creme Brulee. \r\n\r\nSo I don't know if I ate enough to satisfy the $32 bucks worth, but whatever. I walked back to the car like a pregnant mouth-breathing incontinent zombie. \r\n\r\nSo yeah, the Chilean Sea Bass should be your staple Bellagio buffet food. I didn't understand why people were piling on mahi-mahi and salmon and overlooking the Chilean sea bass. Maybe because I was hogging up all the space in front of it, drooling all over the dish. Suckers."

S'Sunday of Memorial Day wkd, 730pm. Plan B after Bacchanal at Caesar\'s gave us a 2-hr wait.\n\nThe Buffet at Bellagio has soooo fallen off it\'s allure and pedestal of being one of the top, high-end buffets in Vegas of years ago. The first sign was that we (party of 2) only had to wait 15 minutes.\n\nTheir carving station meats were not plentiful and selective. Meats did not taste all that good. Ribs were dry. Steaks were dry. Turkey tasted like cardboard.\n\nTurkey gravy was super salty. \n\nOne of the carvers took his sweet @ss time slicing every single piece of prime rib and turkey. Makes for an even longer wait! arghhh!\n\nThe layout is horrible. \n\nNot much main dish selection. \n\nFood was very tasteless.\n\nEverything seemed so "bulk cafeteria" made.\n\nThey close at 1030, but at 9pm, the dessert station was "all out of chocolate covered strawberries". So lame.\n\nDesserts did not taste good. The cheesecake was so bad. Didn\'t even have any chocolate cake selections!\n\nA sign of a buffet that is not high-end? When the ice cream station is NOT manned by a human being. More of a sign that a buffet is actually low-end? When the ice cream station is a crappy soft-serve, manual, help-yourself dispenser! This is a severe contrast to the manned, well-decorated, well-presented gelato stations at the Rio Carnival, the Aria Buffet, the Bacchanal, etc.\n\nTo top things off, it was a "holiday weekend", so they charged "holiday prices". $47.99+tax pp. Yet, the selection, the quality, and the experience was barely better than that of cross of Hometown Buffet and Souplantation!\n\nSorry Bellagio Buffet. Never again until you renovate, reinvent, and rejuvenate!'

S"Great King Crab!\n\nWe wanted some good King Crab legs and searched online resources for reviews.  We ended up coming to The Buffet at Bellagio.  Cost was about $40 each (weekend rate for Gourmet Buffet).  The crab was great!  Ate so much of it, we didn't sample much of the other food.  If you're looking for great King Crab - try The Buffet."

S"My first buffet in Vegas (but certainly not the last). \n\nAfter waiting in line for just short of an hour,  the meal began with us piling leg upon leg of king crab onto our plates and heading straight for the  steaming vat of melted butter. Next was the beef wellington followed by shrimp, and shepherd's pie. I'm the kind of guy that puts vegetables on the plate just for color and to fill in any nooks or crannies on the plate as a sort of damn to prevent foods from mixing together. There is nothing worse than having your ravioli sauce mixing with the chicken wings. With their oval leaves, lettuce works well as an organic capsule to hold certain dishes.\n\nAfter finishing dessert (the macaroons were nothing special) we were absolutely stuffed, making sure our meal was well worth the 90 dollar price tag. I would recommend this buffet if you have lots of room and want to enjoy nice legs (crab legs that is, you can get the other kind at a different place in Vegas)."

She never had to be reminded/asked for refills. I just turned around and my cup was full.  It was magical.\n+ Food: TONS of variety! Each section was pretty huge (i.e. meats, Asian foods, desserts, etc.). Satisfactory taste. \n+ Atmosphere: Bright, plenty of seating areas.\n\nBad:\n- Service: I stepped on and tripped over food that had fallen on the ground about 3 times. Yuck. Clean up on aisle-everywhere, please. Also, for a crazy amount of workers here, the time waiting in line was too long. Not worth it.\n- Price: Pretty pricey for a just-ok experience. \n- Food: For the price we paid, my experience here was ok. There was a lot to choose from, but most of the things I ate were only ok. For the price we paid, I was hoping to be wowed!\n- Atmosphere: Decor had a 90\'s feel. They need to update. Also, everything feels so crammed together--I was literally dodging people everywhere I went. Women\'s bathroom only had 3 stalls too, I believe.  Too small for a buffet, in my opinion.\n\nI wouldn\'t recommend this place unless you\'re lazy to go elsewhere, or you\'re more of a "quantity over quality" type of person.'

The red potato was cook to perfection. I know vegas has many buffets but this one is on top of my list. Me and the gf had no complain. She devour the sushi and said the best dessert ever! I was too stuff to fit any dessert. We left about hour later and there was a line wrap til the front entrance. So left and gamble n lost some money! So in reality that was a expensive buffet for us.

S'3pm Nevada time was 5pm according to my Wisconsin body, so the $19.95 lunch was dinner for me.   I would try to find something to nit-pick, but this is simply astounding value for $19.95.  The seared flank steak, thinly sliced at the carving station, was phenomenal - - an ideal cut of meat.  Unexpected favorites included the creamy herbed polenta,  the super-tasty pesto mashed potatoes.  The rotini with a bolognese sauce had classic bolognese flavor - - not just another meat sauce.  The raw tuna nicoise sald was great.   Incredible dessert selection.  Tasteful furnishings (sat at the nicely marbled bar - - a nice option with the constant drink refills a glance away - - and you might get seated quicker if you volunteer to sit there!).'

S'I tried both the Bellagio buffet and the Wynn buffet since there were so many mixed reviews for both. I have to say that the Wynn buffet is so much better. My boyfriend and I stood in line at around 2:30pm and stayed until 4pm for the dinner items (which only included some new sushi items, crab legs, and prime rib). The spicy tuna hand roll and salmon poke was probably the best part of the buffet. The dessert was mediocre. The creme brulee tasted like pudding, it was very watered down and had a runny consistency. I did enjoy the peach and strawberry self-serve sorbet though but not much of the other desserts really stood out to me. I wish there was more variety and choices for the buffet, my boyfriend even indicated that he went back several times only to get the same items he had already eaten.'

S'Salmon AND tuna poke.  I. fricking. love. that. stuff.  I personally prefer Bellagio over Wynn, if you\'re gonna compare the two "upscale" buffets.  I haven\'t been here for a few years, but everything is still good.  The cocktail shrimp was large and the sea bass was buttery and flaky.  I\'m here for the poke mostly...  They also have a good variety of fresh tossed salads.  For 29.95 on the Thur night, not bad.\nIt wasn\'t entirely great though, I was disappointed they didn\'t have beef wellington anymore and we went around the table spitting out the kobe due to some weird and strong metallic flavor.\nOne source of contention is the mandatory 18% gratuity for large groups...we split our party up to save on this...and the mofo put is in separate seating areas even though our section was entirely empty...ass.\nIMHO, still one of the top buffets in Vegas if you into it.  It\'ll be a while before I come back tho...gotta try out the M or Aria next time.'

But you just dont feel like you're dining in a 5 star hotel. For lunch, it's $19.99/person, which is not bad at all. But kids pay full price... I was surprised they dont give discount for kids... at Wynn you get half off for kids under 12. \n\nAgain, the food is pretty good. Nothing too memorable, just your typical buffet in Vegas, probably better than most places, but I have to say Wynn's buffet is a lot better, even though you pay a bit more. The most impressive section of the entire buffet is their dessert section. The cheesecakes are superb!"

They have both Snow Crab AND Alaskan King Crab legs that are already pre-cracked for.  Their selection of red meat is also much better than the other buffets, including Kalbi-marinated Ostrich, Prime Rib, Quail, Pork Loin and more.  And don't forget to leave room for a plate or two of desserts.  All the mini-sized desserts are delicious and just the right portion for when your stomach is starting to run low on space.  Be sure to get there around 5:30-6pm as the line does start to build up later on."

It was a friend's 25th birthday celebration-fest and we decided to do a group dinner at the Bellagio Buffet.  I called an hour before-hand to give the buffet a heads up that we were rolling with 19 people.  They don't really take reservations so we still had to wait in line but they managed to save us two tables right next to eachother!\n\nThere's sooo much food I didn't know where to start!  The meat carving station was serving up kobe beef, prime rib, ostrich, turkey, beef wellington, and more!  The kobe beef and prime rib were SO deliciously tender.  Other highlights: poke tuna (so fresh), prepared salads area, pastas, vegetarian pizza, mac n cheese, three different kinds of potatoes!!!  \n\nFor dessert I limited myself to three dishes and had the apple pie (really yummy), coconut macaroon (just okay), and the DELICIOUS chocolate covered strawberries.  They were dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and swirled chocolate covered. YUMMMMMM.\n\nAfter tax and gratutity (because we had a large party) it came out to be about $45 per person for the Saturday night dinner buffet.\n\nStuffed."

S"My boyfriend and I were really excited to try the Bellagio buffet and had heard good things about it.  There was a huge line (1+ hour wait) to get in, but we stood in it hoping that we wouldn't be disappointed when we finally got to eat.\n\nWhen we finally did get sat, we were seated at a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  The location was further away from the buffet than some would prefer, but I was happy to have a booth.  Some of the 2-seater tables were very small and looked quite uncomfortable, but I guess if you're planning to eat your way through the buffet, you likely get up enough that your butt won't hurt from the uncomfortable chairs.  I digress...\n\nThere was so much food it was hard to choose what to eat.  The menu items were unbelievable.  Kobe beef. Veal. Duck. Lamb. Free range turkey. Sushi. Crab legs. Pastas. Salads. It was definitely cool to see and taste food that I've only heard about (like Kobe beef) and to be able to eat as much as I wanted, but aside from the variety of food, I wasn't that impressed.  Everything was still just over-processed, over-cooked buffet food.  The Kobe beef was tough and over cooked.  The free range chicken was ok but still a little tough.  The sushi was fresh but still not great... you get the idea.\n\nThe dessert buffet was the same. I was impressed with the quantity and look of the desserts, but the taste was just ok.  The bread pudding was really good but other stuff looked prettier than it tasted.  \n\nFor $40 bucks I wasn't too upset about my visit to the Buffet at Bellagio and I certainly got enough to eat, but, like I said, the quantity was massive, but the taste left something to be desired.  I wouldn't necessarily go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go either."

We made reservations ahead of time since I was traveling with a 40 people group, but the line was not that monstrous at 8:00 p.m.\n\nAlthough the selection was not as vast as I envisioned it to be, the food was still of excellent quality. The miso baked fish was so good. Other dishes that left an impression were the prime rib, salmon/tuna poke, and pesto tortellini. Oh my god, the poke. I have never tasted ahi tuna this delicious. I've definitely been missing out all my life.\n\nThe dishes are replaced pretty often, and everything tastes fresh.\n\nThey have a good array of desserts, some of my favorites were the banana foster (hint of alcohol flavor) and the creme brulee. Their cheesecakes were okay, and the soft serve melts pretty quickly. By the time I had walked from the dessert bar back to my seat, I already had a pool of vanilla around my rapidly melting ice cream.\n\nGreat buffet!

The smoked salmon is so rich and so smooth, very very good. The eggs benedict is also another of my favorites here. They make breakfast perfectly with all their wide selections of food.\n\nDinner here is also pretty good, but I would have to say dinner at the Wynn buffet definitely beats this one out. The prime rib is not as tender here as at the Wynn and the other selections are not as good. Don't get me wrong though it is still a top notch buffet for dinner, just not the best Vegas can offer.\n\nThe service here is really nice, the waiters actually make conversation with you if wanted, for example telling some interesting stories, etc. They also come and ask if you need a refill instantly when they see that you are near empty.\n\nAmbiance and atmosphere here is also not as good as the Wynn.

And let me tell you this: This is a buffet to top all other buffets. The crowning jewel of buffets, if you will.

Success. We had dined at the Monte Carlo buffet the night before, and though it was one-third the price (buy-one-get-one, woo!), the Bellagio Buffet was worth every penny in comparison. Service was better (even with a long wait!), too.\n\nWandering through the buffet, I felt like Alice in a food wonderland, marveling at the choices. It was also my first time here as a pescaterian (formerly vegetarian), so the seafood choices rolled out before my eyes. Swordfish! Sushi! Somebody stop me!\n\nI realize this sounds pathetic, but I don't care ... I was in such a blissful state during this meal. Perhaps it was the company of a dear friend, or the fact that I was on vacation. Or quite possibly that everything I tried was freakishly delicious.

Yes there's prime rib, and various meats. Yes there's an area of just crab for all those people out there trying to earn money at buffets. Yes there's a small sushi area and a row dedicated to Asian food. But when you compare it to M or Wickedspoon... It pales. Especially the dessert section. \n\nThis is a good buffet, don't think i don't appreciate it. And the service was very good and prompt as well.

S'I\'ve been here before in 2008, and the food was not exactly what I would have expected from a prestigious resort as The Bellagio. The wasabi was watery, and the sushi tasted like an untrained person made it for Costco (I\'m sure you\'ll agree Costco sushi is one of THE worst you can have).\nFast forward to 2012, and I thought I\'d give it another try, thinking that perhaps 2008\'s dining experience was a fluke. It was not. Once again, Bellagio insists on serving their hungry patrons with subpar "gourmet" food. What a serious joke! I am once again appalled at what I would refer to as "wasabi soup".\nThe carving station had "Kobe Beef Top Sirloin". Are they serious? There is no such thing as Kobe Beef outside of Japan.'

Being close to NYE and all, we had no dinner reservations and as a last resort, came to The Buffet.  \n\nIt's $10 less than Bacchanal but if I had a choice, I seriously would have given even an extra $15-20 to get into Bacchanal because this was a big mistake (I was at Bacchanal last year).  It is 1/3 the size of Bacchanal and the variety of food is lacking.  \n\nThere are crab legs and you see a lot of people piling it onto their plates (to the point where a whole chain of people are lining up and the people who lack any consideration are still piling it onto their plates).  I tried some and they're seriously not worth the hype that these people make it out to.  They were much too salty and lacked crisp freshness (but they weren't unfresh either).  \n\nThe only good thing they had was prime rib with their kalbi sauce.  Their salmon fillet was also not bad.  However, everything else lacked a wow factor.  It was like any other buffet I've been to.  The desserts weren't good either.  \n\nSo now that I've been to both Bacchanal and The Buffet, which one would I pick?  Definitely Bacchanal wins.  Bellagio seriously needs to vamp up and get their act together and improve on their buffet because Bacchanal is seriously stealing their thunder.  Big time.  So much to the point where, had I not had a show to watch, I *definitely* would have waited 6 hours for Bacchanal instead."

S"I'm THAT girl. You know, the one that dreams about buffets. No, not DAYdreams about buffets like every other Asian girl. I mean dreams, in my sleep, about buffets. My good dreams consist of me actually getting to eat the food I picked out. The nightmares mean I dream about being stressed out because I don't know what else to put on my plate, it just gets filled up more and more until BOOM!! I wake up. Forreals.\n\nI don't know if my taste has become more refined (doubtful) but I wasn't in love with the Vegas buffets this time around. I remember them as being so much better 2 years ago.. but they were mediocre. At least the Bellagio redeemed my Vegas buffet expectations I'd become used to fulfilling.\n\nWe waited in line for over half an hour for the dinner buffet on a Saturday night. It zig zagged up, down, and around until we finally got to the front. You've got to keep your eye on the prize here! Stay hydrated, keep good company, and make sure your phone's battery is charged for playing some time-wasting games.\n\nSo there were a few things that were just meh like the sushi and some of the chicken stuff. And I kind of expected more from the dessert spread. They looked pretty but I was expecting more.. bigger.. sparklier! With more chocolate! \n\nNow, the three things I could've filled my plate with, endless times over, were the short ribs, asparagus, and Yorkshire pudding. The short ribs were so creamy and succulent, the asparagus.. well I love asparagus. And who doesn't love Yorkshire pudding?! A savory pastry shell?! \n\nThe inside of the Bellagio buffet is pretty refined, given it's a buffet. We saw plenty of families and groups of bachelor / bachelorette parties dining. One note to the girls: don't dress up to the buffet. It is Bellagio, yes, but it's still a buffet, not a fancy restaurant. Besides, how can you expand your tummy if you're wearing a non-expandable dress?! I saw some girls that looked like they were going out for the night and it looked silly, out of place.\n\nMmmm just thinking about that buffet makes me believe wasting all that money on those crap buffets was worth it. Worth the hefty price tag (do you know what $30 something could get you in NY?! A pizza and bottle of water), worth the 30 minute wait, and worth walking all the way down the strip from the Palazzo (it's far, seriously!) and back. WORTH IT."

I'll have to call these two buffets a wash , but the prices are little bit lower here and it's easier to get in as well.\n\nI liked the prime rib and lab especially, they had ribs and some other type of marinated steak. Shrimp aplenty, ceasar and other types of salad.\n\nThe dessert section was also very strong, bread pudding, carrot cake, various types of chocolate cake, Flan and my favorite...cream puffs. All in all much better than I expected."

S'My husband and I have been hearing this is the best buffet in Vegas so we decided to give it a try. I have to say we were very lucky we arrived early and got in quickly by the time we left it had a huge line. I can see why though the food was definitely worth it. My favorites being the king crab legs the beef wellington and beef bourguignon but they had so many choices and Kobe style beef sirloin prime rib turkey Italian and Japanese cuisine as well as Chinese American and seafood selections. I highly recommend this buffet even though the service seems a bit slow for getting drinks refilled and removing plates. IT could easily be five star accept for the lack of service.'

S'So... has the staff at Bellagio gotten lazy or something?  I\'ve heard so many great things about the buffet at Bellagio and how their "gourmet" selections offer the best value.  However that is not the case at all.  \n\nThis place is still popping, with my group having to wait 40 minutes around 2pm.  Once we got in, we were seated extremely close to other tables and it felt a little weird.  In fact, I think the layout of the place is weird.\n\nI was really excited to try the Kobe beef at the carving station but the piece I received was way too well done.  It felt like I was chewing leather and all the good things about Kobe beef was not there.  I decided to give it a 2nd chance and went back for another piece.  Slightly better but still, the meat had nothing going for it.  Wasn\'t seasoned well, and I think I can definitely make a better steak.  It just felt like they popped it on the grill and the oven and just forgot about it.\n\nAll the other foods are alright in comparison to some other buffets.  I do like how they crack the crab legs in half already for you so you don\'t have to do work.  Dessert station is the only thing worth mentioning since there is a good selection and that creme brulee is magical.  I probably ate around 4-5.\n\nThe buffet probably was good when it first.  The quality of this buffet has probably dropped and I think that\'s a problem that all hotels face eventually.  They have to find ways to reinvent themselves or just somehow maintain that standard that make them great the first go around.  Unfortunately, Bellagio definitely needs to do that or else nobody will shell out $30-40 again for the buffet.'

The sushi, salmon poke and tuna poke were delicious. Surprisingly good consider it is a buffet.\n\nThe dessert section is great. I mean glorious great. Lots of sweets offered. The creme burlee is good but it isn't warm- well yea it is sitting out for awhile. And there's an abundance of chocolate cover strawberries. OohhhMeeeGeee, forget eating real dinner food. Comatose from stuffing my face with chocokate cover strawberries.\nThe cheesecake was also delicious. Nice soft texture.\n\nOur server was great.

During the week you can get bottomless champagne, beer or margs for $10 extra which is way worth it. they also were lacking in dessert options but i hadnt left much room for dessert anyway LOL'

The salad and dessert bar are lagging behind the times. For the price, I think the M Buffet is a better deal - almost similar quality of items plus free alcohol. For quality, Wynn Buffet is really starting to pull ahead."

S'I don\'t think I\'ve gone to Vegas without doing the Sat/Sun Bellagio Brunch Buffet.  I have this thing down to a science.  Some people know how to count cards, well I know how to bring down the house by attacking the buffet.  So let me lay my wisdom on you...\n\nOK, first off, If you want to take Vegas, you need to follow some simple buffet rules.  1. No salad.  I don\'t care how good the dressing is, or how fresh it looks, or if it sounds good to you.  NO NO NO, that\'s like splitting 10\'s.  Someone fills one of their precious trips to the buffet with a salad, and I\'m picking up my buffet chips and changing tables.  2. No Rolls or bread.  They are good here, everything is freshly baked, but it takes up way too much space and it\'s is a trap they want you to fall into.  Kind of like taking insurance when the dealer has an Ace showing.  3.  No sushi other than maybe a spicy tuna hand roll.  They aren\'t slicing fresh sashimi here.  It\'s all california rolls with lots of rice and little fish.  You are going to get better sushi else where, so don\'t fill up on all that rice.\n\nOK, so now we got some basic strategy down, I\'ll teach you my fool proof system.\n\nCourse 1 - Breakfast.  Go to the omelette station on the left and have them fire one up for you.  Take in all your options.  If you don\'t want to go standard with the fillings, notice they have crab meat and shrimp.  They also have spinach, basil, and cilantro for some extra seasoning.  You want to think outside the box, go get some smoked salmon and bring it to them to throw into an omelette.  Ok after you get your omelette, you grab an eggs benedict (which always has a perfect runny yolk center), some sausage, bacon if you wish.  And now here\'s why I said to go to the Omelette station on the left and not the right.  Next to the sausage is a small bowl marked Beef Tenderloin.  They don\'t have that on the right and I think few people notice it, which is their plan.  So now you have nicely seasoned slices of filet mignon to put some more scrambled eggs on top of for steak and eggs.  I call this course, eggs 3 ways.  Omelette, Scrambled, and Benedict.  Please notice we\'ve avoided all french toast, waffles, and pancakes.  I\'m sure they are good, but you\'ll ruin your other courses.\n\nCourse 2 - Cold Smoked Fish.  Ok here\'s a real tough one.  You can\'t get a bagel with this course, it takes up way too much room and violates rule 2.  So you grab lots of smoked salmon, smoked trout, maybe herring if you like it, and slices of tomato and red onion.  Use the slice of tomato as a base and construct "open face" sandwiches of the smoked fish using cream cheese to hold it all together on the fork.  Right in the center of the buffet are large chilled cocktail shrimp, try to use the shrimp as a barrier between the cocktail sauce and the smoked fish.  Although it\'s a little known fact that cocktail sauce and cream cheese tastes good together.\n\nCourse 3 - Meat.  Go up to the carving station have them slice you up some Prime Rib and roasted lamb.  Make sure they don\'t skimp on your slices here, speak up if it\'s too small.  The odds for making it back again are small and sometimes there is a line.  They know this.  To your right is another small carving station with Turkey and Pork Belly.  Make sure you get this and some cranberry sauce to hold a piece of turkey and pork belly together on the fork.  You have to get some potatoes with your meat and mashed is the best way to go.  By mashing it, they\'ve done some of the hard chewing work for you.  By smearing some on each bite of meat, it goes down smoothly.  If you want flavor overload get the pesto mashed.\n\nCourse 4 - Odds and Ends.  So now walking around the buffet a few times you\'ve seen some other things that catch your eye.  Now\'s the time to just throw whatever else you want to try on your plate.  Roasted chicken and saffron rice, BBQ glazed Salmon, Creamy Pasta with chicken and sun dried tomatoes, a few Lo Mein Chinese dishes,  couple of slices of pizza.  Now with the pizza, don\'t be afraid to take only a few bites of the slice then eat the rest of the toppings so you aren\'t violating rule 2.  The pizza is pretty good and there are usually about 5 or 6 to choose from.  Keep on the look out for a shrimp pesto one.\n\nCourse 4.5 - Back Up Plan.  Sometimes the Odds and Ends aren\'t that happening.  People don\'t pay as much attention to them, and sometimes they sit too long and get a little dried out.  Don\'t be affraid to throw in the towel and then double down on something you really liked earlier.  Sure there are starving people in the world and you may feel guilty about throwing a whole plate of food away that you barely touched, but they aren\'t going to get that plate of food anyway.  \n\nCourse 5 - Dessert.  Sample Everything, Finish Nothing!  When I\'m done, my table looks the same as the dessert station, just with 1 bite missing.  Don\'t feel bad, remember what happened to the last person who told starving people "Let Them Eat Cake"'

S'This is one of the best buffets I have had in Vegas. This place is comparable to the Wynn Buffet, only cheaper - $30pp. Came here on a Monday evening, and there was a line! This place had to be good...\n\nWaited for about 30 mins and entered the establishment. WOW, this place was huge! Scoped out the stations and had so many choices! \n\nAll beefs I tried were delicious - loved the quail!!! Seafood trip was pretty tasty with crab legs and shrimp cocktail. Also had a made to order seafood pastry with shrimp and scallops. Desserts were to die for with so many selections!!\n\nOur service was prompt and our waitress was super nice.

Omelet stations, fruits salads, home fries... all good. Is it worth all the hype? Probably not, but I actually enjoyed eating at a buffet for once. That's a big deal."

They also had lots of mixed berries, which were so sweet that J was wondering if they added sugar to it. I believe the answer is no, although I can't say that with 100% confidence. They also had the cutest little apples which were also very good. The food they serve seems to be good quality and not just large quantities. For breakfast, there's a huge selection. While we were there, they even started to bring out lunch foods! Had we waited around a little longer, we could've gotten our hands on more lunch food. I wanted to stick around until the sushi came out but wasn't willing to wait another hour. Regardless, we left happy and stuffed."

Some of the highlights I had were the already pealed shrimp, prime rib and some of the pasta's. Some of the low lights, the Chinese food, the sushi and the desserts. Chinese food was crap, the sushi was sub par although there was a large selection. The dessert stations looked nice but the food itself wasn't good. And now for the BIGGEST low light. The crab legs. I had some high expectations for them, including love when i saw that they were already cracked open and all you needed was your fork so that you could just remove the meat and eat. The problem....they were frozen solid. I took two legs and let them rest a few mins figuring they would thaw out and be ok...they were too far gone frozen. Honestly just crappy. I was very disappointed with the whole thing especially for the place and the price."

S'I am giving this buffet 3 stars because of the price that this buffet has. The food was just "alright" for me. I went on a Friday night (Lobster night!), and the dinner was $50! It definitely was not worth it. I mean, they had a great variety of gourmet items, but I still was not impressed by it. I would rather shelf out $50 at the Rio\'s Seafood buffet than this. Highly overrated place. \n\nMaybe breakfast will change my mind about it. Who can go wrong with pancakes, waffles, eggs, and sausages?\n\n*Updated on 3/24/08: I actually ate here for breakfast for the first time. I actually liked it better than the Paris buffet for their french toast, but they didn\'t have the crepes! =/ They also didn\'t have sausages, so I was even more disappointed! We actually came at the end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch, so that\'s probably why! I will give it another try! Maybe for my next attempt, I will be more gracious with the stars!'

S"So...when you see the huge line form for this buffet, you are definitely intrigued. \n\nI ended up trying the buffet at 10:30 on a Sunday so we had their brunch buffet.  I was a little disappointed when I found out the sushi part wasn't going to start until 12 but oh well.  \n\nAt almost 30 bucks a person there is definitely variety: eggs benedict, various salads, muffins, donuts, french toast, personal omelets, ice-cream, eggs, stir fry, etc! \n\nServers come around and ensure you have enough to drink: coffee, soda, water so make sure to tip!  \n\nNow the food quality isn't bad.  I mean it's buffet food, you can't expect gourmet and individual dining but it wasn't spectacular.  Most of the seasonings are bland (to cater to the masses) but coming to this buffet is almost a must if you come to Vegas. \n\nJust try to leave this place without a protruding gut."

I didn't think anything was outstanding, or worthy of major hype. Maybe I caught this place on an off-night? I have just had better meals in Las Vegas, and I thought the buffet at the Cosmopolitan was better. It definitely wasn't bad though, and if there were no long line, I would come back."

As I mentioned in another review for Rain Forest Cafe, My wife and I spent less at The Bellagio than on 1 app, 1 meal, 1kids pizza, and 2 drinks at the Rain Forest. My son, 3 years old, ate for free.

There is a lot of variety (meat, fish, pizzas, pasta, fresh fruit, desserts), but not everything is equally good.\n\nSome Highlights:\n-The prime rib: flavorful and juicy\n-The sirloin: kinda bland, a little dry\n-The roasted turkey: unusually moist\n-The pesto mashed potatoes: yummy\n-The various roasted veggies: passable\n-The mini-desserts: varied, I recommend the lemon meringues, the financiers, and the cappuccino mousse. The tiramisu was not good. The creme brulee was okay.\n\nMy husband liked:\n-The bluenose: tender and well-complemented by the sauce\n-The smoked trout: tasty\n-The spicy hunan chicken: excellent\n-Homemade chorizo: Spicy, strong, and tender, though a little dry.\n-Among the side dishes, the paella and succotash had particularly rich flavor.\n\nThe Service: No problems here.

S'What trip to Phoenix would be complete without a visit to the famed Pizzeria Bianco, which has been arguably called the best pizza restaurant in the country by more than one publication.\n\nLocated in Heritage Square, and next to the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco is a very small restaurant.  When the popularity started to mount, wait times could exceed four hours.  Although the fanfare has seemed to die down somewhat from a national standpoint, Pizzeria Bianco still attracts crowds.\n\nIn order to avoid any potential long wait in the 110+ degree weather, we got there early enough to beat the crowds and were seated immediately.\n\nThe meal started off with some nice crusty bread that was super soft on the inside along with some nice fruity olive oil.\n\nThe handmade mozzarella, tomato, basil and extra virgin olive oil salad is a take on the margherita without the bread.  The mozzarella is super fresh, the tomatoes were a little lacking in flavor and the basil added a nice herbal punch.  A classic salad with few ingredients could have been elevated with riper tomatoes and just a touch of salt.\n\nThe pizzas are cooked in the wood burning oven that dominates the kitchen and is the focal point of the restaurant.\n\nThe "Wiseguy" pizza includes roasted onions, mozzarella and fennel sausage.  This is a nicely balanced pizza as the roasted onions brings out the sugar in them to cut the sharpness of the fennel.\n\n The "Biancoverde" pizza includes fresh mozzarella, Parmegiano reggiano, ricotta and arugula.  We added anchovies to this pizza.  The pepperiness of the arugula cuts through the richness of the cheeses.  I personally did not like this pizza, especially with the addition of the anchovies, but my dining companions loved this pizza, and was their favorite.\n\nThe "Sonny Boy" pizza includes tomato sauce, mozzarella, salami and Gaeta olives.  The saltiness of the olives totally overwhelms the rest of the ingredients.  If they were cut into smaller pieces, perhaps this would work better.  After taking the olives off, this became a much better pizza and each ingredient was able to shine on its own.\n\nThe classic "Margherita" pizza includes tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.  We added wood roasted organic mushroom and prosciutto.  On its own, the Margherita pizza is fantastic, but the addition of the mushrooms added a nice earthy flavor while the prosciutto added just a hint of salt.\n\nIs this the best pizza in the country?  That can be argued forever and never answered, as food is subjective.  I do applaud the freshness of the ingredients, and that everything is hand crafted.\n\nWorth a visit when in Phoenix?  Yes.  Worth waiting four hours?  I personally wouldn\'t.'

S'Tasty pizza. The crust has a nice chew to it. Hubby and I got a Wiseguy and Sonny Boy to share. Both pizzas came with generous portions of protein! More than I expected, that rarely happens! Both were $18 each. Wait was 30 minutes for a late lunch. We waited at the bar in the little house next door to the restaurant. Got a couple of beers and got a table at the Pizzeria before we even had a chance to finish our drinks. Valet parking for $3 in the adjacent lot. Service was fantastic! Super friendly with a smile.

Yes, it is a long wait, even if you get there half an hour before it opens (as a party of 2, we arrived at 4:30 one day and were seated at 6), but Bar Bianco next door is excellent, and the pizza always tastes better after a wait. I have eaten pizza in Italy, where, granted, it is very good, and I grew up in New Haven, CT, pizza center of the U.S., and I can say that Pizzeria Bianco is definitely one of the best in the U.S. The crust is the gem, thin enough for the thin pizza lover but also doughy somehow. I've had 3 of the pizzas, and recommend the plain margherita most. The servers and staff are all great as well."

S'Oh Biancos.  This isn\'t really a restaurant you can just say "hey, lets go get a quick bite to eat".  This is a commitment of time.  There are other pizza places in Phoenix, with perfectly good food.  Biancos though, it\'s more of an experience.\n\nExpect to spend at least 4 hours here.  1 ish hours waiting to get on the list, and then 2ish hours waiting to get into the restaurant, then an hour of eating.  Why would you want to do that?!  Well, because it\'s fun.  Make sure you go with a group of people you can have great conversations with.  Go when the weather is fantastic, and make sure you want to have some fun.  I always enjoy waiting in line with a glass of wine from Bar Bianco, which is next door.  You can start your tab over there, and carry it over to the restaurant when you are seated.  After you get on the list, the bar will also keep track of you and inform you when the restaurant is ready for you.\n\nBiancos is located in a quiet, great little section of PHX where there is actual grass and trees.  So waiting will be in a park, where you can stand around and chat with friends and strangers.  I always find myself, and my party chatting it up with the other people in line... we all know we are going to be there for a while, so might as well socialize.  \n\nThe food is always amazing.  I\'ve gone several times and have tried most of the menu.  My one bit of advice, always get fresh basil on your pizza.  It\'s an extra cost, but makes a world of difference, no matter what pizza you get.  The Margarita pizza is still my favorite of them all, it\'s perfection.\n\nJust go, expect to wait, and try to make the best of it.  It\'ll be a great time with friends, with wine, pizza, fresh air, and that basil.  :)'

I thought, ok PB is next door and there is no line, so we went for it.\n\nIt was about 4:45 and the place was practically empty! So the 6 of us rolled in and were seated immediately. Fabulous.\n\nThe menu is simple. Love that. We ordered the salad, roasted garlic pizza, margherita pizza, the Rosa, and the chocolate flourless cake.\n\nOh my stars. The food is excellent. What more can be said after 800+ reviews? My favorite was the Rosa pizza. Carmalized red onion, pistachios, rosemary...now I'm not a pizza expert (like I am with cupcakes and coffee lol), but this was probably the best pizza I've ever had. And I can't believe I'm saying that since I've traveled all over, and the best pizza ends up in my own backyard? \n\nChocolate flourless cake was also the bomb. So fudgy and rich and dense. So good!\n\nService was excellent too. Maybe because we were only  1 of 3 tables, but still. Food came out super fast, waters refilled, nice chit chat with the server about the owner Chris and the concept of the restaurant...I mean the whole experience from start to finish was perfect.\n\nGreat spot.

S"I am going to be a negative nancy.  I just don't understand the hype.  If I wait two hours for a meal, I would expect for it to blow the taste buds out of my mouth.  Pizzeria Bianco was decent pizza, but by no means worth navigating the tremendous crowds.  \n\nIf you do go, I suggest going a Tuesday or Wednesday and getting there at 4 or sending someone there at 4 to hold your place.  They open at 5, but the line is snaking already by 4:45.  Luckily, there are two bars nearby to while away your wait time.  I prefer the Rose and Crown, but you can also do their wine bar and get your tab transferred over.\n\nEverybody should come here and try it out for themselves.  It is definitely a unique Phoenix experience.  That being said, I would rather go to Cibo and wait 0 to 20 minutes for equally delicious pizza."

S'The best pizza in the united states according to several magazines. The owner bakes each pizza himself. The wait is a bit long but you can grab a glass of vino next door at Bar Bianco. Well worth the wait and price. Excellent place to take a date.'

S'If you have the time to wait for a seat, Pizzeria Bianco is something every pizza lover should experience at least once. The pies are that good.\n\nThe 43-seat restaurant in Old Town Phoenix is nationally known and the crowds outside prove it. You will need to get there around 2:00 or 2:30 in the afternoon to line up for a seat or you may be left waiting until after 6:30pm for the second seating. Really. If you get there after 3:00pm, forget about being in the first group of patrons.\n\nWhile you wait, Bar Bianco offers drinks and there are a few places to escape the hot Arizona sun. Most people are nice enough to let you back in line if you need to move, so bring a good attitude and make friends with your line-mates. It will help, believe me.\n\nThe pizza is crafted in a wood-fired oven which, legend has it, was delivered from Italy brick-by-brick and rebuilt on site. The meats offered are gourmet and can be a tad salty. The other toppings and the cheese are also high in quality. The oven creates a wonderfully caramelized crust that the uneducated might call "burned." However, that\'s their problem...the crust is perfect.\n\nI prefer the Sonny Boy, which has Salami and Olives, or the standard Margherita. However, the handful of other pizzas are equally as good. You might want to order two and take what\'s left home versus finishing and needing to order another pie.\n\nIf you\'re there during baseball season, you can walk to Chase Field to catch a Diamondbacks game...and you can park in the garage in between the two locations.'

S"I am the 697th review for Pizzeria Bianco, so what on earth can I add that hasn't already been said? Well, most of the reviews say that the wait is several hours long, which used to be true. In fact, several years ago, I actually waited for about an hour and a half. However, just recently, we walked through Heritage Square on the way to the ballpark. It was 6:30 PM on a Friday night and there was no way we ever would have imagined there would be room for us to dine. However, when we walked by, we noticed two spots at the bar. Could it be? We walked inside and yes, it was actually true! There were two seats at the bar just waiting for us. We couldn't have planned it if we tried, yet there we were sitting down on a Friday night at Pizzeria Bianco without a wait. I think this happened because Pizzeria Bianco has been open for lunch for awhile now and there isn't the excitement of waiting in line for them to open the doors at 5:30 PM. Whatever the case is, I think it's important to note that you might not have to wait for the two hours anymore...I think it all depends on the night. \n\nFood wise, I will second what so many of these reviews say. I really, really like the pizza here and the Margarita pizza is a number one best seller for a reason. It has this buttery taste of perfection with every simple bite. The salad was so fresh I thought something was off, until I realized that I just hadn't ever had such fresh lettuce before! I wouldn't wait for two hours to eat here, but if there's room to sit without a wait, then I will definitely eat here again in the future."

S"I was one of Those People who insisted I would never, ever go to Pizzeria Bianco.  I had no interest in waiting 3+ hours for the privilege of eating pizza.  Bah Humbug!\n\nWait...  what is this?  PB is open for lunch? On Saturdays?  Without a wait!?  OK, I take that all back.  Let's go!\n\nOn a recent Saturday we made our way to Heritage Square.  I approached the little restaurant/house building with a hefty dose of skepticism.  Could it really be *that* good?\n\nThe space is not very large, and was nearly full at 11:30.  Grabbing two open seats at the bar (with a great view of the wood-fired oven), we decided to try two pizzas:\n\nSonny Boy ($16) - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Sopressata (salami), Gaeta Olives.  As I am not a fan of olives, I asked for this to be served without them.  It was really just OK.  The crust was slightly overcooked making the edges more burnt than charred.  Also, it was sliced haphazardly, making the slices strange sizes and shapes.\n\nI was not very impressed.  Until the second pizza arrived:\n\nBiancoverde ($16) - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula.\nThis was a very interesting and tasty pizza!  A perfect blend of cheeses and garlic.  The Arugula was a nice contrast to the perfect blend of cheeses and garlic.  And, unlike the Sonny Boy, this crust was delicious!\n\nAbout a week later, I had the opportunity to enjoy a couple of other PB varieties (in addition to the Biancoverde) during lunch with a few (skeptical) co-workers:\n\nRosa ($13) - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios.  This sounds like a strange combination, but it works!\n\nWiseguy ($16) - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage.  Good, but did not take the place of the Biancoverde as my favorite.\n\nIt was fun to watch their nervous expressions at the sight of an arugula-covered pizza turn to smiles of delight at their first bites.\n\nSo, I am glad I finally gave PB a try.  Will I ever wait hours and hours for these pizzas?  No!  However, you may find me there at lunchtime, savoring a Biancoverde with a smile."

S"Yes! Wow, I finally made it to Pizzeria Bianco after having it bookmarked for a couple years.\nThe good part now is that they are open for lunch, so the line isn't quite as long and they take RESERVATIONS! I made a res for 10 about 3 weeks out, and while it was very crowded in there with 10 people, it was well worth it.\nThe setting is adorable; Heritage Square, to me, is perfect downtown Phoenix. The old house is super cute, as is the bar next door. Bonus points because you can walk to the ballpark and other downtown sites.\nThe menu and wine/beer lists are small, but carefully-selected and unique.\nThe pizza has an excellent crust with delicious, local-where-possible ingredients.\nI highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco for visitors and locals!"

S"Normally, I would deduct a star for having to wait three, that's right, three hours to get a table. But Chris Bianco, himself, mans the  kitchen and it's clear that he puts his heart into making pizza. There were four of us for dinner, so we sampled all the salads and appetizers, which were all wonderful and then had the wiseguy pizza which had homemade fennel sausage as one of the ingredients. \nAnd for a rare event in Phoenix - it was freezing cold. We luckily managed to get a spot in the bar next door where we could keep warm. \nParking is limited, so if you have to park in the adjoining garage, as we did, make sure you bring your parking stub to get validated."

S'Is it really worth the wait? Well, for us the answer is a complete yes to around 40 minutes in June on random weekday but to hear people say they have waited four or five hours for a table is a concept I do not think I could understand under any circumstance.\n\nThe menu is simple and outside of some small before choices do not expect anything other than pizza. The pizza, however, is indeed what the place is all about and for me I had to try the Wiseguy - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage for my first visit and I think it would be hard to imagine going for anything else.\n\nBefore the pizza the Handmade Mozzarella, Local Tomato and Basil with Extra Virgin Olive Oil was simply stunning and if the food alone was not good enough the service is a definite match to the gastronomic sensation. In particular the person (manager?) that hovered around both here and next door at the bar making sure everything was moving smoothly was amazing.\n\nOkay, I am hungry now, but sad that I am now too far away from here for an immediate return visit!'

S"FOOD: The pizza itself was quite tasty. It kind of melts in your mouth. This probably isn't a common thing, but my friend found a bug in her pizza that was probably thrown on with the vegetable toppings. By this time, we've all grown a little frustrated with this place. If you get a bug-free pizza, it's great. \n\nPRICE: A little expensive for pizza standards, but nothing that will have you digging deep into your wallet. Beware, the drinks do NOT come with free refills, including soft drinks. I spent around $15. \n\nSERVICE: The absurd wait for a table is what's keeping me from going to Pizzeria Bianco more often. Be prepared to wait a couple hours for a table, unless you make a reservation weeks in advance. The hours of operations of this place are laughable, only a couple hours each night, and are closed for at least one day out of the week. I wasn't too impressed with the service. The waiter failed to mention that soft drinks do not come with free refills. \n\nSKINNY: Great food, but there were too many drawbacks to this place to keep me coming back again and again. The long wait, bug in a pizza, lack of free refills, and higher than average prices are too much to be ecstatic about Pizzeria Bianco. Worth to try once, though."

S'The most overrated pizza in the world.  Yes.  The pizza is good.  But for the last time, it\'s pizza.  Is pizza worth waiting 3 hours for and putting up with snotty bad service?  I have been here a couple times and the overall experience has always left a bad taste in my mouth.  If you are patient, tolerant, easy-going, and addicted to wood-fired pizza, then by all means, go wait with everyone else.\n\nI am really blown away by all the 5 star reviews.  I guess some people are more tolerant of the "Soup Nazi" mentality than me.\n\nUpdate:  Okay.  I need to clarify my review.  I can\'t knock the food.  It really is fantastic.  And I wrote this review a couple years ago when I was unhappily married and the thought of having to wait more than 15 minutes for a table was intolerable because I just wanted to eat and go home.  So, take what I say with a grain of salt.  If you love pizza and don\'t mind waiting a long (long) time, you will probably love this place.'

It is open 24 hours a day, and it is super affordable.  $6 a sandwich is amazing for vegas.  The original is a roast beef sandwich, which had a hint of cracked pepper.

S'Decided to visit after I read the reviews on Yelp.  The line situation is strange.  First, there is an interrogator at the beginning of the line that attempts to discover which type of sandwich you are getting.  He then gives you a receipt for that sandwich, and proceeds to tell you that the drink and chips can be ordered at the end of the line.  So...this guy\'s purpose in life at this restaurant is to determine which sandwich you want?  Ok....fine.  I will play along.\n\nI ordered the Reuben.  He printed out my receipt.  I paid for the sandwich, my fiance\'s sandwich, a bag of chips, and two drinks at the end of the line.  They then gave me these nifty lighted thingys that will inform me when my sandwich is completed and ready for pickup.  Ok...organized....good.\n\nTo my surprise the lighted up thing went off about 5 minutes into the wait.  I thought "cool...I get my sandwich before these other people that were way ahead of me in line...it must be because of my total rewards tier credit...they are treating me right!"  \n\nWRONG.  First, EOS told me they do not take part in the Total Rewards, which sucks, and the reason they turned on the lighted thing was to tell me they had no Pastrami.  \n\nSo....let me get this straight.  You have a guy whose sole job is to determine your sandwich order...that\'s his job...sandwich ordering...knowing what is present in the restaurant and what is needed etc.....and he screwed it up?  How does a sandwich restaurant not have Pastrami?  That would be like Santa with no reigndeer, Books with no learnin\', staying home sick and not watching Price is Right.  The first layer of defense in telling me a worldwide pastrami shortage threatened Vegas failed with the sandwich receipt guy and the second layer of defense failed with the final cashier ringing me up for a sandwich that did not exist at that restaurant at that time.\n\nTechnology just rolled over in its grave...'

I thought the prices were reasonable and the food was dependable.  I was thrilled to see that I could get a Cobb salad and it was pretty good despite being somewhat different from other Cobb salads I've had.  It had no avocado but had cranberries and two types of cheeses which were in chunks in the salad (I actually kinda like the cheesy chunks).  It hit the spot and was good.\n\nMy friend had the Cobb salad in a wrap which she also enjoyed.  We were able to order and get food very quickly, and there is a coupon for 10% off in the book you get when you sign up for Planet Hollywood's players' club.  We had no problem finding a table.  The food is served in very handy little carrying bags that you could also take to go to another hotel or back to your room at PH, if so desired.\n\nI would return here if I was nearby.  It's inexpensive and dependable, and it's not a sit-down meal which makes it convenient.  I am not sure I would travel too far to get here but I would go here again if in the area.

I was debating between the Full Montagu and the All American: the All American won (this time) - loads of turkey, cranberry sauce, ranch dressing, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes.\n\nThe sandwich was packed with fillings. My friend said, "It tastes like Thanksgiving" and she definitely wasn\'t lying. One of the best parts about the sandwich was the bread: baked fresh everyday, it was crispy yet soft at the same time, and it really made the sandwich that much better.\n\nAfter trying a bite of the Full Montagu, I think that sandwich would have been even better than the All American, which was good but not out of this world good.\n\nIt was a cheap, filling lunch, and with so many options to choose from, everyone is bound to find something they like.

The Caprese had a balsamic dressing that tied the sandwich together in such beautiful harmony. Next time I'll ask for the to warm or melt the cheese a bit more; I like my cheese gooey.\n\nThe broccoli and cheddar soup was like broccoli chunks in cheese soup, but somehow the flavors went well. And of course, how can you go wrong with Ghiradelli?\n\nAmazing!!

Caprese - would order it extra melty next time\n3. Holiday - the gravy, cranberry, and stuffing is like warm Thanksgiving in my mouth\n4. Original 1786 - classic roast beef and horseradish\n5. Italian - nice flavors, but didn't jump at me\n\nBrownie creme sandwiches are like giant brownie Oreos.

S'With over 1500 reviews (mostly 5 star), this is no longer a secret.   When you come here, there will certainly be a long line, but it moves fairly quickly.  The reason is simple:  this is a solid lunch or after-club option for cheap eats.   Their sandwiches are about $7, their hot sandwiches are very flavorful, and their meats are great.  \n\nTheir full montague is their most popular sandwich.  I\'ve also tried their carribean jerk, which has a mild spice to it.  This visit, I tried their seasonal turkey sandwich, which had stuffing and cranberry sauce.  The turkey was moist and it was just a well made sandwich.\n\nThese are flavor-packed sandwiches and a solid option for cheap eats in the middle of the strip.  If you\'re looking for other cheap eats on the strip, I\'d recommend that you venture to the "Secret Pizza" place in Cosmopolitan, to Chipotle by Harrah\'s, and to the food court at Excalibur (where you can find Quiznos, McD, Pizza Hut, Krispy Kreme, and Baja Fresh sans markup).  On the other side of town, then you could go to Circus Circus, Tacos El Gordo, or the Fashion Show Mall for budget eats.  (Downtown is a different story altogether), \n\nHowever....in looking at this list....Earl of Sandwich, Tacos El Gordo, and the Secret Pizza place are clear standouts and you should consider checking them out if you\'re looking to seek great food options under $10.'

S"Earl of Sandwich is probably one of the spots I go to eat whenever I am in Vegas.  It's open 24 hours, which is great for after clubbing eats or even a quick meal before clubbing and/or a night of bar hopping.  I have been here a number of times and always try something different.  So far everything has been really good with the exception of one sandwich that i think was given to me in error.  Overall, I think this place is a gem of a place because it's cheap, tasty, quick, lots of different hot sandwiches, salads, and wraps to choose from, and is open 24 hours a day."

Each day, you can go pull the slot machine once to test your chance to win 2 million.. Do you know how many Earl Sandwiches that is!?!

S"Why would one waste a meal here at this chain restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip? Was curious and went to try it. A big disappointment, and a regrettable meal choice. The giant, almost grotesque pile of par-baked white bread 'loaves' at Earl Of Sandwich are a huge turn-off - hide that nasty pale bread, guys! No whole wheat bread choice. White bread is all they've got - the sandwich nutritional equivalent of an iceberg salad. 21 locations across the USA and growing? You're going to stunt our growth, Earl! Please stop!\n\nAnd, this is how they get 'cha: if you're hungry, you will want two (2) sandwiches, and that will set you back $12. These are relatively small sandwiches with very little going for them on the inside - under 2 oz. of meat, and no 'extra veggie' options. If you were to get a free sandwich on an AmTrak Train ride, this is pretty much the sandwich you would expect to receive.\n\nBecause of this experience, every time I am among the very slim pickings at Newark Airport Terminal A, I pick the Jamba Juice cart every time over the Earl Of Sandwich. Not sure if the Earl Of Sandwich's popularity comes from it's Disney World roots or what, but I crown thee now: the Runt Of Sandwich!\n\nYou really think that Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens actually eat this sh*t? (They are two of the original franchisees!)"

S"Pretty good for sandwiches I'd say. We've been here a few times and every time it's pretty darn good. The last time we went I got the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was the best one I've ever had there. I also got the broccoli soup and it was creamy and delicious. Their desserts are also quite delightful...cakes, muffins, etc Yum!\nMy husband got the Original 1762 sandwich and he really enjoyed it. The Earl's Cub is even better according to him. I really think it's their warm and fluffy breads and tangy sauces that put them a notch above most other sandwich places.\nYou can tell all of the ingredients are fresh, so I don't mind paying 7ish dollars for a sandwich that IS smaller than a Togo's sandwich in comparison. \n\nI am not orgasmic over this place like my best friends are, but it's a cheaper lunch option in Vegas if you want to pass over the typical buffet, and the food is really fresh and high quality for a sandwich shop. \n\nI'm sure we'll return."

Not terrible by any means, but not something I would wait in the exceedingly long line of tourists to sample again. I had the Caribbean Jerk sandwich and boyfriend had the Italian...which was dripping with grease. It is fine as a late night snack after boozy times..otherwise I would not seek this place out.'

S"There are literally thousands of reviews extolling Earl of Sandwich as the finest (and most affordable!) place to have a sandwich on the Strip.\n\nWhile all those reviews are indeed awesome, I'm going to talk about something else entirely: tomato soup.\n\nYes, tomato soup.\n\n(I've said it before and I'll say it again... The easiest way to make a snap judgement about a restaurant is by looking at the quality of its soup.)\n\nThe tomato soup at Earl's is orgasmic.  In fact, it's the best damn tomato soup I've ever had.  It's rich, it's creamy, and it's packed with an incredible depth of tomato flavor.  It's topped with the most perfectly crisped croutons I've ever encountered (not too soft, not too hard).  One spoonful of this tomato soup and I was in foodie heaven ...\n\n... at 8:30am.\n\nYeah, I went to Earl's for breakfast.  Weird, I know -- but please don't hate.  It's actually a great place to go for breakfast.  There are no lines in the morning, and there's plenty of seating to go around.  In fact, it was only like 5 minutes between when I placed my order at the counter and when the little electronic plastic thingy started blinking and vibrating to let me know my food was ready.\n\nWhat to have with tomato soup at 8:30am?  Grilled cheese wasn't on the menu, so I had the next-best thing: the tuna melt.  And, oh my God, this tuna melt was just as orgasmic as the tomato soup.  It was a fresh, delicious roll with piping hot tuna and a layer of beautifully melted cheese.  Is there such thing as tuna bliss?  I think there is, and it's served up at Earl's.\n\nDid I mention that all this food cost less than 10 bucks?\n\nHave I convinced you of Earl's amazingness yet?  If so, get off your butt and walk -- no, RUN -- to the Planet Hollywood hotel as fast as you possibly can and start noshing on some of the best cheap eats in Las Vegas."

S"3.5 stars\n\nThe sandwiches aren't worthy of the overall 4.5-star rating here on Yelp but they are good enough .... as snacks!  The sandwiches are small and there's hardly any meat in them to the point where you might wish you had more... or perhaps ordered two for yourself.  \n\nWe got:\n\nPastrami Reuben - I really liked this as the flavor was definitely there but was disappointed when there was hardly any pastrami in my sandwich.  If I were to come back, I'd get this one again, though, since I'm a fan of pastrami.\n\nThe Full Montagu - This had roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  This wasn't bad but it definitely had more meat than the other sandwich.  Again, the sandwich was the same size as the other -- small! \n\nThis place is convenient if you are either staying around the strip but I'd rather drive and explore what else Vegas has to offer.  I'm sure they have better sandwiches that have generous portions of meat for about the same price.  As good as the pastrami reuban was (minus the lack of pastrami), I'm most likely to pass these sandwiches up and drive to some place else.  Worth a try, though!"

Solid 4 stars for the holiday turkey, one star off for the 45 minute line.\n\n****IMPORTANT NOTE**** \nMy recommendation is to go to the OTHER EARLS LOCATION on the strip, as the line at this one is RIDICULOUS.

I took full advantage of the late hours. I never knew about Earl of Sandwich until I visited Vegas. I ordered a variety of sandwiches off the menu doing my stay in Las Vegas(breakfast & lunch). I enjoyed every sandwich I ate at EOS. Cheap, fast, and delicious is a combination you can't beat on the LV strip. Earl of Sandwich was crowded during certain hours of the day and night. A couple of times, I had very long waits to get my sandwiches. Earl of Sandwich is good bang for your buck. If you're looking for a quality cheap sandwich in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a great choice. Note: Earl of Sandwich is a good choice for after the club eats. I give Earl of Sandwich a 4.5 rating."

Well look no further than the Earl of Sandwich at PH - it is worthy of the title Earl of Sandwich for a reason. \n\nThe location is in the rear of PH near the mall area and generally has a steady line throughout most of the lunch and evening dinner rush. \n\nMy first visit I had the BLT and was pleasantly surprised by flavors of just those basic fresh ingredients. The bacon was generously diced up and tied together on their signature bun so well we came back the next day. I then tried there Holliday sandwich at the recommendation of my friends, though it is not the same as Capriotti's I was slightly nervous ordering it here. IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING. The simple flavors of thinly cut turkey, cranberry, and stuffing come together so well on this sandwich I  wish there were more locations throughout the U.S. The house brand chips pair very well with any sandwich you order - my personal favorite was the sea salt and vinegar.\n\nThere is a selection of teas, soda's, and beer offered at this location with prices on par with other locations in the area.\n\n5 stars - you have to check this out, it's worth your time."

And, it is an awesome choice to save half of the sandwich for later on in the evening, when you're returning home, drunk and starving, from the clubs. Plus, I believe this location is open all the time. But, of course it is -- it's in Nevada.\n\nThe only thing that made me sad about Earl of Sandwich was that I waited in the huge, long line through Planet Hollywood, dreaming of the Italian sandwich I was about to eat (made with salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato and Italian dressing), only to discover that they were out of these ingredients and couldn't make me one. At the last minute, I went with the plain and simple ham 'n swiss ($6.99).\n\nI wasn't sad for long, though, because the service was very efficient, and the sandwich was amazing. The ham was warm, the cheese was melty, and the bread was crisp and hearty. The ham 'n swiss is simple but so, so effective.\n\nI fantasize often about just driving the 32 miles to Downtown Disney in Anaheim solely to reunite with Earl of Sandwich."

S'Never before have I felt so noble in Vegas for such a low price.  Would one rather have a $2000 Bottle Service @ Marquee, or 650 sandwiches from Earl of Sandwich (i.e. sandwiches for life)?  I would have to lean with the latter as every Earl\'s delcicious, piping-hot sandwich I\'ve had has been deliciOUS  If you\'re a fan of freshly baked bread that\'s magically soft and tender on the insides, yet baked and firm on the outside, you have found your nirvana.  Next, each sandwich is comprised of an ample amount of meat/lettuce/dressings/etc where each and every delightful bite is full of flavor and satisfaction.    If only they played EDM....Earl\'s would be borderline culinary bliss.\n\nTheir pricing is extremely competitive, especially for the Vegas Strip. Each sandwich is priced @ $5.99, with additional costs for double meat (really not necessary).  Another amazing aspect of Earls? IT"S OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY!!! Which means, one can wander over there drunk, intoxicated, and eat probably the best tasting sandwich in drunken memory and then even bring one back in case you happen to throw up before the night.  Unlike the other 24 hr joints, which tend to have long, inefficient waits, the line @ earls breezes through as they have an awesome system of those vibrating ringers that alerts you when your sandwich is ready.\n\nRecommendations: The Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, Earl\'s Club (only if you like bacon as it has a prominent taste in the sandwich).  \n\nOverall, I think this how become my favorite place to eat in Vegas and I would gladly recommend anyone who throughly enjoys hot sandwiches to eat here.

With an assortment of sandwiches, I always find myself grabbing their Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich! \n\nMy friend isn't such a fan of the chipotle sauce and recently asked if she could replace it with ranch instead. They were completely understanding and replaced the sauce with her request. Just in case some people are wondering if they can substitute something! \n\nIt's always a great place to try and I'm sure you will not be disappointed!"

Maybe it could have requested rare meat, but I didn't think about it since my sammie was so perfect last time. \n\nI agree with others: the packaging is a little overkill.

But the service is prompt, and prices are not bad at ~$6/sandwich.  I'm no sandwich connoisseur, but the bread is warm and chewy (with a crispy crust), and the flavor is good.  It's not spectacular, but it's a solid.\n\nFor its convenience at the Miracle Mile shops, connected to Planet Hollywood, and across from Cosmopolitan, it is my go-to spot for a sandwich.

It hit the spot right away, haha! The flavors all intermingled inside of  artesian bread created a PARTY IN MY MOUTH! \n\nI couldn't get enough, so I came back the next day excited to try another sandwich! This time I tried the Tuna Melt. OMG, I felt like I tasted PARADISE! This is the best tuna melt I have ever tasted!! Beautifulness! Its simplicity was all that was needed to be the best on my list!\n\nBesides the sandwiches, I liked the Iced Tea Lemonade! It is something different, but different is good sometimes! =D\n\nMy newfound goal is to try all of the sandwiches here!!

The price is alright. When I first had it, it was really tasty, the taste of fresh warm toasted bread with a ingredients I enjoyed was perfect. so I wanted to pick up another the next day to save and eat on my drive back home.

Case in point, you probably don't want to go for the $5 prime rib you find in most places.  Probably. \n\nThis place, despite a silly name and slogan, makes a pretty good sandwich.  Is it the BEST (hot) sandwich.  Debatable.  Does it get bonus points for apparently being founded by the current, actual Earl of Sandwich.  Sure.  Is it interesting that it was started not in Sandwich, but rather outside of Disneyland or that his name is of course not Earl but that his business partner's name is in fact Earl.  A little.  Would it be great to be called Lord Sandwich. Yes. \n\nIn any case, they make a pretty good sandwich for $6 and have a good selection, as you can tell there because there is always a line at all times of the day.  That said, they also have pretty good hours."

I had the chicken chipotle without the bacon and it was delicoussss. From the bread, to the sauce, I was super happy we tried it. I also had a cup of the chicken tortilla soup. SO GOOD. And I think my group was less angry towards me for making them wait an hour of A SANDWICH once we all tried our food. \n\nCame here again 2 nights later and the line was alot quicker (all the EDC peeps left...haha). \n\nGo here for cheap, good food!

The line may seem a little intimidating because it can get long, but it's systemized well so that even though the line can get long, it moves -- which is a good thing. \n\nThere are plenty of selections to choose from but when in doubt, go with The Original. It's your basic roast beef sandwich with a hint of horseradish, toasted in the oven. It comes out perfect and if you're feeling daring, order up a side of the broccoli and cheese soup and DIP the sandwich in it. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. \n\nAs an added bonus, if you've been out partying until 5:00am, a sandwich from Earl's is the perfect thing to eat to sober your drunk ass up."

S"Wow.  A really really good sandwich in the LEAST place you'd expect it.  NEXT TO A CASINO.  And surprisingly affordable.  Don't think of this place as a budget eat.  Its a really really good sandwich.  But you can save some money by hitting this place up a few times if you don't feel like a full blown buffet meal.\n\nI was told this was going to be an amazing sandwich.  I'm always cautious about my hype before eating at a new place.  But this place delivered and then some.  If you've found this place on yelp mobile and you're trying to decide where to eat.  Just eat here, and thank me later.  You'll only be out $10 if you hate it..."

S'Have you ever seen "FRIENDS" the show? Remember how Joey mentioned that the meatball sandwich he had was as good as sex? Well this place definitely hits the spot!! A wide selection, open I THINK 24 hours (we came here after the club at 5 am, so it has to be open 24hrs), and just really good and affordable!!\n\nFor me I wanted something different so I chose the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich. The sandwich has Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce. AS a hot sandwich it was FABULOUS. the bread was crispy but NOT hard. The Chicken was moist and all the toppings just tasted fresh. Move over SUBWAYS and TOGO\'s...I have a new love for sandwiches thanks to Earl. Why can\'t there be one here in California?!\n\nI would recommend this to all my friends to definitely check out. It is affordable, the lines are long but doesn\'t take long, delicious, fresh and just enough to hit the spot and satisfy you for a good lunch! I give earl a 5 stars, best sandwich place I\'ve ever been to in a while :-)'

I enjoyed it, but i felt like they could have put more inside of the sandwich. The wait was kinda long for this place (Only because we went during lunch time), but it was worth it. \nA bit too much hype for this place, but it is good haha.'

They are either open late or 24 hrs, because we arrived after 2am and were able to order a sandwich.\n\nI started with the Club and tried the All American on the 2nd visit - both awesome, but the Club was better.\n\nMy husband started with the BLT and tried the Hawaiian BBQ on the 2nd visit - both awesome, but he liked the BLT better.\n\nMy other friend is in love with the Full Montague and thought the soup was tasty as well.\n\nTheir unique brick-shaped tasty bread and their sandwich sauces make this place so good that now that we've returned home from Vegas, we have looked up all other Earl of Sandwich locations and will make a special stop next time we go to one of those cities.,"

S'When you punch in "cheap eats" in Las Vegas and this pops up, you have to try it.\n\nFor $5.99 a sandwich this is a best buy on the strip. Located in the Planet Hollywood hotel, it\'s a but hard to find, but worth the trip.\n\nThe bread is a pressed (panini) version of an Italian roll. It\'s a texture I haven\'t tasted before.\n\nThe Full Monague & Italian were recommended so we had to try them. Fortunately, we did not hit a long line so our food was ready in 10 minutes. The way they put together the meats and bread is tremendous. Crunchy, soft and tasty all at once!\n\nOne nice touch is they have stickers for each of their sandwich items so you don\'t have guess which one is which. \n\nI\'d give it 5 stars, but the sandwich isn\'t that big...good thing I\'m not that hungry for breakfast.'

Since Earl of Sandwich is on the way back to the hotel we decided to stop by to get our grub on. I swear the walk from the MGM grand was the longestttt...we should have just taken a cab. When we got there the place was packed and there was a line, but it moved quickly. I ordered the full montague and macaroni salad. About 5 minutes later my sandwich was ready. Yes I was highly intoxicated, but the sandwich was amazing. It would have been just as good if I was sober too. That was also my cheapest meal in Vegas. Now that was my 2 cents."

S"What fascinates my boyfriend the most about this is that it seems to be owned by descendants of the actual Earl of Sandwich, meaning that they, of all people, should know sandwiches. This always leads me to question how hard it really is to stick meat in bread and eat it... I mean, could humanity really have gone that long before coming up with such an idea? Or is it that this guy, Earl of Sandwich, just proclaimed it first? \n\nAnyway, I digress...\n\nThe kicker here is the bread- baked fresh and run through an oven with the toppings so that a crusty exterior and gooey interior can create magic in your first bite. \n\nI can always go for more meat and cheese in any sandwich, but for the very fair price of $5.99 per sandwich, I'm not complaining. So far, I've sampled the Full Montagu (#1 for me), the Original (#1 also for me, it's a tie), the club (#3 for me), the italian (#4 for me) and the hawaiian (#5, but this will fall quickly as I sample the others- the sauce is too sweet for me). \n\nIf you ever get the chance, order a salad. The croutons kick serious ass. \n\nThe lines can get long, but the staff runs through it quickly. You order from the sandwich/salad/wrap/soup menu first and are given a buzzer. From there you walk through a gauntlet of temptation- parfaits, potato salad, coleslaw, beer and wine, and a wall of desserts- before you reach the cashier and pay for your meal and anything you picked up on the way. When you hot food is ready, you're buzzed. I usually don't sit in my seat for more than three minutes before I get the buzzer of joy. \n\nDuring my second visit, one register was down so the line was slow moving, but that actually caused my sandwich to be ready right when I paid- not so bad in the end!"

S"I love these sandwiches.  Too bad it's so far away from where I usually stay.  If you don't mind taking a cab, if you're staying in the north end, you should go here.  I recommend you eat one sandwich there while it's warm, then pick up a few sandwiches to bring back to your room too.  I'm sure it'll be a good eat when you're buzzed or drunk.\n\nI ordered the All-American sandwich, which is basically turkey and cranberry sauce.  It was probably one of the top 3 sandwiches I've ever eaten and I eat a lot of sandwiches.  I'm not sure what I liked most about the sandwich, most likely it was the warm bread.  You could tell they used quality ingredients for the whole sandwich, so it could have been that too.\n\nI only have two regrets about my experience; only going there once on my 4 days in LV and not ordering the turkey and bacon, because I was trying to eat a little healthier.  Damn you fit people at the pool making me self conscious about my belly!!!"

Whether you're going for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or for a LATE night snack (they're open 24 hours, btw), you will love this place. I once went 4 times in 3 days on a Vegas trip, and make it a point to go at least once on each trip.\n\nYou may like variety and you may like switching things up every now and then, but my recommendation is to always go with The Original 1762 (freshly roasted beef, cheddar cheese & creamy horseradish sauce). The bread is amazingly good, too, because it is only half-baked before they make your sandwich. When they send it through the conveyor belt oven, the entire sandwich gets heated/baked to perfection.\n\nMy top 4 reasons for going to Earl of Sandwich:\n1) The Original 1762 is absolutely delicious!\n2) The prices are fantastically low!\n3) It's open 24/7\n4) Service is fast\n\nGive this place a try, you will not regret it!"

S"Okay, so it's just a freaking sandwich.  I know people say that it's over rated and well yeah, it is a bit over rated but it doesn't warrant the 1 star review.  Actually, there's no need for me to even write a review because this place has at least a few thousand.  So why did I give 5 stars?  Because look at where you're at.  Vegas is like a giant airport where the food is jacked up to 60% of the actual retail price.  I bought a slice of pizza and a coke one time somewhere and had to pay 12 bucks. Yeah, 12 motherfucking bones.  So let me tell you that Earl of Sandwich earns the 5 stars because for a pretty delicious fuckin sando, you only pay 6 dollars in a land where they would usually charge 12.  So there's my blurb right there.\n\nLine is pretty long, but it goes by fast and you rarely wait more than 5 minutes to get your order.  Not only that, the process of ordering to paying to getting your sandwich is so streamlined and smooth- there's no kinks to the process which is why they can go through so many people so fast.\nI ordered the tuna melt and it was decent- I really like their bread and the portions were good.  A half would have satisfied me but I went ahead and ate the other half because I'm to lazy to carry it around with me.  \n\nOverall - not the best sandwiches in the world, but they're still GOOD and you get the most bang for your buck here.  Plus, the joint is open 24 hours."

S'Their sandwiches sound really good on paper but once they hit my mouth, it wasn\'t as good as I wanted them to be.  It could be that we didn\'t eat them right away.  \n\nThey serve mainly Hot Sandwiches here so I think you should be eating them right away but we were in a hurry to get somewhere so we didn\'t have that luxury.  I may try them again at some point but the next time, I will eat it right out of the kitchen.  \n\nTheir prices are cheap but their sandwiches are smaller too.  They remind me of an Americanized "Vietnamese Sandwich Shop"  \n\nBut just so everyone knows, their prices are not Vietnamese style cheap ($3.50-$4).  They were more like ($5.50-$6.00) from what I remember.   \n\nDefinitely have had better toasted sandwiches in San Francisco though....'

S"The bread.\n\nFor $5.99, you get a medium size oven cooked sandwich, but the size is deceiving.  The bread is pretty dense, and fills you up fairly well, as opposed to Subway or Quiznos which is all air.\n\nThe bread is crowning feature of the sandwiches.  It isn't cooked until you order your sandwich, and then your sandwiched it put through what resembles a pizza oven.  The bread is crispy along the edges, and yummy.\n\nI wish they put more filling, and more veggies, though.  I ordered the jerk chicken, and my mom ordered the tuna melt.  It seems like it would taste must better if the ratio of bread to stuffing was more balanced.  They probably can't over-stuff it though, in fear it wouldn't cook completely.  \n\nWhen I come here again, I'm going to probably order the Full Monague.  The pictures of it look delicious."

The group I was with was making bets/to-do items for our weekend in Sin City and this was one of my items.  Affordable and 24/7 sounds good to me especially since my friends who are Vegas regulars always spoke well of it.\n\nI got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and it was tasty but not sure if it's worth all the hype. The bread was nicely toasted but do wish there was more inside goods in my sandwich. It just didn't wow me like sandwiches at other joints which I still think quite fondly of. Perhaps I should try one of their other sandwiches; I'm not ruling it out just wanted to get my oral pleasure on. And I didn't get my O moment here.\n\nDo be warned not all their buzzers work, mines didn't light up or buzz and after noticing everyone in my group get theirs and other folks after me in line get theirs, I had to finally go and investigate to find out where my sandwich was, it was just chilling there.

Once again, I had to order the tuna melt. I love getting the sandwich and it's so hot it burns your fingers. I know it's definitely fresh. I take a bite; the cheese is so smooth, the bread is soft, and the tuna is delicious. Man! I loved the sandwich so much! I was so sad when it was gone. I am definitely coming back.\n\nMy friend also decided to get the Earl Grey lemonade, which was surprisingly really good! I'm going to get that too when I come back to Vegas."

FML.\nI'd passed this place many times before, not really caring for a sandwich in Vegas.  I can always remember it being busy though.  Now I know why.  Even with my busted taste buds, I could still taste that this sandwich was definite hangover goodness.

S"Friday morning of our Vegas trip.  It was 11:15.  We figured by the time we get to the front of the line, it'll be lunch time.  The line slowly moved, but we eventually got to the front of the line.  Lunch was $24.95.  Or something like that.\n\nThe central dining area is brightly lit by a huge skylight and the faux fantasy forest provided a stepping stone for the imagination.\n\nTypical buffet set up with various stations offering a variety of dishes and cuisines.  The prime rib was good, as was their fried rice, leg of lamb, the gyozas were decent.  The had other items such as pizzas and pastas, sushi, other Asian dishes, a salad bar, and a few other things.\n\nI would have to say the star was the dessert station.  They had at least 12 different desserts, all in small, 2-3 bite servings but they all looked so delicious I wish I could've had them all!  Oh, they also had gelato, with as many toppings and syrups as you want.  I didn't get any gelato but I had a bite of my friend's coffee gelato and it was REALLY strong.  The only thing that irked was one of the ladies didn't know who the executive pastry chef of the hotel was when I asked her.  I later had to google it, finding out that is it none other than the awesome Frederic Robert.\n\nOur server could've been a lot better.  She wasn't around much and we constantly had to flag her down for refills on our beverages.  One of the busboys was doing a better job than she was.\n\nI would definitely have to say this compares to the Bellagio Buffet (review to come)"

For a lunch price and to get all that food it was a good deal.\n\nThe quality of food was good, both times. I think it's better than the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. There was a large variety of food all of which were good. Usually, at Vegas buffets, the sushi is crap, but at the Buffet, the sushi was pretty decent. \n\nThe stalls in the restrooms are similar to private rooms, so you can do your business in semi-privacy.

Unfortunately it did not hold up to our expectations. Yes, it's a very cute and dainty place with its colorful fruit and flower decor. It's well lit and kept clean. The lunch variety was lacking and composed mostly of starches (pizza, pastas, stir fry). I was extremely disappointed. The only thing I thought was good was the noodle soup made to order and their gelato bar. For the money we paid, I was expecting some shrimp cocktail or ceviche. There was none. A bigger issue we came across was the fried chicken. It was inedible. It had no flavor and there was something off with the meat, like a bad after taste. We left unsatisfied and rarely do I ever feel unsatisfied from a buffet in Vegas, because at the end, the dessert bar makes up for it. Unfortunately, their dessert bar was sad as well. Boooooo."

S"I went my second time as a more informed consumer after trying nearly all the buffets, and this is still my personal favourite. I am thoroughly impressed with Wynn's\n\nVariety isn't huge, but it's enough. EVERYTHING looks rather appetizing, there was nothing at the Wynn buffet that i would have rather killed myself than to try. \n\nA party of 4 arrived at 2.35pm and we got in after 30 minutes. \n\nI made my way to get some cocktail shrimps which were big and succulent. A bite of smoked salmon, trout and anchovies, some greek salad, all above average for buffet standards. \n\nThen some alaskan king crab legs. huge, meaty and cut for your convenience, all you gotta do is use a fork and pick the meat out. Relatively fresh and I seasoned it with a hint of warm butter.\n\nThe prime rib was more of a medium, which i prefer medium rare. It was alright, juicy and not too fatty. The lamb chop was not bad, also medium. I also got some mussels which was cooked well, not dry at all! As well as some asparagus which was very dry. \n\nDessert time, I got a crepe which is my favourite from all the vegas buffets. Beautifully presented with house made whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries. The creme brulee was freshly made, and the best creme brulee i've had in a buffet. The tiramisu was also pretty good, I finished everything. The strawberry champagne mousse was a little on the sour side and I only had 2 bites of it.\n\nWe sat by the garden and it was bright and pretty. Our server was much nicer and more prompt than any other vegas buffets I've recently visited, very courteous too.\n\n***\n\nTip: Come before 2.45pm to get in line, so you can eat dinner for the price of lunch. They switch over at 3.30pm. Cheap people style! $35 (lunch price incl tax) for dinner! Crab legs come out only during dinner\n\nFavourites: King crab legs, (not snow!) Big and juicy cocktail shrimp. Higher quality ingredients and prepared with more care. Presentation is outstanding\n\nDo not want: a little expensive. Long lines for king crab legs. medium cooked prime rib (but if you go before they cut to the middle, it's medium rare) and lamb chops \n\nLast words: Definitely the best Vegas buffet in terms of quality, ingredients, presentation."

We tried:\n\nOK\n\nCrab legs, shrimp cocktail, Kobe lasagna\n\nGood\n\nCrepes, prime rib, leg of lamb, pork belly and Peking duck buns, sea bass\n\nIf you want to check out a buffet, then this one is fine, but I wouldn't want to pay the 40.00 regular price at dinner.

Their desserts were excellent and they provided a wide variety of foods to eat.  However, I visited here recently and felt that many of the foods there weren't as good as before.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed eating the snow crab legs, shrimp cocktail, etc. but for $40, you'd expect the quality to remain somewhat the same.  I also noticed that there weren't that many people eating here, even during prime dinner hours.  I waited only 20 minutes and the line didn't even come close to forming outside of the buffet.\n\nI still like this buffet very much but next time, I may end up just going to Planet Hollywood or Bellagio instead."

Came here with the group of friends so we can all eat together.  At $43 a person, there is definitely plenty of food for meat lovers, sushi lovers, pasta lovers and vegetarians alike.  It's nice that they offer vegan and gluten free versions of some dishes but definitely not enough.  \n\nA few goodies at the buffet: salmon hand rolls, pesto pasta, prime rib.  Those were my favorites.  Everything else was just average.  Cheese selection was rather pathetic.\n\nDessert: the lemon tart was good but again, everything tastes mass produced.

S'WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME! OMG! \n\n+1 star for decor... super cool\n+1 star for having crepes for dessert\n\nMy boyfriend and I wanted to come here to check out what all the rave was about. First off, we went on a weekday. It was like a Tuesday night, and they still had a long line; therefore, we were hoping it\'d be a meal to remember! Boy, were we right! It WAS a meal that we\'ll never forget for ALL THE WRONG REASONS! It was $40 per person, which was like the most we\'ve paid for a buffet on the strip... and we\'re such FOODIES! We got it and checked out what they had. There were no oysters. They only had snow crab and it was grilled... not steamed. They had so much space and not enough food selection. For instance, there was an Indian food counter and they had naan but there was no curry, no tikka masala to eat the naan with. They had Indian rice! WTF? They had prime rib, but it was so hard and chewy and it wasn\'t even warm at all! Yes, granted my expectations were a bit high, but seriously, Steve Wynn and do A LOT BETTER! They didn\'t have oysters, or sushi, or anything good, really. The service was crappy. Our waitress barely ever checked up on us or cleared our table. We had to stack up our plates pretty high for her to finally come over and take them. We had to keep flagging her down for refills of water and coke. She kinda gave us the feeling she was avoiding us or ignoring us. I HATE THAT... especially at a place that\'s supposedly HIGH CLASS?!? I dunno what other people are raving about. Seriously, this place had a wide selection of breads, not a variety of foods. I guess a lot of people are drawn to the pasta station? I guess the majority of people who go here and "LOVE IT" are either really drunk or completely starved from gambling that they can\'t differentiate from the lack of quality in the food as well as the selection. Honestly, the only thing I liked about the buffet at Wynn was their dessert. They had gelatos, candy apples, cupcakes, creme brulee, flan, fruits, and customized crepes. \n\nRECOMMENDATION: GO TO BELLAGIO! It\'s only like $30 and they have a wider selection of food. \n\nIf you don\'t care about how much you spend and you\'re not a foodie, THEN THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR YOU!'

The lady that was supposed to serve us got our drinks once and never came back to check for refills we had to get other waiters to get us more drinks.

My favorites were the BBQ brisket and tomahawk ribeye. Brisket was hella smokey and had great flavor and the ribeye was grilled perfectly and if you catch them right when it's sliced and find the good pieces. Nothing beats it. Actually everything I had was good, but ribeye and brisket stood out. Prime rib looked a big over cooked and was the one thing that could be improved. \n\nRoast lamb and veal were excellent. As well as the sliders they had. But the top bun gets too toasted under the heat lamp so take it off. All the salads looked really, really good as well, but come on- salad when you can get a grilled ribeye? \n\nTons of desserts. Creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e was my favorite.

S"In a battle of Vegas Buffets and when compared to that of the Bellagio, I DEFINITELY think Wynn wins. \n\nWynn has a slightly larger selection of food than Bellagio (and a slightly higher dinner price that comes with it -- $170ish for 4 adults on a Thursday night, yuck), but MOST types of foods are covered. Soups and salads? Check. Pizza? Check, and the best pizza in a buffet by far! (I thought Bellagio took top honors in that category, but having eaten their the night before -- they don't). Alongside the pizza was also an assortment of different pasta dishes -- ravioli, tortellini, rigatoni, a build your own pasta station (the Asian chef behind the counter wasn't so friendly though, regardless of how much I smiled and threw in a 'Thank You!', as well as garlic knots!) Other food items include barbecue chicken and ribs, garlic pesto mashed potatoes, TENDER pork loin, 'Indian' rice, 'Chinese' fried rice, chow mein, lamb, duck, turkey, sushi, a seafood station with shrimp and crab ... yeah, and a whole lot more on top of that.\n\nThey also have a killer dessert section (better than Bellagio, also). Aside from all the individual dessert platters, they also have someone making crepes (and though they didn't have it the last time I was there, my last trip to Vegas I ate at the Wynn twice XD, and alongside the Crepe-guy they had someone making Belgian Waffles as well! Nom nom).\n\nMy only grunt about this place (aside from the pricing and potential long wait if you come at the wrong time) is their lack of Mexican and Chinese food. I have yet to come to a buffet (then again, I've only been to 3 in Vegas) that had a taco or burrito station station, and ... while I love the fact that they have 'Chinese' fried rice and chow mein, what  good are those dishes if I don't have any orange chicken or honey walnut shrimp to eat it with? Also, not a fan of their sushi. Simply just not as fresh as authentic sushi places.\n\nOther than that, this buffet totally rocks my socks off and I'm perfectly content with the amount of weight I gain from eating here.\n\nCheck it out!\n\nWynn For the Win!"

It would be 4 stars if this was a $25 a person place but this is a $50 a person place.\n\nAs others have stated the service is really poor.  I literally couldn't even get the waiter to look at me.  The selection was kind of small.  In my head I had imagined a Vegas buffet to be an expansive feast especially when you are paying so much but it wasn't that way at all.  I liked the food fine but my husband thought it was disguising and he barely nibbled at the plate.  They had a salad bar to the far right, followed by cheese, then they had an Italian section (pasta).  Probably the most disappointing part was the meat selection: fatty prime rib, fatty meatloaf, fatty sausage links, fatty brisket, and fatty waffled fried chicken.  I'm not even kidding!  They literally served the most fattening cuts of meat and took the one healthy option and fried it in waffle batter.  I think for this price they should have offered a roasted chicken or something of the sort.  After the meats they presented oil soaked cauliflower then Asian food, and finally shellfish.  The crab legs looked nice but buffet shellfish scared me so I didn't try them.\n\nThe most impressive part was the dessert area.  I really loved the beautifully entry looking back into the glass paneled pastry kitchen.  If you can get a seat looking into the pastry kitchen I recommend it.  They had a wonderful selection of the desserts.

That it was "amazing" and "delicious" and "[insert other awesome adjectives to describe their food]." So of course the day of checkout, we decided to eat here. Now I know you\'re gonna say that we should\'ve gone for lunch/dinner because the food selection is better and blah blah blah. But by this time, GUAP had been lost at the slots and we were in conservation mode so that meant breakfast buffet. \n\nMoving on... the space is beautiful. Fresh flowers everywhere. But I didn\'t expect anything less from the Wynn. They have their aesthetics down pat. What I didn\'t like was their dress code policy. My brother had to walk all the way back to our suite at the Encore to change out of his beater/tank. I mean I get it that you guys wanna keep it classy, but when I look over at the table next to me with a woman wearing basically a napkin over her breasts... kinda defeats the purpose ay? Might wanna fine tune that policy. \n\nAnyways you would think that breakfast buffet foods would be limited because that\'s what I thought. But not here! Pretty amazing variety of foods offered here. Friggin awesome! From different fruit salads to eggs Benedict with salmon to scrambled egg whites to plain old fruit loops for the kids. However their dessert area is by far the most impressive. I probably took something from each area: gelato, cake, cookie, cupcake, mousse, etc. Yes, I\'m a foodie. Tis why I\'m a Yelper. Duh! Now granted I didn\'t eat everything that I took. I just sampled and if I didn\'t like it, I\'d set it aside. Some may argue that that\'s wasteful. Bitch, we\'re at a buffet. It\'s all wasteful.\n\nDefinitely coming back for lunch/dinner next time I\'m in Vegas. But maybe I\'ll come before I gamble so there\'s actual money to be spent. NTS.'

S"First it was smaller than Rio, or Bellagio.  But this works in the favor of the atmosphere.  No need to walk more than about 200 ft from end to end.  Most of the food is prepared on demand or they have it such small quantities it doesn't sit very long before a new batch has to be prepared.  This is great for keeping down that sense that it has been sitting there for days.  The desert doesn't kill you with sweetness but is a nice send off to a great experience.  Some tables gathered each of the available deserts to taste test each which I thought was a good sign.\n\nPersonally I wish I had more room to taste what I could not get too because of my limited space.\n\nHighly recommended."

S"Came here on a Friday night around 6:00 PM and it wasn't TOO busy yet. For Friday night dinner, it was $39.95 for dinner and since we had a party of 10, they added a gratuity of 18%. \n\nThe decor is just beautiful as you walk into the buffet dining room. It looks like something from Alice in Wonderland. The meat selection here is great! If you love meat, I think this buffet will serve your needs. The salad and veggie selection was great as well. There really isn't much seafood here, but didn't complain since I am not really much of a seafood person. They have a decent dessert selection. There are about 6-8 different flavors of gelato, 6-8 different types of cakes and few different types of cookie selection. I would have to say though their dessert selection isn't as great as Wicked Spoon.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience. Will be back when in town for some more meat! :D"

S'= = = = =  THIS IS "THE BUFFET\'" AT WYNN  = = = = =\n\nWhen seven of us stormed in to Vegas day before yesterday to tear it up & bite our way through some more of the Buffets on the Strip, we started with the one at Bellagio, which was just terrific!  Of course the question became, "Where do we go from THAT tomorrow?!"  We settled in on this one here at the Wynn, & here\'s how it was yesterday:\n\n*  Price:  Same.  (Weekday Lunch Buffet here is $23.99, $4.04 more than Bellagio, but we arrived just before 11 AM & were charged the $19.99 Breakfast price.     :-)\n\n*  Food array:  Exactly the same huge number of dishes as Bellagio, 179 plus sauces & dressings.     :-)\n\n*  Service:  Ok, but formal, not friendly.  (Bellagio wasn\'t lovey dovey either, really.)\n\nI started with some of their Manhattan Clam Chowder, which was great.  I also really liked my bowl of their Tom Yum Soup later during the meal, which the Soup Chef (!) fixes up for you to order!  \n\nThe Cornish Game Hen with special spices was delicious, & so on, but let\'s just shorten it to "everything was terrific"!  (A number of the dishes won\'t be the same when you come, anyway.)\n\nTo steal a quote from Barenaked Ladies, I\'m "like LeAnn Rimes because I\'m all about value," so I have to say that Bellagio beats Wynn here by a hair if you pay $23.99 for your lunch here.  If you get in for $19.99, Wynn wins by a hair.  Either way, I loved this place & so will you!     :-))\n\nNote:  All members of your party must be seated at the same time.'

S'Best buffet in Vegas.  If you want to have the dinner menu for the lunch cost, arrive around 2:30 and get in just before they change out all the food.  \n\nPrime rib is a staple in Vegas buffets and here it is done really well.  The mashed potatoes are superb.  \n\nThe different stations each have good food and the deserts are fantastic.  The gelato bar is a must.  \n\nCrab legs are available at dinner.  Veal on the weekend with dinner.'

The only thing to improve to make this a 5 is the staff. Although they work hard it's certain they have too many tables to attend to. Certainly nice.

S"It was 11:00AM and I was starving!!! We drove around for about 30 minutes looking for something to eat  and finally we went to look for a restaurant inside the Wynn by yelpers recommendation. Once we were looking for the restaurant we came across this beautiful buffet. \n\nI'm not a big fan of buffets, but I couldn't resist the beauty of this one and honestly I was starving that at that moment I felt like I could eat a horse.\n\nThe looks: It is BEAUTIFUL, this place looks just like the pictures you see on the Wynn's website (unlike other hotels).\n\n\nPrices: for breakfast is $19.95 + tax so we went during lunch time (it starts at 11:30am) and it's like 22.95 (or 24?) + tax.  It sounds pricey, but it is so worth it!!\nWe got seated around 11:45am, we missed the breakfast but they still had waffles, french toast, pancakes and fruit. \n\nThe food: It was a wide variety of food: American, Italian, Asian, Mexican & more - soups, salads, cold meats, calzones, pastas, eggs, steaks, seviche, sushi & a lot more.\n\nDesserts: Ice Creams, caramel apples, cookies, cakes and fancy little things in very pretty containers, excuse my ignorance I don't know what they are called but they looked so good!\n\nWe sat and ate there for like a little over 2 hours, trying to try everything, but it's impossible!!! So much food, so little room in our stomachs! We would see guests at the other tables come, leave, come, leave... when we realized this we decided it was time to go...haha!\nIt was kind of embarrassing, but whatever, will I ever see them again? no! and the people at the restaurant won't remember me, so just eat, eat, eat try to sample everything...who cares!\n\nI recommend you pace yourself, haha, and save room for dessert, cus I didn't and I only got to try the ice cream :( Which was delicious, I got 1 scoop of coffee ice cream and a scoop of something else, I forget what it was but it was soooo good! One thing though, this coffee ice cream tastes has a very strong coffee taste, they are serious about it!\n\n\nAnyway, I recommend this buffet! Will I go back??\n\nSURE!"

S"I came here super excited since the Wynn has such a highly raved buffet of Vegas and from many satisfied friends. Though there was not a line when my boyfriend and I arrived, and plenty of tables all around, it took a good 30 minutes before we got seated. Alright, I'll let it slide this time. So got seated and ordered a pink lemonade mixed with Sprite because I was so thirsty from the desert heat. when I gulped up my first glass,m I headed towards the food. \n\nThe way I usually eat at buffets is I'll walk around the whole area, see what they got, then mentally divide and pair up which foods I'll get together in each trip. Started off with some pasta. I love me some pasta. I got the tortellini and noticed they had a made-to-order pasta station. Oooooooh! There was a line so I decided to come back. Let's just say that tortellini and the cocktail shrimps were the best of the entire buffet. The ravioli I got at the pasta station after tasted like shit. They only had 2 soup choices where other buffets have at least 4. The corn on the cob was so soggy and greasy. The selection at the Wynn buffet is so minimal. There wasn't much to eat. \n\nNot to mention that the plates weren't all fully cleaned. I came across two plates my entire meal that had specks of sauce on it still. I left still hungry. I should have went to Bellagio."

S"I have a tendency to compare all other buffets I visit to Wynn's buffet. No joke, it is the mother of all buffets in the world. I've been here twice and both times have not failed to disappoint. The selection at this fine buffet does not contain your ordinary buffet items. In fact, the food served is of utmost freshness and high quality. You can tell that the food has not been sitting under a heat lamp all day as the dishes are constantly refilled by the staff. \n\nSalads-Exotic selection. However, they need to work on not over-dressing their salads as they end up very soggy.\n\nCheese/Salami/Prosciutto Section-I love cheese but they should really focus on serving the types of cheese that are more edible by itself. Who the heck is going to eat a cube of manchego or romano? Those are cooking cheeses for crying out loud!\n\nPasta-The gnocchi with vodka-cream sauce is pretty legit! Everything else was ok.\n\nSeafood-You can tell this is the best part in the main entree selection by the amount of people lined up. Crab legs are a must!\n\nAsian Station-Kalbi marinated ribs and tandoori fish. 'Nuff said.\n\nPizza-Thin crust, NY style-gotta love it!\n\nSushi-don't even try. GROSS!\n\nDessert-With a whole room dedicated to dessert, they've got to pride themselves with this station. In fact, it is my FAVORITE! Their creme brulee is definitely close to one you could get in Paris. The tiramisu was nothing short of amazing! I love how tiny the desserts are so you can try a little bit of everything. Don't forget to sneak a  cookie as you walk on out no matter how full you are. You won't regret it!\n\nThey also have unique dishes such as game hen. Didn't try it though.This list isn't even half of what they serve so go on and check it out for yourself. I'm sure you'll find something you like!"

S"The Buffet at Wynn costs more  than you'd normally want to pay for a buffet, but if you're willing to pony up the cash, you'll discover exactly what you're paying for. The place features quality food, and lots of it (proving the point that you can have only ever have two of quantity, quality, and affordability, but never all three). They've got food from every region of the world, and all of it is fresh. I've never really seen a buffet with Indian food options, but there it is at The Wynn, fresh and spicy and full of flavor.\n\nThey also feature a ridiculous dessert area, with fresh made Ice Creams and an endless variety of pastries, pies, and cakes. If you're willing to pay the money, The Buffet at Wynn will treat you very well."

However since each dish is so complex with foodie ingredients-many dishes normally available within my dietary restrictions were not.  Bacon or proscuitto would appear in random tartlettes or side dishes.  Basically? I felt like I spent a LOT of money to come to a buffet that did not have very many accessible dishes for vegetarians or semi-vegetarians.\n\nMy carnivore cohorts seemed pleased enough-but we all wish that we had just gone back to the Rio\'s buffet, which we all felt had a more robust assortment of dishes to select from.\n\nBottom line-this place is a okay, but after all the hype and expense it is not going to make it to our regular rotation of Vegas buffets.'

S'The Food there is not Astonishing, but Decent.  Not as much selections as I thought, nor expected since this is one of the best Buffet places in Vegas according to the reviews.  The most eye opening selection there was the "Polish susage" (best I ever had).  Prime rib is tender, just like other 5 Stars on the Strip.  What I like about The Buffet is the atmosphere and the cleaness.  It is spotless everywhere included restrooms.  Im sure you seen restaurants looks extrememely clean, but has dirty restrooms.   I was a restaurant owner and very picky on cleaness.  I hardly see any restaurants is as clean as The Buffet.  I added a "Star" because of it.'

Our services was attentive and on top of keeping our drinks topped and our dishes cleared when we would get more. \n\nThe amount of food choices is overwhelming. I love the various egg dishes and omelette bar.

The layout makes it manageable and not overwhelming to find what you want, and everything was very fresh and well stocked. \n\n\nThe service was quick and the dining area was very bright, open and inviting. I would be interested to try other buffets in town to be able to better compare this one, but the bar has been set VERY high after this experience. \n\n\nOnly drawback are that it's pretty pricey and the line to get in for brunch was very long.

I really enjoyed their dinner selection more so than their morning delights. \n\nGreat food. number 1 thing I'm thinking about is their creme brulee, I asked to add berries on top and Mmmmm, seriously Mmmmm MmmmmM good. \n\nLove love their ball of flowers decorations, very unique.

I don't see why this is the best buffet, as it cost almost $40 for dinner, it's just a dollar cheaper on Sun-Thur vs Fri-Sat. \n\nThe only good thing I liked was the veggies, but other than that, carving station was small, barely any chinese food, indian or greek. There was italian, but very very little. I think this buffet is more of a healthy buffet because they had a lot of veggies like salads.\n\nDessert was snot great, it was either super sweet or just not good. I only liked the passion fruit tapioca, but discarded the passion fruit because it was too sweet. The raspberry cheesecake in a cup jar was good because it was light. \n\nI don't think you should come here if you're expecting larger variety. The flavor wasn't bad, but go to Wicked instead."

Yup, that's how much I gorged myself at Las Vegas Buffets.\n\nJust two days ago, my malicious, self-indulgent overfeeding came to an end.  Oh my gosh, the food here is mediocre at best!!!  I went here just last December and I thought it was pretty good.  I came here again this week and couldn't finish anything I got!\n\nAgain, my friend and I tend to go to restaurants in the transition time between bfast and lunch, so we caught the last end of the breakfast buffet and the beginning of lunch there. .. it was exciting cos it was like getting two meals in one.  However, both were disappointing.\n\nThe Chinese bbq pork (I know, what am I doing trying to eat dim sum at a casino restaurant. . .it spells disaster).  I didn't even attempt to eat it, cos once I took it out of the bamboo box steamer, the soft white bread became rock hard.  The fried chicken was dry and tough, the fish was dry and flavorless.  The only things I managed to finish were the shrimp cocktails and the ribs, both of which I can name twenty other places where I can get the same or better.\n\nDude, I can't even remember what else I got. The sushi was lame, the the spicy tuna handroll was pretty good, and their freshly baked breads were all good.  Except you don't go to buffets to eat bread. . .that's like filling your stomach up with water!  Blasphemy!  The Italian and Mexican fare were all unmemorable and the desserts were whatever.  The bread pudding looked dry and the only dessert my bf and I managed to finish was the spiced apple walnut cake.\n\nWe're gonna try to Rio Seafood Buffet next time (we heard good things about it) or the Paris buffet (the bf remembers their kabobs and crepes with quite fondness)"

S'Eating at a buffet is sort of like womanizing. \n\nIf there are no rules against eating (or sleeping) around, a man is going to keep trying new dishes (or women) until his body can\'t take it anymore. \n\nEating at the Hometown Buffet is sort of like womanizing on the lowest level. The food is high in quantity, but low in quality. You end up eating a lot of dry fried chicken, greasy processed tacos, and melted frozen yogurt topped with high fructose corn syrup. Yuck.\n\nSo when it comes womanizing, you are essentially taking home girls with an abundance of tattoos, drug problems, and daddy issues. Hot. Kidding. Well, sort of.\n\nEating at the Buffet at the Wynn is womanizing at the highest level. Every food station is a high caliber, high quality meal in itself. You enjoy freshly made Caeser salad, delicious chicken soup, and the fresh fish of the day. Yum.\n\nThat is kind of like dating a very pretty girl, with a slim figure, educated, ambitious, kind, thoughtful, and with a good family background. This would satisfy just about any man. But a man is only faithful as his options. \n\nAt the Buffet at the Wynn, you have the option(s) of continuing on to the next food station(s) and enjoying another classy culinary experience like fresh Tom Yum soup, fresh crab legs, and a dessert station you have to see to believe. So you end up pretty girlfriend with a hot mistress, a hot mistress to your hot mistress, and a hot mistress to your hot mistress\' hot mistress. If that makes any sense.\n\nSo if you are in Las Vegas and want to eat a buffet, you can pay $20 and go to Hometown Buffet (aka the Excalibur Buffet) or you can drop $40 and visit the Buffet at the Wynn. You can take the Tiger Woods approach. Or you can take the Derek Jeter approach. Two athletes. Both rich. Both ugly. But one has a "hit list" that rivals that of James Bond.\n\nRemember, eating at a buffet is sort of like womanizing. But eating at the Buffet at the Wynn is sort of like womanizing at the highest level of Derek Jeter, James Bond, and Archie G.'

S'I used to be a big fan of The Buffet at the Wynn, with its insane variety of meaty goodness, vegan and vegetarian options for those who want to live a healthier lifestyle, and a room packed full of desserts that always made me feel a little like Willie Wonka. I used to tell people it was the best buffet on the Vegas Strip, but I am no longer a fan.  \n\nMy last visit there was just before Labor Day weekend, and was very disappointing.  \n\nThe veal short rib was the only dish that was truly exceptional, while everything else I sampled was just so lackluster: the fried chicken was on par with the kind my local grocery store sells by the greasy boxful, the Cajun pork loin was flavorless and didn\'t inspire me to Zydeco, and the sweet pea risotto was bland and a little too crunchy for my liking.\n\nEven my favorite go-to desserts seemed to have been replaced with piteous knock-offs that left a chilling "Invasion of the Dessert Snatchers" vibe in the air. The cheesecake pops and cake pops I once loved there were now store-bought marshmallows that were coated in a humdrum icing and violently impaled on a stick. The gelato that was once bustling with exciting flavors was now deferential and hesitant.         \n\nThe service, too, was seriously lacking. While water and drink orders are often frequently refilled at most buffets (and restaurants), our waiter\'s appearances could be best described as spectral: he showed up at the start of the meal and was never seen or heard from again. If he has 40 years younger, I would have initiated an Amber Alert.  \n\nSadly, no one came by at any time to pick up the pile of used dishes that were quickly accumulating on our table either. It got so ridiculous that we decided to clear the table ourselves and place our many dishes on the empty, four-seater across from us. Even sadder, a lone diner was seated at that very table shortly thereafter, with everyone oblivious to the Jenga tower of plates and unappetizing leftovers erected diagonally across from her.           \n\nOn the up side, many of the diners seemed to be enamored with the giant crab legs that were pouring endlessly out of the kitchen. Plates were filled two and three feet high with these savory crustaceans that was a high point of this buffet. These crab-loving guests tended to ignore the other offerings available to them. Were they in the know? Or were they there just for the crab?\n\nThe immense popularity of the crab leg station and the sheer volume being consumed by some diners who seemed almost unhinged in their pursuit to up the levels of Omega-3s in their systems seemed to be the "raison d\'\xc3\xaatre" for this buffet.\n\nMaybe this is the reason that the Wynn has just given up? Sure, the presentation and vibrant colors of the many meals at each station really stood out, appealed to the eye, and made me want to try everything. But it almost felt like the offerings outside of the crab legs were just there for show, along with the inedible flower arrangements and the decorative flourishes that adorn this dining hall and provide it with its atmosphere.'

S"5 buffets in 36 hours... Vegas baby! Yeah!\n\n5th of 5. Last one. And the best one.\n\nCan anyone say crabs? Forgo all the other food until you've had a plate of crab legs. Really, this is simple work to eat, Wynn splits the legs in half for you, so all you have to do is pull out the meat and dip it in their butter sauce. Amazing! I ate 3 plates full of crab legs until i couldn't stand it anymore.\n\nThen I switched gears and tried the prime rib. I had forgotten how good the Wynn makes their prime rib. It nearly melts in your mouth and tastes very buttery. 10/10 for taste here. You can't get it better. Really!\n\nDessert great lineup of choices. They not only looked good, but tasted good. They have crem brule here. They do a good job with it as well. They also serve gelato.\n\nRestrooms: very nice. You actually have to go tithe outside restrooms to do a diaper change On a baby changing table, but they let you back in for that reason. The stalls are like separate private rooms. They are very nice."

S"Maybe next time I should try coming again with lowered expectations =P  So, after waiting 2+ hours in line and thinking about all the wonderful foods that will be awaiting (king crab legs, prime rib, rack of lamb, and DESSERTS!!) I was pretty hungry by the time we got to the front of the line.  Be careful here folks, if you have a group of 5+ and there's more than 2 groups of 5+ waiting, the hostess(s) may get confused and you'll have to wait a little longer while they rearrange the seating charts(ahem, poor coordination LOL )   We were seated and drinks brought promptly, but then the waiter didn't check on us until about 45 minutes later, when we had really required liquids about 20 minutes after they initially seated us.  \n\nSo, given that I was uber hungry, Everything should've tasted pretty spectacular right? WRONG!  The prime rib was bland, the seafood wasn't fresh, and the only meat really worth having was the Rack of Lamb- it was seasoned quite well and the meat fell off the bones!  The fish was alright- Salmon was overcooked.  I kept going back for cheese and savory hams!  So I thought, ok, the dessert should redeem my meal.  Well, unfortunately the only thing that met the internal standard of my palate was the Creme brulee- it was yummeeee!!  The other cakes were really blah- strawberry mousse, mango mousse, the carrot cake, the tiramisu was totally off!  Man, seriously i believe that it could've been better for a dinner buffet that costed about $37 (weekday).  Ahhh find a way to impress me next time Wynn- You got nothing over Bellagio ;)"

S'The Wynn buffet was definitely better than the Bellagio buffet. The inside decor was nice. I loved the flower and fruit arrangement that was piled high to the ceiling as you first step foot into the buffet area. The service was GREAT! Our waiter continuously came by to refill our drinks. I just wish something could be done about the cigarette smell. Nobody wants to eat while breathing in smoke! \n\nAs for the food, I really loved the variety of food they had. There was countless options! The teriyaki flank steak was delicious and the crab legs were very fresh. I just wish they included some oysters (that would have really made our day!) The dessert options were great! I loved that they had a crepe station, and all the mini desserts were delicious (red velvet cupcake, creme brulee, cheesecake). I will definitely come back again!'

TONS of variety...huuuuge king crab legs, sushi was disappointing, not many veggie options. however,  the dessert section was MAGNIFICENT!! bananas foster, flan, mini-cupcakes, creme brulees, little raspberry cakes, blocks of fudge, frozen yogurt, maple bars, eclairs...ohh just so many things to indulge in!!....it probably took us 25 mins to eat dinner, about 45 for dessert (i insisted on trying at least one bite everything, so i had to take breaks in between rounds), and then another 15 of just sitting still passing in and out of a food comatose at the table.\n\nmy overall reaction to a vegas buffet: i would rather take that $40 and order ONE fabulous meal, drinks & dessert at a fantastic restaurant OFF of the strip!!

S"My friends brought me to The Buffet at Wynn for lunch. Honestly after my last experience with Le Village Buffet, I was a little apprehensive. \n\nWe had a one hour wait in line (granted it was during lunch hour). I was beyond hungry that I lost my appetite when we finally reached the front of the line. It was close to 2pm. If it wasn't for the pretty decorations in the hotel (which is exquisite), Sharr would've been extra crabby. We paid upfront....there were 3 of us and the bill was $125. This shit better be good.\n\nI was really impressed by the layout of the food stations, especially the dessert station which was outrageous. I really wanted to start with dessert first but everything else looked so damned good too. They even had different stations for international flavors. \n\nAfter about 30 mins or so, I have tried pretty much a little bit of everything. The sushi station was good however I didn't want to get full on rice. But I did get seconds on stir fried tofu and pumpkin ravioli. The meats here are, once again very dry. What is going on with the meats people? Get it right! \n\nThe big hoorah for me was the dessert. I coudn't wait to get my hands on them. Each little pastry was so pretty and beautifully decorated.  I came close to getting one of each, lol. When I got back to my table and actually bit into one of them (it was a marshmallow), I nearly spit it back out. How long have they been sitting there?!?! It was nearly rancid....that stuff was not fresh. Then I was brave enough to try the rest.....all I can say is eh. I really expected a lot from this place but my hopes were shut down. It's all about glitz and glamour again with empty promises. Boooo! Sharr is extra crabby now more than ever. \n\nI'm ready to throw in the towel with the serach for best buffets in Vegas. If anyone have any suggestions, pls PM me. Be warned however, I'm very picky."

Staff were helpful and polite. Roast beef med-rare was phenomenal, as was the brisket, which melt in your mouth, even after removing the fatty spots. They had Kobe-style burgers too. My only low point was the cold and less than tender lamb they served. Alaskan King crab was meaty, NY pizza authentic, as was the Oysters Rockefeller. Maybe no actual Pernod in the Oysters Rockefeller but still a delight. Sweet pineapple, dried figs, cheeses...this is a glutton's dream, I mean, an epicure's dream, like me.

I sampled everything and left satisfied, so it was a successful buffet experience in my book. \nSeafood options were good- sushi rolls, split crab legs, oysters, yum! Everything was super fresh.\nDesserts were good and they\'ll even make you your own ice cream cookie sandwich! My only complaint was that the cookies were hard so it was kind of hard to eat. \nAlso the wait wasn\'t very long which is also a plus.

S'As a Vegan visiting Las Vegas for the first time from the UK, I\'d done a little research as to where I would be able to eat relatively close to the strip. I\'d heard from a close friend that this would accomodate a vegan diet as the owner of The Wynn was vegan himself.\n\nWe arrived in plenty time knowing there would be a relatively long queue, but the wait overall wasn\'t too bad- roughly 30-45 minutes. The seating, as far as my first buffett goes, wasn\'t bad at all. Good space between tables and clean tables.\n\nWhen I went up to pick my first plate, to be honest, I was a little disappointed. I went over the whole buffet to see what the vegan options were like and I wasn\'t really impressed. There were some potatoes and mixed vegetables (which, to be fair, are standard fair at any restaurant), also some rice dishes. However, there wasn\'t anything set out particularly for vegan customers. I asked a few chef\'s at each section if there was an available vegan option (or if a dish was vegan that wasn\'t labelled as such) and at each section I was told "no" or "not available". Which, again, was surprising to me, considering the owner of the hotel is known for "accommodating" vegan customers. \n\nThe desert options matched this also, but to be fair the few options available to vegans- tapioca, especially made chocolate-chip muffins and sorbet- were more than adequate to finish of the buffet experience. \n\nHowever, overall, I feel that $40.00 for this experience was very expensive for a vegan customer looking to get something a little better considering the basis behind the buffet. A shame really!'

When we signed up for the Red (Players) card, we were told that we only needed 55 points to earn a free buffet! Alright! Sooooo, $100 dollars later (each!) we had earned our "free" buffet. \n\nSince we don\'t eat until later anyway, and it was a Wednesday, the line wasn\'t really long. Our server was absolutely incredible. Our drinks were always filled and our used plates were constantly pre-bussed. Yay for good service!\n\nOn to the food! \n\nI thought the salad station was okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Honestly, I prefer the Cravings Buffet\'s salad station at the Mirage where they custom mix your salad into this gorgeous chopped salad. \n\nAnyway, I thought that they had a lot of high-end food. If I eat at a buffet, I stay away from a lot of the filler foods (bread, pasta, pizza) so that I have room for the real food (prime rib, crab legs, shrimp, etc). Let me tell you, if you only get one thing, the king crab legs are SO worth the buffet price. They are even split for you! I just wish that they were hot. The prime rib was good, not great. My bf said that all of the fish he got was cold. I do wish that I had saved room for some of their chicken panang! \n\nThe dessert station was incredible and large.

I admit the flaw in my decision 2 years ago to pass "go" and go all the way to the Bellagio, thereby passing up an uber-delicious food party known as the Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas.\n\nMy friend and I decided to go for the lunch buffet which opens at 11am, and is priced at $22.95.  I was very, very impressed by the service and the selection of food at this buffet.  It seemed like every culinary region in the world was represented at this buffet, and not to worry, every station has a placard stating the cuisine of that particular area.  My favorites included the chinese dumplings, spicy tuna sushi, the salad station, paht thai noodles, and the Mexican station.  And of course, no meal would be complete without dessert!  The dessert station had a wonderful variety of individual portions of cakes, pies, muffins, cupcakes, etc.  I believe even bread pudding was available as a choice.\n\nI tried to sample a little bit of everything, and I left a very FULL and satisfied customer.  The one station that really impressed me the most, personally, was the made to order omelet station.  I contemplated an omelet but there were so many other choices, I think I\'m going to try that on my next visit.  \n\nBottom Line:  Make sure to give your taste buds a culinary treat at the buffet at Wynn Las Vega$!!'

Now it is a buffet so don't expect a five star experience, but there are definitely more hits than misses, and if you are staying in the area (Wynn and sister Encore are at one end of the Strip), it's worth a stop,"

S"There will be a line anytime of day, guaranteed.  My boyfriend and I drove straight here after driving to Vegas and we were starving.  We strategized and only had some fruit in the morning so we would be hungry.\n\nEven at 2:45 it took us 45 minutes to get sat.  Luckily we got in for the lunch price (woo hoo!) because the cashier was cool enough to speed it up.  Dinner service and prices starts at 3:30.\n\nAs far as buffets in Vegas, I've only ever been to the Rio buffet and man that buffet is gigantor!  The Wynn buffet is quality over quantity.  For the size of the restaurant, I was actually surprised at how small the buffet line was, but everything we had was good.  Normally, something looks good, but the taste doesn't live up to the visuals.  Everything we had here was good.\n\nThey even had King crab legs already split for you so you don't have to crack them!  See, Mr. Wynn wants you to eat more crab legs. \n\nTheir dessert station by far is the best though...creme brulee, ice cream, cookies, crepes, cake, chocolate, fruit, bananas foster.\n\nI was content before I got dessert and then I left really full.\n\nWorth $50 for two people, I can't say I would go back and pay $80 though."

S"**Go to The Bellagio instead. Don't waste your money here!**\nSo let me start off by saying that I rarely take the time to write reviews. But I read the reviews of others quite often and that is what led me to this buffet at the Wynn. \n\nI have to say that this place was THE BOMB when I came here 1 year ago. I couldn't wait to go back for the dessert crepe station, king crab legs and creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e. \n\nI'm sorry and sad to report that none of these things were at the breakfast buffet. No crab legs.  Not even snow crab. No creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e. No crepe station. Really???? \nEverything we ate was just ok. Some of it was totally disgusting! The prime rib was so good 1 year ago that it has stood out in my mind ever since. But, today it was just like the prime rib you can get anywhere else. Average. \nAnd they bumped up the brunch price to $38 just for Mother's Day. This price DID NOT include champagne. Wasn't that nice of them?  I will NEVER eat at this buffet again. I will go to the Bellagio next time or Studio B. I'm sorry but $40 for breakfast better include some crab legs, creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e and champagne. Soooooo disappointed.

S'I haven\'t tried the buffet at Bellagio, but will next time since there are so many comparisons made.  For now, I am still daydreaming about the Wynn buffet.\n\nDinner starts at 3:30 pm and is $35.  There\'s always a line, so when my companions were running late for our 4 pm dinner date, I got in line.  I made it to the cashier in about 20 minutes, but they won\'t seat you without your full party so I waited off to the side.  The cool thing though is that the rest of your party can then go through the "express" lane to catch up with you!  So lucky them (for letting me do all the waiting) and lucky me (for not having to wait even longer to get my grub on)!\n\nThis buffet was AMAZING.  Could you get better food elsewhere?  Yes.  But the point is that for buffet fare, the food here exceeds.\n\nWe dined for a couple of hours and there was still so much more I didn\'t get to try.  I made a beeline for the prime rib (great) and then stood in line for the shrimp cocktail and crab legs (yummers).  These are the cornerstones of buffet dining so lay off those fillers (you know who you are mashed potato guy)!  I also sampled some bites from my friend\'s plate.  The herb crusted salmon with dashi mushroom in a carrot miso broth was fantastic, as was the sea bass with cabbage, bacon and fingerling potatoes in a red wine sauce.  It\'s surprising when fish is good at a buffet where the food is bound to sit under heat lamps or on heated trays.  Also good was the grilled asparagus.\n\nThe dessert area made me wish I had a tapeworm.  So many choices (including a waffle and crepe station!) and such beautiful presentation.  I went with chocolate and vanilla ice cream (excellent) and an Oreo mousse cake (sadly it sounds better than it tastes).\n\nThe sushi section (I skipped it) looks weak with only three offerings, but otherwise most buffet sections looked impressive like the salad juice glasses, the five kinds of ceviche and the charcuterie (I didn\'t like the prosciutto though) and cheese (love the gouda)!\n\nCan\'t wait to go back!!!'

S"It's a close one between the top 3 buffets in Vegas (Wynn, Caesars and Wicked Spoon @ Cosmopolitan) - but after trying all three for the Nth time - I have to still give the edge to the Wynn as the top buffet in LV.\n\nThe reason - quality.\n\nWhile they don't offer nearly as much in terms of variety, they make it up by making sure everything they serve is top notch.  The crab legs here are the best versus any other buffet I've been to, bar none.  Same goes for the prime rib, lamb chops and also their pasta and carnitas stations.  The flavor of all the dishes are excellent and even their breakfast options are good.  The fresh strawberries they serve is almost worth the price of admission alone.\n\nThe dessert stations here are also top notch.  The gelato they offer is excellent and I still can't get over how good their vanilla bean gelato is after all these years.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with either Caesars, Wynn or Cosmopolitan - but if you're a crab lover like me, or just want to really get the best bang for your buck - make sure you hit up this place during your visit to LV."

S'Since I had been traveling all day and was famished I decided to venture to the Wynn Buffet for an evening of "grazing" on a variety of dishes. I went just at dinner opening time - 3:30pm (Sunday) and had to wait in line about 10 minutes. (Seemed like forever since I was so hungry) Dinner buffet was $39.99 and I added the all you can drink Champagne, Mimosa, Red and White Wine for $15.00. Total $55.00. I tipped the waiter at the table when almost finished with the meal. He kept my glass full even though busy (I\'m sure the early tip didn\'t hurt). I am a meat eater so I mostly ate the Veal, Lamp and Prime Rib. All really good - especially for the price. Shrimp (very plump) and crab legs (big) were perfect as well. Tried the Seafood pizza - too fishy. Brussels sprouts good (recently discovered I really like them). Great variety of cheeses. I skipped the salad bar.\n\nDesert was an experience. Lots to choose from and there is a chef making fresh crepes. I had read about the Creme Brulee so even though I was stuffed I was able to enjoy one to top off my dining experience.\n\nEven for a woman dining alone I truly enjoyed myself. Requested a table out of the way and the hostess was more than happy & polite to accommodate. \n\nI told several business associates about this restaurant. While it may seem expensive, the variety and quality of the food makes it worth it to me.'

The beautiful decor made me feel like I was walking into a fairy tale.\n\nThe options were plentiful and well organized. Pretty great quality as well!

She also noted that they were just testing out the tea and may or may not continue to serve it in the future but the response from customers has been highly positive.\n\nSome new favorite foods this time around to add to the must get list when you come to the Wynn Buffet:\n1) Chilean seabass (they didn't have this the first time I came here and I'm a big fish lover so you usually don't see this kind of fish served often)\n2) Spicy tuna hand rolls\n3) Some kind of buffalo salad\n4) Mushrooms (marinated in a delicious sauce)\n5) Key lime pie (I didn't like it before, now I do)"

The food are displayed delicately and even for lunch there is a wide range of vareity! All of the food was very delicious!\n\nUsually in buffets, by the time I get to dessert, I am already super full. By for Wynn, I always save some room in my stomach for their dessert! I like their idea of putting dessert into small slices, into small cups, or into small plastic shot glasses. You get to try out so many different types of dessert because of the size! They even have freshly scooped ice cream for you!\n\nMy absolute favorite is the dessert with the mini plastic coffee cups in colors of green and orange.

S'Very, very good quality.  The chefs here definitely believe in quality over quantity, and I cannot argue with them over their choice.  \n\nThe one reason I can\'t give them 5 stars is because they lack the variety that other buffets have.  They have more variety now than the first time I went (around 3 years ago), but I can see some people wanting more.  For example, they had 2 types of salad the day I went: caesar, and smoked salmon.  They had a few other dressings (bleu cheese, italian, and something else), and both salads were great, but sometimes you want to build your own salad with all sorts of additions that the Wynn lacked.\n\nThe few soups that were served were very interesting (I think one was a pumpkin soup), but I didn\'t see anyone get them!  I think they were a little too "different," and they should stick to normal.  A few years ago they had this amazing cream of asparagus soup, I was sad they didn\'t have that this time.\n\nPrime rib was amazing, spicy tuna hand roll was very, very good, and the cheese ravioli was the best pasta even though it was the simplest.  I can\'t remember much more, but those were the standouts.  I was really disappointed in their mashed potatoes and other sides/veggies... strange thing to say, but I expect better, especially after Bellagio\'s pesto mashed potatoes!\n\nNow, the dessert is what SHOULD get the Wynn 5 stars!  Homemade ice cream and sorbet that truly rivals Haagen Daaz, Dreyers, and any other famous ice cream maker.  Amazing bread pudding, creme brulee, cookies, madeleines, etc.  I definitely enjoyed my dessert more than the dinner, and I\'m not usually a big dessert person.'

S"Eat It or Beat It?\n**EAT IT!!**\n\nONE WORD: Quality. \n\nWynn Buffet supersedes all other buffets in Vegas... the only competition: Bellagio. From your usual crab legs all the way to your carppaccio's, Wynn buffet is all about the best quality. You can see it, smell it, and definitely taste it. It's no wonder they were voted #1 Buffet in Vegas! Crab legs... no need for butter, the crab meat is naturally sweet! But my favorite dish of all... the lamb chops... oh god... last time I went, I had 4-5 servings of it... (drools). \n\nWord to all: Don't pay for the weekday dinners or lunches or brunches... add the extra $10-$15 and go for the weekend menu. There are more choices to choose from and the more expensive food items are available, like the different cuts of meat and various seafood items... unless of course you don't eat either, then the other dishes are much more yummier and different, to say the least. \n\nYou get what you pay for right? Oh, and if there's a long wait... add the extra $10 or so to cut the line.. it's seriously worth cutting the line! Seriously, if you're in Vegas... don't be cheap... the same rules apply for the clubs... you want to get in and not have to wait? \nA. Get there early.\nB. Pay the extra dollaz to cut the line (or bouncer) tee-hee. \n\nCONCLUSION:\nIf you ain't doin' it big in Vegas, you ain't doin nothin! Go for the best and pay for the best. Weekend dinner only!

S'This rating is for the value.  Sure if you eat only plates of crab legs and prime rib, it may be worth the $37 for a weekday dinner.  Other than those, nothing besides the desserts stood out.  Nice selection of salads, make your own pasta station, various seafood dishes, carving station with prime rib and turkey, a few dim sum dishes, lame sushi rolls, and lox and crab legs.  The quality isn\'t bad but the price is too high for what you get.  The sushi rolls were small and they had eel, salmon, veggie, shrimp tempura, and california.  Seriously for an asian themed hotel/restaurant, they should make better and more creative sushi rolls and at $37, there\'s really no excuse for lame sushi rolls.  Desserts were the best part of the meal.  Warm bread pudding, gelatos, the molten chocolate cake like "brownie"  Thank goodness for their desserts or else this place is really a two star for what you pay for.'

I was walking around and found few more people that were vegan so I didnt feel too bad after that.  My first vegan pizza was just alright. It had so much veggies on it so i had to take all the bell peppers off. Also vegan cheese for the first time... it was very different and ... slimy =/ but it was good. My Vegan friend didnt like the cheese or the pizza. it was just alright.\n\nThe next personalized food was the soup. They gave us tomato soup. I thought it was just okay too... bland and my friend doesnt even like tomato soup!

S"Taxis frequently drop off tourists at this ghetto location....but there's definitely a reason for it!  Located in a sketchy strip mall is one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.  Even when I am at other Thai establishments...I daydream about the food here.  \n\nOne stand out dish is the fried garlic prawns with shells (FYI shells can be eaten in this case..).  The sea bass options on the menu are all solid as well.  If you order the typical noodle/rice/curry dishes that are available at other Thai restaurants, you will not be impressed and you will feel you have over paid.  The Northern Thai menu is also delicious and adds a little variety compared to other Thai restaurants in the area....while the menu states the dishes are more mild...they still left my mouth on fire.\n\nLotus also has a buffet lunch option.. especially if you are on a time crunch.  Very basic dishes like pad thai, pad see ew, vegetable curry, and assortment of fried foods (tempura, chicken wings, egg rolls) are set out in the middle of the restaurant and constantly filled.  The stand out items in the buffet lunch are the fried chicken wings and the coconut/banana egg roll.  For the price you pay...definitely worth a try!"

S"This is a a fantastic restaurant. Disregard any reviews that try to rate Lotus of Siam based on the lunch buffet. And some of the more common Thai dishes, like pud Thai, are no better here than at your neighborhood Thai restaurant back home.\nLotus of Siam offers an exceptional variety of food. Beef jerky is always a winner for me as an appetizer. I also like the spicy crispy rice and the bacon-wrapped shrimp that are deep fried. (See my photos).\nTom ka gai is a chicken coconut soup they do so well. The way I get it normally in restaurants is that they cook the mushrooms in the soup. At Lotus of Siam they add fresh mushrooms right before they serve it. THat's a different way to do it and I like it. Also, if you look at my picture, you'll see a nice dose of chili sauce floating on top of the soup. Be forewarned about eating that straight. Make sure you mix up your soup before you eat it.\nThe duck dishes are usually pretty good at Lotus of Siam as well. \nIf you're not sure what you want, you can trust your server to order for you. Just tell them what you don't like and they can pick dishes for you.\nThe wine selection is fantastic and the prices are more than reasonable."

S"Lotus of  Siam is great American-style Thai cuisine. Unfortunately, the previous reviews on yelp don't really say this, or maybe I didn't read enough of them. Either way, now begins the review.\nLotus has hands-down the best Orange Chicken I have ever had. If this was 15 years ago, I would've given this place 5 stars. But just like I am no longer a chubby teenager, my taste for fried, overly-sweet, food has passed. The chow mein and pad thai were both good, but their respective sauces were too rich. Or something. Just not 4 stars on yelp good.\nMyself and my eating partner both got the buffet at lunch for $9.99, so discussing the portions is dumb. Let's move along. The service was fast (for a buffet) and water was brought to the table promptly. The used buffet plates disappeared in less than a minute when pushed to the edge of the table.\nLotus is great if you prefer less-than-traditional Thai food."

S"[Note: review is solely for the lunch buffet]\n\nLotus of Siam has the best lunch buffet in Vegas, hands down.  Not because the buffet specials change daily (although tasty variety is nice); not because the ginger tofu dish is tart and spicy in a way that you know they are using fresh ginger; not because the fried sweet potato curry puffs have made me ditch my diet more than once (although, I could honestly pig out on a plate full of those things--crunchy and sweet with a dash of spice . . . mmmmmmm).\n\nNo, it's because each dish under the heat lamp is fresh.  In contrast to most of the buffets in Vegas, Lotus of Siam does not leave their buffet dishes under heat lamps for hours.  Each dish is fresh.  Hell, there's not much chance for the dishes to sit for long since the place is always packed for lunch and the kitchen needs to keep cranking out food to refill the buffet options.  \n\nOh, and the buffet dishes are properly cooked.  An overcooked chicken can ruin a Pad Thai, but you won't find that here.  It's tender, it's seasoned and it's wonderful.\n\nAnd they do a good job of catering to the full spectrum of spice lovers.  The dishes on the buffet aren't overly spicy, but there's plenty of hot sauce and dried hot pepper to stir in if you want to raise the heat level.\n\nAll around thumbs up."

S"After hearing raves about this place from Food Network shows, I had to stop by during my Vegas visit. \n\nWe ordered the Crispy Duck Panang, Nam Prik Ong and Combination Fried Rice. The portions aren't as huge as you're probably used to from other Thai places, but that was enough to fill two people up. \n\nThe Crispy Duck Panang was the clear highlight of the meal -- tender duck, crisp skin, spicy & creamy panang sauce. On their 1-10 spicy level, we got a 6 and it had a perfect amount of spice to it. Definitely don't discard the basil garnish -- mix it in with the sauce, eat it with your rice. Yum! It comes with a small pot of sticky rice, so you don't really need to order extra rice, but I'm a fan of Thai fried rice, so we got the combination too.\n\nThe Combination Fried Rice was good -- not any better than other Thai fried rices I've had. The chicken wasn't particularly moist or tender, and it only came with 2 shrimps. I would probably stick to just beef fried rice or shrimp fried rice, since the chicken didn't really add anything to the dish.\n\nThe Nam Prik Ong was what I really came here for -- I'd heard Ming Tsai raving about it on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate -- and honestly, I was underwhelmed. Not sure if they were just having an off-batch, but it wasn't as complex or flavorful as I expected it to be. I was expecting it to be spicy, with earthy flavors, herbacious Thai basil & cilantro, maybe some lime for acidity. It had a bit of heat to it, but it was pretty one-note. It reminded me more of a tomato-based chili than anything. \n\nAll in all, I can see why people flock to this place. The menu is really huge and the prices aren't too bad (considering you're in Vegas).\n\nThe strip mall it's located in is honestly really sad and run-down looking, but once you're inside, the ambiance isn't bad."

S'Throughout our trip in Vegas, I encountered cab drivers of all kinds. Nevada natives, Ethiopian, Vietnamese, and Nigerian ex-pats and a fiery Argentinian abuelita [although she didn\'t look a day over 50] were some of the most memorable faces.\n\nYet our driver on our trip to Lotus of Siam,  with whom I built the strongest rapport, was the most interesting of them all. Ironically, he was himself, Thai, and a former restauranteur in Las Vegas proper. We spoke of thai dishes, international travel and our mutual distaste for pad thai sauce in a bottle.\n\nAt some point during our dialogue, I asked the lingering question, "So...is Lotus of Siam REALLY as good as they say it is? Is it the best Thai restaurant in the country?" To this, he replied with a simple shake of his head and a "No". "If you want good Thai food, go to Thai Town in Hollywood." He clarified.\n\nI am grateful to this man for lowering my expectations of Lotus of Siam, it\'s never a good idea to go into a restaurant experience believing that the food should be the "BEST" -- a recipe for disaster. So with a newly acquired, down-2-earth perspective, I entered the packed Lotus of Siam and prepared for a memorable experience.\n\nAmbiance:\n\nAfter the Travel Channel stakes claim to a restaurant, one of two things are bound to happen. Either the restaurant will cling to or completely abandon it\'s former character in the face of extreme "over-night" popularity. Fortunately, it seems that Lotus of Siam, while extremely crowded, has apparently retained most of it\'s pre-celebrity essence.\n\nIt looks like...well...a family-run Thai restaurant. The only difference was an entry w/o standing room, a policy that reservations are lost after 5 minutes of seating time [if a "no-show"], and an elaborate walk-in wine cellar in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nFood:\n\nThe Pad See Ew, Fried Rice and Mint Chicken where all winners; but the two dishes which stood out in my mind where the Garlic Prawns and Jackfruit Curry.\n\nGarlic Prawns: Full prawns, shells included, which where completely edible from head to tail. Crispy, moist and \xc3\xbcber flavorful.\n\nThum Ka Noon: This northern-style, non-coconut milk curry is made with young jackfruit and shredded dried fish. The curry broth was like none I had ever tried. It was a fan-favorite around the table for dipping, showering over rice or straight up slurping!\n\nSo...who was right? Andrew Zimmern or my Thai cab driver? Is this really the best Thai food in the country? Clearly I am not qualified to answer this question. Yet, I can assert that the food was quite memorable and some of the best Thai food I have had to date. Additionally, their unique specialization of Northern Thai cuisine is hard to come by outside of Chiang Mai.'

S'~$12 per person for the lunch buffet. This place is a little off the strip, and it is definitely worth it. The place does not face the main street, so you have to turn into a parking lot before you will see it. It is not the best Thai food, but it is a great deal for a good variety of food.

S"This place was just okay.  I feel like it didn't live up to the hype.  I went with the drunken noodles per the yelpers recommendations. It is a dish I am not experienced with, so maybe it just wasn't for me, but it was nothing special.  My wife had the pad thai with chicken which was okay but not great.  With all the rave reviews I was really hoping to be blown away.  The staff here was also suspect.  They seated us at the bar while we waited for a table but then didn't come to offer us any beverages.  I understand that it was near the end of the shift, but close the restaurant when it is closed, not when it is almost closed.  The bartender ignored us and just went about cleaning up his area.  Lame.  I would be willing to come back here and give this place another try, but I truly was let down this go around."

My fav is the panang curry - they do a great job with it.  Sweet, spicy, a lot of depth and subtle flavors.  \n\nThe one thing that's inconsistent there is the spice level.

S"Who knew I would have a compelling reason to go to Vegas just to get Thai food, something that I could literally find every few blocks where I live.\n\nBut before you get excited to visit this place, you'll have to find it. You really can't see the restaurant from the street, but once you turn into a plaza and notice a huge empty parking lot, you are definitely getting warmer. \n\nI went with a lot of choices as advised by yelpers- the prawns with drunken noodles, the crispy duck in panang curry (it's been weeks since I've been but the name has stuck with me) and the last was a beef dish that I don't quite remember the name. The prawns were gigantic and cooked with such a nice crunch to them. The noodles that comes with it is a perfect accompaniment, even with your white rice! I also loved loved loved the duck. Great crunch on the skin and the curry had a reasonable kick to it- loaded with flavor. Both of these dishes I would no doubt get again. The beef dish- while the beef was cooked nicely was not a favorite of mine. It was doused in something that resembled BBQ sauce that I wasn't a huge fan of (and notice how I said doused, they probably put too much on the meat).\n\nAll in all, it was a delicious meal. It is on the pricier side for lunch but, I personally think it is worth every penny. Don't be shy and ask for more rice if you need something to soak up all that curry. Truly a 5 star for me!"

S'I came here at night for my last Vegas thing before driving back to LA. It was about 8:30PM when I rolled up to this place. My first thought was, "Wow, this parking lot is sketchy looking." There are hardly any street lights. When I parked, I parked next to some Audi that had its front end smashed in and 4 flat tires. Then while walking to the entrance of the restaurant, some very sketchy-looking white male on a bicycle started to make up some story about "his wife" then asked for money. We just kept walking because who knows what kind of bicycle shenanigans he might pull off. We put our names down on the decent sized waiting list, went back outside, and moved my car just to get some piece of mind in the dodgy parking lot. It seemed like no one hung around outside of the restaurant which added onto the sketchiness. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for 2 people.\n\nThe food was delicious with lots of flavor and textures. We pretty much only ordered from the chef\'s specialty section:\n1) drunken noodle with soft shell crab\n2) deep fried garlic prawns\n3) nam kao tod\n\nAll the food was a little spicy yet yummy. Again, it was my last Vegas thing of the day before heading 3 hours west and I was already awake for a long time gambling and such so I was almost falling asleep in here. Maybe my review would be different if I had more energy or was drinking.\n\nIf you plan to check this place out, make a reservation so you can minimize the time your car is in a danger zone. You\'ll be surprised with how big it is inside the restaurant.'

S"I wanted to give it 2 star but i told myself may be the cook had a bad day.   Also, the 3rd star is for the good service.\n\nI found this place while looking up on chef Claude Le Tohic of Joel Robuchon.  Tohic won Best Chef Southwest 2010 from the James Beard foundation  (well deserved), beating Saipin Chutima, of Lotus of Siam and Rick Moonen, of RM Seafood.   \n\nThe restaurant walls were covered with framed pictures of the chef/owner and celebrities.

S'The only thing that Lotus of Siam did wrong was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. What do I mean? Well, it had the misfortune of 1) being the dinner we ate AFTER having gone to Jose Andres\' e\' and 2) being visited a few months AFTER the wife and I had eaten in Portland\'s Pok Pok.\n\nIf it weren\'t for those two things, this would\'ve been a five star review all the way. But alas, it wasn\'t the best meal I\'d eaten in 24 hours (though, yes, an unfair comparison) let alone the best Thai I\'d had (by which I mean the aforementioned Pok Pok.)\n\nSo let me stop the comparisons and just talk about our experience. It\'s in a strip mall--a sketch strip mall at that. Some (my overly critical parents, for example) might find that a turn off. Others (a-hole Yelpers like me for example) add points given a genuine hole-in-the-wall status. Thankfully, the sketch doesn\'t extend to the interior.\n\nWe had a group of six. We\'d made reservations about a month previous so we had few (if any) hiccups (though we did heed the advice of showing up exactly on time.) The wine list was impressive by hole-in-the-wall Thai joint standards. Actually, it wasn\'t bad from an objective standpoint either. We\'d ordered a few bottles of Reisling, letting the sweetness of the wine counter the spiciness of the food and allowing each diner to bathe in the unfettered air of foodie douchebaggery.\n\nI ordered the BBQ Pork (Moo Yang). It was tasty and I was pretty pleased with it, though it was kind of one-note. Also, it reminded me of the pork I\'d eaten at Tu Lan\'s, a shady Vietnamese place in SF. Now that\'s not a bad comparison since I LOVED that pork, but I\'d expected something a bit more...Thai.\n\nMy wife ordered a green curry dish. She said it was "okay," and indeed, my sampling of it concurred. She groused, though. "From the reputation of this place, I was expecting to be blown away." Yeah, I guess so. Then again, some places shine with their unexpected dishes--their specials and such--while phoning it in on the same ol\', same ol\'. I guess this could be one of those places. In fact, I hope so. It\'s really hard to tell since the majority of our group went the "5 different varieties of curry" route and they too were mildly disappointed.\n\nSigh.\n\nThe service was good and friendly. My pork was tasty. The wine flowed easily. But most of my group were perplexed and questioned the LoS\'s reputation. I don\'t know, man. Why didn\'t you guys order the whole fish if you wanted to see what they can do?\n\nAs you can see, I\'m a bit torn. I\'ll give LoS the benefit of the doubt and grant them four stars at least. Hopefully I can return someday and see what they can REALLY do.'

S"Take me to Thailand already!\n\nWas soooo excited to come here after hearing about this place for years! Thai restaurants are pretty standard in the Bay Area, so I was really hoping for something different. \n\nReservations are a must for dinner (or anytime, probably)!! Or come right when they open at 5:30PM and get your name on the list. I came here on a Sunday night at 6PM and it was already a 30 to 45 minute wait for a table for two.\n\nDefinitely try to order items you don't normally see at other Thai restaurants. That's the key. If you go for the same old stuff that everywhere else has, then that's what you're gona get... the same 'ol boring stuff. Try something different!\n\nGet the Nam Kao Tod! It's crispy puffy rice sauteed with sour sausage. It sounds a little weird, but it's delicious! I love the crispy texture and there's tons of tangy flavor from the sausage and citrus they put in it. Watch out for the heat though! It might not seem that spicy at first, but the spice creeps up on you and lingers!\n\nThe drunken noodles with soft shell crab was SO GOOD. The sauce for the noodles is on the sweeter side. It's a nice compliment to the salty, crunchy soft shell crab. Don't forget to eat some of the deep fried basil leaves with it!\n\nBut the most amaaazing thing was their mango and sticky rice! HANDS DOWN the BEST mango and sticky rice I've ever had! The mango was perfectly ripe and so sweet. The sticky rice was unique with the hint of floral in the background. And I couldn't get enough of their coconut milk!\n\nThis is also a great place for you wine lovers! Their wine ROOM is astonishing. They have a whole binder as their wine list. They even have one FULL page dedicated to German Rieslings alone!\n\nThe menu here is huge. There's no way you can hit everything in one visit.

I wouldn't say hidden because this place was packed and very popular with the locals and I, being a native of Cali, this place was a good find.\n\nI'm not familiar with Thai food at all so I had to yelp it to see what people craved here. Only thing I knew on the menu was pad tai noodles.  Nam Kai Tod was a good appetizer to begin with. Some sort of sweet crispy brown rice. You have to try this if you have not before.  My partner in crime ordered the glass noodle salad which had a very lime taste to it.  I love sour food and the flavor was just perfect.  It's not an appetizer but it might as well be because even an anorexic can't get full from the amount of glass noodles that was served.  Best to order one for yourself instead of having to share it just as I and my friend did.  Next on the line was the drunken seafood noodle. I'm not very good in describing flavors but I'm just here to tell you this was freaking delicious. It gave many options of flavors in one plate, from shrimp to muscles and the noodles in it.  And the last was the dessert! Damn I've never had one this good. Coconut ice cream on sticky sweet rice. One word to describe this is, can I have some more!? Alright it wasn't one word but you know what i mean.\n\nThe only sour taste that came out from this was I had to pay for her too. Wtf, she's my ex, haven't the rules changed?

And I walked out of this place thinking it was good, but definitely not amazing.  And I went on a Friday night.  We were thinking that maybe I didn't get their best chef-but who doesn't use their best chef on a Friday night?\n\nWell, I went with 4 other friends and we ordered a lot of different types of food.  We started with Tom Kah Kai which is a traditional coconut chicken soup almost every Thai restaurant makes.  It's ok.  Not great.  I've definitely had better.  I was a little surprised.  And I got myself a Thai tea.  Same thing, wasn't great.  Have definitely had much better.\n\nWe then got a spicy salad.  I don't remember which one.  This I liked more but only because it was really, really spicy.  Spicy and salads is a rare mix and it worked out with this salad.  But most my friends couldn't handle the spice.  I could barely handle it myself to be honest.  \n\nWe got a pad thai noodle dish, a pineapple fried rice and a fried sea bass dish.  Maybe, we got some more things though honestly I don't remember the rest.  Really tells you something when I can't quite remember what we ordered.  It's simply because the food wasn't that remarkable.  The sea bass was crazy disappointing.  I though we were getting an entire sea bass and only got a small cut of it.  I almost flipped the table over when they served the sea bass especially as it was the most expensive dish we got. $30 for this one plate.  Crazy, absolutely do not order this.  Completely overpriced.  You go to any other authentic Asian restaurant you're getting a whole fish for that kind of price.  Actually, you're getting a whole fish for less than that price.\n\nSo overall I was not impressed with this place.  Did I get the wrong chef?  I don't know.  I doubt different chefs are going to give you different portions of the fish-this is for sure.  So I thought the food was good and I wouldn't tell people to avoid this place.  But at the same time I don't think I'd come back here unless I was going with someone who'd eaten here multiple times and knew exactly which dishes to order and which ones not to."

S'Lotus of Siam is nestled in this bizarre world of tranny bars and swinger clubs.  Off of Sahara, in this plaza that is like a whole nother world!\n\nWe went here for lunch and I was super excited to try this place.  While I am partial to Pin Kaow, this place is delicious!\n\nMy friend did the lunch buffet.  Everyday they have different food at the buffet and so many things to try!  She loved the egg (??) soup the best!\n\nI ordered Chicken Pad Thai at 5 spice.  (I know, not very daring!) It was very good!  I felt a little rushed when trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, because their menu is HUGE!  Next time, I will check it out online before I go!\n\nIt was interesting sitting in there, mostly because there was some sort of wine convention or something going on and all the tables were filled with people drinking wine and on their laptops.  Very interesting.\n\nThe down side was the service.  We got there around 12pm and at 1:15pm we never saw anyone after they delivered my one plate of food.  So we found someone and asked for the bill.  Twice.  Then I paid cash.  And had to ask for my change.  Twice.\n\nOther than that, I would totally be back!'

S'You\'ve gotta love Thai food and culture for its sensuality.  Who else names their cities Bangkok and Phuket? So when I came across Lotus of Siam, I naturally thought it was a massage parlor with happy endings. After all, the lotus is the universal Asian code word for vajajay. I quote from an ancient Thai love poem - "She laid back with her beauty spread before me like a lotus blossoming, ready to capture the dew". Who woulda thought that Thai poets wrote in English back then!  But after reading the reviews I was aroused in a different way.( Now the term sexual appetite makes sense) and I had to go (or come, depending on your perspective).\n\nSo far of all the Thai places that I have been to, Lotus of Siam has had the best food of all.  I was pretty amazed at the wine selection available for a Thai restaurant.  Who thinks about varietals from Chateauneuf du Paupe in a Thai place?  But they have it here!  Service was unusually good for an Asian place.\n\nTom Yum Kai and Tom kha kai was the best I ever had anywhere.  Nice acidity and creaminess of coconut was spot on.  Braised short rib with panaang was ultra tender and wonderfully flavored.  A fantastic idea for that curry.  Fried sea bass on top drunken noodles was also very good.  very tender with a nice crisp saltiness.  I\'m not sure if my taste buds were a bit off that day, but the food seemed a bit on the salty side, but not overwhelmingly so.  Spice levels tend to be on the higher end, so I would order a notch or two down from what you normally get at other Thai places.\n\nGourmet magazine (before its closure) touted this as the best Thai food in America -  a pretty bold claim, but I can\'t find reason to argue.\n\nIf you can\'t get your spice on here, there is always the Green Door just across, so you can get your kinky on (or so I\'ve heard).\n\nI end with a famous Thai adage - Beware of who you lay with because you may be struck with the fiery burn of Thai chili in your head that has no mouth.\n\nbest thing - tom kha kai and braised short rib with panang'

S'I\'ve heard so much about this place being "THE BEST" Thai food ever so we were very eager to go try it.  I have to say I\'m disappointed.  Not sure if it\'s what we ordered but we tried the top 3 yelped items.\n\nLocation:\nIt\'s located slightly off the strip so very convenient to get to however the strip mall is old and ghetto.  When we came at 5p it looked dark and abandoned however by 5:30p when they open for dinner there was a huge line waiting to get in.\n\nService:\nGood and FAST, we got our food a few minutes after ordering it surprisingly.\n\nFood:\nNam kao tod - The first bite of this salad was amazing.  The crispy rice is crispy and is packed with flavor.  However by the second and third bite, it was way too salty.  Would not order this again\n\nTom Yum soup- Salty but standard\n\nCrispy duck and drunken noodles- The duck was very crispy and good.  However the duck to noodle ratio seemed off.  There was like 80% duck and 20% noodles which I guess most people would feel is worth it but I like having more noodles.  After a few bites we were out of noodles and were just eating duck alone\n\nOverall:\nGood but not the best Thai food I\'ve ever had and it\'s a bit pricey.  I feel like you can have the same type of Thai food at other restaurants for cheaper.\n\nTip:\nLong lines sometime but the restaurant is HUGE so it goes very quickly.'

Not cheap at all.Even though, I wnat to try buffet this time.\nPad thai was ok(taste was good but noddle was stick together) Red curry was ok(vegetable was fresh but too much oil than regular dish) egg soup was good, fried rice was ok, and fried banana and fresh fruit was good. Of course they served more food such as Thai style beef stew, egg roll, Fried Tofu, Mixed vegetable.\nAlso, I ordered coffee. It wasn't good.(I bet they did warm up for me cuz it was way too much hot and taste was........different.

S"I have had Lotus of Siam on 3 occasions since moving to Las Vegas, 1 in the restaurant and 2 times for take out. \n\nThe food served in the restaurant was a lot better than the experience I had with take out. I ordered the yellow curry and spicy noodles with shrimp for my first take out order. The styrofoam box the noodles were in looked like it had been stepped on, their was sauce all over the bag and it leaked on my counter. After preparing my first plate of food I noticed a black and white hair in my food. My friend and I were disgusted because it looked like an animal hair. I immediately called back Lotus and told them I would be bringing the food back for a refund. When I went into the restaurant I showed them how sloppily they had packaged it and the unknown hair in my food. They said it was probably a hair from one of the girls clothing and I told them it looked like a cat hair. After this they handed me my money and I could see they wanted me out of their restaurant.\n\nFast forward a few months later, Lotus is still the closest Thai restaurant to my place and I don't like Komol. I told my friend I wanted to order take out again and she was completely surprised I wanted to give them another chance. I ordered the panang curry with vegetables and asked what vegetables were in the dish. Penny, the owners daughter said carrots, cabbage, and broccoli. I also ordered the Thai spaghetti with chicken. This time my order was packaged correctly but I noticed the panang curry was more oily than usual and contained very little sauce. I also saw that there was baby corn, various peppers, onions, and green beans. Penny described inaccurately what vegetables were in the dish. What if I was allergic? People need to be careful these days and not say things unless they are 100% sure. Both the panang curry and Thai spaghetti were a solid three stars, but after my shocking take out order and misdescribed dishes the most I can give this restaurant is two stars."

By the way, don't let the outside fool you. It's pretty big inside!\n\nThe food here is so flavorful! The service is uhhhhmazing and if you're Asian, you know it's rare you get good service at Asian restaurants. We started off with the tom yum soup, level 6 spicy. The spice level would definitely go up next time. It has just the right hint of hot and sour. Next we got the pad thai which totally blew me away. Pad thai is something I always need to get at a Thai restaurant to compare and this dish surprised me with how good it tasted. The papaya salad was good, but nothing really special. Garlic prawns were huge and crispy and I could taste the slightest hint of garlic! I hate it when food items claim they have garlic in it but you can't taste it for shit. Next we got the drunken noodles w/ soft shell crabs. MMMMMM, so gooood! Crabs was good and drunken noodles had the right amount of flavors. Last, we went with the mango sticky rice. The rice could be sweeter in my opinion but overall, not bad.\n\nI love this place and would continue to come back when I'm in Vegas. Until then, I'll be dreaming about it."

S'Despite the reviews cautioning against dreadful crowds and long waits, we had no trouble getting seated immediately at 7 pm on a Friday night. This is probably the most spacious Thai restaurant I\'ve ever been to - in addition to accommodating multiple large party banquets at the time of our dinner, the restaurant was also serving patrons seated at the full bar (a traditional Thai restaurant with a full bar - classic Vegas; complete anomaly). \n\nDespite the strong fight put up by the drunken noodles and the tom yum noodle soup, I ultimately went for the pork larb ($8.95) with a side of sticky rice ($2) per my waiter\'s recommendation on the basis of both popularity and healthiness. According to him, the larb - consisting of "lean" ground pork mixed with red and green onions and cilantro bathed in a spicy/fishy chili lime dressing, accompanied by a few cucumber slices and a petite wedge of raw cabbage - is prepared with no fat and is one of the most popular menu items. While the dish was undeniably tasty, I found it to be wildly underwhelming on the whole - the flavors tasted exactly identical to the seasoning packets used in Mama brand ramen (which I love but don\'t need to pay restaurant prices for). The biggest disappointment of all was the dismally poor quality of the pork. Contrary to my waiter\'s word, the meat was EXTREMELY fatty, and I found myself picking out the visible chunks of fat as I ate. I definitely should\'ve gone for the shrimp instead, but we were in a hurry and didn\'t have time to wait for a new dish to come out. The sticky rice was a more moderate disappointment - the rice used is a longer grain than what I encountered in Thailand, so it was more fluffy than sticky. Save yourself $1 and just order the regular steamed rice. \n\nEven though I wasn\'t impressed with what was a solid 2 star meal, I attribute that more to mis-ordering than bad establishment. Service was fantastic, and you can tell the chef takes great pride in the restaurant and cooking/her food in general. I\'m not sure along which basis people can claim this is the best Thai food in America, but I\'d be interested in returning if I ever get the chance to try the more specialty / creative menu items, such as the drunken noodles and various seafood offerings - I\'d just recommend staying away from the pork.'

S'Lotus of Siam is a bit off the strip, and sits in a sketchy area. There is nothing special about this place, inside and out. After reading so much about it, and hearing Andrew Zimmern rave about this place, it was on top of my list for my last Vegas trip. It goes to show, all of the top restaurants aren\'t inside the popular casinos and resorts. Most of them are all commercialized and owned by restaurant groups. Lotus of Siam is one of one. It makes it unique and special, and is a part of Vegas as much as any of the popular resorts.\n\nWe started things off with something exciting and new. The Koong char num plar, raw prawns marinated in seasoned fish sauce was a favorite of ours. With the spicy fish sauce, fresh garlic and roasted chili paste, the dish definitely had flavor. Ironically, I used a bunch of that fish sauce to get rid of the rawness and "fishy" flavor. Spiciness met sweetness from the shrimp. The texture of this was spectacular. A bit on the sticky side, the texture took some getting used to. Still a great way to start.\n\nMy personal favorite was the Nam Kao Tod. It was a crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. Texturally different from the raw shrimp, this had a nice crunch, and the crunch played a great role in this dish. The ginger flavor popped and the citrus was key. It was delicious and refreshing.\n\nThe dish of all dishes-the one to get here always Is the Drunken Noodle Prawn. Thick rice noodles are on fried with deep fried prawns. The shell I kept on and the frying process makes the skins edible. The special blend of garlic sauce and Thai basil was perfect. The prawns were cooked perfectly and the crunch of the skin was amazing. This dish is pretty hard to pass up -- a definite must order here.\n\nTo end everything, we ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice. It was a great neutralizer form all that garlic, shrimp, and spices. The coconut flavor was mild and not too overpowering. My favorite was the sticky rice. Everything just had such a delicate flavor and nothing was overbearing.\n\nBack home in Los Angeles, there are a bunch of Ktown style Chinese restaurants that have pretty good food. From spicy seafood noodles to fried pork and beef dishes, they are all delicious, but you won\'t find any of these in China. The menu hasn\'t changed ever since the first time I went, and that is the quality of the places. You know what you will get, and its the same no matter when you go. Lotus of Siam is kind of like that. The menu hasn\'t changed in forever, and the food, though may not be genuine Thai renditions is delicious.'

S'Probably one of the best Thai places that I have ate.  Some other top contenders are New Krung Thai Restaurant in San Jose and Osha in San Francisco.  \n\nOn the outside, this place looks real plain, nothing fancy, expecting a no ac and dirty kind of place.  But once you walk in, you see this nice temperature controlled wine cellar.  Then you see how large the restaurant actually is and that it is packed with people.  We made a reservation about 2 hrs in advance and had no problems getting it.  Once we arrived, they honored the reservation and led us immediately to our table.  I hate the places where you make a reservation, but still have to wait like everybody else.\n\nWe got the spicy catfish with basil, crispy duck in panang sauce, Tod Mun Pla (deep fried fish-cak), and Tom Yum Kun soup.  We got everything medium, oh also, everything came in exactly as medium for me, its not one of those places where medium means, low to zero spicy.\n\nThe Tod Mun Pla was great, I love the spicy sauce with cucumbers that came with it.\nTom Yum Kun soup was good, but was actually a little spicy for me.\nThe spicy fried catfish was real tasty and it stayed crispy till the end, I was expecting it to get soggy later on in the meal, but it stayed crispy.  \nThe crispy duck was also great, the only part of the duck that was crispy though was the skin.  It came with a panang sauce, which was good, we put that over our rice.  The duck was a little pricey though, about $21, was expecting it to be a whole duck, but was probably only half a duck.  But was still worth getting it.\n\nOverall, if I am in Vegas and feeling like eating Thai, I would come here.'

All their herbs and spices are potent, they probably have their own garden outside. but then again, this is Las vegas, so their herb and ingredient source is definitely not local, but nevertheless, fresher than the prince of bel air.\n\nForgive me for my lack of knowledge in thai eats, but deep curry puffs(wontons)? shaking my head, "yes." Well. It\'d be better if it was freshly fried out of the oil tank, but it\'s a buffet, so it\'s a compromise. Just like their pad Thai noodles are a little bit on the dry side, but still tastes decent. They have a nice and simple selection on their buffet menu, like the ginger tofu dish. They also offer regular menus as well, which I have yet to try.\n\nMany of the workers here are smiley, which in that moment, makes me just want to book a flight to Thailand, now.

S"I was forced to check this place out during my recent trip. My friend had seen it on some travel show and also had an article highlighting it from a magazine. It was said to be the best Thai restaurant on the west coast. Well after I heard that I had to see if this was true.\n\nWe called to make reservations however they don't take reservations. We took a taxi from our hotel and let me warn you that this is off the beaten path. When we arrive it was about 8PM and I honestly thought we were in the wrong spot. It's located in an old strip mall. \n\nUpon entering we found that the restaurant was packed, that's always a good sign. We sat down and proceeded to order a bottle of wine, Rudi Pichler Riesling. It went very nice with the spicy red curry. I am not a big meat person and would rather not touch the stuff. I do make exceptions and this visit was one of them. My friends and I usually opt for family style dining when we go out. It's no surprise that meat is ordered but I tend to leave them alone. \n\nWe had the Tum Yum soup (I remember this because yum= yummy) which had a little kick but was excellent. Next came the entr\xc3\xa9es, forgive me because I don't have the names. Red curry sauce with duck, and Pad Thai. Remember what I said earlier about meat? Honestly the duck dish was prepared and presented beautifully. I had to take a nibble. The meat was tender but the outside was breaded lightly. Great texture. The red curry was perfect because it wasn't overwhelming and went very nice with the duck. Pad Thai was the best because the noodles were not mushy as some places tend to over cook, and the flavor came alive in my mouth! (I need to go back, my mouth is watering just writing this.)\n\nAfter dinner we finished with some Tozai snow maiden sake and some banana dessert. Both were an amazing finish to a perfect meal."

It was good, but not a new favorite.\nThe entrees were far better, with the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodles being my new favorite.  The fish was so perfectly cooked and buttery that I won't be able to return here without getting it every time.  We also had the Nua Nam Tok, which was one of their many charbroiled beef options.  They do a good job with their beef and it had a great flavor with lots of heat.\nI do wish after all these years, the restaurant would improve its website.

It probably deserves more..\n\nPlaces like Komol, Weera Thai, Pan Asian, Archi\'s etc. etc., they make really good, in fact, they make really great Thai food! LoS is completely on an entirely different level. For example, take the classic, drunken noodles. At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says "this is drunken noodles." At LoS, it still says  "this is drunken noodles", but it\'s totally different from every one I\'ve ever had in my life. And, I mean different in a totally amazing, uniquely personal, life changing sort-of-way... That goes for EVERY dish on the menu. Also, if you haven\'t had the crispy prawns, do try them, quite possibly the best thing I\'ve eaten this year (them prawn shells..)\n\nWhenever I eat at a restaurant, I always come in with an open mind regardless of what others have experienced, positive or negative. This restaurant isn\'t just one of the best restaurants in Vegas or the entire country, this is a world class restaurant. This restaurant will continue to rack up the accolades, and deservedly so. Well done Lotus of Siam.. Well done!'

S"For a Thai restaurant that's somewhat small, located somewhat in the less nicer part of LV, I'm quite surprised and amazed about the accolades this place has received. It might be difficult and often times challenging to get into the restaurant because there's usually a wait, and people shuffling to get in or get out. \n\nWhen you finally get to be inside, (assuming that you might have to wait outside of the restaurant for a bit) and get a chance to see all the pictures of the celebrities that came into the restaurant, you can't help but wonder how the heck Lotus of Siam got the chance to entertain the celebrities they had the opportunity to cook for. This place is somewhat a hole in the wall, and you would think that celebrities would confine themselves to big name restaurants where exclusively rich and powerful dine. Apparently not at Lotus of Siam; all sorts of people (rich, not so rich, big, small, tourists, locals, etc. etc.) come here to enjoy awesome Thai cuisine. \n\nThey have a nice menu that covers all the traditional Thai dishes (pan fried noodles, salads, curries, soups, desserts) + specific specialties that I haven't found at any other Thai restaurant. If you're into hot and spicy, I would suggest taking an antacid before hand cuz their food can get crazy spicy where you'd probably be soaking in your clothes once you're done with your meal. \n\nI can't tell you a specific dish that stood out because honestly, they're ALL good. Everything is superb in flavor, freshness, overall quality. What did stand out was their prices and quantity. Lotus of Siam is a tad bit more expensive and you get a bit less of food than at other Thai food places. I have confidence that anything you purchase would be a great pick.\n\nAlso, while it appears that Lotus of Siam boasts to claim they have an amazing wine selection, I can't voucher for this as I never had the chance to purchase one of their wines there. Just FYI though, in terms of whether or not you're wondering what beverages they pride themselves over...\n\nI'm wavering between a 3/4 starts on this one...Definitely a great Thai food restaurant. Wouldn't say it's the best, but it sure is up there in Thai food places I'd dine in and come to again when I'm in the area."

S'Freakin\' loved this place!!!!  Ok so I came here with a local....as we pulled into the parking lot, I was kinda sketched out.  My friend was telling us about the "Green Door" which was located in the same strip mall.  Well I don\'t want to gross you out so you can look up the "Green Door" for yourself.  LOL.  Anyways, my friend was telling me that this place is a little hidden gem.  Boy was she right!  We came on a Friday night and there were lots of people which was a good sign!  We started off with dumplings and beef nom tuk.  Both were excellent and full of flavor!  For my main dish, I settled with the Pad See Eww and it was amongst the best I\'ve ever had.  I\'d definitely come back here the next time i come back to Vegas.   Don\'t let the sketch strip mall scare you cause the food is excellent.'

S'This place gives new meaning to the saying, "Don\'t judge a book by its cover."  Stuck in a rundown shopping center next a wig shop, I didn\'t know what to expect from what I\'ve heard to be "The Best Thai Food in North America."  \n\nMy co-worker swears by this place and gave me a list of menu items to order: Chicken satay, steamed sea bass (not on the menu), shrimp garlic, and mango with sticky rice for dessert.  My boyfriend and I ordered some crab fried rice just in case the recommendations turned out to be "too Thai" haha.  Turns out we enjoyed the crab fried rice the most.  Everything else was good too but nothing I would rave about.\n\nThe staff were accomodating and sweet.  The atmosphere was homey and inviting.

S"MAKE A RESERVATION.\n\nDon't be a dumbass and not make a reservation.  If you are going to vegas and have about a week of notice, you should be able to get a slot no problem.  It's not a ridiculous wait for walk-ins, but it's an unnecessary wait if you just pick up the phone.\n\nThe food.\n\nIn short, thai food executed at a high level without being pretentious.\n\nMy recommendations:  \n\nAppetizers:\n\nSpicy garlic chicken wings - These wings are deep fried to get the skin nice and crispy and glazed in a sweet garlic chili sauce that make for the right balance of sweet, spicy, salty and crispy.\n\nNam Kao Tod:  \nCrispy rice with pieces of pork and green onion.  This dish, if I recall correctly has some spice to it.  Not for everyone, but a nice textual accompaniment.\n\nMains:\n\nPad Thai - A refreshingly light take on something that can be bogged down with sauce.  The right balance of noodles, peanuts and sauce.\n\nPad See Ew - This was good, I don't recall what was in it exactly\n\nGarlic prawns - If you order anything from this list, make sure you order these.  These are large prawns that are breaded and deep fried to the point where the shells are edible (if you don't mind a bit of chewing).  These are my favorite here.\n\nPanang curry - I'm not a curry fan, but this was good.\n\nIn short, catch a cab and look for the weird Green Door massage parlor and you'll see the line out the door for this place.   If you have reservations, you'll have a great dinner."

S"Their most recent exposure on Top Chef: Masters had an out-of-town friend wanting to check this place out.  After our first visit  many years ago, I figured it would be a nice treat to go back.\n\nAfter making reservations for a Thursday evening, they told us they would only hold the reservation for 5 minutes because they are that busy.  Okay.\n\nWe were a party of six - four adults and two kids.  \n\n* Chicken Dumplings ($6.95) -   Basic deep fried wontons with chicken and vegetables and served with a sweet chili sauce.  This order was mostly to satisfy the kiddies.\n\n* Our friend recently had a Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad ($13.95) at another Thai place and wanted to try their version.  When he saw the presentation, he was immediately disappointed.  The pieces were a bit larger than he would have hoped and it was just an okay salad taste-wise.\n\n* The Husband was certain about one dish in particular - the Crispy Duck Curry.  (He loved it before and that's all he could remember.)  When the waiter heard this, he insisted we order the Crispy Panang Curry instead and assured us we would LOVE it.  (It also cost $20.95.)  I asked him if he was certain we really would and he said yes.  We thought it was just alright...and not really worth the $21 cost of it especially.  Sure, it was tasty but I've had better panang curry in Vegas for a fraction of the price.\n\n* We also opted for something from the Chef Specials - the Red Snapper.  Sure, it was a whole snapper at market price, which ended up being $35.  Our friend couldn't believe it when he discovered how much they charged for it.\n\nWhen the waiter initially took our order, he asked what our spice level choice was.  We wanted the salad and curry mild since the kids would be eating it.  However, it was far from mild and we were unable to serve it to the children.  As we neared the conclusion of our meal, we wanted to add another dish.  We asked the waiter for some suggestion and he mostly focused on things from the Chef Specials that were market price or didn't appeal to us.  We ultimately decided we were done with the meal.  \n\nI did take a quick peek at the dessert menu hoping for a saving grace but there was nothing exciting on there and our visiting friends were done with their Lotus experience at this point.\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing visit.  Sure, they have all the fame they could ever want but it just leaves us wanting more. Maybe we ordered all the wrong dishes?  We probably won't be coming back here anytime soon."

S"To this Texas girl, Lotus of Siam is some dayum good Thai food.  I can't group myself in with the connoiseurs and aficionados but I do love to eat it!  We came in for a late lunch right before our flight out, so we had all our luggage with us and it wasn't an issue.  The cabbie that brought us here had never heard of the place, but the one that took us to the airport was all excited we had heard about it because he loves it too.\n\nAnyhoo--\n\n- Thai Iced Tea, get it.  \n- Crispy garlic prawns, I wasn't the hugest fan (I was a little more squeamish about the shells) but my dude loved them\n- We wanted to order the snapper or sea bass (i forget which now) on the drunken noodles, but they were out, so we got the duck.  Very similar to pad kee mow with basil, tomato, peppers---soooo good\n- Tom Kha Gai soup - VERY tangy but good.  A little on the salty side.\n- Mango sticky rice - I've never really liked this in the past but holy mother of god I'm now a convert.  SOOO glad we were there during mango season!!!  Now I gotta find this in Dallas...\n\nFor a casual Thai-enthusiast, I'd definitely recommend checking it out!! We'll definitely make it a staple for future visits."

I'm a HUGE riesling fan and this place has a wine list like I've never seen. Seriously. If you love rieslings and are in Vegas, you HAVE TO come here. I'm not even that into Thai and I go here. \n\nBut, since one needs to eat in order to drink more, I recommend their sea bass. Pricey but seriously delicious. My dad got their equivalent of broccoli beef and it wasn't so wonderful. Just bland. Their dessert (the fried banana one) also left something to be desired (that something was ice cream since the thing was a dry as bone) but I just waved down the waiter and got some. Problem solved! \n\nAnyway, go out here. You'll feel like a real Vegas insider and have the chance to try some really special wine. \n\nOh, and eat too. :) \n\nPS: Call ahead for reservations!"

S"Hallelujah, I think I've finally been converted to a Lotus of Siam fan. I have been to Lotus of Siam on two previous occasions and have not been impressed. I'm the first to admit that I don't believe I ordered the right things on my previous visits, so I take ownership of that. \n\nI came here this evening with my fella. It was his first visit and he was excited to finally try the famous Lotus of Siam. He's a big fan of Komol, so he wasn't sure Lotus could top it. We arrived around 8:45 and there was an estimated 30 minute wait. We were seated in less than 20 minutes, thankfully. Once seated, our server was extremely attentive and friendly from start to finish. There wasn't a moment that our drinks went unfilled. He checked back on us often, so that helped give them an extra star as well. \n\nOn to the food. Having had two previous less than spectacular visits here, I was on a mission to find the right food to eat here. I had heard so many great things about the nam kao tod, so that was a must try. We also ordered the drunken noodle with prawns and the choo chee duck. The food came out quickly and the food portions were incredibly generous. The spice level was no joke. I had heard they were famous for spice, so we ordered a 5 to stay on the safe side. We typically order a 7 or 8 at other restaurants, but we were very glad that we erred on the side of caution. The flavors were amazing. The name kao tod had the perfect flavors and texture. The drunken noodle were also terrific. So was the choo chee. The duck was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce. \n\nLotus definitely more than converted me to a devotee this evening. It'll definitely become a regular on the Thai rotation again, I'm excited to say. I already have a list of other delightful delectables I'm looking forward to trying on my next trip."

I would highly suggest dining with a large party so you're able try all of the restaurant specialties and the Chef's choice's.\n\nIt was just the two of us and we must of looked famished because we ordered half the menu. It was my last dinner in sin city and I wanted to win the gold medal of gluttonous overkill.\n\nWe ordered the crispy duck panang. Holy shit this is fcking awesome. The salt and pepper prawns with drunken noodles. Huge mutherfcking prawns, delicious. Spicy thai beef jerky, they need to bag this and sell it to cowboys. YUM. Fried chicken wings sauteed in garlic. Yes Yes Yes. A cold beef salad with lime, very refreshing. Crab fried rice and softshell crab curry. Why don't all thai places serve food like this? Chicken pad thai, this dish I didn't care for, I've had better. The quality of the food is by far better than any other thai place I've been to. The menu is very diverse, I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get away from the same standard fare that the casino's have to offer.\n\n5 amazing stars."

It was definitely the best Thai food I've had in a long time. \n\nMy friend and I started off the meal with Tom Yum soup and we asked for a level 4 spicyness and OH BOY it was SPICY! So definitely order lower than you what you think your spicyness level it because oh man, my throat was on fire but I love every single bite. \n\nThen we ordered the Thai BBQ chicken and the classic Pad Thai. and OH MAN! The chicken had so much flavor and it was cooked to perfection. They used small noodles to make the pad thai which I had never seen before, but it didn't matter because the flavors were perfect. I ate until I was close to exploding. \n\nAnd like other yelpers mentioned, the outside does look a little sketchy, but the inside is nice and clean and very spacious. DEFINITELY come eat here!

Growing up in NY, I'm used to some of the best places being a hole-in-the-wall so this place makes me feel right at home.  This restaurant is surprisingly inexpensive when you consider the type of dining experience you get at other restaurants on the strip.  My favorites are the crispy rice, duck in red curry and my all time favorite is the Nua Yang Prik Thai Onn, which is sliced steak that is as tender as you can imagine, sauteed with red chili paste and peppercorns.  I go to a level seven on spicy, but I'm a little crazy.  They also have an AMAZING wine list.  My favorite pairing is the mango w/sweet sticky rice and a dessert Gewurztraminer.

All of the dishes came on shallow plates, five dishes later the three of us were still a bit hungry. The spicy beef salad was drenched in sweet dressing. \n\nI've definitely had better.

S'Service: Extremely attentive. Almost too much so, but they really took care of us. When we first arrived, the hostess asked if we would like to take the stairs or elevator (I think it\'s common practice, but we noticed that none of the waiters were taking the elevator, so maybe they aren\'t allowed), we went through two big bottles of water because they were constantly refiling our glasses, and our waitress seemed overjoyed when we handed her a cash tip. \n\nFood: Perfect fish, perfect meat, perfect pastry, perfect perfect perfect perfect. My boyfriend said it was the best meal of his life. The portions are "fancy restaurant small" for some dishes... don\'t be fooled. We were SO full.\n\nPrice: Expensive, but expected. My boyfriend and I got waters, ordered one appetizer (Hamachi Crudo), two entrees (Beef Wellington and Seafood/Fisherman sampler), a side (truffle mac and cheese), and desert (blueberry tart). Ran us $206 after tip. \n\nOverview: I recommend everything that we ate. Cooked perfectly, well balanced, and there are some "food snob" items along with some very basic but tasty items on the menu. The atmosphere is kind of pretentious (the hostess explained concept behind the huge, neon, chandelier/piece of art in the center of the dining room, etc.), but I chalk that up to the location, and Gordon Ramsay\'s idea of what a Vegas restaurant should look like.

If you are looking for Chef Ramsay\'s scallop, you will have to order the tasting menu because scallop is not on the regular menu.\n\nOnce we were seated, our waiter immediately gave us the iPad with wine and cocktail menus. A moment later, meat / steak cart suddenly appeared as our waiter explained different cuts of meat.\n\nThe overall service was exceptional with one minor hiccup. One of waiter was about to serve Kurobuta pork belly, but later he realized that blue crab soup was supposedly come out first because that was technically what I\'ve requested. Not like I cared about which dish came 1st, but the waiter took the pork belly back to the kitchen and we basically had to wait another 15+ minutes for the soup to come out. \n\nBreads - Free Refills (Lemon Focaccia w/ Olive Oil, Black Truffle Mushroom w/ Pancetta + Pork Fat, Baguette w/ Blue Cheese, Butter w/ Volcanic Sea Salt) - Black truffle mushroom bread was amazing, baguette was decent, and lemon focaccia was average. Sea salt butter was one of the smoothest butter I\'ve had.\n\nBlue Crab Soup (blue crab, corn, red curry - $17 Total Rewards Member, $18 Regular Price) - Creamy texture with a bit of sweetness, sourness, and spiciness all in one bowl. Full of flavors and a pretty good soup. \n\nKurobuta Pork Belly (cheesy grits, tomato jam, onion pork jus - $18 Total Rewards Member, $19 Regular Price) - Pretty good pork belly (some portion of meat was melt-in-your-mouth good), but all that tomato jam and onion pork just didn\'t enhance the overall flavor of pork belly.\n\nFingerling Potatoes (parmesan, truffle - $11 Total Rewards Member, $12 Regular Price): It has this very interesting roasted flavor - did not regret this order.\n\nRoasted Beef Wellington (medium rare w/ 45 minutes wait, glazed root vegetables, potato pur\xc3\xa9e, red wine demi-glace - $99 for 2 Total Rewards Member, $101 for 2 Regular Price) - This should be the best order right? Well ... not at THAT price level. Well seasoned beef with flaky golden crust - so I could see the appeal, but I still prefer the traditional juicy cut steak. \n\nSticky Toffee Pudding (sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream - $13 Total Rewards Member, $14 Regular Price) - Ho, ho ho! Definitely best order of the day. Such an amazing dessert ... and brown butter ice cream was the BOMB! One of the hardest ice cream to cut with a spoon, so I just stabbed it with my fork and took one bite at a time. Simply the right sweetness and texture for pudding cake - man, so amazing. \n\nOver-hyped prices, pretty good appetizers and the Beef Wellington, and out-of-this-world sticky toffee pudding. Probably not worth $300 meal (for 2 or 3) because I am pretty sure you can get better food with that kind of money, but it is still not a bad choice for the special occasion (or your are simply a Gordon Ramsay\'s fan and say "I\'ve visited his restaurant ... at least once in my lifetime!").'

S"This place is great. Although it started off seeming like it might not be, the hostesses really seem to have a bit of an attitude, like they are better than you. Once we got sat though that was the end of it. The first thing you notice is the decor, all very nice with a giant English Flag painted on the roof. The music also seems to be most if not all English Bands. \n\nThe first thing we had was a cooked oyster appetizer, this was a very good start. Then we had our main dishes, my wife had a lamb dish that came with a rack of lamb, and a shepherds pie, the pie was really great. I had the beef wellington, this was amazing as well (this only comes cooked medium rare so be aware of that if you don't like your meat cooked this way). We also had a macaroni and cheese side, and that was fantastic. Finally for desert we shared a s'mores cheesecake, that was great, especially the marshmallow ice cream on top. \n\nThe waiters are great as well, all very attentive and nice, really the only down side of this place is the hostesses, which is surprising since they are the first contact with the potential customers. \n\nThis place is pretty pricey, but the quality of food is top notch. Not only that in a lot of places like this your dishes are really pretty small, this place though the portion sizes are pretty generous. So if you are looking for a nice place to eat with great food consider coming here. It does get fairly loud inside so this would not be the place to go for a quite dinner."

S"It's been more than a year since my last visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak.  Being it December, I decided on coming back to have another Beef Wellington since it seemed like the perfect meal for the holidays.\n\nUnfortunately, while the food was top notch, my waiter almost killed the experience because he was pretty slow and at times was no where to be found when I needed him.  The most bizarre part was how I sat at my table for a good 20 minutes without a menu.  Not a big deal, since I already knew what I would be ordering, but I just thought it was strange how I wouldn't have a menu right off the bat to look at.  My waiter did do what he was scripted to do like explain all the meats from the cart (The Meat Wagon! --  http://bit.ly/1h8BxQw).  It's still impressive to look at, but if you've been there before like I have, it does drag down the ordering process for me.\n\nWith all that said though, I still had an amazing meal.\n\nKurobuta Pork Belly -- http://bit.ly/1c2cjnM\nw/ cheesy grits, tomato jam, onion pork jus\nThis was a really good appetizer to start off with.  The pork belly just melted in my mouth like butter!!  Interesting take on a southern dish.\n\nBeef Wellington -- http://bit.ly/19j6hfQ\nStill the best tasting Beef Wellington I've ever had.  Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!  Wellington was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was juicy and full of flavor.\n\nFrench Press Coffee -- http://bit.ly/1hGdgBV (pic from my last review)\nSame coffee and and flavor spoons as my last visit.  This time I used both the Amaretto and Baileys flavor spoons.  Still was a great way to cap off my meal.\n\nAll in all, it was a very good dinner but the service from my waiter was under par.  It's really too bad I have to downgrade to 4 stars, but maybe next time I come by I'll have a more attentive waiter.  Still worth visiting if you're in Vegas and want a great dining experience."

The service is excellent from the ladies out front, to the waiters and bus boys. The inside is lively and trendy and it just has that fun atmosphere when you can sit for a long time,  drink and hang out.\n\nOf everything we ordered, the beet salad and my beef wellington were the standout items. In fact the beef welly was amazing. Toffee pudding? Amazing. Fingerling potatoes? not amazing. Fried green beans? Not amazing. The french coffee with chocolate spoons? - Very awesome. Lick-the-spoon-clean awesome.\n\nYou even get to see the Hell's Kitchen winner Chef Christina doing her thing.\n\nWhat I don't get is how a restaurant of this quality can't throw together a vegetarian meal on the fly. Yes yes i know, steak house, vegetarian, mind blown, i get it.\n\nIf this was applebees and they told me they can't do sushi? Fine, my expectations are low to begin with. When you're going to a place with a chef that can cook while being called a donkey and a muppet on national television, I expect them to be able to throw together a decent vegetarian dish. The vegetarian risotto that my gf received was basically not great. I tried it. It was left there half eaten. I've been to very few high end restaurants that couldn't do a good alternative for the non meat eaters.\n\nThe meats that came out were amazing. The non meat stuff was just alright."

Our waiter was snooty and condescending.  Fortunately the food made up for it.\n\nI would not recommend the $30/ounce fillet.  Although buttery and melt-in-your-mouth exquisite, not worth $90 for the tiniest steak on the planet."

S"I decided to become a pescatarian for Lent so I went here on a whim to treat myself. Go big or go home, right? \n\nI ordered the beef wellington, of course. It was delicious. Cooked perfectly in my opinion. I don't like overly seasoned steak. I feel that if it's cooked right, the taste of the meat shouldn't be covered in sauces and seasoning. The couple of potato and carrot pieces that came with the plate were firmer than I'd had before. I didn't think I'd like that, but it was a pleasant surprise. I got the mushrooms on the side, which were a bit of a disappointment to me. I don't know if it was the mushrooms themselves, or the sauce used to cook them in, but something tasted both too earthy and fishy at the same time. Weird description, I know. I'm sorry, I don't know how else to describe them.\n\nThey provided me with a plate of a variety of little breads to try. The one with bacon was my favorite, of course!\n\nAll in all, it was a nice experience. Went on a Tuesday evening, no reservations, so I sat in the bar/lounge area. Totally fine with this, as it was nearly empty, and I liked being pretty much alone. As people started flowing in, I was on my way out. Perfect! The only thing I didn't like, was that the music was so darn loud in there. I'm getting old. Loud music belongs in a handful of places: clubs, concerts, parties. Not restaurants or mall shops. Maybe I'm just an old grump. I have no idea if the dining room area is a little quieter. Hope so, or I don't know how you'd hear your date. But then, if you don't want to...\n\nService was excellent. Loved my servers."

S'Oh ribeye cap...\n\nWhere have you been all my life?! I know, I know. You\'ve been there for me the whole time. But like a jerk, I never knew you existed on your own, separate from my now-former favorite cut of meat: the ribeye. You\'ve always been my favorite part of the cow, but I never knew it was possible to have you and only you...Gordon Ramsay Steak made a dream (I never knew I had) come true. The fact that they offer this piece of meat is worth the 5 stars alone. Google it. You know you want to...\n\nAnother 5 star item? The sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream. Not only is the presentation clever (the brown butter ice cream was served as a "stick of butter"), but the flavor lives beyond the looks and the hype. My friends and I agreed: we\'re willing to brave the Strip traffic and casino smoke to sit at the bar here, have some Rince Cochon on tap and some sticky toffee pudding.\n\nOther notables:\n-the variety of the menu- it is a steakhouse, but if you feel the need to veer from their specialty, they have several seafood and other meat options. My friend got the Fisherman\'s Grill, a sampling of seafood that includes shrimp, salmon, mussels, lobster and perfectly cooked scallops.\n-beef wellington - how can you visit a steakhouse envisioned by a British chef and not experience tender bites of beef wrapped within puff pastry that\'s not even soggy on the bottom!'

Not a big deal.\nWe both got strong drinks, very well prepared.  The bread assortment was very  nice.  I had the Beef Wellington.  OMG, I am still dreaming of this dish!  It was perfect to the last bite.  My husband had the short ribs and he said they were very good as well.\nWe wanted to try a dessert but didn't have room.  But we will next time we go in May.

S"This restaurant review is way past due. Before Gordon Ramsay Steak opened to the public I was fortunate to receive an invite to a preview dinner. Prior to be seated, we had a drink in the lounge. The cocktail menu seemed extensive, but I am more of beer girl and lucky for me they had a nice selection of beers too.\n\nShortly, thereafter, we were seated in the dining room on the main floor. Our waiter was kind and eager to answer our questions. He assisted us in choosing wine for our meal a riesling for me and a malbec for him. We started with a yummy variety of breads - the one with pancetta was a real winner - and then moved onto the sliders, which were a big disappointment. We also had yellowtail tuna which was fantastic! I loved the fresh clean flavors. \n\nNext, the main course was presented. The halibut was nicely prepared but failed to leave an impression. I have had better for much less. The New York strip on the other hand was very good. It was nicely seasoned with a beautiful crust. We added on crab and it was terrible. I actually questioned if it was imitation crab. Fortunately, the side of pureed potatoes were positively scrumptious and the crummy crab became a distant memory.\n\nDessert followed, we were given a treat of chocolate spoons to accompany our french press coffee while we waited for our tea trifle. The spoons were filled with alcohol, it's not something I enjoyed, but I appreciated the playful twist. The coffee was a lovely blend, I did enjoy that very much. The tea trifle, however, was a complete failure. We told our waiter as much as well. The ice cream on the side was very good, but the trifle was dry and bland. Just terrible.\n\nThe restaurant is comfortable, the staff was friendly and the meal itself was hit and miss. Our tab was comped, but totaled $300. In no way was our experience worthy of three hundred dollars. At that price point, the entire meal had better be stellar."

S'Came here on a Monday night. The atmosphere is nice and the service was excellent. We ordered the Foie Gras appetizer which was very good. We ordered the Bone-In Rib Eye 24 oz Steak which was huge and cooked perfectly. We got the bone marrow as a side which complemented the steak well.\n\nI ordered the beef wellington but it lacked seasoning which was a little disappointing. There is a lot of hype about this dish, especially with the price and time required for its preparation, but I did not want to finish the second half of it. \n\nWe ordered creamed spinach on the side which tasted okay. I hate to mention this because this is a really nice establishment, but we later found a 2" piece of plastic wrapper buried in it when finishing the rest of our meal in the hotel room. We don\'t normally treat ourselves to a fine meal but the night that we did, did not impress us.'

S"Well. We all know who Gordon Ramsey is, right? Best restaurant owner in the business... maybe? \n\nThe food was good. For what it is worth, I was truly expecting more. I am from the NYC -Philly area so I know good food.. and maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought the food was super mediocre. The bread was off the hook, but my chicken was relatively bland. I also got the kobe beef sliders and they were delicious. My husband got a $50 steak and they gave him the crappiest knife ever. Seriously, you could have the perfect steak, but with a crappy knife you can't really enjoy it. Sounds weird until you go to some locations that allow you to choose the knife.\n\nAs a business owner I was super attentive to the staff and cleanliness. The restaurant was spotless. So clean. The staff... well lets split that up. The front desk staff consisted of 5 girls and they were pretty worthless as far as help goes. We had a reservation made two weeks in advance and we were sat about 25 minutes late which is a shame, but can be forgiven. The girls just seemed to stand there with no clue about much and a snobby attitude. \n\nOnce we got seated I was impressed with the structure that was created for all of the waiters and waitresses to follow. I couldn't believe how they were so well trained and maintained their professionalism [even when we told our waiter he could relax because we aren't stuffy at all and were just there to relax]. So I would love to talk to Gordon about his curriculum for that!\n\nOther negative - It was extremely cold and extremely loud in there.\n\nSo, 3 stars I think is a fair rating for this high end restaurant!"

I really wanted to try the famous Beef Wellington, but was a tad disappointed to hear that it automatically is medium to medium rare, unfortunately, I like medium well, but the NY steak did not disappoint!!  and the ribeye was to die for!  Our waiter was so nice, he even pointed out Gordon sitting at a table downstairs, I would have gone down to meet him, but he was already getting ready to leave, so I missed that. I completely recommend this awesome restaurant!"

S"I came to Gordan Ramsay's Steak with a group of friends last night. We all concluded that it was absolutely nothing special at all and 4 out of 6 people in our party did not care for their steak at all. The flavoring in the steaks were completely absent and there was just nothing special at all about the food. I will say the tartare and the Sea Bass my friend had was very good but that was really the only thing anyone in our party liked. The service was also nothing special which you would expect out of a steakhouse labelled as $$$$ on Yelp. Lastly, the restaurant is extremely loud. I'm not exaggerating when I say that you have to shout when communicating with people at your table. I won't be coming back and I will not recommend this place to anyone. Again, just nothing special at all and it was actually pretty pricey at $250 per couple."

S"WOW, WHAT A MEAL THIS WAS!\nMy friend and I came here with high expectations after reading the many yelp reviews and salivating at all the pictures of the food online. \n\nWe made a reservation for 8:30 and only had to wait 5 minutes before we were promptly seated. Our server quickly introduced himself and the menu. Before we knew it, we came face-to-face with the  mesmerizing steak cart. As good as all the cuts of meat looked on the cart, my friend and I came here for one thing only: THE BEEF WELLINGTON!\n\nI ordered the single serving beef wellington and Mac & Cheese while my buddy ordered the single serving beef wellington and Chorizo stuffed Maine Lobster in brandied lobster cream sauce. Expect 45 minutes for them to make your beef wellington, as it must be cooked perfectly. While we waited, there was so much in the restaurant to look at. The wine bar, the cute hostesses, the gordon ramsay object in the ceiling and the kitchen. The whole presentation of the restaurant was just very welcoming and fancy hipster looking. Service was very good too, I feel unfortunate for the yelp-ers who complained about lack of service.\n\ngrading of our food:\n\nMaine Lobster in cream sauce: A. Friend said it was good, but it wasn't anything you can't find in your local high end steakhouse. \n\nMac & Cheese: B-. The texture and sauce of the dish was dry and didn't quite tantalize my palate. \n\nBeef Wellington: A+. Gordon Ramsay, you got me! Flake was crusty, the beef was \ncooked perfectly and easy to cut. I loved the mash glaze and vegetables it accompanied with. By the time we finished half of the beef wellington, we were so full already.\n\nthe bread: A+. I forget the names of these free bread plates they gave out, but they were phenomenal. I am pretty sure my friend and I went through 3 plates.\n\nBy the time we finished our meal and paid our $180 bill, we were absolutely full. We struggled to walk out of Le Paris, onto the Las Vegas Blvd. My friend and I (both athletes) had to sit down on a bench for a few minutes to rest from that absolute beast of a meal. That's how good GR STEAk IS!\n\nMy only quirk with GR Steak? This is a high end establishment, as least the prices certainly show...where are the white table cloths that usually accompany high end steakhouses?"

S'OVERVIEW: I went back and forth debating if I wanted to spend the money at GR Steak and figured I\'d check this off my food bucketlist. Although service is amazing, it\'s pretty pricey and the food was good but not mind shattering.  Came out to a lil over $250 w/tip for the two of us. Would come back only for the dessert!\n\nLOCATION: Inside the Paris Casino. It has a huge "Gordan Ramsay Steak" sign so you can\'t miss it. If you\'re walking in from the Bally\'s walkway, it\'s to the right once you hit the casino. If you\'re coming in from the Eiffel Tower entrance from the strip, walk all the way to the back of the casino and it\'s on your left. \n\nRESERVATIONS: We booked on Thurs at 10pm. We got there a little early around 9:30 to see if they could get us in and were told the table will be ready at 10pm but we were welcome to stay at the bar. No biggie. We decided to walk around and gamble a bit and came back at 10pm. \n\nSEATING: Once we got in, our hostess told us the lights above mimic Gordan\'s hand movements as he makes the beef wellington. Cool? The lighting explains why most of the photos on yelp suck. The red lights give everything a dark red color to photos but using flash is too bright and distracting. \n\nSERVICE: AMAZING!  When I made the reservations, I made a comment it was my bday and everyone from the hostess to our waiters all wished me a happy bday :) (no freebies but still nice) Great that they actually read those comments! Both my bf and I were kind of fish out of water, a bit awk because we normally don\'t go to "fancy" restaurants. It was a bit overwhelming for us because it seemed like we had a couple servers. But the waiters were not snooty at all and nice! Heads up, they will come by and wipe down the table to keep it clean between each food course. I thought we were just super messy but they seemed to do that to most tables. Also just like on Hell\'s Kitchen, they served our entrees and side dish all at the same time. This is why we had multiple servers so they could have two people serve at the same exact time. \n\nFOOD:\nBread: Comp bread. Sadly, I wasn\'t as in love with the bread as my fellow yelpers. There was variety of diff kinds and we actually didn\'t finish it. The butter was actually kind of hard so it was difficult to spread. \nDrinks: HK Antioxidant - it was good; very refreshing\nAppetizer: Half Dozen Oysters. These came 3 diff types (2 of each kind pre-seasoned)  2 types were East Coast and 1 was West Coast.  It was the first time I had oysters and they were SO good. They also came with a tiny bottle of Tabasco and side sauces. OMG it was so good and fresh! \nMain course: BEEF WELLINGTON FOR 1 - I was confused on yelp by the photos; some showed 1 piece and others showed 2 pieces. Mine did come with 2 pieces. I gave one to my bf and he gave me half of his AMERICAN RIB CAP. \nThe beef wellington was honestly a bit clumsy to eat but the beef was SO tender, juicy and perfectly medium rare. I personally thought the meat itself was a little under-seasoned but it was pretty good. The puff pastry on top was perfect! The potato puree was more just a decoration, literally a couple of bites if you scrape it together. Vegetables were ok, they were strangely sweet and just a couple bites as well.   \nAmerican Rib Cap- just comes as is. We were both a bit disappointed as it was tougher than we both had thought. It was ok but nothing amazing. We both preferred the wellington :)\nSide: Mac & Cheese - there are so many rave reviews about this mac& cheese on yelp but neither of us liked it :( It was bit cold when we got it and it was too dense and flavors didn\'t go well w/our meats. \n\nDESSERT: Sticky Toffee Pudding- don\'t miss out! This dessert itself deserves a 5 star. I was worried about it being a "date cake" but doesn\'t take like it! Perfect sweetness w/the icecream together. Perfect dessert to share for 2. \n\n\nTIPS AND SUCH:\nThe wellington did take about 45 mins and they will time all the food to get to your table at the same time so unfortunately everyone else will wait on yours ;) It\'s not too bad since you\'ll get bread but plan on getting an app too. \n\nThey have a Total Rewards pricing, so make sure you to bring your card. We weren\'t staying at Paris but it looked like you could charge to your room if you are. If you don\'t have a TR card, get one for free at any TR hotel; Bally\'s and Paris both have a counter.\n\nDRINK MENU:\nhttp://www.parislasvegas.com/content/dam/plv/Dining/Upscale/gordon%20ramsay/Gordon%20Ramsay/Paris-Las%20Vegas-Dining-Upscale-gordon-ramsay-Gordon%20Ramsay-Bar-7-2014.pdf\n\nDINNER MENU:\nhttp://www.parislasvegas.com/content/dam/plv/Dining/Upscale/gordon%20ramsay/Gordon%20Ramsay/Paris-Las%20Vegas-Dining-Upscale-gordon-ramsay-Gordon%20Ramsay-Dinner-7-2014.pdf\n\nDESSERT MENU:\nhttp://www.parislasvegas.com/content/dam/plv/Dining/Upscale/gordon%20ramsay/2014_Spring_Dessert_'

S"Okay so EXCELLENT service and they actually let us sit upstairs this time. CL and I came here for the foie gras because the last time we were there, it was a big piece for each of us. This time it definitely shrank! It was still good. It was just about half the size? The server wanted to explain to us about all the parts of the cow but we heard it all the last time I was there.  We told him he didn't need to push the beef cart and waste his breath telling us about it. He tried to sell us on the tasting menu but us, knowing that we went there just for the foie gras said NO! I already knew what I wanted. CL had to read the menu. So I ordered the beet salad which was delightful and almost too pretty to eat. Also the foie gras appetizer which had two little buns in it filled with cream cheese. For my main course I had the shortribs which was SO good. OMG! The meat was so tender and juicy! CL had the foie gras that came with his medium cooked ribeye steak and the pot de creme. The ribeye was cooked to perfection. You do get a discount if you give them your total rewards card but no free desserts on your birthday. We asked for both sparkling water and still water. They weren't smart enough to leave the still water for me but instead I had to keep putting my glass out so that they could see it was empty.  Finally towards the end, the busser left the glass of still water for me."

S"Party of 4 on a Monday evening.  Busy but not too crazy.  Like the open kitchen layout.\n\nI went in knowing exactly what I wanted --- the famous beef wellington.  It takes 45 minutes to prepare.  I asked if I could order that as soon as we got seated, but the server told us that the chefs request everything ordered together.  \n\nThe server brings by raw samples of all the cuts, which is quite impressive.\n\nStarted off with some bread, which was delicious.  Warm, crispy, a couple of different varieties --- personal fav was the one with pancetta baked in.\n\nStarted off with the pork belly appetizer, which was phenomenal.   For our group, we each probably got 1.5 bites, so it's not a huge portion, but sufficient for a taste.\n\nThen we got our steaks.  No complaints from anyone.  The wellington was amazing ---  filet mignon medium rare inside that incredible pastry crust.  I watched a bunch of Youtube clips on how Ramsay makes it, and I almost expected to be disappointed given my insanely high expectations.  Nope.  Surpassed it.  Every bite was moist and flavorful (and again, it's filet mignon, which often has no taste if not done right).\n\nWe were way too full for dessert.  Fantastic meal, great location, friendly servers.  Probably a lifetime top 3 steak for me."

S"This is one of those places where they take care of everything to the last detail to make sure that you enjoy the experience and stuff is not left to chance. No way you can get a reservation on a Saturday night but we came in and sat at the bar area which has a lot of room, and a lot of tables. Our high table had a better position or view than some of the tables near the kitchen, so unless you can make a reservation upstairs I would say you can get a great table at the bar almost any time. The waitress was impeccable, she had all the answers and the way she managed everything was outstanding. They get great training I believe, because when I wanted to try some cider beer (the drinks menu is on an iPad by the way) she explained why it looks so much like cider and not so much like beer. She also said they tried all the drinks in training and this one gave her the most buzz. We got the Gnocchi, Wellington steak and a file, all super great. We didn't like the Fois Gras, too fat for my taste, but at $25 a plate I'm pretty sure most people love it! The spinach and mushroom sides were delicious and so is the starting bread they serve, it's actually different pastries. We just couldn't try any dessert since we were absolutely full after 2 days in Vegas, but the ones we saw at the other tables looked fantastic. The whole d\xc3\xa9cor and light is carefully thought out and also the sound, there is loud music in the background but not intrusive when you talk at the table, you can hear everyone just fine and there is no need for yelling. It's the perfect place to have a great time and an awesome experience together with great food."

S"Marvelous.\n\nI came here with a pastry chef colleague of mine who used to work with the (now) GM, so we didn't even have to order. We simply sat down and the kitchen just started sending course after course. Of my amazing food coma, the stand-outs for me were the beef wellington and the creamed corn side. We had various small bites brought to us, so I don't think they were on-menu, but presentation was exquisite and service was excellent.\n\nMy favorite part of the entire meal was dessert: a delicious cake with brown butter ice cream. My pastry chef friend told me the secret to the cake was the use of pureed sweet figs in the batter...genius. It was moist, fluffy and memorable. Paired with the ice cream, it was a 5-star dessert for me.\n\nThe atmosphere is loud and nearly club-like. I wasn't there on a romantic outing so I enjoyed the vibe. I am definitely looking forward to coming back to enjoy the bar and more of that dessert!"

S"We just came here last week on the Vegas part of our honeymoon.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of not making reservations in advance and there weren't any tables left for the last couple of nights we would be there.  We couldn't leave Vegas without eating here so we opted to eat in the lounge/bar area which was still a nice atmosphere and provided us with a slightly more snug, but comfortable table after letting a few people pass us in line.  The only downside was the wait of 1hr+ to be seated, but it was barely noticed since we were enjoying watching Christine in the kitchen.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Chianti from the Ipad cocktail menu.  The prices were very reasonable and they provide a great selection of bottles from average to premium.  Since we were advised that we would be waiting at least 45 minutes for our entrees, we decided to order a couple of cocktails to start.  The Ipad came in very handy since it provided images as well as ingredient lists for each drink.  My wife ordered a Mojito, which wasn't on the menu and it was far too sweet for both of our palates.  I ordered an English Garden, which was an excellent cocktail containing Hendrick's, basil, lemon, cucumber.  It was definitely the best use of gin that I have ever experienced in a drink.\n\nOur meal started with a bread basket containing about 5 different varieties of bread.  The most notable were the 2 brioche, but the one containing pancetta specifically stood out.  We then followed up with an order of Short Rib Tortellini with foie gras, which was so good that my wife and I are still talking about it. \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the bone-in strip loin with a bone marrow sauce and my wife ordered Gordon's acclaimed Beef Wellington, also the reason for our 45 minute wait which was well worth it.  My strip was cooked perfectly and was defintely one of the best steaks that I have ever had.  The bone marrow sauce was rich and added a lot of flavour, although I found if too much was used it overpowered the meat.  My wife's Beef Wellington was phenomenal; it was a beautifully tender piece of meat that could almost be cut with a fork alone surrounding by a perfect amount of light pastry.\n\nEven though we were both feeling fairly full at this point, we couldn't leave without trying Gordon's highly-renowned Sticky Toffee Pudding.  It was one of the most decadent desserts that either of us have ever tried.  The Brown Butter Ice Cream that it was served with could have stood up on it's own as a phenomenal dessert, but complimented the pudding perfectly.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend going to Gordon Ramsay Steak if you're in Vegas.  I know that any of our visits in future will include a dinner here, as well as reservations made well in advance."

S"This restaurant blew me away!  Everything was presented well and tasted just as amazing.  Being a Masterchef fan, I had to come to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and experience what he is all about.  I saw the kids on Masterchef Junior cook the famous beef wellington and had to have me some myself.  I immediately booked a reservation for my family on Thanksgiving.  A holiday will gave me a justified reason to be completely gluttonous and gorge to the max.\n\nFirst off, Steak is located in the Paris hotel.  Just look for the big red sign.  At the hostess desk you will check in, and grab some cool matches :)  You are then seated in the bar to wait for your table.  We were then escorted upstairs to a cool booth with a great view over the entire restaurant.  \n\nWhen you are ordering the waiter will bring over a table with every cut of steak they serve and describe the marbling, texture, and flavor of each piece. \n\nThe bread plate is pretty darn good!  The two flavors of the pinwheel rolls (truffle and fig + bacon) are both amazing.  It is like a savory pastry that melts in your mouth.  The other breads were good as well, but the pinwheels are the winners.  The butter is served with black volcanic salt which adds a nice smoky saltiness to the butter.\n\nI got the Beef Wellington which is served rare-medium rare (this cannot be changed due to the way that it is cooked).  The Wellington was so soft and juicy I was in love.  The truffle and prosciutto around the filet mignon was tasty and the pastry around was super buttery and flaky.  So good.\n\nMy brother got the short rib which fell completely off the bone.  My parents shared a rib eye because they both have hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and heart issues that they don't want to die of.  The rib eye was sufficient for both of them to share.  The restaurant even cut it into slices to make sharing easier for them.  \n\nFor the sides we all shared the macaroni and cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and fully loaded baked potato.  The sauteed mushrooms had a nice woodsy feel to it and the mac and cheese was great.  It has blue cheese in it, which surprisingly did not overpower the dish.\n\nFor dessert we shared 2 sticky toffee cakes!   I would have devoured it faster if I wasn't so fully of steak.  This is their most popular dessert and I can see why.  They pour the toffee sauce right over the cake when it comes to the table.  The cake itself is light and fluffy and the sauce is just heaven.  The salted caramel ice cream comes in a rectangle form, so it looks like a stick of butter.  It was a little bit salty for me and I would have preferred straight vanilla ice cream instead but it was all good overall.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to spend a lot on a good steak dinner.  The quality of the food matches the price.  It was definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas so far. \n\nNotes:\n- Use your Total Rewards card to get a few bucks off everything you order.\n- Make a reservation.\n- Enjoy everrrythangg!"

S"I got a dinner/show package for Gordon Ramsay Steak and Jersey Boys at a discounted locals' price.  Last night was the night and both were excellent!  I am one of those people who dislikes the public persona of Gordon Ramsay.  I'm not sure I would have come here last night but it was one of the food options and I grabbed for the ring and I got the gold one.\n\nI had a few choices from their menu for each course but it was easy for me to order.  For an appetizer, the British ale onion soup.  For the main course, I chose the 24 ounce bone in rib eye.  And for dessert I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I did not order a side, an extra charge, since I would be eating approximately a pound of beef alone.  \n\nI had a reservation for 5 PM and arrived shortly before.  A hostess asked me to wait in the lounge area and assured me I'd be shown to my table soon and I was.  Another hostess asked me if I wanted to walk the stairs or take the elevator.  The stairs it was.  She seated me at a small table along the railing which gave me a nice view of the downstairs dining area and a  view of the ceiling with the Union Jack and the neon sculpture.  Coming up the stairs, she explained that the neon was an artist's conception of the movement Ramsay's hands make when he's creating a beef Wellington.  It is very interesting very different.\n\nRichard, one of my servers, brought me their drink iPad.  I politely passed and went with an iced tea.  They only serve bottled iced tea, Republic of Tea, and I was given a choice of three flavors.  The blackberry sage was my choice, a tea I often make at home.  \n\nI gave Richard my voucher for dinner and a few moments later, he brought the Ramsay menu and told me my choices for each of the courses.  I ordered the soup and steak first and waited until later to order dessert.\n\nSome bread was brought to my table and the selection was so different than normal.  There were two lemon thyme focaccia squares, one mushroom truffle mini brioche, a pancetta fig mini brioche, and two slices of Stilton walnut baguette.  On the side of the bread plate was a round of English Devonshire butter with Hawaiian volcanic sea salt sprinkled on top.  Yes!  A restaurant that doesn't hide the salt from you.  I did observe a woman at the next table trying to get some butter without getting a single salt crystal so I understand both sides.  The bread was excellent.  I had one slice of the baguette and one mini brioche--the mushroom truffle.  I knew there was a large steak coming and I wanted to leave room.\n\nThe onion soup was excellent.  I had some of that soup at Ramsay's Pub at Caesars so I knew what to expect.  Rich broth, tasty caramelized onions, and the two slices of Welsh rarebit on top made for a very good start.\n\nThen a runner brought my steak and it was indeed huge!  It had a Demi-glace with mustard seeds.  The steak was done extra rare as I requested.  It was marbled very nicely and it was very tender.  I sat their thinking I must be some kind of glutton as I kept eating and eating until I was almost completely to the bone.  At home, I would have gnawed on it like a dog, but I let my better manners take over last night.  After bringing me the steak, Carlos, my other server, asked if I wanted any salt or pepper.  He appeared a but later with a plate with two containers--one with ground pepper and the other with sea salt!  A second Yes!\n\nLater, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I also had this at Caesars. I wanted to compare it to some STP I had the week before at another steakhouse on the Strip.  There is no comparison.  Ramsay's version wins hands down.  It's a moist pudding cake served with toffee in a metal pourer and a stick of brown butter ice cream.  Delicious!\n\nA note on service.  Richard and Carlos were first rate!  They were polite and friendly.  An above and beyond kind of thing happened when I asked Carlos about the types of bread.  He went to the kitchen, got a sheet of paper, and wrote out what they served.  That was really nice of him and it helped me remember the different things on the plate.  At the end of dinner, Richard gave me a business card with their two names on it and I'll keep it for the future because I will be back.  I have to try some more things on the menu.\n\nBy the way, Mr. Ramsay, I may change my thoughts about you a bit.  I understand that you're public persona is somewhat of a show for TV and that you're much different--read nicer--when not before the cameras in Hell's Kitchen!"

S'I really wanted to like Gordon Ramsey Steak.  I went in with high expectations, but left slightly disappointed.  I sat at the bar and ate, as I was traveling for work.  The bartenders were all quite nice, and pleasant.  My order was simple.  A glass of Shiraz, the house salad, and the Beef Wellington.\n\nThe Shiraz was fine.  A good pour by the bartender.  Nothing amazing, but it was good.\n\nThe bread was good.  It was a good start to the meal.  There was a mushroom bread, and olive bread, and one that I couldn\'t understand.  I actually asked the server to repeat what type of bread it was, but I still didn\'t get it.\n\nThe Salad was underwhelming.  It had way too much dressing on it, and the the flavors were mediocre.  The lettuce was a bit soggy.\n\nWhat I was expecting to be the star of the meal, The Beef Wellington, was just OK.  The beef was good, but the breading on it didn\'t do anything special for me.  I felt as though the potatoes and the veggies could have been a little bit more plentiful on the plate.  It was good.  Just not Amazing.\n\nAll in all, I would give the restaurant a 3.5 star rating.  However, one of my rules is that if nobody says "goodbye" when i leave, I take off .5 stars.  It is not a very difficult task, and should be a focus of all good restaurants.  In fact, when i left, there were 4 (yes FOUR) Hostesses standing out front.  Not one of them said "thank you" or "goodbye" to me.  It may be worth a try if you exhausted the other steak places in Vegas.  I may go back next time and try a regular steak instead.  However, for now, I\'ll say that Gordon Ramesy continues to disappoint me (Pub, Burger place, and now Steak).  Maybe i just need to lower my expectations....'

S'Oh boy. You expect to get great service and even better food from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, right? Our service was sub-par. We waited extremely long for a menu, then even longer for our order to be taken. We asked to be served bread since we were quite hungry from waiting, and I could see the waiter roll his eyes. Meanwhile a gentleman sits next to us and chats with the waiter about the menu. 60 seconds after that conversation a server walks up and begins to drop the bread at the table next to us, and I noticed the waiter motion to our table so we did finally get the bread. We started to notice that this person next to us was getting attentive and fast service when it struck me that he was a food/restaurant critic as he was taking notes on his phone after each conversation and bite of food. Professional or amateur I\'m not sure, but he was given noticeably better service than any other table around.\nThe variety of bread was nice and included 2 types of brioche. We ordered sliders as an appetizer, which were pretty good. The main course: I ordered a special they had that night which was the "eye" of the ribeye, rare. He ordered the full ribeye, medium well and we ordered a baked potato to share (all sides are to be added on and are enough to share). My "rare" steak was medium and so was his "medium-well" ...I guess they just evened it out. The baked potato looked as though it had been sitting because the sauce on top had developed the film that warm dairy does after sitting. The steaks were tasty- can\'t say anything negative about the quality of the meat, and the skins of the potato were seasoned and delicious. I enjoyed that they bring around a "meat tray" that is like a dessert tray, except with all the cuts of steak offered. Can\'t say I would return next time I\'m in Vegas, nor do I think I would recommend to friends.'

S"+ The Drifter: Bourbon, notes of ginger, bitters, just wonderful~ My hands were too small to hold the massive glass it was served in, but with a drink this tasty, you make it work!\n+ Beef Wellington: Muy delicioso. Not much I can say about this that hasn't already been said. It was my first time having a wellington of any sort, so I was worried it would come dry (how they cook the meat and the pastry perfectly together is beyond my realm of understanding), but my concerns quickly melted away with each wonderful bite. You're warned that it takes 45 minutes to come out, but I don't think we waited more than 15 minutes. \n+ Kobe Rib Cap: Ohhhhhhhh wow. I had no idea what a rib cap was until the server explained it. Imagine a ribeye. You've got that massive chunk of meat, sometimes with a bone attached. On the perimeter opposite of the bone, you've got the rib cap in all its buttery, tender glory. Loved this!! The server recommended the bone marrow sauce to go along with it. Honestly, it would've been perfectly fine on its own, but the sauce was delicious and decadent addition to every bite. \n\nThe Brussel sprouts and Mushrooms we got to accompany the meal were good, but got too salty to finish at the end. \n\nI'm always a little worried about celebrity restaurants because I can certainly see the quality of food deteriorating over time simply since their name has gotten so big and less attention is paid to the food. Thankfully, that's not the case with Gordon Ramsay Steak!"

We would always have a ritual of going to The Nine Steakhouse during every Vegas trip, but decided to try a different place for once.  \n\nThe standards in this restaurant can be seen everywhere.  The freshness of the food and the quality of the steaks were out of this world!  I had the kobe steak and my wife had the Wellington and we were both speechless on how delicious everything was.  \n\nDefinitely get the toffee pudding for dessert, even if you feel too full!

S"I wasn't sure if there were cameras around, because it felt like I was in Hell's Kitchen. We ordered the pork belly, poached lobster, smoked beef tartar, all were delicious. First course, market salad and English chowder, not impressed. Second course, 24 oz rib chop, 18 oz NY strip and chicken with tikki masala spices, all unpleasant. Third course, sticky pudding, some cheese cake, these were good. \n\nHere comes the worst part, we ordered drinks all specialty cocktails, before we can say anything else our server bolted. A busser quickly gave our waters and breads, cocktails come in 15 min, apps next 15, at this point we have finished apps, drinks and half the bread plate, main course 1 hour 48 min after cocktails were served, dessert took another 33 min after we were done. We didn't even finish our main course we were so full from waiting. We had to ask server where are food was and all he said was it comes out when done, WHAT? But i see the manager on duty coming out the back, mouth full of food and didn't even come by to see how we were. Clearly we looked frustrated with our hands to our heads or face looking very disturbed.\n\nI know this business well, and understand it can be busy or kitchen maybe overwhelmed but to have managers and servers like we had was an epic fail for this place. I have booked a group here and they were so happy with everything. We just happen to be there when the drop out staff were working.\n\nIm so disgusted and upset that i don't even want to bring any business here anymore. Go to Stripsteak instead!"

S'Friday night 8:00 reservation for 4 Nov 7th.\nMy new favorite Martini olive!  Blue cheese, onion and bacon! Yum!\nOur dinner waiter was awful.  \nFirst thing he asked was do you want drinks and since we all had drinks I said we don\'t want drinks. He handed me an IPad and I started looking for the dinner menu.. I ask where on the menu is the dinner menu and he tells me that the tablet is the drink menu.\nHe brings out the paper menu and I order two orders of bone marrow apps. he then tells me they don\'t have bone marrow apps and they have always been on the accompaniment menu. Then he tells me he can serve them as apps..\nI guess he wanted to show how knowledgeable he was.. whatever.\nAnyway, I request fresh brioche to come out with the marrow. The brioche come out (cold) and ten minutes later the marrow comes out. \nIt comes time to order and I ask for the fattest rib-eye. He asked how I wanted it and I said 118 degree center. He looked at me like I was on Mars. Since he seemed confused and not happy with my precision, I said between rare and medium rare. He was not happy with that either and corrected me with "rare plus?". Sure.\nMy friend requested mayonnaise with the Asparagus side and the server said they didn\'t offer mayonnaise and he would like whatever sauce it was served with (my words).\nMy steak comes out at about 90 degree center.. full on rare.  Fluck. At this point I really don\'t care for this guy. Four minutes later he comes by to check and I tell him my steak is way too rare. He starts to explain about how steaks are prepared and I cut him off and tell him to stop talking and the next time I see him he should have my steak in his hand and done right.\nIt came back just fine but would have been better if it didn\'t have to be fired twice.\nWhen the steak came back i asked the servers assistant for some mayo and he offered up some aioli with professionalism. \nOn to the food.\nThe bone marrow apps didn\'t have a lot of marrow in them. The last three times we were here they were done the way I do them. First pick the bones that are full and set aside the less full ones. These were the bones I would have tossed.\nThey were tasty, just not enough marrow. I only ordered two servings based on the size of the servings the last three times.\nThe Asparagus and Okra sides needed a bit more seasoning.\nMy friends rib-eye was perfect as well as the two beef wellingtons.'

S'The biggest complaint I have with this place is getting a reservation.  They don\'t do online reservations b/c they apparently don\'t know it\'s 2012. So you have to call. AND you can\'t just call Paris, you have to call the restaurant, and it\'s not like the restaurant every picks up the phone..other BIG issue you will get hard busy signals like you used to do in the 1990\'s. No kidding. You can\'t even get through.\n\nFood is exceptional, amazing steak, the fingerling potatoes which typically are super boring are phenomenal [meat and potatoes!!!!! makes this girl happy!]\n\nI talked my dinner date into the tomato and pickle dressing salad, he was VERY skeptical, looked at me like I was crazy...so we shared it. After his first bite he said "can we order another one?" made me laugh!  That\'s my favorite thing there so try it- you will surprise yourself that tomatoes and pickles can be so AMAZING.\n\nI still say this is one of the top 3 steaks I\'ve ever eaten across the country. \n\nThey lost a star b/c of the reservation debacles.'

S"WOW......\n\nAll I have to say is this is probably the best steakhouse I've been to so far. I am a huge ribeye & porterhouse fan but everyone said Gordon Ramsey is known for the beef wellington so I decided to give it a shot even though I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms or mustard on my steak.\n\nThe wait staff was very attentive and friendly. They came out with a variety of breads that was pretty decent and different from the standard hot rolls or pretzel breads they serve to you now. My wife ordered his signature chicken and we shared a side of Mac & cheese. \n\nWhen the wellington came out it was cooked perfectly med-rare and the first bite was FANTASTIC. With all the flavor you wouldn't have known you were eating a filet. My wife who isn't a fan of steak or red meat loved it as well. The Mac and cheese was pretty good and her chicken dish was very moist, flavorful and juicy. \n\nFor dessert they are known for their sticky toffee pudding, which happens to be her favorite as well and she thought this was the best thing ever. I wasn't a huge fan of it and think the Monkey Bread served at Craftsteak is hands down the best dessert in a steakhouse. \n\nPrior to coming here SW was #1 on my list in vegas but this is definitely better and we will be back next week."

S'It could have been a great experience...but service totally ruined our "good experience". So why a 4 star? Because the food was still great, just service was... ugh. You would expect much more from a place like this. So when you come in, they only give you the drink menu to order, then 15 minutes come to get your drink order. Then 15 minutes later they give you the regular menu. 10 minutes later then come to get your order, and if you don\'t get an appetizer, the waiter "frowns" upon you and would tell you this "well your entrees are going to take longer to come out because you\'re not ordering a appetizer" That doesn\'t make sense? Because if we order appetizers, wouldn\'t it take even longer for our entrees to come out? I think he thought we were cheap, and that was not the case. \n\nWe ordered beers, and didn\'t want appetizers because we didn\'t want to get full. We didn\'t even touch the bread. We know with steak places like this, the steak is huge and appetizers would make us even more full. We also order 2 sides (potatoes & mac n cheese) and the waiter was like "you would usually order 3. We felt like he was trying to up sale on everything and gave us an attitude when we didn\'t take his recommendations. I felt he thought we were cheap and didn\'t want to order a lot. FYI, we had a show to attend and couldn\'t waste our time on food we didn\'t eat. Ugh, it\'s service like this! Vegas nobody gives you good service because they will always have people coming, but geez, this guy man... we gave him more than 20% tip too. He doesn\'t deserve it! \n\nThe steak was good. I shared a porterhouse for 2 with my bf, the filet melted in your mouth. Good filet part. The NY strip part was good, wasn\'t the best, but it was good. Not the best steakhouse I\'ve been too (probably service turned us off a bit too) Sides were great though, the mac and cheese was sooo good. \n\nWe made reservations a month in advance. We still love Gordon Ramsay. Just be prepare to be judged... but again, "that\'s Vegas" for you.'

S"I just had dinner here not even a full week ago, and I'm already dreaming about the next time I'll be back.\n\nLike others, I was drawn in by the infamous Gordon Ramsay beef wellington. It wasn't even a decision when the menu came out. The waitstaff and hostesses were extremely friendly and accommodating. They definitely made us feel welcome, and transitioned our bar tab to our table bill easily. (I don't know why some restaurants make that so difficult)\n\nWe ordered a few drinks, (they ended up not charging us for our soda drinks and only charged us for our alcohol *score*) and for the appetizer we chose the lobster stuffed with chirozo. For our entree we ordered the beef wellington for two.\n\nThe lobster was amazing! It was a single lobster tail in a creamy sauce with chorizo in the center. The lobster was cooked perfectly and the chorizo not too salty. It took all of my will power not to lick the plate when we were finished.\n\nThen the entree came. We each took a minute to just look at our amazing dishes. We also ordered a side of potatoes but they were nothing to really talk about. Just pretty basic, they were good but basic. We ended up not finishing the potatoes. The wellington on the other hand was like food for the Gods. We each took a bite and closed our eyes to enjoy the rich goodness. The meat was cooked perfectly, the flaky crust was flavorful and not dry. Under the fillet was a bit soggy but we didn't care. We pretty much ate in silence after that. It was delicious, and super filling. \n\nWe definitely did not have room for dessert. Next time, I will be prepared."

BUT...\n\nLobster- small tail tasteless, over cooked\nMussels- 2 on the plate were the size of raisins\nSalmon- taste fishy\nTuna- tasteless\nScallops - 1 piece on the plate ( good)\n\nSide of spinach - $12\nThis is acceptable \n\nWould never go back again.\n\nNo wonder most of the restaurants he help failed a year or 2 after he left.

S"I have loved Gordan Ramsey from the first episode I saw of Kitchen Nightmares on the BBC.  So it was obvious that when I was in Vegas for my sister's wedding, I had to go here. \n\nI made reservations online about 2 months in advance for myself, boyfriend, and another couple who shares the love for Ramsey also! That was quick and easy! \n\nWe arrived at 7 and we're brought right to our table. The hosts were super friendly and ours told us a little about the restaurant and decor. \n\nOur waiter arrived and he was amazing! Seriously top notch service, which should be at a place like this, but I had never had this type of experience. He was so funny and knowledgeable and gave us the perfect amount of time to decide what we want. He also brought over the cool meat tray so we could see the meats they have to offer. We ordered the kobe beef sliders, crispy pork belly, and foie gras for appetizers. Everything was delicious as expected. The foie gras was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. I was hesitant to try it at first but it is so so flavorful and delicious! If there is one appetizer you try make it this! \n\nFor dinner I ordered the filet, my boyfriend had the beef short rip, and the other couple ordered the seafood mix and porterhouse steak. We ordered fingerling potatoes and truffle Mac for sides. Everyone ate every last bit! Steak was cooked perfectly and was so delicious! \n\nFor dessert we both had the sticky toffee pudding. OMG can I just eat this 24/7? Gooey, chocolate, crunchy, melty, everything you dream of goodness! \n\nI hope I can come back here next time I'm in Vegas, if for nothing else the dessert!

My bf said he's been coming to this place for years so I guess for those that know about it, it's a legend. \n\nWhy would anyone bother going to Denny's when you can go to the Peppermill?! \nFood was super fresh, I had a veggie omelette that was gigantic and perfectly fluffy. It seriously had to have been made with at least four or five eggs. Sadly I couldn't finish it, especially since it also came with toast and I got fruit instead of potatoes. Mind you, this was good fruit, not just some grapes and a slice of melon. It was more like a mini fruit salad along with all the other food! \n\nI must say, I have a special place in my heart for the kind of gaudy decor (fake plants and pink flamingo lamps) that awaits you at The Peppermill. The waitresses all wear cute little outfits and are super friendly, seemed like they've probably worked here since it opened.\nApparently there's also a nice fire pit in the other room, which I didn't get a chance to see.

S'Usually a 24 hour restaurant, I usually think of Denny\'s. Mainly a little less then average place, just to have something to eat and not much to really look at, except the other booth of people around you. But Peppermill, proved me wrong about 24 hour restaurants, and looks more then an average place. Now this was an ideal 24 hour restaurants, that I wish it could take over Denny\'s. Then I would be coming there all the time. \n\nLocated next to Riveria, its a very colorful restaurant on the strip. Of course I had my doubts about going here, but glad my wife twisted my arm and go. Outside, it may look a bit unsure on cause its close to downtown. But despite the fancy looks that you can see on the outside, inside, is a whole different story. The seating is not like no other picnic table booth, its basically a curved booth with nice, colorful seating. You don\'t have to worry about being smooshed against the wall anymore. Each booth is like curved like the letter "C", all over the restaurant. It has very nice lighting, and very wonderful arrangements, like your in the rainforest. Not like Rainforest Cafe, but a bit less elaborate then Rainforest Cafe. \n\nThe staff was wonderful, we were seated right away, we were served drinks, once we were seated. Our waitress was very nice as well. They all wore colorful uniforms and made the place interesting. She always made sure that we were okay. \n\nLooking over the menu, the pricing was a bit more then I expected. But once I got my food, I can see why. The food was in big portions. I ordered the New York Steak, and ordered it well done. I was amazed that it came out well done. I mean, no pink what so ever on that meat. Usually when I order steak, it doesn\'t seem well done, but this time around, it was. Made me think about next time I come here, I should order medium. I don\'t mind pink, but I thought like any other place I had a well done steak, it had little pink. But I really did enjoy my New York steak. It did come with a salad, and it came big. Also came with Onion rings that were big. Mainly everything was big, even my wife\'s coffee cup was big. As much as I wanted to try to finish it, I couldn\'t. I came so close though. Finish the salad, the steak, but threw in the towel with 3 onion rings left. \n\nIf your looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night. Peppermill will surely not disappoint. The pricing may be more then usual, but its well worth the price, especially when everything comes at you in big portions. Very well recommended 24 hour restaurant.'

S'Despite a long walk from where we were staying, Peppermill was quite the epic feast with Kathleen W. and the birthday girl Ina S. + bf Alex P.\n\nWhen first entering, I could hear the "Awws" from the girls as they noted the neon lights, blossoming trees, and ambience inside. Definitely an old-school romantic diner type feel. Got seated at a booth and had a pretty hard time choosing between their menu ranging from Southern fried steak to breakfast foods to pasta. While deciding, we got our picture taken in the booth, whcih we got to keep - cute.\n\nEnded up ordering the following and definitely had to split up to the ginormous portions:\n\n-Seafood omelette: Even split two-ways between Kathleen W. and I wasn\'t enough to finish this. Filled with shrimp and crab, we wondered how many eggs went in this breakfast monster that could easily take up room in a cake box. Hashbrowns were not as great as I would have liked, but the taste of the omelette was just how I would have wanted it, with a good amount of hollandaise and cheese\n\n-Nachos appetizer: Mound of beans, carne, jalapeno, nachos, and real cheese that you can dip in guac and salsa - basically a heart attack ready to happen, but quite tasty while warm\n\n-Fish n chips: Not gonna lie, these were surprisingly good. Thick slices of cod and curly fries was a total win.\n\n-Mudslide: Delicious with real ice cream in there (much better than the pre-made stuff I usually blend). Girls said they could really taste a lot of alcohol, but I really just enjoyed it like a milkshake\n\nSuper filling meal where less than 3 dishes almost exploded our tummies with awesome. A great way to end our Vegas weekend.\n\n*Note: Apparently if we would have told them it was our friend\'s b-day, we would have gotten a pretty large sundae, but we had difficulty moving ourselves afterwards, so probably a good idea that we didn\'t let that go to waste by telling them :P'

S'Spunky, surreal neon decor with leggy waitresses wearing shiny hose. Famous amongst locals and was in the movie Swingers I hear. Right next to the Riviera down a ways on the strip. Service was good and the food quite tasty. Lots of variety. I was in Vegas on business and ate there twice. The ribeye was quite good and they didn\'t overcook it which, to me at least, is vital. The next time I got the gyro which was tasty but the lamb was just OK. No one was displeased with their meal as far I remember. If you\'re cruising through Vegas and want to try something very authentically "Vegas" but also desire a good meal and don\'t want to break the bank, Peppermill\'s the spot.\n\nOpen 24 hours by the way and oh yeah, if you\'re a drunkard this place is also optimal as they have a fireside lounge which seems to cater to the party crowd.'

S'After reading mixed reviews, I decided I wanted to try this place out anyways.\n\nCame here late last night with my boyfriend. The setup and decorations were pretty neat.\n\nAfter opening my menu, all that ran through my mind was "Denny\'s food but double the price," so I expected the food to be good.. Or at least somewhat decent.. Wrong. We ordered the sampler to share, and neither one of us liked a single thing from the sampler, if you want cheaper and better diner food, go to Denny\'s or iHop.\n\nTwo stars because our server was very nice, and inside was cool. Food was not good at all.'

S"The Peppermill is like if Sean Connery as James Bond designed a Denny's.  It's great diner food with awesome cocktails, cheap!  The fire-pit lounge is just the best thing for wowing your friends who come in from ther parts of the country, or for getting out of the LV January cold.  The whole place is lit in purple, with all kinds of amazing floral decor. \n\nThe mood is a must-stop-by and is an easy walk from the Wynn or Riviera."

S"I have been making regular stops to Fireside Lounge for a while now and I really like it. The lighting and decor would do it for me alone.  Booths tucked behind fake plants. Fire coming out of water.  It feels kinda like being in a fish tank. A pink fish tank. \n\nThey serve all manner of sweet, strong, and overly garnished cocktails. Tall ones, short ones, pink ones, and blue ones. Some of the drinks are the size of fish bowls.\nPink fish bowls.\n\nThe bartenders are in black and white and the cocktail waitresses are wearing evening wear. Drinking these crazy drinks in such an atmosphere can really have a good effect on the old disposition. If you know what I mean.\n\nSo I have visited the lounge a bunch and never so much as walked into the restaurant. So the last time I was in town it was time.  \n\nThe ambiance was the same as the lounge only a bit brighter and more restaurant like. Which might have something to do with the fact that it is indeed a restaurant.\n\nThe evening gown clad waitress came over and brought us mai tais and what not. The restaurant waitress was dressed interesting also, I think. All were nice.\n\nThe food was quite good and served in over sized portions. Pancakes, omelets, burgers and stuff like that. I personally had buffalo chicken wrap due to some reviews I have read. I would not normally order some such thing like that. It was really good. Everything everybody got was good. Big salads and other bullshit I don't remember. \n\nSo two good things in one building. And it's on the strip, albeit the ass end of the strip. And for desert you can go across the street to the Riviera. Go get it."

The menu is literally a book (think Cheesecake Factory) with about anything you could think of up for grabs 24 hours a day!  You could see anything from a few girls passed out in their eggs, to folks doing business here at 3am- so the entertainment alone is priceless!  Our service was terrific, and the place has a fun funky feel with neon and floral everywhere!\n\nMy dining partners had the NY Strip and Eggs, while I had the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict- a little pricy at 24.00 but hey, it's Vegas!"

S"This place has been awhile for a long time and both the restaurant and lounge are hot spots, but for different reasons. Both are old school, classic Vegas with the restaurant featuring classic American favorites like burgers, breakfasts, sandwiches, steaks, etc. I've been here many times and most everything I've had is good. The prices are high ($20 for a Chicken Fried Steak) but portions are huge so I guess it's warranted. I'm a healthy eater but I'd easily take half a portion for half the price sometimes. This place is super popular so if you're trying to go at a peak time, either try to find a place at the counter or prepare for a pretty long wait.\n\nThe lounge is also old school with the fire pit being the main attraction. It's dark, leathery, and open 24/7. Definitely a place you want to take a date if you want an a romantic after hours dinner. Like the restaurant, prices are higher than they should be but you just can't beat the ambiance."

S'I know there is another review for this place, but i\'m pretty sure this is the correct name for tthe lounge/restaurant. went here couple weeks ago when me and the guys went to vegas for a 21st bday bash. it was 2am and my friends and i were pooped and wanted a place where we can go and chill. i remembered watching the vegas episode of "no reservations" with anthony bourdain a while back. they came to peppermill for some cocktail in a huge bowl. i knew i wanted one. \n\nbefore entering the lounge you must remember the dress code: no hats. other than that your good to go. it was dark but the neon lights and black lights brought a relaxing mood to this place. it was me and 3 other guys. bad idea. this place is for COUPLES! if your not there with a significant other, you\'ll feel a little awkward. the plush couches were made for snuggling. we felt really uncomfortable and so we headed straight to the bar. i saw those huge goblets and i told the waitress i wanted whatever drink goes inside those. the cocktail was the scorpion. i had it before at trader vic\'s. its a very good fruity/girly cocktail. i really couldn\'t taste/feel the alcohol....yet. its 18 dollars for the cocktail but it can easily be shared by 3-4 people. some guy next to us won 7000 dollar jackpot in video poker, and i\'m not too sure the management was too happy with that. overall, this place is a really chill, relaxed place to hang out after a long hard night of gambling, drinking, clubbing/dancing. but make sure you come with a significant other or else get ready to feel lonely and awkward. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSECRET....order the scorpion blended with ice cream. it will freakin rock your world. o and be careful please cuz you won\'t be tasting any alcohol in it.....it\'ll taste like a fruit milkshake. :)'

S"This place is so Vegas!  Once you're inside, it kind of feels like you're eating in a glowy bluish forest.  Some people actually get to eat under the canopies of the fake trees.  All the waitstaff are dressed up in some way.  The cocktail waitresses have these shmexy long gowns, the waitresses have short skirts and suspenders, and the waiters have a male version of the suspenders.  They show less skin, though. Too bad. \n\nThis place is known not only for its Vegas-y vibes, but also for its large portions!  Most of our group struggled to finish their meals, but a long day of competition worked wonders on my appetite. That mushroom burger didn't stand a chance.  And the milkshakes? GINORMOUS. In general, I'd say food quality is mediocre, but they give you such a large quantity that I feel most people would be inclined to take half of it home. (I love leftovers) Also, for those of you who are into the brekky-for-dinner thing, breakfast is served all day long. \n\nAdditional bonus: our server was so nice to separate all the orders onto separate checks despite the fact that we presented her with a 20-person group. Winning!"

S'Met up with some friends here the last time I was in Vegas. It was the perfect meeting place prior to a night of drinking and debauchery. \n\nWe had a very large group (20+) and the servers were patient with all of us. Ordered the Country Fried Steak breakfast. Portions were huge. I got a generous helping of hash browns along with egg whites. Two huge pieces of country fried steak with sausage gravy all over. The sausage gravy actually had a generous amount of sausage pieces in it. Drinks here are made strong and do not disappoint. \n\nThe look and feel of the place just screams cheesy. Reminds you of the days of old Vegas with the neon everywhere. It is nice to see that not everything has changed. \n\nIf you are not in the mood for a buffet or a high end restaurant, this is the place to go. Me and my friends came here before a night of debauchery but you could also go here to recover as well.'

S"Walked in around 10am and was seated right away.  20mins later...there was a line out the door. crazy!\n\nFood: Overall the food portions were huge.\n1. Waffle - Huge portion with butter on top.  Nothing special.  Just a waffle.\n2. French Toast - 6 slices of toast.  nothing spectacular\n3. Veggie Omelet - The ingredients were great but the omlet itself did not hold up well meaning they added to much liquid (water, milk...i dunno what it was)\n\nOverall, the food isnt very expensive but the portions are huge.  It did lack a lot of flavor but it wasn't horrible.  It would be hard for me to recommend this place for food.  \n\nI would recommend the lounge.  It was actually pretty nice but weird at the same time.  Diner on 1 side and a sexy hot lounge on the other."

S'Omigod, I don\'t know how we managed to miss this place in the 9 or so years we\'ve been in Vegas!  I\'d heard about it forever, but finally went after a performance of La Cage aux Folles at the Smith Center ran a lot longer than we expected.  It was late, we were very hungry, and I figured they\'d be open.\n\nI was unprepared for all the neon.  But I LOVE neon, so this place had my kind of vibe.  It took a long time to slog through the big menu, but as we were looking I was also noticing the size of the portions passing by, so we decided to share an omelet, with hash browns and a toasted bagel.\n\nThe omelet was gargantuan, and when I asked our waitress how many eggs it had, she said "about 10."  That meant four eggs for me, since I always make sure hubby has a bigger portion.  That\'s usually my quota for six months.  I\'ve never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  I just couldn\'t stop eating them.  My only nit was the bagel, which was barely toasted, but I think even more toasting couldn\'t have saved it.  You can\'t pass off this thing with a whole to a New Yorker and really get away with it.  It looked like a bagel, but didn\'t quack like one.\n\nWe didn\'t have drinks, but had a good time looking at the mammoth drink being shared at the table next to us.  Next time we will indulge, either in the restaurant, or in the lounge, which I made sure to check out before we left.  Spectacular!, and I can\'t wait to try it.\n\nThis all took place the night before I was to leave for Jersey for an extended period.  The next night, friends were arriving from the East Coast, and where did hubby take them?  You guessed righ.  And that couple liked it so much that all three of them went back the next night, too.   With all that food, I hope I\'ll recognize my husband by the time I get back!\n\nPeppermill is the closest thing to our beloved East Coast Greek diners, but in true Vegas style, glitzier, bigger, brighter, and over the top.  In a good way.'

S'My S.O. and I went here the other day after attending an awesome Shins concert at the Hardrock Hotel. I\'ve been wanting to try Peppermill for a while now, especially with all the reviews. We talked to a few locals who were concert go-ers that night and they highly recommended that we head over to Peppermill.  \n\nWhen you are driving there, just be aware that Peppermill is located somewhat off the strip by the Convention Center. It\'s next to a Ross and there is ample public parking.\n\nWe entered into Peppermill and it was like stepping into a cheezy night club/vegas dive bar/I really don\'t even know what. The decor is super cheezy and kitchy. I loved it.  It\'s definitely one of those "you must experience it for yourself" kind of places.\n\nI ordered the eggs benedict per my fellow yelper\'s recommendations.  I loved the hollendaise sauce and the portion size was amazing. The hash browns were cooked a little longer than usual and they were crunchy and tasty.\n\nThe S.O. ordered a feta omelette and I\'m not sure what kind of beast of a creation came out.  As the S.O. was eating his omelette, he said, "Geeze, I\'m getting full, I wonder how many eggs are in this thing?" The waitress replied, "Anywhere from 10-12 eggs." Holy heart attack, Batman! So what\'s the point you ask? Share, share, share!  The portions are plentiful here.\n\nThe service was also very friendly and great. The place was a little dead but I think that\'s only because it was a Thursday night.\n\nIf you are in Vegas and want a good late night dinner, I highly recommend Peppermill.'

Happened upon this joint based on a recommendation from a co-worker.  We went on Valentine's Day for lunch.  Loved the decor- the funky old school vibe was neat.\n\nThe coffee was big and excellent.  We shared the tomato soup which was surprisingly cheesy and very good.  In addition, we shared a chicken balsamic sandwich, which was fine, but nothing special.  The onion rings it came with were good, but nothing different than your typical onion ring.  The service was just so-so... had to ask a couple times for water, but it was super busy so that was understandable.\n\nBasically, not sure if I will go back again- maybe to check out the fireside lounge, but for me it really didn't rock my world."

We got one of the specials with spanish sausage, onions, peppers cooked with hashbrowns and fresh eggs and cheese. Yummy!

S'Passed by this place many times but never bothered to stop by.. Until, we did a "nearby" search on my Yelp App... Mann, have I been missin\' out for the last few years!! \n\nFirst off, the atmosphere/decor is definitely out of the ordinary and most likely inspired from a nightclub/strip club.. Disco ball glass, Cherry Blossom Trees and Neon Lights.. Interesting and totally Vegas!\n\nWhat will make me come back again and again:\n\nSouthern Fried Steak: This was the Best Chicken Fried Steak I\'ve ever had! Crispy, Crispy Chicken Breading, Good Thickness, Tender and So Flavorful!! The gravy was Great and just made it even better! It came with Some of the Best Hash Browns I\'ve ever had!! Yes, this plate was a Double Whammy!! The Hash had the typical string/shredded potatoes but wider cuts and an amplified potato flavor!! The eggs, I tried their scrambled eggs and they were tastier than average and fluffier than normal. Plus, I opted with a side of White Toast. The Toast was ordinary but it came with a delicious strawberry jam. To Top it off, this entree could easily feed two starving people!!! \n\nFrench Toast: Another Generous Dish that came with 6 Fat 1/2Slices of Texas Toast that were Frenched up Correctly! Nice soft butter and maple syrup (not too thick) just brought it home! Traditional and Executed Right! \n\nMarinated Pork Chops: Came with 2 bone-in cuts, grilled with the nice evident checker marks and lightly seasoned with herbs and spices. Not bad but Nothing compared to the Southern/Chicken Fried Steak. This also came with a small slices of apples and sauce. The side of Hash Browns.. You know how I feel about those! This time, I went with egg whites and a bagel with cream cheese for the included choice of sides. Egg whites were Great (similar to the scrambled eggs) and the Bagel was massive and Satisfying (No, Einstein Bagel but it did the job).\n\nDined here twice now, within a week and this place isn\'t around the block.. Hint, Hint.. Service both times were Flawless.. Veteran Servers: know what to say, how to say it and when to say it.. Fast service, follow-ups.. I like the Feel and Atmosphere, much different the norm. Prices are alright, they pile on the food and quality is there. I\'m hooked on their Southern Fried Steak and Eggs!!! and  Hash Browns!'

It was the Peppermill Omelet that consisted of a cholesterol bursting amount of eggs along with hash browns and a blueberry muffin. The omelet was as good as anything at a breakfast place. The muffin was very fresh. \n\nI can't tell whether this place is from the Hobbit or a vintage 70's slutty diner. It doesn't matter though because the waitresses fit right in, Vegas style.

Aren't we excited!  \n\nI love this place, in actuality, especially as a last stop on a night that's gone on a little too long when the weather's a little too chilly.  At about 2 AM on such a night, warming oneself at the fire pit with a gigantic plate full of nachos is pretty much an unparalleled delight.\n\nThe blue and pink neon is a little too bright, but it gives the Lounge a character no other place has.  I could do without the flat screens playing Phish and the like, but you can't win 'em all.  The drinks are a little pricey, ($7 for a well drink, $9 and up for specialties) but you ARE on the Strip and you're paying for that awesome fire pit too.  (That gas bill must be outrageous.)  The waitresses are always very polite and prompt, and their dresses make me giggle just a little bit.  (Long, black cocktail dresses look somehow out of place and perfectly comfortable there at the same time.)  The Peppermill is really the only place worth lounging at for a local on the Strip anymore, so let's keep it on the downlow and keep the tourists away, shall we?  Shhhhh!"

S"This place is so tacky, it's not even funny.  Upon entering, you feel like the SS Enterprise teleported you back to 1980.  I want to brae out my shoulder pads, aqua net, parachute pants and Members Only jacket.  The ceilings are mirrored, with neon pink, and blue lights everywhere.  There are these giant fake cherry blossom trees, and planter after planter of fake plants and flowers.  Just think, the cheesiest place imaginable. \n\nYou may come here to be entertained by the cheesy atmosphere, but you definitely come here for the amazing food.  The portions are enormous! Definitely big enough for two to split.  We got one garden omelette, a fruit cup, and an order of eggs Benedict to share for three people.  It was more than enough food.  \n\nWhile the food and the service were both excellent, the only bummer of this visit was the 30 plus minute ticket time to get our food.  The server repeatedly apologized, and was kind enough to not charge us for our coffee, iced tea and oj.  This is the minus one star.  Otherwise this place rocks!"

I had a classic burger for $14.00. It was a good basic burger but I could have gotten one for 1/2 the price anywhere. We had milkshakes and the were terrible. Very runny. I like a thick shake. Very little chocolate sauce. $8.00 each. I'm glad I went but wont go again. To many other places to get a good burger."

S"I completely happened upon this spot by chance. I had been wandering around in some labyrinthine mall full of ritzy stores I couldn't imagine shopping in, when I saw the sign for Holstein's Shakes and Buns? Sounds like a winning combo to me. \n\nThey weren't very crowded in the middle of the afternoon, so my gf and I got a seat real quick. I had a good buzz going, so we opted for something off the Tiny Buns section of the menu. I went with the Crispy Pork Belly Bun, my gf had the Meat Ball Grinder. We also got an order or shoestring fries. I contemplated getting an alcoholic milkshake, but I figured it would be a waste since the food & shake itself would likely counteract the effects of the alcohol, and I also assume the amount of booze in each shake is equivalent to one conservative shot. \n\nThe Meat Ball Grinder was good, but I also have yet to find a meatball anywhere on Earth as good as my Dad's, so I'm going to be biased eternally. The Pork Belly, however, was so goddamn good. The key was the Asian steamed bum it was served in. It's like someone sliced a little circle of fluffy goodness of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and used it to bundle up my delicious pork product. I've never eaten anything like it before. The fries were boring, although shoestring has never been my favorite. They're pretty typical for a place that seems to thrive on atypical offerings. \n\nI'm definitely coming back here with a bigger appetite to try some of their full-serve offerings, and maybe one of those gourmet booze-infused milkshakes. They aren't too expensive, and the food is killer."

S"Lets,start with price its a little on the high side for a burger but after you eat there it won't matter anymore. You also have to take into consideration that you are not at home this is vegas and the space is at a premium causing the business to have to charge more to cover that expense. \n\nOur server Erin was fantastic. This girl never stopped moving and I never saw anyone in her area including us sit with an empty glass. I drink a lot of diet coke and she kept them coming I never had to even ask. She was very friendly, perceptive and just a great person to talk with. Even had the food been fair the service would have Moore then made up for it. \n\nThe food was very good. We had the hen burger and the longhorn burgers. We cut them in half and each took a half of each. They were both good burgers. We both preferred the hen not to say the other was bad it just didn't seem to have the flavor we liked that the hen did. We also ordered the onion rings and they were great. The sauce was a bit smokey for me but my wife loved it. They came out nice and crisp and the onions were actually cooked.\n\nWe will go back."

S"Yum-diddly-yum! This hopping little place inside The Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas is delicious. The wait was not terrible (15 minutes) and the staff was attentive and friendly. We started with the fried pickle appetizer  - good breaded crunchy coating and equally crunchy dill pickle spears within. A few fried olives in the mix didn't hurt one bit. Hubby ordered the Korean Bull-Gogi burger loaded with a nice soy/kalbi marinade, kimchi, and a fried egg atop a perfectly cooked burger and incredibly toasty bun. This burger was a nice size and had a good side of sweet potato fries with it. I had the lobster roll sliders in mini-hot dog buns with a nice aioli and cup of cole slaw. Great flavor on both entrees. Plus... we each had one of their cool milk-shakes. Mine was the Oreo cookie with Bailey's and hubby had the S'mores with rum. Goodness gracious, set me up with another! Food was pretty reasonably priced for pricey Vegas as well. Try it!"

S"We needed a convenient, relatively cheap place to eat and this was right in the Cosmopolitan Hotel (across from Marquee).  There is no way this place could go out of business in this location.  They serve gourmet burgers and spiked milkshakes.  Is there anything you can't get drunk on in Vegas?  The burgers are pretty damn good, but it was really only a better version of Red Robin, with an upgraded (better looking) wait staff.  The essential complement to burgers - the fries - were a disappointment.  They seemed overcooked.\n\nService was extremely slow, even though there were plenty of empty tables, but our waitress kept us updated.  I had nearly finished my shake by then.  \n\n3 stars for now.  This place has potential, but I doubt anyone cares all that much as you can't miss with burgers, fries, and shakes."

S'This place did not live up to expectations.  We browsed yelp reviews and looked through the menu prior to getting here, and were really excited to try the selection, but most of us left disappointed.  Luckily, I think I got the best burger of the bunch (The Rising Sun Burger!).\n\nThe Rising Sun Burger is an Asian-inspired burger so I loved the sweet, salty flavors.  The fried avocado and addition of tempura added a wonderful element to it.  I also added an additional egg on mine.  However, I think the key to a GREAT burger is the meat patty, and this is where Holsteins fell short with ALL our burgers.  Mine "supposedly" had a kobe beef patty, but I would\'ve never known the difference because in-n-out serves a better patty.  They asked us how we wanted our patties cooked, and all of us went with medium-rare, but they were all overcooked.  Our patties tasted dry and flavorless.\n\nOur group shared two appetizers - the Lobster Mac \'n Cheese and the Wings.  Both were mediocre.  The mac \'n cheese was runny, there was barely any lobster in it, and the portion was tiny.  Not worth the high price tag.  The wings were your standard wings - I think Wingstop wings are just as good.\n\nAlthough I didn\'t order one, my friends said the alcoholic shakes didn\'t even taste like there were any alcohol in them.  They might as well have ordered regular non-alcoholic shakes elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.\n\nCool concept, but execution fell short.'

I originally didn't think that it would be enough food but it turned out to be plenty.\n\nThey offer adult shakes with booze in them, which is always a fun idea.  I stuck to one of their specialty cocktails, which was very tasty and actually had some booze in it.  \n\nService was quick, friendly and efficient, a nice stop while touring the Cosmopolitan casino."

It was perfectly cooked and the beef tasted like beef, sounds stupid but its not that common. I mean when you order a burger it should taste like beef not .85 cent teriyaki sauce or sweet baby rays BBQ sauce but I digress. The bun was delicious and the fries were excellent, I went with the steak cut. The decor in the restaurant was very hip, kinda Japanese anime-esque. The service was very good and friendly.'

The menu is so unapologetically predictable but I can't say I'm disappointed. \n\nOur meal before flying home consisted of:\n-- 'bam-boozled shake' brown cow ($11): whipped cream vodka, root beer, vanilla ice cream & pop rocks. Reason for 4-star rating.\n-- black & white shake ($8): comes with an extra tumbler. Yummy! \n-- fried chicken fingers & waffles ($11): horrid! I've had better at Denny's. Everyone's got their version of this comfort-food fave, but please do it right. \n-- 'tiny buns' Maine lobster roll ($16.50 for 2): the chive aioli overpowered the dish. Loved the cute, tiny hot dog buns. \n-- 'tiny buns' pork belly bun ($9 for 2): I wanted to try, but after bf showed me the sheer amount of fat, I couldn't do it. Yes, animal fat scares me. (sidenote: BF prefers chairman bao.) \n\nFour stars because I love the idea of 'tiny buns,' & because I want to try every single alcoholic shake on the menu.

I liked that you could grab a seat without waiting in any lines, and that the service was polite and quick.\n\n* Hen House ($15) - 4.5 STARS: Beef With Fried Egg, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato And Onion With Mustard & Ketchup. This was probably my favorite burger, even though it is so simple. Ordered medium rare, ofcourse.\n\n* The Longhorn ($17) - 3.5 STARS: Beef Patty Topped With Texas Smoked Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Creamy Cole Slaw & Dill Pickle. I thought for sure this would take the cake, but there was alot going on. Sometimes simple is the best way to go.\n\n* Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese ($16.5) - 4 STARS: Creamy Tallegio-Mascarpone Sauce With Maine Lobster And Black Truffle. This was uber cheesy and truffly.

Both times I tried the classic burger though; since it really doesn't come with many toppings, you have to serve excellent beef and I didn't think it was fantastic.

Thats fried avacado. If you aren't already ordering this burger as we speak I don't know what else to say to you.\n\n\nWhat to Avoid\nNom Nom- this is pretty meh. Kobe beef should be so good it stands on its own (you are paying enough for that anyway)- but here it is covered in potato chips and 1000 island dressing- a dissapointment\n\nCalifornia Turkey- if you are trying to eat healthy this probably isn't the place for you but even the veggie burger is better than this"

Welcome to Las Vegas!\n\nThis place typifies the Las Vegas burger, minus the In-and-Out down the street (which we traveled to twice, didn\'t come back to Holsteins).\n\nI get it, arugula is fancy, it\'s not worth a $15 burger though. Service was terrible, waited about 20 minutes for a table, being the first party on a non-existent, no-names last. Then, hostess: "oh, someone just took that table that opened up. Sorry!" ... wait, what exactly is your job here? Anyhow... sat at the bar due to hungry, takes forever to get anything ordered, and bartender literally stops attending to respond to someone else\'s commentary on something or other. Worthless service.\n\nI dunno. I mean. Burgers people. Not $20, not $30. You\'ll probably spend like $50 for 2 burgers and a beer. I can\'t do it. I\'m in the wrong city. But, In-and-Out is down the street! Under $10 for two to eat, and way better service than Holsteins. Fail.\n\nGood food though.\n\nThanks for listening!'

Luckily, after walking to the exit and realizing it was pouring outside, we turned around and noticed Holsteins across the hall from the Marquee. \n\nFirst and foremost, the service was friendly and the staff did a great job. Secondly, the food was well worth it. \n\nTo start, they bring out seasoned popcorn that was quickly devoured by us. Next I ordered the Frozen Grasshopper (a Bam-Boozled Shake) that consisted of Peppermint, Chocolate, Cr\xc3\xa8me De Menthe, Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka. While it was good, it was definitely a lot (couldn't finish it after the burger). \n\nAnd lastly, their burger. My, what a burger! After being torn between the Gold Standard & Fun-Ghi Big Buns, I decided to go with the Gold Standard. Now this burger is as follows: Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli. I ordered mine medium and it was plated as such. The sirloin was cooked to perfection with a beautiful char outside and juicy inside. The smoked bacon and aged goat cheddar gave it a great kick, but for me, the magic came in the garlic-chive aioli. I mean, WOW, what a burger! \n\nEvery bite was tasteful, satisfying, and worth every penny. It was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had.

S"Thanks to Holsteins yummy Bam-Boozeled shakes (with the help of many cocktails beforehand), I can hardly remember a thing about my dinner here.\n\nAfter polishing off many rounds of happy hour cocktails at Comme CA, a group of eight of us found ourselves at Holsteins (located inside the gorgeous Cosmo hotel) for dinner on a Friday evening. \n\nThe first thing I need to tell y'all is that all eight of us were fairly intoxicated before entering Holsteins. And after all eight of us ordered a Bam-Bozzeled shake with extra shots of alcohol to start our meals, the rest of the evening became quite a blur. Such a blur, in fact, that even though every single person ordered a different burger from their large menu (we also ordered appetizers), and even though I took a bite of everything ordered, I can't really recall everything I tried and if I even enjoyed it. I'm just glad I took pictures, otherwise I would have been totally guessing on some of the food we ordered. This is just a few of the items I tried that fun night at Holsteins; \n\nDrunken Monkey Shake- Reese's, Banana, Malt, & Frangelico Liquor\nCereal Bowl Shake- Cap'n Crunch & Absolut Vanilla Vodka\nCampfire Smores- Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka, Chocolate, Marshmallow & Graham Crumble\nPork Belly Buns\nSalt & Vinegar Popcorn (Complimentary)\nThe Rising Sun Burger (I ordered this)- Kobe Beef Burger, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado\nGold Standard Burger- Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger W/ Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli\nThe Longhorn Burger- Beef Patty Topped W/ Texas Smoked Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Creamy Cole Slaw & Dill Pickles\n\nI do remember that we all thoroughly enjoyed our adult shakes. They were sweet and thick but the bartenders were more than generous with the alcohol because every shake was just as strong or even stronger than the cocktails we had before entering Holsteins. \n\nI can honestly say I slightly do remember my burger being damn tasty. I loved the teri glaze on the patty and the tempura avocado was a nice touch. This burger reminded me of something I'd get at Umami in LA. As for the rest of the burgers and the apps go, I'm assuming I and everyone else enjoyed them because every plate was licked clean. \n\nFrom what I remember the service was great and the atmosphere in the restaurant was fun and upbeat. The prices here are really reasonable.  \n\nI will definitely try Holsteins again. Next time I'll just make sure to be sober before eating here so I can fully remember my experience. Till that day comes I'll give Holsteins a solid 4 stars."

Since i had to go back to work - no drinkie - had some root beer called rat bastard ( $5 ) - ok \n\norder kettle chips ( $6 ) \n\nGold Standard Burger ( $17 - add $2 more for onion rings ) \n\nCool looking place, in the mall area of the Cosmo - place was hopping today.\n\nGuy next to me seated 3-4 minutes after me - he gets his malt and sliders before i get my chips and/or burger....in fact, i never get my chips - the bartender didn\'t  hear me .....okaaay.\n\nThe burger - asked for it medium - it was juicy but no hint of pink at all ...none ... since the burger was juicy i can live with it.  My guess a quarter pounder, but not sure - overall, i liked it - the goat cheddar complimented the meat, lil micro greens were a nice touch and  bacon was all good  but $17 .... not sure about the pricing.  \n\nOnion rings were also decent but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWill i try again ?  yeaaah - i want to try some of the sausages they apparently make in house.\n\nA pet peeve - they make mention of everything made in house yet what do they bring me when i get the plate of food - bottled catsup and mustard ( i believe heinz and french\'s ) - geez guys, can\'t you make it yourself ?  or at least put the stuff in a fancy container ?   At least they didn\'t pull a kgb and when i ask for mayo they throw me a few "to go" tear open mayo containers .\n\npics will be posted later today'

S"I had a burger called the Gold Standard. It did not have any gold contained within it and I am okay with that. It did not have very many standards, either. For example, a few minutes after it came to the table it started hitting on every guy there. Even Julian.\n\nNo standards.\n\nI added a fried egg and I was happy about that. I ordered a caipirinha since they had a full bar and I was happy about that too. Kevin used up more ketchup than a family of six should use in any given month other than July. July is a month where most families of six use a lot of ketchup. Look it up.\n\nThe art on the walls might make a vegetarian feel a little bad. But if you're a vegetarian and you're eating at this place, you're kind of an idiot. Not for eating at this place. But for being a vegetarian. What's up with that?\n\nSide note...the popcorn is pretty legit. Don't miss a chance to try it. It's free, too. So unless you just got sealants on your molars, you should dig in."

S'YUM. Great burger place. We checked in with foursquare and each got a free drink from the special they were offering! I got the beef burger topped with thick sliced smoked bacon and a fried egg, salad on the side. But god damn the other specialty burgers looked SO good too. Will definitely be back to try more! \n\nReally cool atmosphere and nice servers.'

S'Stumbled upon this place via Yelp because my friend was craving chicken strips. After getting seated by a cute and cheerful waitress, we got to snack on popcorn while we looked over the menu. (Free popcorn is always a positive in my book!) I ordered the Gold Standard Burger since everyone was raving about it on Yelp. The burger was good, but I have to say.. the fries were definitely drool worthy.\n\nThey had a large variety of "Bam Boozled Shaks" aka boozed up milkshakes. I had a bit of my friend\'s Oreo Milkshake = yum! (And I don\'t even like chocolate..)\n\nBy the way, if you check in on FourSquare, you get a free pint of draft beer!\n\nLove love love the cute cow art decor all over the restaurant. It\'s super cute and lively. They also have TV all over the place so you could watch the games that were going on.'

S"So I had rad about this place on yelp and after reading the reviews I decided I would try it out. The food was good for the most part it was a party of seven and everyone had something different. The burgers where all just ok nothing special but I can say u do get a good size portion for what you pay for. Ordered some appz. And they where ok the best out of the where the steak and cheese spring rolls will be going back for some more of those. Next the chicken and waffles where bland at best and only came with one mini waffle. All the milk shakes where beeter than advertised although I didn't ft a chance to have one of my own all in all the place was jus ok nothing spectacular but I would go again for desserts and milk shakes. Food is hit or miss depending on what u order. Oh also turkey burger was on point for sure"

S'Came here for dinner with a group of 13. I must say, they took forever and a day to seat us. However, everything else after that was smooth sailing.\n\nWe were greeted with white truffle popcorn when we were seated but the waitress must not have gotten the memo that 3 small tins of popcorn (which were great) would not satisfy 13 guys\' long wait/pre-meal munchies. However, she was on top when it came down to our orders. \n\nI got the Fun Ghi burger, which they pronounce fungi but should be pronounced more like "fun jee"....anyways, the burger was $17 but should have been more of a $14-15 burger.   The mark up must have been from the "truffle oil" that they claim they put in it but I couldn\'t taste truffle at all. Came with streak cut fries but I would recommend getting shoestring fries. \n\nWhen ordering your burger, order it 1 step more rare since they tend to overcook the patties. I ordered a medium rare and was served medium, NBD.'

S"I really liked this place. Got a strawberry shake, and it reminded me of Red Robin's shakes which I love. Also, the burgers were delicious and surprisingly not too oily compared to other gourmet burgers. The one thing you have to try is the onion rings. I hate when onions are too large in onion rings, but Holsteins does it right with the thin onion strips and delicious breading.\n\nMy only complaint is the wait time. The first time we went, they told us it was a 30-40 minute wait for our food no matter what we ordered. Food NEVER takes that long to come out even in a steakhouse. We got lucky the second time we went because the waiter told us it was a 30-40 minute wait, noticed we were in a rush, and ended up pulling strings and got our food out in 10 minutes, so kudos to service!"

S"One bite the Rising Sun Burger and you're in beef nirvana.  And one bite is all I got, because my dinner companion, AKA significant other, wouldn't share after that.  But that's ok, although my Longhorn burger wasn't as good, it's no flakeout in the burger department.  Just not as exotic an explosion in your mouth as the traditional Japanese flavors that are perfectly introduced into the western standard that is the burger on a bun called, once again, The Rising Sun.  And let me tell you, this burger planetarian will now orbit around this fabulous burger.\n\nThe beers are nice and cold and that's what I reverted to after an uber strong margarita on the rocks.  I treated it like a shot, cause at $14 there's no way I'd leave it sitting on the table.  We were seated immediately, the service was fast, extremely friendly and ready to answer any questions we had about the menu.\n\nI can't wait to go back, and guess what I'll be ordering next time?  Hai, The Rising Sun.  Arigato Holsteins!!!"

But they charged $11 for our bday cake and didn't even sing with us. \n\nDefinitely paying the price for ambiance not for satisfying taste buds. Our bill came out to $80 per person...bit pricey for burgers, no?"

S"This place is good. I wouldn't say it's the best burger place ever like some reviewers have said, but it was good.\n\nWe ordered the fried pickles which were decent. The insides were lava hot, even after a while of letting them sit to cool. I am pretty sure these are frozen, though. My grandma owns a restaurant and tried out fried pickle spears for the menu and I tried those. Pretty sure these were the exact same ones. \n\nMy husband is a huge burger fan. I don't know if he loves anything more.\nHe got the golden standard burger that apparently has won a bunch of awards or something (according to our waiter).\nWhen I asked him how he likes it, he just shrugged. I was shocked. He said it was alright, but if we ever ate there again, he would try something else. \n\nI had the blackened salmon po-boy. It was really good but super awkward to eat because it's a long piece of salmon sitting on a hamburger bun. I had to piece off some of the salmon and eat that separate before diving into the sandwich. Overall, a good choice. The slaw on it was really good. I got sweet potato fries and they tasted just like every other sweet potato fry. Good, but nothing crazy amazing.\n\nWe didn't get a shake because we were outrageously full, which is a disappointment on our part hah.\nIt's a fun place. Nothing really too bad about it so I'll give it a 4 star. Maybe I'll have to go back with more people in the future to get a better idea of what it's like."

S'I went here twice during my week in Vegas, and I would have gone back again if I could.  We tried a lot of different things on the menu, and everything was good.  The service was great, and it is in the Cosmopolitan Hotel which is amazing.\n\nBasically whatever you get here is going to be good; burgers, salads, appetizers, drinks, and reasonably priced for Vegas.'

S"I've been dying to try this place since the Cosmopolitan opened and I really wanted to love it.  But it was just okay.\n\nThe prices were a little crazy.  I know it's the strip, but $11 for a dogfish head beer??  $11 for a drunken milkshake is one thing but the beer situation is crazy.  Speaking of drunken milkshakes, I tried the drunken monkey milkshake.  It's basically a huge milkshake with banana, reese's cups and Frangelico.  Was sooo good!  What was not so good is the massive gut ache I got shortly after eating it but that could be on me.\n\nThe fried pickles I ordered as an appetizer were pretty good and I have high standards being from the place which claims to have invented the frickled pickle.  The lobster roll I ordered, in addition to being kind of bland and all mayo, consisted of two teeny buns and were definitely not worth the $18 price tag.  For $55 before tip, I can think of many other places I would rather go.  I have seen reference to some popcorn in other reviews but I didn't see this while there.  Overall, very underwhelming, but I still may give it another try."

S"Any place there's a pink and white cow in the middle of the bar, I'm there.\n\nHolstein's was a great find last night, after countless hours of scouring the Yelp site for something other than sushi.  I was ready for a change, for a new spot to grab a burger, and when I saw the reviews for Holsteins and it's location, I had to give it a try.  \n\nLet me start by saying that the Cosmo itself is beautiful, and this place makes it even better with a pink and white cow in the middle of the bar.  \n\nI made reservations through their website (highly recommended) for dinner at 9pm.  Late?-Sure, but it prevents us from eating with the regular dinner crowd.  We arrived and were greeted by the nice hostess who seated us immediately a corner half booth.\n\nThe ambiance is really comforting and chic, which I love.  With the chocolate leather seating to the bright colored tiles aligning one wall and picture-framed tv's, it's metrosexual.  The menu is interesting, too, boasting unique sodas, shakes, and burgers.  Obviously, the menu was in the higher dollar range for a burger considering it is in the Cosmo, but I went all out and ordered what I wanted.  \n\nI ordered their newest shake--the cereal bowl--which tasted like breakfast in the morning but in a really fantastic way.  With vanilla ice cream mixed with crushed Cap'n Crunch and Fruity Pebble cereal, it was quite a treat to have, almost like dessert before dinner.  I LOVE IT.  I'm a big cereal person, so this was perfect for me (and it was suggested by the server).\n\nFrank picked up this crazy strawberry soda that was really really good.  I'm going to try and find it at the soda shop on Trop and the 215.\n\nWe had the philly spring rolls with tempura pepper slices and ketchup.  It was freakin' great.  The flavors and textures were all on point.  When you combine a philly with a spring roll, magic happens.  Squishy, creamy, gooey cheese oozes out of the end and the ketchup makes it all the better.\n\nWe ordered their kettle chips, which had this great bleu cheese salt on them, and the french dip was awesome, too.  Unfortunately, the spring rolls trumped the chips, but they would go great with a beer at the bar, for sure.\n\nI ordered the Rising Sun burger: Kobe beef patty with tempura avocado, crispy yam strings, teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo.  Wow. Just the right amount of sauce and the yams gave it this nice, sweet, spicy flavor and texture.  The meat itself was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  With that soft, white bun that didn't overpower the meal (it was really light), I believe that I found my favorite burger in Vegas.\n\nFrank ordered the Gold Standard: aged beef patty with guyere (substituted for the aged goat cheese), lettuce, tomato, and onion.  He added lobster, which made it decadent and very flavorful. The sweetness of the lobster accentuated the patty's aged flavor.  It's a winner, for sure.\n\nWith no room for dessert, we tapped out with an 81.00 bill, which was expected.  I would definitely eat here again. And again. And again.\n\nIf you want to try this place out, do.  There's a lot of try and many days out of the year to do it."

They also have an amazing selection of beers (both on tap and in the bottle). Service has always been great as well. \n\nI would recommend making reservations if you can. It can get busy around lunch time."

S'First of all, I want to start off by saying that the Cosmopolitan is starting to irritate me. Everything that is the Cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. The types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- the bottom of the barrel. Don\'t get me wrong. The building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. LCD screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. I just can\'t stand how un-classically Vegas it is. They try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. The addition of Holsteins Shakes and Buns to the property is just the cherry on top. I heard ravenous reviews about Holsteins and I was excited to try this place. Things like, "the best burgers in Vegas," and "I Love Love Love Hoslteins" were some of many glowing reviews. Here is my 2 cents.\n\nThe lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. Surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. Unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. Lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. Theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. The truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. My favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. It consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.\n\nUpon request, which I thought was complimentary, was popcorn. Though it wasn\'t your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. I read that it was truffle popcorn. Excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. It was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. This was a weird mix and though not appetizing, I found myself reaching for the popcorn. I ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. The sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. I guess my curiosity superseded my palate.\n\nQuite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food I am most knit picking about, the burger is a classic. From the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, the burger is a great vessel to work with. With such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can\'t mess it up.\n\nAnd now, the Rising Sun burger -- It had Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. Their take on a Japanese burger sounds good on paper. The fried avocado alone would make me happy. It was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. I just didn\'t have enough of it. That probably was the only thing good about this burger. Everything else was a mistake. First of all, what is wrong with this is the Kobe. I hate when restaurants advertise as serving Kobe when we all know most of that is just an American breed, if not, from Australia. Second of all, when you cook a "Kobe" beef burger, it has to be rare. Nothing else will do. What I got was all grey inside. The crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn\'t any different. That is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. The teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn\'t help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. Did I order the wrong burger? Maybe, but that still doesn\'t make up for the overcooked patty.\n\nIf anything, the drunken monkey shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. It had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. The adult version has Frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from Italy. I opted out and went with just a regular. "You are in Vegas. Live a little!", you say? In hind sight, maybe I should have made this shake alcoholic. It would have made me feel better about the sub-par meal I just had. Still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.\n\nPretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. I just can\'t associate this restaurant with good food. The same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe Johnny Rockets, with a lower price, and I still wouldn\'t think twice about it. I mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. Come on! The food really needs an upgrade. How awesome would it be if finally, the Las Vegas Strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? I think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. I guess I just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. For now at the Cosmo, I guess Secret Pizza will have to do.'

S"Did someone say fancy hamburgers and alcoholic milkshakes?  This is the definitive upscale Vegas burger joint with a pricey menu and coffee table dining arrangements.  Sure you could go across the street and stuff your face for 1/10 of the price at Fatburger, but you wouldn't feel sexy like you do here.\n\nFrom the high class cheddar popcorn served in a stainless steel bucket to the wildly over priced beers on tap, you can rest assured you're dining on the Vegas Strip when you pay the check.\n\nEverything we ordered was on a level above.  From the perfectly cooked thick cut bacon to the freshest avocado that tasted like it came straight from your mother's garden.  Just reading the menu will have your mouth salivating and anyone who loves food will appreciate the interesting and creative combinations displayed in their menu.\n\nIt was a tough decision but I went forth with the Gold Standard.  How could I pass up an awesome dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli?  Oh man, my mouth is salivating just thinking about it!\n\nThe French fries were fresh and the attention to detail was impressive.  Our food arrived in perfect photogenic state and we didn't hesitate to flash a few photos of those beautiful burgers to honor the day.  Taking time to masticate our fine fare and truly savoring our meals only added to the experience.  A few beers later our very attentive wait staff had us mulling over the dessert menu.  Any other meal with a lesser burger and dessert victory would have been mine.  However, this burger deserved to be tasted the rest of the night.\n\nHere's to expensive burgers!  Cheers!"

I ordered the brown cow which is basically root beer float with pop rocks and vodka.  Didn't taste any alcohol nor did I taste any pop rocks.  Not good.  Ordered the lobster roll.  It was okay as were the sliders which were overcooked.  The foie burger was decent but a bit heavy according to the GF.  Will I come back again?

S"Great place for burgers! Was recommended this place by a friend who compared the quality of the burgers to Father's Office in LA. I haven't tried that place yet but this is definitely a solid joint. \n\nThis place is pretty popular so expect a wait. We were seated after about 25 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. You can leave your number with them and they'll call you when your table is ready.\n\nThe popcorn to start with is really good..honestly they were better than the fries that came with the burger. The fries were kind of bad, reminded me of cafeteria fries and were greasy and soggy, hence taking off one star. The burgers however were well worth the price, huge and delicious. I ordered a steakhouse and, being a gal who sprinkles tons of pepper on everything, enjoyed it very much, however it was definitely more cooked than the medium rare I had asked for. One of my friends got the rising sun which I think I'll try next time, I've never had any burger like it. Another friend got the machete and he said it was the first burger in his life that he couldn't finish, so that gives you an idea about the enormous portion sizes. ;)\n\nDecor is nice, service was pretty slow but overall it was a good experience and I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas. :)"

S'The restaurant is a great place to enjoy "desserts" in the form of their shakes, especially after having a meal at another Cosmopolitan restaurants.  Each are $11 a piece, which is not too bad for a sweet alcoholic beverage after a meal, or just to enjoy during your break from exploring the secret spots dotted throughout Cosmopolitan.\n\nI came here after a sushi dinner at Blue Ribbon, and we each ordered a different "shake".  Collectively we ordered Black Cow, Oreo & Caramel S\'mores.  \n\nAs a destination for fairly reasonably priced meals, Holsteins Shakes and Buns, is recommended.  The burgers and sliders looks great, tastes good, and will not break your Vegas budget.\n\nAtmosphere: 4/5  Cool, trendy hangout spot for locals and tourists.\nDecor: 4/5  Nice, trendy, modern.\nPrice: 4/5  Very reasonable, especially for a restaurant inside a mega-luxury resort casino on the Strip.\nFood:  4/5  Dessert is delicious, even if making delicious shakes does not require formal culinary training.'

S'When I had to make my way across the "skywalk" to work on the other side of the street, I always took a "short cut" through the Cosmo upstairs.  After our dinner at China Poblano, I learned to pay more attention to what else was up there, which was the reason why I zeroed in on Holstein\'s.  And hey - any restaurant serving burgers that even utilizes the COW\'S FREAKIN\' NAME, had better be ready to \'bring it\', as far as I\'m concerned.  So when Bear and I selected it for our burger fix, we were prepared for - at the very least - a \'transformative experience.\'\n\nSo was it THAT kind of deal? Nope, not really.  But you could do SO much worse.\n\nFirst of all - as promised - I have to give a shout-out to our server, Amanda.  Just that right, attractive combination of smiles, sass and \'savoir faire\'\' (NOTE TO MANAGERS: GET this woman a raise, STAT!) I\'ve always loved that in the better restaurants in town, the staff always have an \'inside/out\' knowledge of the menu and the daily specials, and in this particular area, Amanda did not disappoint. (Which is why Holstein\'s gets an extra star.)  With so many different styles of burger to choose from, it could have been an all-day task to select just one, but with her help, I chose the Nom-Nom Burger ($16.50), while Bear went "classic" and got the Gold Standard ($17.50). \n\nPricey? Well, DUH! What does anybody expect when they\'re using Kobe and dry- aged sirloin to craft the frickin\' burgers? (And don\'t forget - this IS a \'Strip\' joint we\'re talking about here, people!) And while we waited - but not for long - we got to check out the unique decor that included anime-style artwork of the Holstein\'s "mascot".  Cute...especially considering that he\'s on the menu as well as the wall!\n\nFor our \'intro\', we had the Buffalo Chicken Dip ($12.00) a cluckin\'-good twist on chili con queso served with warm tortilla chips, and Bear\'s \'de rigeur\' item to try, the Cuban Street Tacos ($13.00) a delicious menage-a-trois of roast pork, ham and Swiss lovingly drizzled with pickle and spicy mustard aioli. The bite I had of one of them made me wonder if I should\'ve gotten a separate appetizer as well....\n\nAnd then came the burgs.  Bear liked his Standard just fine, and I added some \'meat candy\' (aka BACON!) to my Nom-Nom for about two bucks more. I didn\'t know if I expected a burger with barbecue potato chips and 1000 Island dressing to actually work, but damn if didn\'t, and in quite a tasty way, too. (But then again...name one thing that doesn\'t taste better with bacon on it.)  It was quite the stunning companion to my Frozen Grasshopper Shake ($11.00).  And the fries served with were just the way I like them: crispy, spicy shoestrings, with none of the greasiness you get from other burger joints.\n\nSo, sure, Holstein\'s is giving up burgers, but not at Jack-In-The-Box prices, so it\'s always best to keep that in mind.  And as repeat visits go, I think we can file this one under "Special Occasions" mostly.  And we will always ask to be seated in Amanda\'s section...'

S"This place is a hit or miss as for experience dining inside.\n\nI can't deny that their burgers are delicious but depending on what time and server you get, your experience will depend on service.\n\nI came to Holsteins a couple of times and the first time was great. Good service, good waiters and good food. The second time I came, it was horrrrrrrible!! The food was good as always. But the service was just terrible! The thing that angered me the most is that it was only our table receiving such bad service. We see others receiving their food promptly and watching the managers check up on them but when the manager came across our table, he straight turned away and ignored us!!! Didn't even ask if we were doing alright. Which we weren't! We waited forever to get our food and the waiter was pretty much non-existent to us! It took forever to get his attention and we even waited forever for our check even when we asked for it.\n\nThe third time, we learned better so we decided to order togo and eat in our rooms. That way, we don't have to deal with inconsistent service.\n\nAnyways, as for the food. Definitely try the billionaire burger. Hey, you're in Vegas so go big or go home! The foie gras is perfectly seared and so flavorful and the combination of the onions and truffle sauce is sooo good! So worth the price! Only $28! If you want something a little bit reasonable, the rising sun, the fun-ghi and el machete are all delicious as well! \n\nIt's surprisingly a good burger joint and is a must try if you're staying in Cosmo!"

S'Burgers are played out.\n\nThere, I said it...  It seems like no matter what major city you are in, there\'s some strong competition on who has the best burger.  It isn\'t as if we see the same thing with who has the best beshbarmak (go ahead and look it up, edu-ma-cate yourselves), right?\n\nBut with that said, I must admit, I\'m a bit of a burger fiend.  I do love me a good burger.  Always medium rare, and I also tend to look for interesting topping combinations to see how creative the kitchen is.\n\nThis is where I\'ve been going wrong all this time.\n\nYou see, something needs to be said and credit needs to be given to the places that honor the burger for what it is SUPPOSED to be.  A patty made of ground beef served between two slices of bread, usually in bun form.  Toppings are typically added to compliment the meat and bread combination.  That\'s it.\n\nIt is with that in mind that I have to say Holstein\'s does a pretty mean burger.\n\nTheir meat is spectacular.  Maybe the best beef patty out there.  Assuming they use their namesake breed, I can tell you that the beef is very flavorful, and yet holds up in its patty form without being too greasy.\n\nWe split two orders with the notion of being able to taste a couple of their burgers.  Both were quite nice, and had pretty simple toppings.  The bun is notable since it has a lovely glaze on it and holds up well to all the juices that come off the patty and toppings.  The meat, as noted before, is the star.  Toppings, at least in our case, were more like condiments that complimented the beef rather than over powering the flavors.\n\nIn a way, very simple, but done correctly.\n\nIt also needs to be said that the Frozen Grasshopper is amazing.  Imagine a Shamrock Shake with booze in it, except it still just tastes like a better version of the Shamrock Shake.  Got it?  Yep- it\'s really good...\n\nBeer selection is a\'ight.  Prices are a bit steep compared to many "gourmet" burger joints, but PLEASE REMEMBER where the hell you are.  Does ANYTHING come at a "reasonable" price on the Strip?  When you consider that fact, I\'d say Holstein\'s actually is a very reasonable place to grab a meal.'

S'I came here for snack before going to Marquee.  Holsteins offers gourmet burgers, @ very high prices.  They also offer salmon and chicken options, as well as apps like wings & calamari.  In addition, you can also get foie gras on your burger for $12 extra.  Lastly, Holsteins offers bamboozled shakes w/ liquor at $11.\n\nI ordered the Gold Standard ($18 - Dry aged beef sirloin burger w/smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli).  Sweet potato fries or rings are a $2 upgrade.  \n\nUnfortunately, the burger should have been called the "Old Standard", because it was a basic burger w/ bacon on top.  The burger wasn\'t that big, didn\'t have any distinctive flavor, and it was nothing special especially for the price.  I can get an equivalent burger & fries for much less.  The same goes for the fries.  They were nothing special:  Both 3 Stars.\n\nThe ambiance was typical sports bar w/ a bar obviously, lounge seating, and the regular dining room:  3 Stars.  The only thing that was superior was the service from Toshi the bartender.  He was super cool & friendly.  He also comped me on a drink, so I gave him the cost of the drink as an additional tip ($10):  5 Stars for Toshi.\n\nHolsteins is a pricey place to have a burger if you are staying at the Cosmo.  But I would definitely not go out of my way to come here.  However, I would go out of my way to say hello to Toshi, and just have drinks.'

S'As a vegan, I feel dirty and weird eating at a place called Holstein\'s. Why do so many themed restaurants (like burger places) think its clever to decorate their restaurant with the same animal they\'re also selling? That shit creeps me out.\n\nAnyway, they have a few vegan options here and my sister and I were in desperate need of food. Their "Urth-burger" was actually really good and had all of my favorite toppings - avocado, avocado, avocado.\n\nOh and they have an alcoholic veganized milk-shake on the menu. It is damn delicious. \n\nThey also have a DJ playing pretty good tunes as you eat. I danced to Daft Punk while I stuffed my face.'

S"I came here on a Sunday for lunch. The wait for our party of 5 was around 20 minutes which wasn't too bad considering there were shops nearby to visit in the meantime. Our server was very accommodating and had all sorts of things to recommend. He brought out free popcorn for us as starters. It tasted very interesting, like spicy BBQ...\n\nI got the Rising Sun burger which was very delicious with the fried avocado inside! Every burger also comes with a side of fries. I had ordered sweet potato fries but they gave me the regular skinny fries instead. I didn't mind because they were nice and crispy but once I let them know about the mistake, they brought out the sweet potato fries immediately which was nice. I also ordered the Frozen Grasshopper which was one of their alcoholic milk shakes with peppermint and chocolate. It was also delicious and I could not taste the alcohol at all.\n\nTip: if you check-in on foursquare and show your server, they will give you a free pint of draft beer! (we got this and the beer was very smooth and did not taste cheap at all)\n\nOverall it was a very nice experience. I loved the cute cartoony cow deco all around the restaurant. Our server even made it a point to stop by and wish me a safe drive back to California when I was standing in line for the bathroom, which was not even close to our table. I thought that was a very nice gesture and topped off our visit very well."

It really dampened the mood. \n\n Thankfully, our waitress was nicer and pretty on top of everything. We tried both kinds of fries and neither were great, but their chocolate milkshake just made it into my top three ever. \n\nMy "Longhorn" burger was delicious, but it would have been plenty of food if it were just a beef brisket sandwich, but of course there was a huge burger patty on there too... seriously filling.\n\nJim G. really summed it up great when they described the atmosphere as "bordering on douchey" ...

The macaronis were tiny little noodles. Chef boyardee style noodles. Not enough lobster and def not enough cheese.\n\nFried pickles were exactly what it was. Not a fan.\n\nCalamari was actually tasty. Not the traditional with sauce on the side. It was on the bottom of the plate and calamari on top with slices of jalape\xc3\xb1os!\n\nThe gold standard burger was ok. Supposedly the best burger in Vegas but not to my standard. I asked for medium and it came out well done. It was too charred. Only tasted the burnt meat. The idea of the burger was awesome with aged goat cheese and arugula but that\'s it. Just the idea was great. \n\nI wouldn\'t dine here. It\'s not worth the money and experience.\n\nThe shorts on the girls were cute.

This is one of the few restaurants that offer a gluten free bun, let alone a gluten free bun that is delicious, so when I found out they had this option we immediately ran to this restaurant without passing go.

Everything about it is right. You'd think a burger with that many ingredients would be overwhelming, but it's not. No wonder this burger has gotten them several well-earned awards. Everyone we know that has come to Holstein's with us has loved this burger.\n\nCaptain Hook Burger:\nGrilled Atlantic Salmon w/Frissee, Pickled Shallots, Herb-Caper Mayo & House Cured Gravlax \n\nTo be quite honest, I don't know what Gravlax is, but whatever it is I love it and will go back to Holstein's to eat it whenever my waistline can bear it. The salmon was cooked perfectly: tender in the inside with a buttery crust on the outside and definitely not greasy. If you're looking for a lighter option instead f a burger, this is the way to go.\n\nGo here. You will love every bite. If you have a gluten allergy or not, you will be able to eat their regular french fries (natural cut and good, but nothing life altering) or their sweet potato fries which are a delicious treat in a world that rarely gets sweet potato fries right. If you're looking for less fried, go with the coleslaw. So, so good. Eat up and enjoy!"

S'I had nothing but high hopes for Holsteins, sadly my dining experience did not live up to expectations. It wasn\'t that the food was bad, it was actually good. What killed the experience for me was the horrifically bad service and the ridiculously loud music.\n\nI arrived at Holsteins at about 9:15pm on a Monday night, walked up to the hostess desk, and after being ignored for a few minutes was "greeted" by the snottiest hostess in the whole world. After some exasperated sighing and excessive eye-rolling I was told that they were full, the waiting list was full, and they wouldn\'t even take my name for the waiting list until after 9:30. Boom, that was it....and then she walked away. We were aghast! WTF? Oh, GAME ON! So, I walked 3 feet away, pulled out my phone, and looked at Opentable.com. Oh hey, look at that...there are reservations available for Holsteins...now. I promptly made a reservation for 4, pushed send, got my confirmation, and walked the 3 feet back to the hostess desk. Phone in hand and with a gigantic smile on my face I greeted the snotty hostess and said I had a reservation. She once again grunted and rolled her eyes saying, "oh, are YOU Carrie?" After I happily confirmed that I was indeed Carrie...THE Carrie with the 9:30pm Opentable reservation Snotty Hostess said, "I saw that you JUST made the reservation. (Eyes rolling up a storm) There is a long waiting list, but because you JUST made a reservation I will put your name at the top of the list. But just to let you know, it might take 20 minutes or more to get you a table." I honestly have never encountered a more snotty, hostile, and unaccommodating hostess anywhere. It would serve Holsteins well to hire hostesses with temperaments more appropriate for the position.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nBam-boozled "shakes" all $11.00\n\nDrunken Monkey\nFrozen Grasshopper\nCereal Bowl\nBlack Cow\n\nThey were all fine...nothing special and not very boozey. FYI, the Black Cow is a float not a shake, despite the fact it is not marked as such.\n\nBurgers:\n\nGold Standard $17.50 - \nLonghorn $16.00\nSteakhouse burger $16.50\n\nAll the burgers were cooked perfectly and they were tasty, but the toppings were very skimpy. I have indeed "experienced better." They are served with fries...two of us chose shoestring fries and one upgraded to sweet potato fries. Sadly, both types of fries were mediocre at best. Additionally we ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes which were also mediocre.\n\nOur server was fine, but not fantastic. The music was so loud we could barely hear the waitress or carry on a conversation. Overall our experience was a less than stellar one. The experience with the snotty hostess put a taint on the evening and there was nothing that happened during the rest of our dinner that made up for it. There are way too many other restaurants in Las Vegas with bigger, better burgers and better service. I will not be returning, unless it is to punch the snotty hostess in the face (I kid! I kid!)'

The place was hectic with a Dj playing and a gathering crowd lining up outside of the Marquee.\n\nThe menu has some really good looking things on it, but everything is pretty damn expensive.\n\nI went with the gold standard burger and a side of onion rings.\n\nThe burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was really juicy and rich and had great flavor. All of the accompaniments worked well together, but worth 17.50? Not sure about that, then again it is Vegas.\n\nThe onion rings were also pretty damn good. Nice batter and seasoning with a great crunch to them. Would get them again..\n\nOverall I was pretty pleased with Holsteins. Nothing was amazing or lifechanging, but a pretty great spot for burgers and shakes although you are going to be spending some $$$"

S"My friends and I were staying at the Palazzo and I thought to try Sushisamba for my sister's bachelorette dinner.  We made reservations at 10:15pm and upon arrival the bar area and the dining area looked pretty full.  \n\nThe decor was dark and interesting, with black and white classic Japanese films airing on a large big screen and some classy art/anime con another wall.  My friend and I had a discussion about how we appreciated the scene.    \n\nTheir menu features a wide array of items: small platters, appertizers, large platters, sushi.   I checked out their menu from the Palazzo website prior so I knew what prices to expect.  We started off with a bottle of sake - they have a pretty extensive sake list - and the price was reasonable for a bottle of sake.  \n\nI had ordered the rock fish ($29) and it was prepared very elegantly and was also very very delicious -sweet and moist.  I let my friends sample my dish and everyone really enjoyed it. 2 of my friends ordered the teriyaki chicken ($25) and it wasn't your typical chicken teriyaki - the chicken was served with the bone in and was accompanied with purple mashed potatoes.  I think this was probably my favorite chicken teriyaki dish I have sampled before and the others agreed.  Others at the table ordered sushi, ramen, fries, etc.  There were 9 of us and out of the group, it impressed 3 of us (1 person was myself).  I appreciate good quality food and I thought the prices were reasonable - it is Las Vegas and it is a trendy restaurant in the Palazzo so it's expectable for the prices of cuisine.  Most restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip are usually typically pricey for the amount of food you receive anyway.  I typically like upscale restaurants.  On the other hand, the other girls at the table complained of hunger and that it was expensive.  They didn't agree that ramen for $18 was worth it - they are used to $5 ramen at a no-thrills restautant.  Yes it is only ramen, but it had a delicate lemon grass flavor, it was a decent size, and it is generally a good price for an upscale restaurant.  So this review offers insight for 2 different perspectives.  It was light fare, but perfect for going out to clubs after.  \n\nService was superb.  Our waiter served us well; had friendly casual discussions periodically, and offered to take us into Sugarcane - the club.lounge attached to the restaurant.  Granted, the club/lounge was empty and only had 2 people dancing, it was a nice gesture and this review is solely based on the restaurant.  \n\nIf you appreciate upscale quality food that emerges to be different and unique in a chic environment try Sushisamba :)"

S'Great atmosphere and awesome service!  \n\nOur server was VERY knowledgeable about the menu and she explained how to order.  She saw the confused look on our face and said "let me know your preferences, your budget and I\'ll put together a menu for you".  We all agreed that was the way to go.  She picked a GREAT combination of appetizers, sides and entrees for us to try along with a large plate of sushi.  We were all impressed with the food choose and were very happy with her selections. \n\nHere are some highlights of the dishes we tried....\n\nThe sashimi taquitos.  Lightly friend corn tortilla stuffed with various sashimi with a great salsa.\nThe pork gyoza with a sweet pumpkin sauce.  FRICKEN DELICIOUS!\nSkewered sea bass marinaded in miso.  YUM\n\nThose are just a few dishes that stood out for me.  Definitely will be back.'

S"Fun place with a great vibe. I have been to the SS in NYC and loved that as well. \n\nIn Lost Wages, everything is bigger and splashier so it is no surprise that this SS has a huge bar and restaurant with really good food.\n\nWe went last Saturday night and met the front desk staff Jason and Jeremy who took very good carte of us and even sent over a scallop wrapped in some sort of dough deal that was fantastic. We also had a crunchy roll and a yellowtail with jalape\xc3\xb1o that rocked. \n\nWine list was good, not great. Drinks might be a better way to go in the booze department. \n\nStaff was friendly and quick. maybe a touch too quick, but all was good in the end. \n\nIts a beautiful space in the Palazzo/Venetian shopping center so lots of other cool stuff to help you spend your money if there is a wait. Or, you can always go downstairs and gamble (I hear they have that in vegas now!)\n\nI'd go back next time. Solid pace as Frank might say."

The Miami locale lacked alot of the zest and pow you get in Vegas.  Out of all the ones I been to, I like vegas the best. \n\nThe Churrasco plate is wicked.

The new tokyo and topo rolls are insane good.\n\nTry this place you won't be dissapointed."

We asked him for a sake menu when we ordered our food.  No one came close enough to our table for us to flag them down and ask again, until the busser came with our food.  Then we got the menu.  But when the couple at the table next to us had water accidently splashed on them, they made a fuss over them, going out of their way to get the woman's scowl off her face.  Sushi was good, but the price tag was not worth the horrible service."

S'I almost want to give this a 5. Near oh my god moment, but not quite.\n\nThis is a little misleading. I swear this came up under "Chinese" on Yelp while we were looking for something (in a group of four) but this is definitely not Chinese. It\'s Japanese Brazilian fusion, which I had never had, but was awesome. The menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, "are you OK with raw fish," "do you have allergies," "how do you eat red meat," etc. This was helpful - usually I\'m not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason I was having problems focusing. Worth mentioning they say up front that they\'ll take back anything we don\'t like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.\n\nWhat we got was really pretty exceptional. Gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you\'re thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. All sounds fancy, all really good.\n\nThen a warm plate - grilled sea bass with a sweet glaze, filet mignon (not their A5 wagyu, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and king crab leg, all with a side of elote. The bass was good - tender and flaky, and I like the glaze. But it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. Firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at N9NE. Tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. And the crab was that near oh my god moment. An *enormous* king crab leg, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. Wow, this was exceptional. And while I guess I should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a crab leg family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.\n\nFinally, sushi. Their Neo Tokyo roll, which is their version of the spicy tuna, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. As well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. All of the cold rolls were good - I especially liked their Neo Tokyo roll. The sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...I could do without. It was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. However, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. This was about the only misstep I could find.\n\nThe atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of Brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, Brazilian slums, and Japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. Not sure what they were going for. But whatever.\n\nGreat spot - Chinese though it wasn\'t, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we\'d be back. The total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. I loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. If you\'re going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.'

Nevertheless, our sushi and sashimi tasted very fresh and of good quality. \n\nWe split a combination platter and two rolls. I can't remember exactly which rolls we got, but one roll had pear in it. I would never have imagined utilizing pear in a sushi roll, but it was a perfect compliment to the raw fish.\n\nThat experience pretty much sums up sushisamba: a contemporary take on sushi rolls. Innovated flavor combinations and fresh fish!\n\nIn typical Vegas fashion, the interior is beautifully done and sets it apart from your ordinary sushi joint.\n\nA tad pricy for sushi, but you get what you pay for, and at sushisamba you get quality and innovation. \n\nFolks this ain't your run o' the mill sushi joint!"

They're served with this garlic aioli sauce on the side and the combo is SO GOOD. I could munch on these things all day long. \n\nIt's a very trendy place but don't expect to have any intimate conversations. The music is constantly blasting in the background."

The temperature was a bit warm for a casino and music a bit blaring for my taste.  But what it really comes down to is the food, right?  The food was OK but not bad.  The Pork Belly was incredibly delicious but the Shrimp Tempura with truffle was soggy and didn't have the bite and crispy goodness a tempura typically has.  I just expected a bit more out of this brand name and really didn't do it for me.  I probably wouldn't go back.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that are worth betting on."

S"Came in for lunch on a Sunday, which was very quiet, but nice. \n\nSushi Samba is a blend of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine and they had plenty of dishes to choose from.\n\nWe got seated at the bar, which I find odd that you can't order straight from the sushi chefs that are standing right in front of you.  So it's like seating at the tables anyway, but your closer to the TVs and can stare at the fresh fishes available.  \n\nWe started with Seared Kobe Beef- ponzu gele\xc3\xa9, warm Japanese mushrooms, truffled tofu crema, I thought it was a little too salty, but overall, the dish was very good.  \n\nsashimi tiradito- Yellowtail jalape\xc3\xb1o and lemongrass- the yellowtail was fresh and the sauce was good. It was more lemongrass tasting, didn't really taste the jalapeno. \n\nanticuchos which are two skewers served with peruvian corn (double the size of normal corn and a bit harder) Sea Bass and Miso- the fish was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  This was the most recommended dish and it was worth the try.  There was no fishy taste. \n\nSamba Rolls- El Topo- salmon, jalape\xc3\xb1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion- warm rolls, very tasty, melted right in my mouth.  \n\nFor sushi, their ika was good and their sake (salmon) was pretty darn fresh tasting. \n\nTheir green tea was also very good. I believe it's $5.  \n\nOverall, the service was great and quick.  They came and refilled everything without asking.  Food was good and I can't wait to come back to try everything else."

Even the manager came over to check on us and wish us a happy valentines day and even chatted it up with us for a little while. He even brought some kind of champagne with strawberries for us at the end of our dinner. I believe his name was Jeremy so if I'm correct....then thanks Jeremy you definitely made our experience a good one. Kudos to Philip our waiter as well. He dealt with our drunk asses throughout the entire dinner and provided amazing service at the same time. \n\nWe ordered an order of the wagyu gyoza to try. Yeh we ended up ordering another 4 orders right away. I think that might give you a good idea of just how amazing this dish is. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed with it. Then we got the churrasco with like 3 or 4 different meats that came with 3 different sauces. If you've got money to spend then I definitely suggest getting this dish. The spicy tuna hand roll with spicy mayo on top was also AMAZING. Hands down the best spicy tuna hand roll I've ever had. \n\nThe two downsides to this place and the reason I took off one star is because of how pricy this place is for the amount of food they give you and the fact that their bathroom had absolutely no lights. I literally couldn't see where I was or what I was doing the entire time I was in the stall. \n\nOverall if I have a lot or extra cash to spend then I will most definitely be back for the great service and especially another helping of the wagyu gyoza and spicy tuna hand roll."

S"SUSHISAMBA fuses Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian flavors- peculiar, until you realize that Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside of Japan itself.\n\nFrom edamame to plantains, wasabi to chiles, SUSHISAMBA is a true testament to the unique tastes created by immigration and integration and the balanced evolution of these flavors over the last 100 years. \n\nHaving visited the Las Vegas location several times as well as the Miami one, SUSHISAMBA is high on my list of culinary experiences that delights time after time.\n\nAmong my favorites is Yamato roll, comprised of tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar, topped with gold leaf. At $19 for 3 pieces, you may have to take a sledgehammer to that piggy bank, but you probably won't regret it.  \n\nAnother outstanding roll is the Bobo Brazil, filled with avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, and chimichurri inside, layered with tender seared wagyu beef on the outside. Every bite melds into the tongue and disappears in a flurry of flavor.\n\nI tried the Kanpanchi Tiradito on this last visit and didn't find it worth the $19. Drizzled in yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, the 4 small slices of amberjack were acceptable but not exceptional.\n\nOn a final note, our waitress looked like a gorgeous supermodel, which worked out great in curbing my own appetite, thus making the meal more affordable. I already started a new piggy bank for next time."

I work at a magazine and if I wasn't a food snob already, eating with my boss is gradually making me one. Their brunch was a wonderful surprise! We started with freshly squeezed juice. I ordered a blueberry/strawberry/banana combo. You can mix three juices in one. My boss also ordered her own combination. The brunch is family style and up to 4 dishes for $23 each person. If you have a bigger party, the servings will be larger. We ordered Eggs Any Style, Smoked Salmon Platter, Assorted Pastries and Bread and either the el topo tamago roll or the sunday samba roll.  We ate them all up. My boss even ordered a cappucino before our drive back to LA. They have locations in Chicago and NYC as well. The menu looks the same out there too. Yum, what a great finale!

S'Let\'s just say this place is sooo scrumptious! Their Bobo Brazil is my favorite! Mmm savory seared kobe beef in a roll can\'t get better than that. Definitely recommend their spicy tuna roll as well. I love the uniqueness of their hybrid menu it\'s different in a good way. Their service is also really good. Well, except for this one cocky waiter. He introduced himself at our table as, "the best and most wanted waiter in Vegas".... seriously?'

S"I really enjoyed Craftsteak.  It's a great place if you're with a group of friends, as you can order a bunch of sides and share them, family style.  My steak was excellent, although overcooked at first - I sent it back and they got my new filet out quickly.  Good service, but pacing is very leisurely, which we expected.  If you've got tickets for a 10:00 show, you'll want to start dinner no later than 6:00."

S'Craftsteak is the absolute best way to start off a weekend in Vegas. High class all the way, I have never felt more under-dressed but the staff was so cool Victor, Edgar, and Oscar were on point.\n\nWe started off with a round of drinks, I figured sense we are in Vegas I should have a Nevada brew. The Tenaya Creek IPA was excellent along with the grilled calamari. My lady got the surf and turf while I got the dry aged T-Bone for our entree. Everything was cooked to perfection, that T-Bone steak with the filet and the skirt steak melts. baby spinach and roasted asparagus to compliment all that beautiful red meat.\n\nTheir beer and wine selection was fantastic, I believe they have over a 1000 different bottles to choice from. I also enjoyed the Dogfish 60Minute IPA on tap. To top off the night the table shared their infamous Cinnamon monkey bread and the strawberry shortcake. The atmosphere is wonderful, one of the best meals of my life.'

S"If you have the money and the time I would definitely recommend the chefs tasting menu.  I went into it thinking it was going to be little bites of food here and there. It started with our maitre d' asking if we wanted an alcoholic drink.  I decided to have sparkling water (two bottles in total) which I later came to find out was 8 bucks a piece.  It was a good addition to the rich food but helped our final bill climb. I can't remember all of the items that ended up coming to our table but every one of them was substantial and oh so tasty.  The mashed potatoes are a must have even if you are just having a steak get the potatoes you will enjoy them.  The meats including Wagyu skirt, strip and lobster melted in my mouth.  The lobster came with a parsnip butter sauce.  All I can say was oh my goodness.  It also came with the potatoes I mentioned earlier, asparagus, wild mushrooms and a grain of some kind.  When dessert came out they had brought several different plates and I was expecting to get to pick one.  OH NO they all were for me.  Cheese cake, two kinds of ice cream, chocolate mousse, seasonal berries and the ever so delicious monkey bread.  By the time the bill came it was just around 400.00 including tip.  The experience was worth it for this foodie.  My full tummy felt like it was going to burst for hours after and was pretty uncomfortable even the next day."

S"I'm not sure what's happened here.  The service is still great, but the quality of the meat was really different than when we were here last.  We ordered the bone-in ribeye and it was chain grocery store quality at best.  You know how lower grade meat has that mealy texture?  We ordered it medium rare and it was still that way.  We were really disappointed because the last time we were here it was a delicious experience.  Maybe their purveyors are pulling a fast one on them.  To be fair, we are used to prime steakhouses and this wasn't listed as prime...but we still didn't expect it to be as low in quality as it was."

The malbec didn't go with the meal as well as I had hoped it would, but I forgot how hard that can be to pair with food.  I didn't realize the sides would be as salty as they were.  That meal needed something like a pinot noir.   My wife had the sea scallops and she absolutely loved them.  The staff recommended the monkey bread for dessert, and they sure were right on that one.  I paired it with a glass of madeira, and that was a homerun.  I got that one right, anyway.\n\nI would give this place 4 1/2 stars if it let me.  I can't give it five, though.  It is a great dining experience.  Next time, I am going to splurge on that Kobe skirt steak."

S'Each time i visit a new city, one of the first things that i check is if one of my favourite contestants from Top Chef has opened up a restaurant in that particular city.  Well, i thought it was about time to switch our focus from contestants to judges.  I will admit that when i first started watching Top Chef, i had never heard of Tom Colicchio, i blame part of it on being Canadian.  So on our recent trip to Vegas we made sure to make a reservation at Craftsteak.  We walked from the Trump hotel, and really underestimated how long the walk would take.  We were about 10 minutes late, but luckily and surprising the restaurant was behind schedule.  We ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes to be seated.  Upon walking into the restaurant it was grand, and the sheer size was impressive.  Our server shortly came over and we both placed a drink order for a pomegranate martini.  The drink had pomegranate, lime and tequila.  The drink wasn\'t memorable, it was very straightforward, i was expecting something different for $15.  I did appreciate though how each drink came in a mini shaker and was poured tableside.  For our mains, we both ordered a steak (sorry i dont remeber the cut), and 2 sides per person.  I had the sunchokes, and shiitakes, and my sis had the fingerling potatoes, and mushrooms.  We debated about how many sides we should order, they averaged about $15 each, i would\'ve preferred one each but i was expecting the portion size to be miniscule.  This is my issue, a server works at a restaurant day in and day out, they are experts, and when we ordered our mains and four sides, he should have stepped in and and be honest and say that that would be enough for two linebackers, not too young ladies.  I have read Waiter Rant, i know that servers drive up the bill for a bigger tip, but if he was straight forward and suggested something lighter, for a similar price, i would have respected him.  Our food arrived to the table and the steak look great, but the only thing that i could look at were the sides, and how i just wasted so much of my hard earned money on food i knew that i couldn\'t finish.  Each side was good but at the end of the day it was roasted in fat, and served, that was it, it was very basic.  I was unimpressed with the entire concept of the restaurant.  I know that it is a steakhouse, so you order your meat and sides, but the whole meal was disjointed, it was simply meat, mushrooms, and starch.  I wish that there was a sauce to bring the entire meal together.  I wanted to eat at Toms and get his vision, i didn\'t get it, i was so disappointed.\nOverall, i am going to use a line of Toms that i recently heard him recite on Top Chef, "you go to a restaurant for the food, and you return for the service", unfortunately i wont be going back for either.'

S'It was good but I expected so much more.  I was craving steak and getting to go to Tom Colicchio\'s famous high end restaurant meant my expectations were high.  We ordered three different steaks and sides so we could get a good sample.  Out of the three steaks, only the Ribeye is something I would have applauded, and it\'s pretty hard to mess up a Ribeye.  I hate to say it but I\'ve had better steak at Outback Steakhouse.\n\nWith all that said I would have given this place a solid three stars, but it was the service that took it down one more.  Three steaks, three sides, a bottle of wine, a check that was over $400 and we were pretty much ignored by the waitstaff.  Patty at Denny\'s down the street had better customer service.\n\nI hate to say it but I can\'t see myself trying this place again, nor would I recommend it if someone asked "I\'m going to Vegas, where should we eat?"\n\nSorry Tom.'

S'Solid meal. Service was almost impeccable. \n\nI took my husband here for his 30th birthday. What better place to take a dude than to a steak house right? RIGHT!\n\nWe went with the domestic wagyu chef\'s tasting menu. They say "three courses" but what they mean is you get three rounds of food piling up at your table. There were multiple appetizers, multiple steaks, and multiple desserts. If there was something you really wanted - they were pretty accommodating in making any changes.\n\nOn top of the three course meal - we also ordered a dozen little neck clams.\n\nAppetizers + the clams came out and they were outstanding. The clams were fresh and delicious and the appetizers were really good. I hate to say this - but I\'d even say the appetizers stood out more than the steak (I know... blasphemy for a steak place). The shrimp were the highlight of the appetizer section followed really closely by the clams.\n\nThe steaks: I can\'t remember... but we got 4 different cuts of steak and a bunch of sides - including the really delicious mashed potatoes. Although by this point, we were literally bursting to the seams. We ended up packing 1/2 away for snack later.\n\nDessert - 4 different desserts - although one of them is a fruit plate but I think that still counts since it wasn\'t just fruit cut up... At this point we were just trying to eat whatever wouldn\'t keep for a few hours because our stomachs were packed.\n\nWhile the three course tasting was fun - I\'d probably do this place a la carte. The portions were ridiculous for 2 people and I felt like I couldn\'t enjoy my steak as much since I was pretty much full after all the appetizers. \n\nOverall, worth a visit - but come with a hungry stomach!'

S'Craftsteak the second time around was as superb as the first. The tasting menu is tough to pass off, but I had to try the short-ribs. I definitely see what the excitement is all about! TRY THE SHORT RIBS.\n\nI paired these with a Sandrone. Also, the waitress let me know that some snap pees had just come in that afternoon and reccomended them.

S"The wagyu skirt steak was pretty awesome.  I am not a big fan of wagyu cuz its like eating a fat piece of fois gras.  I should like fat on fat cuz i am fat but its just too fatty for me.  WTF happened to the Fatty A.  Lame.  The skirt steak was perfect cuz the meat is tougher but with the extra fat it was perfect.  I compared it to the bone in rib eye and both had different flavors and texture.  The only bad part of the meal was ordering wine at this joint.  The winelist is massive and it took them over 30 minutes to get someone to take my wine order.  Lamers.  We tried a bottle of the Vineyard 29 but I wasn't impressed.  -1 suckaz."

Despite sitting at the bar, however, the ambiance was perfect with low lighting, fresh baked breads, and very curteous staff.\nThe food is the average american fare of steaks, sea food, and salads; prepared with simple ingredients, served a la carte, at not so simple prices.  One filet and one steak, asparagus and garlic potatoes au gratin on the side, chased down by two jack daniels and a coke: $175.00.  Good food, but not worth the price.'

S"made reservations for 5:15pm (the earliest they could seat you) because we had to catch a 7:30pm show in new york new york. \n\nThey seated us right away and we were given a menu. We ordered the prosciutto ($14) for appetizer, which was basically a ginormous plate full of proscuitto slices. For some reason I thought it was going to be served with something else, not just plain prosciutto. However, it was the best tasting prosciutto I had in my life, recalling back to the taste of fresh ham from my childhood in Bolivia, though thinner and chewier, and possibly fresher. \n\nentree: I ordered the bison ($39), and my bf ordered the kobe flat iron steak ($58, if i remember correctly). The bison was tastier than beef. I chose it because I read it on yelp somewhere that bison is just really good. I thought I'd try it at Tom's restaurant so I could blame him if it sucked. It didn't. It was juicy, tender, lean, and it had a kick to it. My bf's kobe was a hit. He said that it doesn't hit you (how good it is) until you're about to swallow. I'd say the taste and texture of kobe definitely develops as you chew it. Perhaps next time, we can try the wagyu (still have yet to try it).\n\nFor sides, we got the yukon mashed potatoes ($11), and the asparagus ($11). Next time, I'd just get the mashed potatoes and save myself an extra $11. The asparagus was great, too, but it wasn't to die for like the prosciutto or the mashed potatoes (which also tasted like my childhood mashed potatoes that were made with fresh cow milk and loads of butter).\n\nOur server asked us what kind of wine, if any, we would like to pair with our steak. I asked him what went well with bison, since I never had it before. He suggested the pinot noir. I personally like zinfandel with everything so he gave me samples of each to taste (I chose the zinfandel, $17). My bf sampled the merlot and the shiraz and went with the shiraz ($18). \n\nThe total bill was $204, tax & tip included.\n\nthe experience? priceless. I'd say this is the best steak house we've gone to so far. \n\nThe only pet peeve I have is eating a steak that gets colder and colder as you eat. I'm sure there is SOME way to combat that, considering that some steakhouses serve your steak on 500 degree plates or cast iron skillets that are still hot. \n\nWe told our server that we had a show to catch and we were out by 6:45pm. However, the wait time for our food was about 45 minutes. We're not the most patient people but I think this is somehow normal in vegas.\n\nI'd totally go back, and with more money next time."

S"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.  Why am I giving it 4 stars?  It's because it's so damn expensive.  The steak and the sides were great, the portions were humongous, the desserts were delightful, but was it worth $460 for 2 people?  Uhhh....not so  much.  Yes the meal was better than your run of the mill chains like Claim Jumper or TGI Fridays, but for half the price at a place at let's say....Ruth Chris' Steak House, I would say I'd stick with that.  We had the pre-set menu with the American Wagyu Surf N Turf.  For a special occasion, like Valentines Day, yes it is well worth it.  But would I go on a regular basis?  Probably not, I'm going to stick with Morton's or Maestro's for my usual Steak cravings."

I have no idea what else is in here besides Yukon Potatoes and Butter, but whatever it is, holy crap it is addicting.  This innocuous, off-white color side dish packs flavor and velvety smooth texture and flavor and orgasms and flavor some more all into a copper serving bowl.  This dish singularly revived my love for potatoes.  Now, on to the steaks.\n\nI will give my shout out to our waiter for the evening on this one.  So I was part of a bachelor party of 8 gents, and we could not decide on entrees.  So as a group, we all decided to splurge on the Wagyu/Kobe taster at the server's recommendation.  OH MY GOD.   Thank you restaurant gods for blessing us with an awesome server.  The recommendation on the taster was spot on.  We got wagyu/kobe filet, ny strip, rib eye, skirt steak and flat iron.

Potato puree (basically mashed potatoes), quail, and chocolate souffle dessert were the standouts and all very very good (the souffle AMAZINGLY so.) But for entrees, both types of steaks were just okay..scallops were pretty lousy. I've made better myself, and they were on the smallish side. You'd expect big juicy plump ones considering you only get TWO! Ironically, they serve you HUGE PORTIONS of everything else. It really is way too much food. \n\nThey focus on quantity over quality, for reals.\n\nOther than the food, the service was great, and the ambiance is kinda cool...not what I was expecting though.

The saut\xc3\xa9ed mushroom variety is surprisingly good but the dinner rolls are enough to fill you up before the steak.  The service is pretty good and the attire is casual so you don't have to get really dressed up.  Reservations are a must."

S"WOW!! \nLet's start with their fresh petite oysters! OMG, i can have more of that as my entree.  The ambiance is very elegant; beautiful lighting; made it perfect for any special occasion.  Glad that we went here on our first nite out on the Strip.  He had the NY Steak (which was crazy good) while i had Scallops and the asparagus was prepared in perfection. The services was pretty awesome too. Definitely a must go to for any of you celebrating something very special and would like something intimate."

S"I  visit Vegs primarily for the eating extravaganzas and the buffset, but maybe in between, I just might throw in a visit to Craftsteak.  I mean hey If you've won a notable amount of dirty cash and you're looking for a worthy meal to splurge on, this is where you absolutely must go. \n\nIt is recommended that reservations are made, unless you like to spend a lot of time people watching in the casino.\n\nThe setup/ambiance is very contemporary, but not ostentatiously  trendy. The strategically dimmed lighting seems to bring out your dinner mates' best features, and possibly hides a bit of that post meal pouch you'll be harboring later on. \n\nStarted off with the mozzarella caprese salad. It seems simple enough but I think it was prepared very well, or it could have been the presentation. In any event,  this already got my mouth watering for my second course, the rib eye cooked bloody rare. Holllly! Bite after bite and I could barely contain my tummy fairies from playing their golden harps around me.  It was just that f@cking good. The hangar steak and filet mignon were just as good, but I fancy the slight buttery marble in my prime rib.  Got the mushroom risotto as a side and there I was, yet again, trying to contain my excitement over excellent meal. This was by far, the best risotto I have ever spooned into my greedy little mouth. Everything was so masterfully prepared, I can't even express that enough without sounding redundant.\n\nI really wish I had room for dessert because my eyes ooogled as I saw goodies passing by me to and fro, but sadly, I was defeated! Sigh. \n\nEither way, I was in awe over and over again as each food item crossed my lips....\n\nOh and service was stellar. \n\nA typical 3 course meal will set you back about $90 with gratuity, oh it ain't cheap, but it's sooooooooooooooo worth it. I can't wait for the tummy fairies to sing their tunes to me again......"

S'I had high expectation I know it\'s $$$$.  I was excited to finally be able to try Kobe beef... Although I was only getting the American version, I was still excited.  As you can see from my profile I love meat... love it!  Yes a PETA member -- you know people for the eating of tasty animals!  So we made reservations for a Fri. night.  Was very exited and got there a bit early, so we were showed to the bar to wait for our table.  We didn\'t even finish our first round and we were ushered to our table.  \n\nWhat we ordered (party of two):\nWe decided not to go for the tasting menu but we did order the tasting wine flights.\nStarter - Foie gras --- Yes even though I\'m a proud supporter of  PETA , I couldn\'t help to feel just a bit bad about ordering this.  But once I tasted it, all my concerns were gone.  This stuff was outstanding.  This was very rich but the wine (Conundrum) paired very well to cut some of the richness.  Only complain I had was that it only came with 2 pieces of toast.  The foie portion it self was big but had to use the bread on the table in order to finish the dish.  Would have love some more of the toast. \nMain - American Wagyu (rib eye my fav. cut)  bar none the best rib eye I\'ve ever tasted.  It was just perfect, met my expectations.  For 105 bucks it better!\n          - Braised short ribs - what can I say, nice tender piece of heaven.  \nSides - Wild mushroom risotto - very good \n            - Yukon puree - also very good\nI didn\'t pay attention much to the sides as I didn\'t want to fill up any valuable stomach real-state with the sides.\ndessert - ordered the dessert tasting menu. By this point I was in a meat coma so I couldn\'t really tell much but from what I remember it was good.\nOverall it was a wonderful dining experience very nice service, great decor and ambiance, and the food it was up to and even exceeded my expectations.  Yes it\'s pricey but what do you expect when you visit a sin city "fine dining"  establishment.  Would definitely come back, next time hopefully I will have a  better craps session so I can blow all the winnings here.'

S"My boyfriend and I made reservations to dine here because his friend highly recommended this steak house.  Our reservation was on December 27. 2011, at 6PM.  We arrived on time and was seated promptly. The decor was simple, yet elegant.  Think lots of dark wood and spacious seating arrangements.  \n\nOur waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested we go with the chef's tasting menu.  For $120 per person, we were on our way to sample a trio of starters, a dual of angus steaks, a trio of side dishes, and FOUR different desserts!  The fourth dessert was added because I mentioned we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday (even though it was still days away, LOL).  \n\nFor starters, we were served the cocktail prawns, warm frisee salad, and the lobster bisque.  The prawns were perfect.  My favorite starter was the salad.  It was just absolutely delicious. \n\nFor sides to accompany our steaks, we were served the mashed potatoes, mushroom assortment, and risotto.  My favorite was the mushrooms.  Our angus steaks included one ribeye and one New York strip.  Both were prepared perfectly.\n\nAs you can imagine, when dessert time rolled around, we were already pretty stuffed.  $120 per person is on the expensive side, but the chef really gives you way more than enough food.  For dessert, we were served the cinnamon monkey bread, sorbet,  farmer's market fruit plate, and a flourless chocolate cake with ice cream.  The monkey bread was my favorite.  It tasted like a gourmet cinnamon roll.\n\nOverall, the service was superb and the food was good.  I wouldn't say it's the best steak I ever had, but as far as the tasting menu goes, it's the best value.  However, we ate only half of the food and couldn't take it back to the hotel because we were off to see Ka."

S"I was absolutely appalled at this meal. I would have been mortified to serve it and the behavior of the staff made it all the worse. My steak was inedible and as I have pointed out, I do not return food to the kitchen. Either they get it right the first time or I don't want them near my food for another go round. When I left my steak uneaten the server asked if I enjoyed it. Really? What did he think?\nI pointed out that it was inedible and he told me if I only let him know, he would have brought me another. But at this point, it was too late.\n\nHe explained this often happens and they just serve it to the pigs. Gosh, thanks. The pigs? So it's either me or the pigs. Nice visual. \n\nRather then an apology or can we bring you a glass of wine, a few other employees made their way over and short of actually making it right, let us leave feeling like we we had done something wrong. Maybe it because we weren't dining with movie stars. I'm not sure what it was but something just didn't click.\n\nWith so many fabulous restaurants in Las Vegas, this one should be avoided. Bad food and rude wait staff and a $300.00 bill. What more could I ask for?"

S"Yelp really needs a 1/2 star increment, because this place deserves 4.5 stars.\n\nI have to admit, I don't watch Top Chef, don't know who Tom Colicchio is other than lots of ppl made a fuss about him.  Still, I enjoyed my experience here...\n\nAtmosphere is accessible, and feels like a welcome respite from the ridiculousness occuring just outside its doors at the MGM Grand.  But you're not here for that reason...\n\nYou're here for some oustanding steak.  Craftsteak is proud to explain the difference between Angus, Grade 7 Wagyu beef, and Grade 10 Wagyu beef.  Served simple, medium rare, and with little to get in the way of the flavor and texture of what may be the best steak I ever had (I did the grade 7 Wagyu - awesome).\n\nOne more thing - dessert included a chocolate torte with bacon ice cream.  I'm an instant believer.\n\nOnly knock on this place -- we went with the table-wide 3 course prix fixe.  Grade 7 Wagyu with lobster was $155/person (does not include drinks).  While it offered more options in appetizers, steak (we could sample across the NY Strip, filet, and ribeye), the portions were larger than they needed to be, and the quantity of dessert served was just plain obnoxious and felt a bit wasteful.\n\nStill, if you want an amazing steak experience, give Craftsteak a try!"

S"I suppose that I have some explainin' to do, considering that my group of 3 friends and I dropped $500 on dinner here yet only gave it 3 stars. \n\nSo, let me start with the sides. We tried the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, gold yukon potato puree and asparagus. The hen of the woods mushrooms were quite good, but nothing I can't put together myself. They had no great sauce, no POW factor. The gold yukon potatoes were fine - nice potatoes that were boiled and pureed to baby-food texture. No special or unique flavors going on there. Finally, I'm convinced the asparagus was just microwaved in some water. Very poor effort there, guys. Considering each of these dishes was $15-$25, I'm very disappointed. \n\nNow, onto some better things. I had the lobster bisque which was very good. Nice and creamy with succulent chunks of lobster. The only complaint I have, if it even counts, is that they served me a ton. It was very rich and I didn't have a cup of bisque, it was a giant bowl. \n\nOn to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here, nothing; just pure steak goodness. It was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered. \n\nOverview: The service was impeccable. The wine list was extensive (however out of our price range, at $125 per person without drinks). Though the steaks and bisque were great, the sides were eerily reminiscent of my grandmothers (terrible) cooking. I think Craftsteak is a poor value for your buck, therefore I'll give it 3/5 - A-OK."

The ambience in this place just screams sexy.........as I sat in my comfy sofa seat.\n\nI ordered the lobster bisque, rib-eye steak and sides of spinach and fries.\n\nThe bisque and super tasty warm buttery roll melted in my mouth.\nAfter eating the bisque and rolls, I could of left fully satisfied.....\n\nThe rib-eye steak was fuckingoutstanding...............perfect......\nwithout the need for any seasoning..........\n\nThe sides were good, but the steak, bisque and rolls\nwill keep me coming back.........!!!!\n\nThe host and mgr came by to ask me about my meal.......I was so hot.........after eating that I could of f.......ed them both.\n\nIt was that good!'

HELLZ YAH!\n\nSTOP filling up on bread Doug...yes, you can have these too...bread was good.\n\nAs a group of 6, we opted for their special taster.  4 of us even got the wine taste which included a red, a white, and a dessert.  the dessert wine was from italy, very sweet...very delicious.\n\nThey are able to provide alternatives, like huge scallops, for non-red meat eaters.  Sorry Win, might not be the best place for you,  but I want my steak.\n\nCaren, we were there for the same weekend...our scallops were awesome, steaks were good but not the best I've had.  I didn't touch the quail, i used to have some as pets.  Don't ask...\n\nIt was fun tryin the 5 types of steaks, judging them, then eating more.\n\nThe potato puree was well whipped creamy mashed potatoes....mmmmmm\n\nThere was this bread pudding....very nice.  i normally do not eat bread pudding, but I had to try this one.  The pear ice cream, sorbet...very interesting in a good way.\n\nBring friends here for a nice dinner in Vegas.  It is an experience to at least try it for once.\n\nlocated in the back of the MGM, bathrooms are outside.  i love the hanging lights."

S"First off, I can't believe I just got scooped in Vegan reporting by Becky M., who posted her review a couple of days ago.  I am shamed.  I went to Craftsteak when my meat-loving friend was in town celebrating her b-day, and agreed to check out what a steakhouse could do for a vegan.\n\nI called to confirm that they could hook me up, and they totally came through!  We suspected that they'd be able to do something, considering that Tom gave the Top Chefs the challenge of cooking a vegetarian dinner.... but I was super impressed with the wide variety of options.\n\nI started with the Persian cucumber salad with watercress and ginger dressing.  Delish! Very fresh and crisp and vegan without any modifications.  Also tried the vegan roasted red pepper with sliced garlic appetizer.  Simple but the flavors paired very well.  \n\nFor my dinner, they created a plate of mixed veggie sides (there are about 40 veggie sides - some are vegan, some vegetarian, and some have meat bits in them).  I had broccolini (even the meat eaters were swooning over this), sauteed spinach, grilled asparagus, grilled sweet corn niblets, chanterelle mushrooms, and fried Jerusalem artichokes.  Everything was done very well, and I got way more food than I could eat for ~$34.  I would totally suggest having someone at the table order this even if you do eat meat just so you can try a variety of sides.  Because the sides are HUGE.  Definitely enough for 2-3 people to share.  \n\nI was even able to have dessert - chocolate sorbet -- it was creamy and delicious and not too heavy after a giant dinner.\n\nI was very impressed with the staff's understanding of the vegan diet and was surprised to hear that I was the 3rd vegan there that night! So despite what people have said in reviews below, you SHOULD go here if you're vegan or vegetarian.\n\nEverything was pretty reasonably priced considering the size of the dishes and the fact that it's the Strip.  We had 3 salads, my vegan plate, two meat entrees + two sides, 3 desserts and multiple cocktails and our bill was around $350 (thanks to Becky, who was my sugar momma that night!)."

S'Who comes to CraftSteak and doesn\'t get the Wagyu tasting menu??\n\nIf you\'re going to splurge, this is the place to do it. I always go for the Surf & Turf Wagyu Tasting and I\'m never disappointed. Alright, I\'ll say that the Ceasar Salad isn\'t a highlight but again, you\'re going to a restaurant with the word \'Steak\' in the name so that definitely sets expectations.\n\nThe lobster is divine totally bathed in butter - I can feel myself getting fatter is write this... and I love it. The skirt is my favorite - so rich and buttery, it literally melts in your mouth. Everything is served family style so your best bet is to come with a group so you can sample everything. The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous. And to end everything, dessert ranges from assorted sorbets to mixed berry cobbler to my personal favorite... monkeybread!\n\nThe service is literally impeccable. They\'re kind, courteous and engaging not to mention they\'re at your table all the time to see if you need anything. This last time, I came for my anniversary and not only did the waiter comp us a bottle of Muscato but also ANOTHER dessert that had, "Happy Anniversary" with our names written in chocolate. He was also kind enough to make reservations at L\'atelier Joel Robuchon for us for the next night.\n\nWe dropped easily $400 for the 2 of us that night but if there were any restaurant worth doing it at, CraftSteak would be it (well, aside from French Laundry, of course :)'

S"This restaurant makes all of its patrons who walk out feel sorry for vegetarians. I'm sorry, but it's true.\n\n5 Stars. Times a million.\n\nSometimes the best approach for eating out is deferring to others' wisdom. Here, that approach really paid off. Came here for my buddy's bachelor party dinner and luckily we had a Craftsteak veteran with us (Thanks YE Steven H!). This helped the ordering process go along a lot more smoothly.\n\nOriginally we were just planning to order for ourselves, but our wily veteran felt that it would be better if we ordered the multiple cuts and shared that among us instead. Our server understood and was very accommodating, which eventually led to us getting full stacks of appetizers, desserts, and of course, THE STEAK.\n\nI've had Kobe beef in Kobe, Japan, but this was heads and shoulders above my experience there. Every bite melts in your mouth and the juices were so good that I needed more of those delicious rolls to sop up the remaining sauce. Even our friend who usually likes his meat a little more cooked through had to give it up that these medium-rare cuts of marbled beef were sublime. That being said, even though the meat was excellent, the accompanying sides of asparagus, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes were so freaking delicious that you don't mind it taking up space otherwise reserved for the beef.\n\nDessert came out after we were already stuffed, but we made room for the Monkey Bread (aka the Elegant Cinnabon), Ice Cream & Sorbets, Dark Chocolate Tart, Bread Pudding, and fresh fruit. Great finish.\n\nI honestly think if we paid twice as much, it would still be worth it."

S"Given the more than ample supply of dining options (and steakhouses) in Vegas, I don't think I'll come here again (for a very long time).\n\nThe food quality was good.  Quality meat indeed.  But I would expect that a restaurant specializing in steak would know how to cook its quality steak to the specifications of medium rare, medium well, etc.  \n\nUnfortunately, that wasn't the case.  My bf's medium rare request for his filet mignon was translated into an almost medium well steak.  He had to send his back and then the second stead still wasn't cooked medium rare (it was more medium).  My request for a medium well steak, but closer to well than medium resulted in a well done steak.  I generally don't find medium well steaks to be dry, but this one was dry.  I expected more from a steakhouse.  Perhaps the lesson learned is order your steak cooked a little less than you normally would. \n\nDespite the steak cooking issue, there were some highlights to the meal.  \n\nThe beef tartare was good.  I was very pleasantly surprised since the idea of eating raw meat is rathering repulsing to me most of the time.\n\nTheir potato puree was delicious.  I could have taken a straw and drank that up. \n\nThe chocolate souffle dessert was amazinggg.  Yum, yum, yum!  On the side was some caramel ice cream which was equally delicious. \n\nIt was a good dinner, but it just didn't live up to the hype.  I wish I was reviewing how good the steak was instead of how good the sides were."
