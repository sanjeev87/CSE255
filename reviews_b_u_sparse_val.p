S'I have been here a few times, first and foremost the service is always impeccable. Friendly, welcoming and they like to chat and have a joke.\n\nFood is right up my street, combination of flavours from across the med done in a sharing style. Starters we all opted for the mezze, no less than 14 dishes appeared before us with breads as well - so tasty lots of flavours going on and very fresh tasting NOM NOM NOM.\n\nFor mains I went for a sea-bass dish that was spiced and served with a bean and sun dried tomato salad. Very very tasty!!!!! Fish was perfectly cooked, the spice added flavour while keeping the great taste of the fish, and the serving was huge. Very very happy JD!!\n\nDesert was a tough one - in the end I opted for a scoop of raspberry sorbet and one of pistachio ice cream!! Should they go together you may well ask??? Many would say no....but I say say.....YES!!! The sorbet is packed full of taste but is possibly too tart so the pistachio adds a earthy richness that offsets it nicely between mouthfuls!!\n\nAdd to that a nice little wine list and these Aberdonian boys are doing the tastes of the middle east a huge boost!! Recommend happily!!\n\nAs for the last star - for the setting, for the style, for what it could be, I think they need to refine things a little more to hit that high note!'

S"I went to OT's for lunch the other day and had a good experience.  Although I've lived and/or worked near the 24th and Camelback  area for several years now, this was my first time in.  I finally went because my dining companion suggested we meet there.  \n\nService was attentive and it was the perfect place for a business lunch.  I had the Oriental Chicken Salad and they accommodated my request for holding the wontons and adding avocado.  I liked that it included mango and the miso dressing was delicious!  My friend had the french onion soup to start and the BBQ Pulled Pork Panino sandwich.  He seemed to enjoy it.  He picked up the bill (lucky me), but I think it was moderately priced - maybe even a bit expensive for what we received.  The portions were not huge and we were not offered a bread basket that I recall.\n\nRegardless, this was ideal for our lunch meeting...  we didn't have to wait and we could hear each other speaking.  They validate your parking in the garage so it's pretty convenient as well.  I'd like to go back on a Friday or Saturday night to experience their live entertainment and perhaps another selection from their dinner menu... but until then, 3 stars is the rating I give to OT's.  It was good - nothing more, nothing less!"

They have this large air circulating system (or whatever it is) that makes a lot of noise and also takes up counter seats and is a huge eye sore.

S'I stopped at Fernando\'s during lunch time on a Friday.  It was bustling like many of the places downtown during lunch.  There was a line like expected, but it moved very efficiently and the people behind the counter were direct, but not in any way rude.  They ask if you want all the normal toppings in a nice way and didn\'t seem to mind many people not wanting different toppings.  The place was tidy and what\'d you expect out of a sandwich shop.\nNow the food.  They have a daily lunch specials that make a sandwich a "meal" by adding a fountain drink and a bag of Herr\'s chips.  I ordered the Sante Fe Steak Taco wrap and allowed them to put everything on it that they normally do -- tomatoes, black olives, mild peppers, lettuce, steak, and cheese.  Next time I think I will opt for jalapenos.  The wrap was toasted, but was really soggy and did not end up looking anything like the pictured wrap, man that pictured wrap looked so toasty and delicious.  My wrap was good don\'t get me wrong, but I was hoping for more.  It was a good size for a good price and they throw in any dipping sauce you want, I got their house Southwestern.  I really liked what I saw from the subs coming out for other people, so I will go to Fernando\'s again soon and grab a sub.  Maybe I\'ll even update update my rating.  \nAgain it\'s losing stars only for the sogginess.  Go check out Fernando\'s to replace your Subway or Jimmy John\'s sub.\n\n***Edit***\n\nOrdered the Bacon Beef and Cheddar toasted sub.  It was good, but again just not great.  I still prefer Fernando\'s over DiBellas, Jimmy Johns, and Subway as far as sub places downtown.  It just falls short when stacked up against other sub places.'

S'The bean dip was good.  That was it.  Everything else was just bad.  To be fair we showed up for an early dinner, 4pm on a Saturday, which is pretty much the worst time you can go to a restaurant.\n\nThe service was slow, but I expected that due to the time we arrived.  What I did not expect was way overcooked tamales, cheese enchiladas that were somehow actually bad.  Beef tacos that were inedible.\n\nMy shredded beef enchilada was decent.  I know this is not supposed to be super amazing Mexican food.  It is supposed to be OK americanized and somewhat boring mexican food.  After we left, I told my wife that half way through the meal, I wondered if I was going to get food poisoning.  She remarked that she had thought the same thing.'

S"If you're in the Pointe and you feel the need for chicken O Bico is an a-ok spot to stop for a bite. You will be disappointed if you set your expectations based on the type of Portuguese chicken that you'd find on the Plateau, this is not Romados.\n\nO Bico has some good diversity on the menu which includes Calamari, Chorizo Poutine (what gluttony) and even a Vegetarian Sandwich. I had the vege sandwich and fries which I enjoyed and my friends both had a quarter chicken. We all missed out on the spicy sauce which we didn't see sitting on the counter until it was too late, but I'm sure that this would have improved the chicken a notch. Overall there was nothing to rave about, but certainly nothing to complain about either.\n\nI wouldn't make a special out of your way trip to eat here. But, if you're in the hood it is certainly a good spot to stop in to grab an affordable bite to eat. Oh and they have Sumol, a fruit flavoured Portuguese soft drink. be sure to order one with your meal."

S"I first ate at Graze Desert Grille last year when this North Scottsdale resort was called Xona (it's now Zona). I believe this grille had a different name then, too. I stayed at this resort facility while in town looking for an apartment.  \n\nLast year I had breakfast a couple of times, and I remember that it was really good. You can choose items, including healthy care, from the menu or you can take advantage of the breakfast buffet. Fast forward to now, when I live here and saw a post on Facebook about their brunch. I decided to drive up there after church last Sunday and have lunch. The place was quiet and I took a spot at the bar, where I was well taken care of. I had the Chicken Sonoran sandwich with avocado slices and their sweet potato fries with ranch. Yum!\n\nThe service was great, and I was kinda glad there weren't many people in there...I was looking for some peace and quiet. The only thing I would change is to add more items to the menu. \n\nTips: \n-- Drive in via Zona's main entrance and park in the parking lot there (in front of the main doors, as if you were parking to check in). As you're walking towards the main entrance, bear left and Graze is there by the patio. \n-- The patio has misters!"

Every curry dish I have had hear is scrumptious! i have heard one person complaining that the curry wasn't authentic South Indian. I can't really comment on this, but I can give the taste and presentation a thumbs up! And for me that's what a mattered.\n\nPrices are pretty reasonable. I ate here with a friend, with two courses and it cost us around \xc2\xa325.\n\nAlso note that its BYOB.

The food is good, home-made fresh and with more than the usual tuna&sweetcorn fillings.

S'I cannot believe how amazing this restaurant is! The owner was opening the door for me as I walked up, and was extremely personable and welcoming.  The restaurant is small and cozy, and the food was by far the best Italian I\'ve had in any part of Arizona! Their spinach ravioli was to die for, their beverages are cold and refreshing, and the desserts...don\'t even get me started! I asked the owner what he would recommend for dessert so he brought me a canoli and a "brownoli", which is a brownie stuffed with canoli cream and dusted with powdered sugar. It is probably my new favorite treat on the planet!! I would definitely and will definitely visit this restaurant on a regular basis, as the owner was very kind (and hilarious), and the food was both reasonably priced and delicious!'

S"Craving Chinese, so we went back to this location today. Chow Mein bowl is threads away from being empty, but do you think they were making any? NO. Same thing happened the last time I was here. I think they may need to install some type of monitor to let the cooks know when the Chow Mein is almost gone. The young lady serving the food was very nice, but she was literally doing everything while the 2 cooks  just stared at the food cooking...and by food, I don't mean Chow Mein. When we first got there we were the only ones in line. By the time we left there was a line 7 deep...know what they were waiting for? CHOW MEIN. To the owners/managers of this particular franchise. You really should read what people are writing. The food tastes good, but honestly I will drive a little further to get better service, or at least Chow Mein that is made with some forethought."

S"The draw and appeal of this restaurant is probably the name :) . While that is enough to put people through the doors, you are hoping to have decent food.  At times, the service was spotty and disorganized, where one server would show up right after another dealt with your table.  The manager who checked up on us was quite cordial though.\n\nThe restaurant is mainly opened for breakfast and lunch, which is clear when you take a look at the menu.  The thing that's clear is that there's more focus on the brunch aspect of the menu.  The burger ordered means well, but there was one technical flaw that hampered enjoyment.  While some enjoy having their burgers cut in half, it ultimately led to ingredients falling out.\n\nWhile the structural issues of the burger got in the way, I'd still recommend people to try Smile as the taste was still pretty good."

S'This is a gem hidden away (maybe too far away) in Webster Hall off of Fifth in Oakland. I worked a block away for three years and had no idea it was even there until another graduate student gave me the menu before he finished his degree and said, "this is my secret that I\'m passing on to you." So, for better and/or worse, I\'m letting the cat out of the bag here. This is the best cheap food you will find in all of Oakland for lunch (or breakfast). It\'s funny, the first time I ordered from them I called beforehand and ordered a veggie burger and some fries and told them I\'d walk over to pick it up (they also deliver within 3 or so blocks)- and I couldn\'t even find the place after walking through the maze of Webster! After finally getting there, I walked into the little kitchen and there were a bunch of guys there just hanging out. Don\'t let the small space fool you... it\'s got a big heart, as well as the cook there (.... I\'m not sure if it was Kevin). He was super nice and after I told him I had gotten lost and it was my first time eating there, he gave me a free dessert and told me to come back soon! I mean, who can beat $3 for a well cooked and tasty veggie burger and fries for less than $2? And the food was great! Since then, I have been back a couple of times. I recommend calling your order in first. They also do a mean breakfast, from bagels to hot stuff like omelets and hash browns. The one con to this place is that it closes pretty early in the afternoon, I think around 4 or so. I\'ve been working late a couple of times and called over for dinner and I was super bummed (as well as my stomach) that they had already closed for the day.'

S'I feel bad giving 4 stars because I enjoyed my sushi from Sushi Belle, and my conversation with Angel, the owner, but I have to keep it real - 5 stars are reserved for exceptional food and exceptional experiences. Sushi Belle is great though. \n\nI couldn\'t believe that one could get 22 pieces of good sushi for $10, so I went to check it out myself. It\'s possible, folks! The food isn\'t going to blow you away, but you and your wallet will be glad you went. And it\'s nice to meet an owner who actually cares about her clients, has a great attitude, and is thoughtful. I truly respect someone who runs her business as openly as Angel does. She tells you what you might expect from the "surprise" special, she is perfectly upfront about allergies, even if you choose to pay extra to have her change knives, gloves, cutting board, etc... and she has even put together a "kosher" platter to better serve the large Jewish community in the area. It\'s customer service done right, and I applaud her. \n\nTo a previous reviewer who commented that the owner isn\'t Japanese, I must say that most sushi restaurants are run by non-Japanese, so this doesn\'t bother me in the slightest. \n\nI wish Angel and Sushi Belle all the best, and I look forward to visiting often for good, inexpensive sushi. \n\nXi\xc3\xa8xi\xc3\xa8, Sushi Belle. \n\n(Yes, I know, that\'s Chinese..)'

S'I really want to like this place because it\'s the closest Mexican food place to my house. First what I like about it; certainly the location. The interior has also been updated nicely too. The owners of this place are completely new; this location had previously been 2 other Mexican places before; one was good, one not so good. The women working the counter were very friendly and the menu is clear.\nWhere it needs improvement; the layout inside is sparse, they can not accomodate a family eating a meal here. A few small tables is all they currently have. I\'d like to see a chips and salsa station; waiting for your food isn\'t as bad when you have a snack.\nI\'ve ordered breakfast burrito\'s here twice; the first time I ordered an egg & cheese. I got egg, cheese and potato (I\'m not a potato fan). The menu does list potatoes in all the burrito\'s and I didn\'t specify "no potato" so I really won\'t ding them for that. So I decided to give it another try and this time I did specify "no potato" and I did get what I ordered, however, my tortilla is overcooked with several burnt spots (meh, I don\'t like a burnt taste to my tortilla). I do like the green and red salsa they serve (I mix them together). A good kick but not over the top.\nThey are open M-Sat, closed on Sunday. So overall, currently they have a "meh" 2.5 rating from me, however, I will give them another try and will update my review accordingly. I have to try some of the other foods as well. I think this place has potential to be a good one so give it a try; they are new and perhaps they will use the feedback they are getting from customers to make improvements.'

S"The movie finished late and most of our usual places were closed so we tried this one.  Tuesday is pasta special day so I ordered the seafood linguine with Alfredo sauce, which I usually LOVE. My daughter ordered linguine with a rose sauce and a few meatballs. We also had the Caesar's to start and one order of cheesy garlic bread. The salad was delish and huge (2.45!) with Renee's dressing.  The cheesy garlic bread wasn't very garlicky at all and was so-so.  My pasta had cubes of overcooked salmon in it, (not very pleasant), 4 tiny shrimp, and a few itty bitty scallops, and even when covered in their grated parmesan cheese had almost no taste whatsoever.  I think they forgot to add cheese to the sauce!  My daughter's pasta sauce wasn't much better, what there was of it.  Talk about skimpy... Enough just to barely coat the pasta and lacking any flavour.  The meatballs are light and huge and slightly peppery.  They're ok, and might have been better with some sauce but there wasn't any to spare on the plate!  The pasta was quite dry.  All in all, an edible meal, but lacking flavour.  Most of it ended up in take out containers.  We plan on adding cheese and sauces when we reheat it.  Too expensive to just throw away.  Even on the Tuesday special, no drinks, just water our meal was close to $40.  When I saw the menu I was quite excited and said we'll have to come back a few times to try some other things...  NO!...  Not after wasting money on these two dishes.  I wish we had just gone home and opened a bottle of Classico Alfredo from the supermarket and boiled some fresh pasta.  Also, the pasta was a bit more then al dente.  It was hard.  I guess their pizza must be better, but we'll never know now.  Wish I had tried something else instead."

Sorry you lost your favorite salad but that doesn't give you the right to rate them a 1. In your own words, you never even tried the food of the new ownership, thus your review is a merely a rant and not to be taken seriously. \n\nAnyway, don't let that lady dissuade you from checking this place out. I'm a big fan of chicken curry and I've tried it at at least 10-15 places. This one is my favorite. I'm not sure what I love about it, the right amount of curry and spices, right choice of veggies(minus the mushrooms, thanks for listing the ingredients in the menu so I could delete those...saves me picking them out!) It's simple yet tasty. They deserve a 5 star due to the fact that I've tried so many other places and none have compared. Keep in mind I haven't tried anything else on the menu, sorry I can't review those. \n\nThe crab puffs are also great. Big chunks of chives, which I like. There's a place on Estrella with better crab puffs, but Tang's has the best curry chicken in my opinion."

S'Mosaic was such a pleasant surprise!\n\nYou know that sinking feeling you get when you walk into an expensive restaurant only to find pounding music and a crowd more worried about style than substance? That\'s what I was expecting when my husband told me we were going to some \'fancy\' place in "Scottsdale."\nBut I was totally wrong.\n\n This beautiful restaurant, surrounded by the desert and Pinnacle Peak, was quiet, romantic -- and yet laid-back. \n\nFirst, let\'s start off with the wine list. It was enormous, containing   wines from well-known wineries, as well as from smaller ones. It notes wines that are organic or grown using sustainable agriculture, etc.\n\nIn addition to meat and fish entrees, the menu offers a wonderful vegetarian dish for each course, which included choices like a potato, saffron and parsnip soup and a salad that had fennel, endive and olives.\n\nFor our main course, my husband had some entree of kangaroo loin and ostrich. While I, personally, couldn\'t really stomach the thought of him eating a kangaroo, he said it was delicious. I was surprised to see they actually had a tofu dish as an entree, complete with barley, gourmet mushrooms, veggies and a great sauce. Did I feel lame paying nearly $20 for a tofu dish? Yes. But was I pleased to see the chef was considerate enough to  remember vegetarians? Yes.\nFor dessert, we shared a citrus-almond cake. It was delicious. Absolutely delicious.\nI\'d highly recommend this place. It\'s pricey, but with it\'s slow-food focus and its creative meals, it\'s one of those rare places that you feel is actually worth it. Also, the food was very healthy, and we left without feeling uncomfortably stuffed.'

It does not have many pull up stalls anymore after they removed half of them, some of the order stations don't work and it could be cleaner. The staff is great and the food is good, so if your just wanting good sonic food and don't care about the other stuff, this location will do just fine."

S'Ich war das erste Mal mit einem Freund hier. Den D\xc3\xb6ner bieten sie in H\xc3\xa4hnchenfleisch oder aus Kalbfleisch in eigener Produktion an. Ich habe beides probiert und fand sie lecker. \nVor allem das Kalbfleisch ist Yaprak-D\xc3\xb6ner, also Bl\xc3\xa4tter-D\xc3\xb6ner aus (fast) reinem Fleisch. Das geh\xc3\xb6rt generell zu den teuersten und qualitativ hochwertigen D\xc3\xb6nern. Den kann ich empfehlen. Ich esse meist Yufka-D\xc3\xb6ner und trinke dazu selbst gemachten Ayran. Insgesamt lecker. Zu dem Fett gibt es eine Besonderheit.\nBei Hackfleisch Spie\xc3\x9fen ist die Mischung fettiger, aber man schmeckt es nicht gross raus. (verstecktes Fett)\nBeim Bl\xc3\xa4tter-D\xc3\xb6ner wird von aussen gefettet, damit die Fleisch-Bl\xc3\xa4tter nicht zu trocken werden. Leider erscheint und schmeckt er dadurch fettiger.\nDas sollte man dabei beachten. Die Bedienung ist in t\xc3\xbcrkischer Sprache nett und h\xc3\xb6flich. \nAber in deutscher Sprache sind sie leider nicht so galant. \nDas liegt nicht an den deutschsprachigen Kunden, sondern meistens daran, dass die meisten Ausl\xc3\xa4nder dies in deutscher Sprache nicht ausreichend gut k\xc3\xb6nnen. \nDa m\xc3\xbcssten sie mehr \xc3\xbcben. Vielleicht sollten die Kritiker dies bedenken und in den deutschen Sprachkenntnissen mithelfen. In der Summe komme ich gerne hierher.'

We've had the chicken-fried steak, the ribeye, the porterhouse, the chicken tenders - the ONLY gripe we have is that they always are out of prime rib by mid-Sunday afternoon. (If you want prime rib, go Friday or Saturday!) Love the rolls with the cinnamon butter, fresh salad fixings, and the way they fix green beans is GREAT with lots of bacon and mushrooms.

S'This place is everything that you don\'t want in a restaurant. Rude waitresses, low quality and quantity of food, long serving time and above all an owner which is a crook. \nI arrived 9:35 Friday evening there with a group of friends to try "Chateau Amoo Jamal" since we had envied this since long. \nFirst they started by telling us that there is no food left. We ordered some dishes from the very limited list of options left. Then we waited and waited and waited and waited again. Meanwhile other groups of people arrived and where served earlier than us while they had ordered proper dishes like kebob, curry, etc. \nI complained to the servant and she started to mock me asking for the food. I couldn\'t believe my ears and so embarrassed in front of my friends. Then she went in and brought the so called food in a minute or two. It was half done and it was more of snack than a proper food. Then the manager came and made excuses where I proved him wrong. He just was speechless. Not even an apology but more mockery.\nIf this wasnt enough, then came the topping for their stellar performance. The CROOK owner said that his machine doesn\'t work so we had to pay cash. Obviously he was avoiding taxes. Downtown Montreal. Can you believe that!'

The wine was awful and was suggested by the server. I also subtracted a star because the waiter argued with a lady at our table because he brought her order over and it was wrong. He blamed her and said, "Well you SHOULD have said..." I have never seen a waiter act like that before. I was embarrassed for him. Lame.

You are never open Sunday night any I went there THURSDAY night ay 9pm and guess what.....the owners were too sleepy to be open. I starved all night so I could get your food at 8pm, when you were supposed to open,and I went but again at 9pm and NOT OPEN! So now I am starving because you  are LAZY! This is war. Enjoy your FB and Yelp because I will make you feel the pain I feel in my stomach right now, you lazy border jumpers!!!'

S"When you want something quick on this side of town, Chinese, and reasonable, this is the place to go- been going to this one for years. I usually get the bowl with half white rice and half vegetables, with either the beef and broccoli or the mushroom chicken. I don't finish it, I save half for later. My husband gets the two item with half fried rice, half chow mein- beef & broccoli and orange chicken. Sometimes he gets the pork but only if it's lean. Sometimes, we each get an eggroll (when you complete the receipt survey within 2 days, this could be free). Fortune cookies come with your meals.\n\nUniform design for this fast food chain restaurant. Most of these restaurants are decorated the same: panda prints, red paint, tables/chairs, bar type tables/chairs. Free refills on sodas. Bathroom in one corner. Open kitchen- cut veggies in clear bins kept in the refrigerator- I love that, though sometimes the veggies are pretty chunky. Most of the food trays were full. There were three people working. This is a fairly busy but clean location that shares the parking lot with McDonald's. It wasn't as busy yesterday but then again, we got there past 1 pm though. Several strip malls in the area and close to the Boulevard Mall- convenient location."

The menu actually has quite a few options considering how little their prep space is, and I've liked everything I've had from them so far.\n\nThe sandwiches are stuffed - the breads look small but they're filled to capacity and then some. They can be a little messy to eat (you'll need that fork, btw), and the last few bites will probably get soggy under all those delicious fillings.\nThe Arepas platter has everything except, ironically enough, an arepa. It's a decent amount of food, and one of the best deals you can get for that price downtown. Just writing this review is making me crave plantains.\n\nService is really friendly - sometimes a little slower than your average Subway or fast food place, but the guy who works there makes sure to pay attention to every customer and their order, so those extra two minutes are worth the wait.\n\nOh, and they serve churros!"

My girlfriend ordered the crab stuffed sole dinner and the fish wasn't cooked. Although there were only four tables occupied by customers, we waited several minutes to get a server's attention to no avail. I eventually got up and brought the plate with the raw fish to the front cash to advise of the problem.

S"I came here for a quick take-out lunch last week. It was recommended by a self-acclaimed pho enthusiast I guess you could say. I had obviously consulted Yelp! before venturing over because it's sort of become my thing! \n\nI was unsure how take-out would work; would I get a bowl? Would I get everything separately? I got there, and found it was pretty small, but it's a small family-owned shop, so not surprising. Pretty clean and friendly staff. Was greeted immediately and given a menu to look over. Prices are verrry reasonable. 8$ for a large soup is pretty awesome! Took no less than 5 minutes to get my soup and be on my way. It was packaged all separately which I found was convenient; the broth was in a styrofoam container, the noodles and rare beef were in another styrofoam container and the bean sprouts, mint and coriander were in small baggie. On my way back to my office however I was worried as to how I was going to eat my soup. Once back, luck was on my side; I found a large soup bowl perfect for my much anticipated pho. I combined everything, added some hoisin and sriracha and sat down to enjoy my concoction. \n\nIt's definitely a good bang for your buck. I wouldn't call it the best I've ever had, but it's pretty good and conveniently located (considering I work a block away). I added hoisin and sriracha before trying the broth by itself so I can't say what the broth itself tastes like. But all combined, it's a pretty good mix. I would definitely recommend it and will be back in the near future."

S'I\'ve been a customer of US subs for over 8 years now and the sandwiches are as good as ever.  Back in the day, I used to go here for lunch, usually on the weekends with some buddies.  This was often a stop after leaving the ABC store that is nearby, as we were looking to put something solid on our stomachs before hitting the town for the evening.  \n\nHere are my observations after my most recent visit this past Saturday evening:\n\n-I noticed, as a previous reviewer has stated, that the interior seems to be a bit run-down, and sloppy.  This of course, could be a product of the high traffic that comes in and out of this place on a typical Saturday - which could be a good thing.  Either way, sweeping the floor or wiping down a table or two definitely wouldn\'t hurt.\n\n-Seems much more expensive than what I remember.  I feel like I used to get a sandwich, make it a combo-meal (with fries and a drink) for less than $7.  Tonight, when I asked how much it would be to make it a combo, i was told $9 and change BEFORE TAX! I must admit, I was shocked!  Not that $9 is super expensive, but for the amount and quality of food you are getting, I simply could not justify paying that much for a sandwich, fries, and a drink.  Also keep in mind that the sandwich by itself is $5.39.  So that means you are paying over $4 for fries and a fountain soda!\n\n-I ordered the chicken fajita sandwich, just the sandwich for $5.39 and took it to go - not wanting to eat at the dirty tables.  It took no more than 5 minutes for it to be prepared, and upon getting it home, I was more than pleased with my order.  The bread was soft, the chicken tasted great, and it was covered with a healthy portion of melted provolone cheese.  I could not have asked for anything else out of the sandwich.\n\n-The service was straight.  No real problems.  The gentleman who took my order was cool and to the point. Nothing out of the ordinary to report.  I def did not experience a "pissed off" cashier as a previous reviewer did.\n\nGood food is good food, and US Subs as been serving up good food to me, personally for almost a decade.  I will continue to go here when I am in the area, and I would recommend you do the same.'

The food's very good, though not quite at the stellar level of the original location yet.

No distinct flavor from herbs or spices.The  cheese wasn't good either, it didn't have that gooey/stretchy consistency you get with NY style pizza. It was more like low fat/low quality cheese. The crust was the only part they got right. Just the right amount of crispness. I truly hope they can improve on their product, it's a shame not to.Who doesn't like pizza???"

The table was not properly cleaned and had bits of melted cheese stuck on the table.\n\nWe had the Baked Taco Beef Penne and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. The pasta tasted alright and the portion was fair, I wish there was more sour cream on the top.\n\nThe pizza, on the other hand, was just ridiculous. I mean, the restaurant\'s name is Boston PIZZA, right? They\'re suppose to be famous and known for their pizza, RIGHT?\n\nOh boy that "thing" was disappointing. First of all, they were out on multigrain crust, what kind of place with Pizza in its name goes out of pizza crust??? Second of all, that "pizza" had only a very thin layer of cheese with very thick crust, I think they were short on BBQ sauce as well, as the "pizza" had almost no taste. It is also hard to believe that, for such a small portion, the "pizza" came with no other garnishes, salads, or sides (not even the choice of having such things). They should name their pizza "cheesy bread" instead.\n\nI do have to admit that their mint candy tasted absolutely fantastic, I love that candy!\n\nI may come back one day just for that candy.\n\nNah I won\'t.'

For dessert, we had bread pudding and apple pie.\n\nThe ambiance is great, they\'ve really put a lot of effort into the feel of the place. It used to be a new day cafe and it\'s completely different. \n\nThe pulled pork came on a plate of fresh slaw, which I\'m not a huge fan of slaw but it didn\'t bug me like it normally would. The pork was smoky and moist, tender. \n\nThe chicken was a little charred, some people like that, my wife doesn\'t at all, and I just think it\'s ok. The chicken was very moist, very tender, obviously had a good marinade, but I thought it was a bit overly salty which I suggested could be helped by a little wash after the marinade. \n\nThe cornbread muffins were good, not too dry and had real corn in them. Personally I\'d have liked to see a little dollop of apple butter or honey butter.\n\nThe bread budding was fresh. Literally just out of the oven, with little crisp parts and a good custard-like texture. Fresh cinnamon really stood out. Unfortunately, with no fruit and no bourbon vanilla sauce, it just couldn\'t stand on its own, it needs "something"\n\nThe apple pie however was amazing, tasted just like my wife\'s apple pie, tender flakey crust, soft but still individual apple slices. Delicious!\n\nThe fact that everything is homemade means they can adjust and change, I look forward to seeing what turns up my next visit'

S'DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!\n\nCalled in an order. They said it would be about 45 minutes. About 5 minutes after we had originally called we called back to let them know we\'d like to pick-up the order rather than have it delivered (decided to run errands rather than be lazy pizza eating fattys). "No problem", they said,"45 minutes!". 45 minutes pass and we go to pick up the pizza. When I entered no "hello", no "just a minute", I just stood there for a good 5 minutes before I had to flag someone down and let them know I was there to pick up an order. They said my pizza wasn\'t ready and it was being made right now. "Come back in 10 minutes". I went to my car to wait and about 5 minutes later went back in and waited patiently......for about 15 minutes. I then had to flag someone down and let them know I was waiting for my pizza. They disappeared for 10 minutes and came back only to tell me I had to wait another 10 minutes. \n\nI would also like to note there was a woman who had been waiting there long before I even showed up and was getting the same run around like I was.\n\nSo once again, after waiting 10 minutes, I go back inside. And once again, there was no one there to greet me or give me an update. Everyone was running around like a chickens with their heads cut off. After standing there for another 10 minutes a crowd of maybe 8 people had formed in the lobby. Not a single one had been greeted or acknowledged. I was able to flag someone down, who once again wandered off and came back only to tell me my pizza had left for delivery. WHAT! It was then I asked for my money back and then, ONCE AGAIN, the person I had been talking to scampered off. I, AGAIN!!! had to flag someone down where I explained to them what happened and that I wanted my money back. It was at that point the woman, who informed me that my pizza had been sent to delivery, came up to me and VERY rudely said, "Ummmmm...I\'m trying to get a hold of the driver...ok?". NO. NOT OK. I demanded my money and went to hit a drive-thru. \n\n*I have worked in a pizza shop before and even when you\'re busy there\'s a right way to handle things.'

A huge variety of sandwich fillings and all for under $5 (with taxes, chips and soda) plus or minus a dollar.\n\nIt sounds silly, but it's cheaper to buy your lunch here than to bring something from home! The French bread is warm and tasty, the fillings freshly cut or made. I love their egg salad sandwich and with a chips and a pop, it comes to $4.75! \n\nYou will always see a line-up, especially when the students come back for school.

S'Amir is a chain of Lebanese restaurants, but each one is franchised so they are all a bit different. I would actually rate this place a 3.5/5 but I rounded up for the sake of making good when they made a mistake in delivering (this is one of few times it\'s happened over the last, oh I don\'t know...15 years or so).\n\nMy family has ordered her regularly for a long time, and I\'m not sure if it\'s been the same owners the whole time, but the food is pretty good for "fast-food" style shawarma, shish taouk, and even a bit more upscale items like shrimp skewers. They have a number of vegetarian items, so if you don\'t eat meat you\'ll be able to have a meal here no problem. They have a large seating area with space outside in the warmer months, and like I mentioned before, they do delivery.\n\nWe had a little get together chez nous tonight and ordered in some platters of mini items a few days in advance. When the order arrived we realized that they had forgot to send an extra order of hummus and one of garlic sauce (which is super garlicky, not a good idea on a first date). So we called them back, and they didn\'t even bat an eyelash, they sent the sauce right over with a huge bag of pita bread. It might not seem like a big deal, but that was a nice touch. \n\nI didn\'t realize no one else had reviewed this location since it\'s so popular and right across the street from a metro station, but maybe next time I\'ll remember to take pics?'

S'On a Thursday night in August, my husband and I happened upon this three-week-old restaurant south-west of Vieux-Montreal.  The small restaurant seats 20 or so comfortably with additional seating at the bar. The place was a buzz with activity. We did not have reservations and the hostess hesitated before giving us a table. \n\nRustic wood floors and brick walls made Jane feel warm and welcoming. The menu, as in many restaurants in Montreal, was written in chalk on a large black board. The food was fresh and seasonal. The main courses were mainly pizzas with one Fish option. \n\nWe shared a warm Asparagus salad with duck shavings and mushrooms. All was drizzled with a pleasantly tart vinagrette.\n\nI had the Schwartz pizza of smoked meat and cheeses. (See the Famous Schwartz Deli site). There was cheese in the perfectly baked crust. It was nice and thin under the toppings, but full enough around the edges that I could really enjoy the bread! \n\nMy husband had the cod special - seared cod served on a bed of mushrooms and asparagus in a seafood stock. \n\nThe staff were friendly and the service was very good - I could tell these people knew what they were doing.\n\nA great little place!'

S'During the day this place is acceptable, just to be served by a great guy named Ralph. He is a very cool senior with such a big heart.\n\nThe reason for the one star is that the service is so bad. If you are in a hurry go to the drive thru, that is where they focus their attention and pretty much ignore the guests in the lobby. However, you will get your food fast, just accept the fact that your order might be wrong.\n\nThis McDonald\'s is very close to our house and we sometimes stop in late night to get ice cream from the drive through. The service at night is beyond bad. They always have a difficult time giving back the correct change, the orders are wrong. \n\nThe one thing that really stands out is the way they shove your food order at you in the drive through. We like the ice cream cones, you would think that if I am in the drive thru in my truck and I order ice cream, that you might want to take a little bit of care in making the cone. Like clock work, they start handing me ice cream cones ( shoving at me is more like it) the cones are dripping and the ice cream is falling off the cone. I really don\'t want melted ice cream spilled all over, I asked for a napkin, the girl replied "there is paper around the cone" \n\nFor some reason, I keep thinking the service will be better at night, it never is.\n\nIf you want some late night entertainment, go though the drive thru at night. You must bring your sense of humor,Don\'t say, I didn\'t warn you.'

S"This post and 4-star rating is solely for the older gentleman (wears a black, long-sleeve shirt under his uniform) that I always see working in the morning at the drive-thru window. He is one of the most kind-hearted and respectful person I have ever met at a fast food establishment (or any business for that matter). He always has a warm greeting every morning with a sincere smile on his face. This man is the kind of employee McDonald's should be looking to hire and promote. \n\nAs for a review on this McDonald's location in general, I would give it an average, 3-star rating. It is certainly cleaner than most locations I've seen and the service left me with no complaints. \n\n5-stars for the older gentleman working in the morning drive-thru.\n3-stars for the McDonald's establishment."

My husband ordered the Bourbon Burger, and it was really gross.  It was overly sweet and the sauce just didn't mesh well with the burger.  Emily didn't bat an eyelash when we asked if he could switch it out for something else.  We have never, ever asked to switch a dish out at a restaurant, ever, but it was just inedible.  Anyway, she quickly brought out his mushroom swiss burger and it was much different--super awesome!  Oh, and we went on a Tuesday, so our kids at free.  That was a huge plus!

It was whisper quiet and the husband and wife proprietors are really the only thing I could hear.\n\nI ordered an Asahi, a seaweed salad, and some sushi (just fish and rice, no rolls).  I told the waitress "no eel" since I don\'t like it (I like to make things clear when ordering a chef\'s choice sushi plate...) and she was surprised, but complied.  There was a nice selection of fish and it was all quite fresh, though one of the fishes was a little *too* cold and semi-frozen inside.  It happens, not the end of the world.  Presentation was very nice and the rice was perfect, despite the lack of customers.  The seaweed salad was great, and a perfect portion.\n\nI was relieved to see somebody come in and order take out, as it can\'t be possible to keep a restaurant open with so few customers.  I\'ll go back as the food was quite good and the owners seem like a very nice couple.  Pricing is reasonable.'

My friend John\'s roasted chicken sandwich, while tastier than mine, was also in the "more bread than meat" club.

S"Was at dinner the other day with my friend and she mentioned how a new taiwanese place opened. She said the name was something kitchen... and it reminded me of Liang's Kitchen in San Jose when i went up there in 2011. Then she looked it up, and confirmed it was Liang's Kitchen. My face with from :o to *_* Lol ! Was so excited for the next few days (Thurs to Sun... so 3 days) to go try it out ! I remembered the location i went to was super busy, their beef noodle soup was amazing, served hot in a metal bowl. Their noodles were hand-made, varying size showing it was not machine made. Been wanting to go back since every time i go up to the Bay but never had the chance !\n\nSo it opened in Vegas... Finally a new Taiwanese place ! and its one i recognize ! w00t ! It sits on the north end of the complex, on the NE corner of Spring Mountain and Arville, replacing what used to be called Hot Feel. Minimal renovations were done after the take over of the unit with some reorganization of some tables. \n\nThe menu and ordering paper is about the same, if not the same as other locations. Price wise, i dont remember. Came to try this place with a few friends for dinner. We had initially ordered a few things. 1 Beef Roll, 1 Green Onion Pancake, and 2 Large Beef Tendon Noodle Soup (later i realized the L/R next to the name was large and regular NOODLES, not the size of the order OOPS hahaha o well)\n\nBeef Roll and Green onion pancake came out first\n\nGreen Onion Pancake - normal green onion pancake but fried? (is that the right term). The exterior was crispy, interior was soft and hot ! Not a fan of the fried version after a previous experience at another restaurant, but this was really good ! Especially since it was fresh and HOT ! :D i liked it \n\nBeef Roll - Essentially a green onion pancake wrap with braised beef, cilantro, and hoisin sauce. Not as hot as i had expected in comparison to the green onion pancake. I had ate the green onion pancake first so i thought this was going to be as hot. Overall, not bad. Not too sweet and overpowering by the sauce. Fairly nice balance. We had ordered this another time after and crispy exterior on the 2nd order was flaking off. Looked a bit ugly. XD (being called high maintenance for stating this... T_T)\n\nBeef Tendon Noodle Soup - We had ordered 2 with large noodles. 1 came out first before the other. The first order, as large as i had remembered. Lots of noodles, in a large metal bowl. Lots of preserved veggies and stuff on top. 2nd one, not so much... Amount of noodles was probably 1/2 of the first order. Inconsistency? Maybe. Didn't matter too much since we were sharing so the noodles were fairly split anyway, so not so bad overall, but still, a bit weird to have varying amounts on the same table. Flavor wise, pretty good ! Large noodles were uneven (lol as expected of handmade) and al dente ! The noodles were actually a LOT larger and wider than i had expected (to be honest, i dont remember how it was in San Jose). In a small sharing bowl, putting like 3 strands of noodles fills it up. Thats how big the noodles were. Beef was tender. Tendon was soft. Flavor overall was nice. A little sour kick (from the preserved vegetables probably). Next time, i wanna try the regular noodles. Memory is failing me XD\n\nShanghai? style wonton - friend wanted to order this. Small wontons (maybe 10-15 in an order) in a seaweed soup broth Nothing too special. So recognizable amount of shrimp in the wonton (not sure if shanghai style has shrimp? HK style certainly does). Wasn't a favorite but at least we've tried it? Lol\n\nServers tend to speak to you in mandarin (3 out of the 5 of us spoke cantonese. 1 of the 2 mandarin speakers didnt pay attention). yeah we fail rofl. Overall, not too bad. \n\nWould love to come back to try other things. I believe they have lunch specials as well. Prefer to have had them open in a different location but oh well."

The pan-fried salmon with salad and the lamb rump both cost about \xc2\xa315.  Whilst I'm sure they're delicious, this means that if you want to have a moderately priced meal you're pretty much confined to the vegetarian options.\nBesides this, however, the place is clean and well organised with friendly staff and great service.  I came here with my family and as soon as we walked in we were greeted and shown to a table.  This sort of hospitality continued right up until we left  and each course didn't take long at all to arrive.  I had the cullen skink soup followed by the gnocchi which both tasted great and were served in generous portions.  Further, as explained by their menu, all their food is locally sourced within Scotland, which both ensures the quality of their ingredients and it makes economic sense.\nIt would be good if Howie's reduced the cost some of their mains, but quality of their food and service is excellent."

Particular favourites are the club sandwich ($10.99 with real chicken breast, not sliced!), the smoked meat (on special 2 for 1 on Tuesdays), and the Jimmy Dean. The pork souvlaki platter holds up well under scrutiny. I wasn't big on their quarter chicken, but it wasn't bad -- besides, if you want chicken, there's a St-Hubert across the street.\n\nThe service is usually quite prompt, the washrooms are always clean, the food is consistently well-prepared. Not an especially fancy joint, but a solid choice for a casual meal out."

It's usually a toss up between IHOP, Denny's, and Waffle House.  \nHowever, Denny's food is realllllly good now! \nI did hear about them revamping their menu and really working on improving their food and believe me when I say they did a really good job.\nEverything I've had recently was very tasty.  \nTheir nachos and cheese fries have this new cheese sauce that isn't the typical Sysco or US Food Service one.  Their fries are a cross between a waffle cut and steak fry, again, never before seen anywhere else.  \n\nGive Denny's a chance and try out their new food!"

S"One of the lousier restaurants in Montreal. Before we get into the food and all that, I'll have you know that it randomly closes despite taking reservations for that night. I know someone who reserved a table for a business meeting there at 8 pm with out-of-town execs, and when they showed up the doors were locked and the place was closed for the night. You're probably thinking who the hell would have a business meeting there, when Milos, Ferreira, etc exist, but that's besides the point.\n\nNow for the ambiance - the interior is wall-to-wall plaster reproductions of ancient greek murals and there are framed pics of Greek islands and all that kitschy shit littering every wall. A real eyesore. \n\nThe staff don't give one shit about you or your order. I have seen appetizers take more than an HOUR to come out from the moment you order. In the meantime, they bring you stale bread and a dish full of sunflower seed oil to dip it in. Literally, stale bread that was baked two weeks ago. \n\nNow, the rest of the food has moments of brilliance - the sausage, chicken, and lamb meat platters are really good, and the Greek salad is satisfying. There isn't a whole lot on the menu to be honest, but what's done well is done really well. \n\nI don't know why the owner(s) don't just strip out all the ugly decor, run the restaurant responsibly, and encourage the chef to keep it up. It could have been very decent, but once again the lazy Quebec loser attitude and allergy to money torpedoes another business."

I WAS HUNGRY!\n\nI walked in to see that me and my mom were the only people there.  A nice lady at the counter told me to seat myself.  I asked for a coffee and it came relatively quickly.  My and my mom both ordered your pretty much run of the meal breakfast, 2 eggs, choice of meat, choice of bread.  I ordered my eggs over medium, they came out borderline hardboiled.  The meat was edible but nothing worth noting.  Our waitress was prompt to refill the coffee throughout the meal.\n\nThen it came time for the check.  Not sure what happened here.  We waited on the check and it never came, when I finally saw the waitress again, she said you pay up front(I assumed that, I just thought I needed a check to give them first).  I went up the register and the other person working there asked where my check was, we were the only people there, it can't be that hard.  After the cook/cashier found the hostess/waitress we were rung up and on our way.\n\nRelatively cheap, but nothing special, worth the drive elsewhere."

She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again."

Plus, it was about the time that the food was coming out, so it was really fresh, rather than sitting on the steam table for hours on end and just be turned over and over again.  I'll say that was the reason.\n\nWhatever the case, I decided to go for a plate and you know, it wasn't bad.

S'We have been long time customers of this location. Original owners rocked. Today I can say I would never recommend anyone to this location again. We had a 2nd horrible experience last night and made a strong effort to let this store redeem itself. We ordered our two favorite pies last night. Family size pepperoni with extra cheese and a family size chicago style chicken bacon stuffed with no onions. We moved over the last few months to a home further away but felt we would continue to patronize this branch.  Long and the short of it...pizza number two was chock full of onions for the 2nd straight time. The last time this happened was on our previous visit and we just let it go. My wife at 8 months pregnant cant do onions so this time we called backed to explain.  Manager said they would replace the pie over the phone.  We wrapped up the uneaten pizza and rather than drive 10 miles back waited til this evening to return it. We were greeted with a new manger un familiar with our situation. To us it was a no brainer....here is an uneaten pizza being returned after being prepared wrong.  Just make us a new pie and move on. Instead....a call to the store owner was made and a half off coupon was offered. That was it. Final answer? Yes. That is all we can do was the response. Well....that 15.00 decision made at the upper level just cost this group not only our business for good but we will certainly share this experience with members of our neighborhood and church (the largest church in the area just around the corner from this establishment) Horrible experience. We even called them back after driving all the way home stunned by this business practice. Good riddance papa murphys. We will also be following up with a call to corporate.

They know good pizza and since traveling to New  York, I can tell you I have nevered again ever committed the mortal sin of ordering a Hawaiian Pizza!\n\nI really like this place. There are many good places in town, and until someone decides to ship in New York tap water to make the dough, let's face it, you won't get NY pizza here.\n\nHowever, the pizzas are great and I don't order them with mushroom, so I haven't experienced the canned mushroom issue that others have. I really like the crust, it is the perfect thickness and just the right amount of cheese and pepperoni.\n\nSubscribe to their coupons and  you can save a lot of money.\n\nI really enjoy supporting a family restaurant and this is a great one.

Divas crowd the front cashier area and lack the proper etiquette to attend to customers. They border on rude and disinterested in servicing you. It took awhile before a waitress came to seat us despite the front cashier area had all these women there catting amongst each other. Out of the eight I counted, only two were busy trying to handle the busy afternoon crowd. Why they were loudly bumping rap/hip hop music in the foreground is beyond me. \n\nThis place has the potential to be a great restaurant that could attract a broader crowd, however it's managed poorly and is reminiscent of a Latin hood joint."

S"Honduran in focus, gargantuan in scope - Morazon has it all and in huge portions.\n\nI mean, friggin' HUGE. Plates like movie props from some Roman Banquet, piled to overflowing teetery, waitresses wrangling the cramped dining space to get it onto your table before things start tumbling down. If you're a meater, these plates are for you - and there are a hundred to choose from. A fav at our table was the Pollo y Plantanos - green plantains piled high with roasted chicken, bone-in, sauced and covered with minced herbs, 14 bucks for more food than you could share between three. \n\nVeggies are going to have to do some picking and choosing, and will probably come away with a Chile Relleno, or maybe some papusas, and if you're lucky and your espanol es bueno, a Burrito Vegetarian. There's breakfast to be had, plantains both sweet and non, lots of cheesy, beany options, and the papusas aren't bad. But not amazing either.\n\nWhich is pretty much the theme - flavors, on the MexiEcuaHonduraCharlotte Scale, were some midway between Azteca's blandness and 3Amigo's sharp - so the salsa was meh, but the sauce on my Relleno, awesome.  \n\nCheap, quick, and decent. I'll be back."

The choices are pretty decent for the size of the place.\n\nI normally grab a couple rolls of maki to go after a nice workout at my gym nearby.  They are very fast and the sushi is definitely good.  It is a bit more pricey than the other quick sushi shops, but it is definitely worth the slight increase in price.'

S'I had a coupon for 2 combo plates with drinks, dine in or take out. My boyfriend and I decided to use it for takeout and have a movie night at my house.  The place was completely empty, so empty they started mopping up the floor from the entrance to the cash register; there was nowhere to step without leaving footprints when we walked in. One of the guys saw us coming and quickly threw a "wet floor" sign on the area (glad to see they care). From the moment we walked in and handed them our coupon, we could tell there was a very strong language barrier. The guys didn\'t seem to know what we were saying unless we mentioned something on the menu. Honestly, I never really find that to be a problem, but it was just a little tough trying to explain the coupon to him without seeming like we were ripping them off because it was already paid for. \n\nAfter we were able to explain it to him he asked what we wanted. I asked him if I could get super nachos instead of a combo plate and he said yes. We ended up getting the super nachos and chile relleno combo plate and two drinks with the coupon. We noticed a sign on the side that said they were having a 99cent taco special going on so we got 6 tacos (4 carne asada, 2 pollo) because we felt back just walking out without having to pay for anything. Plus, we were having a movie munchie night so it was our time to get crazy. \n\nAs we were waiting for our food, we went to get our fountain drinks but a huge chunk of ice clogged the machine so we called one of the guys over to help us. He came over, but then ran back behind the counter to put on a pair of gloves because messing with the ice. I found that to be very sanitary because I imagine other places just pushing out the chunk of ice with bare hands. We waited less than 10 minutes for all our food and headed home. The food was still hot when we got home and we divided everything up amongst 4 people. The super nachos were like a volcanic mountain exploding with toppings; it was fantastic. Nothing special compared to other places like Roberto\'s, but nonetheless delicious. I didn\'t try the chile relleno, but I heard my mom and dad talking about how they didn\'t like the sauce on it (I\'m not sure what kind of sauce they used). The tacos were all gone within 5 minutes, so they were obviously pretty tasty and cheap!\n\nI\'d like to come back here for their specials. From what I recall, they have quite a few specials going on everyday.  Like $5 fish taco combo plates from 11-2pm and 99 cent tacos.'

Here's my reasoning behind a 1 Star rating- we ordered a supreme pizza with 2 Pepsi, and we placed the order hours ahead of time for our pizza to arrive at 8PM.  They show up at almost 830, and bring DIET Pepsi!  Now really, how hard is it to screw that order up?  Thing about it is we didn't learn our lesson the first time.   Last time we ordered from this Pizza Hut they forgot to bring the side sauces we ordered.  Bottom line - no attention to detail and I have to question their competency.   If you can't get a simple order right then you fail, and if you fail working at Pizza Hut, there's really not much else left for you in this world."

They are pricey for 'fast-food', with most of their options, including a la carte, being around $7-9. I have tried their Bulgogi, with steamed vegetables and kimchi, which was all really good! The sweetness of this dish was great with the garlic and spice of the kimchi! \n\nI really want to try their Mandu and tempura, but they keep it under heat lamps in the front, which makes me wonder how long it has been there..but will probably try it one day ( I was watching ABC 15 and saw they got a D for their health inspection in July. It was for things like improper holding temperatures, kimchi made at home(was removed from service), thermometers, ect. BUT Most of these problems were solved on the same day)\n\nI see now that they have added Boba tea, which I'm also really excited for, seeing as how it's hard to find without driving to the far west or Scottsdale to find!\n\nHopefully the busier they get, the lower prices will become, but being one of the only Korean places on the East side of Phoenix, they might not."

S"I'm suprised there aren't higher scores because I'm usually the one who rips places. In a nutshell, this is a better version of your standard Phoenix Americanized Mexican restaurant (Macayos, Los Olivos, Ajo Als, Abuelos, Chevys etc). It's Americanized Mexican food but the reason it's better is all the little things are executed well. The chips were not stale and chewy but fresh out of the fryer and crispy and hot. The beans were hot and had melted cheese nestled in it instead of your typical dry refried bean paste (Macayos). The queso dip was not microwaved Velveeta that got cool after 3 minutes, it was stringy and melted and pieces of onion and pepper in it that had almost a fondue texture. The plate was piping hot to the point that the sauce in the plate was boiling. I hate when Mexican food is served cool (Macayos) and you can see that the cheese is still partly in shredded cheese form (Arriba). The service was also friendly and timely. We were not abandoned, our drinks were refilled.\n\nSo what's lacking...flavor. Although the food was hot, the cheese was melted and everything was executed well, there was nothing about the food that made you crave it like Los Dos Molinos. The Margarita was not served in a margarita  glass which I thought was a little weird and it was a little too tart. The hours of operation are weird. The place closes at 9 PM even on weekends!\n\nThe reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's a better executed version of a lot of the Americanized Mexican restaurants in the valley."

S'Pros: The food. As the majority have already said, the food is pretty damn good. Ordered the Saltimbocca and Pollo della Chef. Both cooked fresh from scratch and very satisfying.. \n\nCons: Everything else. \n\n- Walked in on a Saturday night after 6 and the place was empty (perhaps this was a sign), as in no staff to be found anywhere either. We eventually wandered into the \'dining room\' from the bar to find someone and get seated after standing around for a few minutes with no sign of anyone. \n\n- Salads were DRENCHED in dressing - I\'d strongly suggest ordering it on the side.\n\n- Random guy behind the counter cooking (for the staff it seemed) cursing up a storm about the \'cheesy sh*t" he was making. Sounded half-baked. I will say he didn\'t bother me at all as I thought he was hilarious entertainment, but I would imagine he would offend about 95% of everyone else in the world.\n\n- Staff then completely disappeared from the room after being served. Without the glass of wine we ordered. Finally re-emerged about halfway through the meal to be reminded about the wine. \n\n- Which apparently wasn\'t chilled/refrigerated, and to our best guess was chilled in a shaker glass as there were small bits of ice in it watering it down. \n\n- Screwed up the total on the bill, and basically just gave up on the math after a while and said something to the effect - I kid you not - \'well we\'re close.\' \n\n\nSeem like really nice people, and the dude can surely cook - but there are LOTS of kinks to work out. As some have mentioned, they have to decide what they want to be. The way people are dressed.... I will just be polite and say does not quite jive with an Italian sit down restaurant.

It just seems odd that a restaurant that caters primarily to people on their lunch breaks would be so unprepared for lunch.'

There was a full plate of California rolls, teriyaki chicken, miso soup, dumplings, and something else I can't remember now! SO tasty. \n\nThe decor is bright and modern and the waiting staff are always friendly and pleasant. I haven't had a bad experience here so will continue to stuff my face with ramen and wasabi peas.

The manager not only gave me another sandwich he gave me my money back for that combo that I purchased, and a card for another free sandwich in the future. This is what I call great customer service. My hat is off to Chick Fil A. I have had this happen to me before and the restaurant  just gave me another meal, and no refund. Andrew S. was right this is the best Chick Fil A in Pittsburgh.'

I think we were the last to leave one night and no one ever made us feel rushed. \n\nThe group I was with covered an erray of menu choices from veal, tortellini, pizza, mussels, calamari. Ceasar salad was a bit heavy on the sauce. \n\nOne of the guests orderd a bottle of spanish wine, not very tasty but not the fault of the restaurant.

S"When we noticed that there was a Le Milsa in DDO, I was happy as we could take my dad to a 'typical' Brazilian Churrascaria. However, as soon as we arrived I knew it wouldn't be typical. What Brazilian restaurant doesn't serve Guaran\xc3\xa1 (a Brazilian soft drink)  p\xc3\xa3o de queijo (cheese bread), farofa (manioc flour) and vinagrete? Being married to a Brazilian, these are all things that you come to expect at that kind of a Brazilian restaurant. \n\nThen, I was further surprised by the fact that there was no salad bar. Not being much of a meat eater, I was looking forward to having the big choice of salads. Instead I had several pieces of sausage. \n\nAnother surprise was the fact that the pineapple with cinnamon was not included in the meal itself, but as one of the two choices for dessert (one scoop of ice cream being the other). There was no Brigadeiro or passion fruit mousse, no flan. Regarding the pineapple, it was good. However, when I took several pieces, we noticed the manager give a negative look at the waiter. It was because he gave it to me before dessert while the food was still being delivered to our table.\n\nOnce one of the waiters found out that one of us at the table was actually Brazilian, the service kind of improved a little. They were a little more attentive.\n\nRegarding the ambience, I was very surprised that the TV was playing a DVD from Carnival from 2011. I was surprised that they didn't get a more recent DVD. I \n\nIt is interesting to note that apart from my husband, there were no other Brazilians. It is obvious that their intended customer are non-Brazilians, and that they wanted to introduce their culture. Kudos to them. But if I were new to this cuisine and had no prior knowledge this is what I would expect if I went to another churrascaria. And if it were up to me, based on this visit, I would not.\n\nUpon arrival, I was a little shocked to notice two puddles of dried up vomit outside of the restaurant close to the steps from the street. I would have expected them to take care of the outside as well as the inside of the restaurant. After all, the entrance is the first thing a person sees when entering any establishment. A quick hosing down would have been appreciated. \n\nIn review, I was disappointed with our experience. It was expensive and did not have the basic food that I have experienced in other Churrascarias."

Inside there is a wooden home bar and kitchen entrance. \nYou will notice the LGBT theme - more so in the washrooms. But it is not overly done so.\n\nThe cosy corners and the few tables create a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. So does the background music. They serve a selection of favourite drinks, teas, coffees, juices, beers and spirits. \n\nBeside that there is also an opportunity to eat some food. I saw some giant Yorkshire puddings filled with mince (or haggis?) \n\nThe waiting staff was friendly and helpful when needing to make a choice. \n\nA good touch is the supply of free condoms in the Ladies & Gents washrooms. That is of course to encourage safe sex practises - but not just for the gay community. \n\nI felt at ease and relaxed and it is good getaway on a Saturday afternoon to have a little chat and a drink. \n\nNothing too special, but very restful.'

Drinks are relatively inexpensive. There is no food which really sucks sometimes. They allow outside food to be brought in. The service is really spotty.

Sure it was just another ol' fast food type restaurant in a food court located in a busy mall in Las Vegas, but the food here was really good! I will say that I was suckered into eating at the place by them offering me a taste of their Bourbon Chicken. Nevertheless, all I can say is that it worked and they knew they had something good going. The lady was really nice behind the counter and the service was just the service (it was a panda express type buffet line; I'm not sure what they could of done to blow my mind service-wise). \n\nThe food, though, is the main reason I'm writing this review. I ordered steamed vegetables, bourbon chicken, and blackened chicken. If I could go back in time, I would double-down on the bourbon chicken because it was so delicious. Also, the steamed vegetables were very fresh during my visit and it made for a great meal. Although, I did steer away from the chow mein because it didn't look that appetizing.\n\nPrices were reasonable and the ladies that helped me were nice.

I\'d highly recommend their "Venus dip", especially with their warm focaccia bread.  Their chickpea roti is also good, and their veggie burger is flavorful.  For those that like seafood, their mermaid wrap (with smoked salmon) is delicious, and they usually have a fish special for dinner.  Their dinner pasta specials are never disappointing, and always overflowing with fresh, perfectly-cooked vegetables.  Definitely an excellent choice for vegans, vegetarians and health-conscious diners.  They have a good selection of house-made beverages as well, from house-made iced tea to delicious moccachinos (and soy alternatives).  If you\'re going with a group for dinner I\'d recommend making a reservation, otherwise it tends to be quiet.  The atmosphere and decor is definitely more casual, but they take their food seriously.'

S"Came here solo on a Friday night.  I was debating just going to bed, since i work at 3am, but my craving for Korean food was too much to overcome in my weaken hunger state.  Anyway, i decided to give Seoul Oak a try since I see the AYCE sign when visiting Monta Ramen next door.\n\nThe waitress that was working was super nice and I think rather attractive.  She suggested that i move to the next table when i told her I am interested in the AYCE option, because the ventilation system at the next table was better.\n\nThe food ordered here comes in plates, so it is not one of those AYCE places where you get a plate and select what you want to eat and how much.  So when my order came out for the beef tongue, I had to ask her to only grill 1/3 of the full plate that she brought out.  She was fine was that.  And I ordered a few more items (marinated beef ribs, boneless beef rib-didn't like this as much as I would like, marinated chicken, marinated sliced beef, marinated pork ribs-spicy and I think is a little hard to grill and cook properly).  Overall I like the food and love the banchans they served, which included the Korean spicy soup.\n\nThe place does not smell like it is too smokey either. +1, but your hands will smell if you do the grilling, which is pretty much unavoidable unless someone else does all the cooking while you do just the eating.\n\n\nPrice for AYCE is $19.95. Not the cheapest but not the most expensive either.  They also offer lunch specials that is pretty reasonably priced during lunch during the weekdays up to 3pm.  I will be sure to come back and check that out in the next few weeks.\n\nI think this is a 3 stars establishment, but bumping it up on the attentive and friendly service, especially since one waitress is looking after the entire restaurant."

S'I came here twice on a less than 48-hr trip to visit my parents and thought it was okay. \n\nThe first time was for lunch with my parents and sister. The place wasn\'t crowded at all and the weather was nice so we sat on the patio (I don\'t think anybody was sitting in the restaurant). I ordered a Cuban panini, which was pretty good. It came with a choice of coleslaw, side salad, regular fries, or sweet potato fries. I went with the coleslaw, which was kind of bland and I thought the cabbage was almost too shredded, but it wasn\'t bad. My mom also got a panini (the chicken pesto, which I tasted and thought was good as well), and she went with the sweet potato fries which were yummy. I thought it was a little odd that they give you A LOT of fries (well, at least in my mom\'s case), but if you order coleslaw it\'s a pretty small portion (well, at least in my case). My sister ordered a harvest salad & my dad ordered a blue cheese wedge salad and they both enjoyed what they got. The service was good, but like I said this place wasn\'t very busy. \n\nA couple friends of mine wanted to meet for breakfast before I left so I suggested Stella\'s since the lunch was good, and we wanted to go somewhere that wasn\'t gonna be too crowded. Once again there was nobody here. We sat inside and at any given time while we were there, there was only two or three tables occupied (including ours) with nobody on the patio. However, service was pretty slow. I ordered a yogurt parfait, which was okay but nothing special. The granola was good, but I was a little disappointed that the only "berries" that were included were strawberries (when I saw "berries"  on the menu I thought there would be a variety). My two friends both ordered whatever the breakfast was called that included eggs and potatoes. They both said there meals were good (especially the potatoes). I think we probably would have enjoyed our breakfast a bit more if service wasn\'t so slow (especially for how few people were actually in the restaurant). \n\nI thought the prices here were a tad high for what they offered (I didn\'t think the portions were that big for either breakfast or lunch), but it wasn\'t too bad. The paninis me and my mom ordered did include a side and were about $9. I think the salads my dad and sister ordered were about the same price. The breakfasts that we ordered were about $6-7, which isn\'t all that bad, but like I said the portions aren\'t all that big. \n\nEven though Stella\'s is in a food court at an outdoor mall (Tempe Marketplace), I did like the look/feel of the restaurant. The tables, chairs, and bar area all have black furniture that has a kind of "rustic" feel to it, and the walls are painted red, which gives the place a kind of "homey" fell. \n\nI\'d come back to Stella\'s, but I wouldn\'t make it a priority...'

S"It's a Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese restaurant. I should have known better than to go to an unspecialized restaurant. The food is mediocre at best. I had Pho and they only had one option. I'm used to with having at least ten different options for Pho - with beef, tripe, etc. My fianc\xc3\xa9 had stir-fry beef that when served looked more like curry - again mediocre. Nothing amazing, but not terrible. You're probably safer ordering typical Chinese food that you would find off a Panda Express menu (orange chicken, general tso, etc)\n\nPros: clean restaurant"

S'Worst service ever.  Went there over the weekend for a quick snack to tie us over before our dinner reservation later.  Big mistake.  We ordered two hotdogs, two fries, and two orange drinks.  The food preparer filled our one order of fries, then realized that she didn\'t have enough for the second order, so she had to get the manager who told her to make more, and she did this all in slow motion.  I\'ve never a seen anyone move so slowly in a fast food place.  They then decided to give our one order of fries to the next order, so now we were waiting for our entire order, "so it wouldn\'t get cold."  Seriously, if they were low on fries, they should\'ve just told us and we wouldn\'t have ordered them!  Now we were stuck waiting an extra 15 minutes we weren\'t anticipating, when we were already on a time crunch.  Every place I\'ve ever been, if you have to wait for something, you can at least sit down and eat the rest of your order while you wait,  and they tell you there will be a wait BEFORE you place the order. So we FINALLY get our order. The hotdogs were plain, nothing special.  The fries were WAY TOO HOT to eat!  The best part of the order were the orange drinks. We will never go back there!!  What a waste of time!'

Popeye's at Excal: are you owned by a massive jerk?\n\nThis bad boy is in the Excalibur King's Court: a food court with Popeye's, Hot Dog on a Stick, Smoothie King, and some other fast food eateries I cannot remember right now. (McDonald's is probably there, since that POS is everywhere.)\n\nGood:\n+ Quick, when they want to be;\n+ ten percent (10%) discount for Military/Police/Fire, sometimes they give it to you, sometimes they don't (perhaps subject to ideological stance of cashier); and\n+ the food is A-OK, seating plentiful. \n\nBad:\n- Attitude of (some) workers;\n- lack of any condiments (they must be requested); and\n- twenty cent (20\xc2\xa2) upcharge for asking for bottle water in lieu of their nasty fountain sodas (there is no Hi-C\xc2\xae fruit punch), and obviously there are no re-fills (no self-serve beverage machine).\n\nThis Popeye's location is like a schizophrenic uncle who you (and local law enforcement) are forced to deal with every so often. \n\nVery inconsistent: sometimes there is a huge ass queue with just one cashier (!) and people are even trying to cut (not on my watch; get in the back of the line, asshole!) and they get through it impressively fast. Other times there is hardly anyone waiting, three dedicated order-takers, and yet they are insanely slow. \n\nThey give you service discount, they don't give you service discount.

S'Heute waren wir im Thong Thai. Das Restaurant liegt auf der Kaiserstra\xc3\x9fe und wurde dort 2008 er\xc3\xb6ffnet. Wir sind \xc3\xbcber das Internet darauf aufmerksam geworden.\n\nWas fand ich gut: \n- Das Restaurant ist wirklich nett eingerichtet und bietet auch f\xc3\xbcr gro\xc3\x9fe Gruppen viel Platz\n- Die Portionen sind mehr als ausreichend und gro\xc3\x9fz\xc3\xbcgig\n- Das Gem\xc3\xbcse war auf den Punkt und knackig. Sehr gut\n- Der Service war flott und nicht zu aufdringlich\n- Da ich keinen Geschmacksverst\xc3\xa4rker mag, wurde mein Gericht ohne Zus\xc3\xa4tze zubereitet\n\nNegativ ist mir folgendes aufgefallen\n- Wir haben im Au\xc3\x9fenbereich hinter dem Lokal gesessen. An sich ganz nett, aber der Tisch war klebrig, der Ascher voll und mit irgendwelches zerkn\xc3\xbcllten Flyern garniert\n- Ich empfand das Massaman Curry als preislich am oberen Limit mit EUR 12,40. Das ist meines Erachtens schon ein stolzer Preis. \n- Von der W\xc3\xbcrze war ich nicht sonderlich angetan und ich fand das, bezogen auf die Sch\xc3\xa4rfe, ein wenig fad. Die ausgewiesenen "2 Peperoni" habe ich nicht geschmeckt\n- Der Innenraum ist f\xc3\xbcr mich zu dunkel und eher was f\xc3\xbcr Winterabende\n- Negativ empfinde ich au\xc3\x9ferdem, dass Gerichte nur auf Nachfrage ohne Geschmacksverst\xc3\xa4rker zubereitet werden. Ich w\xc3\xbcrde mir w\xc3\xbcnschen, dass einfach die nat\xc3\xbcrlichen Zustaten zu einem schmackhaften Gericht kombiniert w\xc3\xbcrden und auf Hilfsmittel verzichtet wird. Die frischen Zutaten, die ja in diesem Lokal zweifelsohne verwendet werden, sollten ausreichend Geschmack bieten. \n\nVon mir daher eine sehr durchschnittliche Bewertung. Wir werden aber wiederkommen und probieren noch andere Gerichte.'

S'This casual bar/restuarant is located inside the Gateway Phoenix Mesa Airport in the southeast valley.  My father and I dropped into the bar for some pre flight drinks midday on a Thursday.  The bartender was incredibly attentive, quick, social and made fantastic drinks for us (bloody mary and glenlevit on the rocks.)  Their house vodka is Svedka and they also have several beers on tap.\n\nWe left the bar very happy people, but suprisingly wound back up there in their restaurant an hour later ordering a couple of Budwisers and Stella Artois on tap.  Somehow our flight got turned around on an Allegiant airplane due to a "panel" issue.  We pleasantly enjoyed our second time around in a booth with beers and shared a delightful ceasar salad and the soup of the day-brocolli cheddar :)\n\nI can\'t complain about this little airport bar/resturant since their staff was so quick, friendly, and the food was pretty tasty.  I recommend swinging through here if you end up flying out of this quaint, clean, and affordable little airport in the valley.'

S'My sister called me up and told me she had reservations for a great little pizza place in the Atwater market area that she had heard great things about and did I want to come? I rarely say no to pizza and I was looking forward to trying out a new place, so yes yes yes was my reply.\n\nFoyer is nestled between a hair salon and another restaurant, pretty non descript from the outside but it has a warm, cozy ambience inside. We were greeted by friendly staff and quickly shown to our table.\n\nThe menu is not huge but their pizza selection is very interesting and definitely original. We weren\'t starving so we shared a salmon tartar, which arrived very quickly. it was fresh but a little lacking as far as taste, good but nothing memorable. \n\nAs for the pizzas, we decided to each order our own and share.\nI was torn between the smoked meat pizza and an onion soup pizza, the smoked meat pizza had bechamel sauce, grainy mustard, gherkin pickles, bacon and smoked meat. It sounded a little strange in terms of flavor combinations but our waiter assured me it was delicious and was a top seller.  The onion soup pizza had bechamel sauce, caramalized onions, bacon and gruy\xc3\xa8re. It sounded delicious but I wasnt in an onion mood so I decided on the smoked meat.\n\nMy 2 dining companions ordered the Margherita and added on mushrooms and the other order a pepperoni, chorizo, hot pepper pizza.\n\nOur pizzas soon arrived and we all traded a slice. My smoked meat pizza looked good but I still wasn\'t overly excited and wondered if it was a wrong choice. Thankfully my first bite proved me otherwise. The crust was crispy and on the thin side without being wafer thin. The bechamel was creamy and the saltiness of the smoked meat and the crunch of the gherkins made for an interesting contrast of textures and flavors. \n\nThe pepperoni, chorizo, hot pepper pizza was amazing, spicy perfection! Definitely my favorite!\n\nThe Margherita with mushrooms was also good but didn\'t tantalize my taste buds, it was good but didn\'t stand out or make my mouth happy like pizza should.\n\nAll in all, tasty pizza, a good choice if you want to enjoy a non traditional pizza experience.\n\nWe were offered desert, the chocolate mousse looked tasty but we were all stuffed with no room for anything else. We got our bill and the waiter came back with our leftovers in a box with a cute drawing of a "scary"pizza, one of the waiters is an artist and likes to decorate the to go boxes, a cute touch:)\n\nI would definitely come back but only if I was in the mood for a change from my tried and true favorites.\n\n3 pizzas, 2 glasses of wine and 1 appetizer, 105$ including tip.'

S'A great little deli cafe, Relish is ideal for getting that quick bite to eat at lunch time or a morning coffee. \n\nLocated near the water of Leith, and on Commercial Street, Relish provides freshly made sandwiches, homemade soups and a selection of hot drinks. Furthermore, it provides a wide range of cheeses, meats and Italian themed foods, including olives. \n\nI have been there a few times and on both times the food has been excellent and defiantly represents value for money. The soup and bread combo does not cost much more than two or three pounds, the tomato basil soup I tasted was warm and tasty. However, if you want a bit more to eat I can also advise upon the sandwiches. I had a baguette with cheese, salami Milano and a red onion salad. Again it was great and very filling as well!\n\nI would certainly visit Relish again and I am envious of the people of Leith for having such a good deli cafe!'

The service was good. \n\nI put a lot of stock in a restaurant's iced tea because it indicates how frequently the container is cleaned. Russell's was passable but starting to turn.\n\nThe cheese fries were smothered in what I would describe as what you would expect for nachos at a stadium; you know pumped warm Velveeta, but in this case slightly off flavor. Stay away from them. \n\nMy wife had a half rack of ribs and rated them 3.5 out of 5. My son's Hangover Burger was cooked to near dryness, but it was still pretty good. I had a cheese steak. Lots of meat with greasy grilled onions. Again, the meat was over cooked and it had a couple of spots of tough grizzle.

I thanked him for the heads up and declined the add on.\n\nWhen we got down the street to a red light, I stuck my hand in the bag to get some fries. And they were stale and cold.

Each panel describes all the ingredients that come in every item and at the bottom you get to choose your meat, they have steak, chicken, tofu or vegetarian. For me, that's a good break from the rest of the places where you get dizzy just by looking at their long and confusing menus.\n\nGetting to the best part, I got a chicken wrap called the superbiotic, it comes with bell peppers, spinach, chick peas, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes (which I would have preferred rehydrated, they felt like a bumpy road in my mouth) and a cucumber dill dressing, everything tasted nice and fresh (as the name states, freshii). My hubby got a steak burrito and he said it was ok, he though it needed some kind of dressing since it just came with a little bit of avocado and beans.

Instead, in a back alley terrasse next to a St. Hubert Rotisserie blasting Racine in Cote des Neiges surrounded by French people will just have to do."

S"I OFTEN WALK passed restaurants just to have a gander at the menu; call it a food geeky hobby of mine.  As it happens, Purslane is just around the corner from my work and has caught my eye all too often without action.  Time to pay a visit!\n\nLocated on St. Stephen Street, Purslane proudly sources around 80% of its produce from the surrounding Stockbridge area.  Not only does this bring a community feel to the restaurant but also allows the excellent produce from the likes of George Bower the butcher, George Armstrong the fishmonger and I.J Mellis to feature on its menu. \n\nThe restaurant is small, there's no beating around the bush about that, but it's small with a certain charm and romance to it and is tastefully decorated too.\n\nOur server was very relaxed and chatty and as we placed our order, it was obvious he really enjoyed his job.\n\nWe were presented with an amuse bouch\xc3\xa9 of crispy chicken and Asian noodle salad.  The aroma of roast chicken invited you to dive straight in, where you were greeted by this excellent nugget of chicken and accompanying salad that was fresh and crunchy and had a pleasant hint of aniseed to it.\n\nFor starter, I went for sole and salmon roulade with sauce vierge.  The smell suggested the fish was as fresh as a daisy.  Expertly seasoned, the roulade was moist and tasted of the sea.  The sauce vierge was well-made and added to what was overall a great modern version of classic flavour combinations.\n\nSarah chose pigeon pithivier with wild mushrooms and Madeira jus. The pastry was properly cooked and satisfied my Paul Hollywood-esque inspection - no soggy bottoms here. \n\nShe found some of the pigeon a little chewy, although the piece I tasted was fine and the flavour was there.  The mushrooms were wonderful and woody and the jus, ahh that jus was simply sublime. \n\nThe intermediate course consisted of pan fried hake with a fricassee of vegetables, which being honest I wouldn't have expected to be included in a meal priced at \xc2\xa325.95. Not that I was complaining, as this was a sheer joy to eat.\n\nThe fish skin was crisp and the meaty flesh was perfectly cooked. The attention to detail evident in the shelled peas and podded broad beans and a wonderfully light and creamy sauce made it as if the dish saying 'you didn't order me in the first instance and this is what you're missing'.\n\nFor main, I had roast breast of guinea fowl with confit potato, watercress and jus gras.  There's several different skills demonstrated in this dish; not just the cooking of the breast but a nifty ballotine and a neatly butchered leg were all top notch. The tasty jus gras sees the whole bird being used to its full potential; I only wish there was more of it on the plate.\n\nI have to say I thought the watercress made this dish.  The pepperiness just gave it a hint of spice and a bit of texture. The use of an ingredient bang in season tells you a lot about the ethos of the restaurant.\n\nSarah had grilled red mullet with herb crusted boulang\xc3\xa8re potatoes and roasted red pepper salsa. Faultless execution and seasoning of the fish, which was complimented by the zingy salsa. However, Sarah felt the potatoes could have been crispier and more golden.\n\nThe raspberry sorbet was a welcome palette cleanser as I chose to finish with apple and butterscotch cr\xc3\xa8me br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e while Sarah ordered the assiette of pear.\n\nThis was no standard br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e let me tell you.  Lifting the apple crisp to find the centre had been cut out to house the butterscotch sauce was rather quirky, while the outside offered the crisp exterior you would expect from a classic version of the dish.\n\nThe popcorn was a fun addition but it was sadly a little on the limp side.\n\nThe presentation of the pear dish was clean and modern and the tastes from the sorbet, cannelloni and poached pear were refreshing, light, and a thoroughly pleasant way to end any meal.\n\nPaul Gunning has honed his trade under chefs like Marco Pierre White, Jeff Bland and Jean Michel Gauffre and that shows.  His presentation of food is outstanding and no detail goes unmissed. This is a chef who has learned his craft and is now intent on putting his own stamp on the Edinburgh food landscape.\n\nAt \xc2\xa325.95, I can't think of anywhere that offers better value for the standard of food on offer and it really is fine dining without any hint of pretention.  It's made me question how good places where I've paid considerably more actually are and I can't give a much bigger compliment than that.\n\n This gem of a restaurant and one really needs to be experienced first- hand."

S"I spent a week temping at an office in the Wells Fargo Tower and I ate here twice. It is a little cafe that is connected to the tower and it obviously caters to all the businesses in the Howard Hughes Center business park. All the people coming here are employees from around the area. Surprisingly enough it is not super busy at Noon (lunchtime) as both times I went is was exactly Noon. However, they do appear to be a thriving take-out business. I guess most people these days just can't get out of their office, even if the place they're ordering from is just a few floors down from them.\n\nAnyway, it's a nice enough joint with seating inside and out. They have a HUGE menu considering how small the place is. There are cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, plates (mostly Greek-origin), wraps, soups, and salads. \n\nOn the two days I went I had a hot sandwich, the Turkey Loco, which was okay, but I just did not realize it was not going to have any veggies on it all. Guess that's my own fault. Second day I had the gyro salad. Basically gyro meat on a bed of lettuce, but it also comes with a dressing and tzatziki sauce, cucumbers, tomatos, and red and green peppers - yum!\n\nI suggest going with the salads here because you get the most bang for your buck. The salads are generous and since you're paying so much (everything here is $6+) you might as well get the most out of it! \n\nNot too many people are going to just come here because they want a bite to eat, but if you find yourself working in the Howard Hughes Center this place will definitely do."

Blink and you miss it, but please don't blink too long as missing it will be such a shame.\n\nGo on a sunny day, you can sit outside and enjoy some of the finest italian coffee this side of Italy. Strong baby strong! There's some arty magazines and the usual newspapers to read, so you won't be bored if you forget your book or your friends.\n\nThey also do a range of paninis using italian ingredients so you've got an authentic  experience from the get go. Heck even the owners speak italian to one another.\n\nSize wise the cafe is pretty small, so you might struggle to find a seat on say a Saturday but it's well worth visiting even then, as you can grab a take away to enjoy your grub around the corner by the water of leith.\n\nIn short it's a great stop when you've visited the shops in Stockbridge and you're feeling slightly peckish or you're running low on caffeine."

S'The Why:  Recommended by a Montreal contact when I inquired about a classy/classic French restaurant where I could take my mother and aunt without breaking the bank, La Chronique struck me as a great place to start off our dining in Montreal.  Knowing full well that my family does not have the same appreciation for haute-French as I, Chef Marc De Canck\'s take on provincial French seemed to strike a good balance between accessible and refined and with a convenient location on L\'Avenue Laurier and a "business casual" lunch compared to the "jackets suggested" dinner destination I made a reservation for noon on a Monday.\n\nThe food:\n\nOregano Potato Bread, Nuts and Grains Bread, Cows Milk Butter and Fleur de Sel:  Complements of the house, served piping hot, and replenished without request the "nuts and grains" bread was as good as many pain au cereal in Paris while the potato bread was light, aromatic, and airy.\n\nDuo de Foie Gras de Canard / pain d\'epices, puree de coing, gelee d\'abricots:  My obvious choice, and a wonderful one at that, this presentation of Palmex Farm\'s fatted duck liver was presented both seared and en terrine.  With the warm preparation served over spiced bread quince puree and the creamy chilled portion topped with a thin piece of golden bread and brown sugar crumble there was nothing particularly elaborate about this dish, just high quality ingredients paired beautifully, the sweet cutting the fat and the aromatics perfuming the palate.\n\nFilet de Proc Fume / Polenta, Courgettes, Moutarde: My plat principal, this dish was suggested as our waitress\' favorite and a chef\'s signature with good reason.  Again quite rustic in its construction but featuring an ample cut of lean pork loin smoked and placed over toothsome polenta tinged with mustard seeds the highlight of this dish was actually the jus - a pan reduction of bacon, zucchini, and cocoa that fit somewhere between sweet and savory thus working well to meld the pork and polenta without overpowering either.\n\nOnglet de Boeuf Angus / Salsifis, Choux de Bruxelles, Champignons:  A surprising order for my mother who rarely orders beef this was another hearty dish that would have fit nicely on any French bistro menu as the tender Alberta sourced hanger steak was cooked to medium well served over a sort of confit of Brussels sprouts and salsify with lightly pickled at the side.  With mom focusing on the steak, dense and aromatic with just a touch of smoke and char I particularly appreciated the sprouts - caramelized but still pungent and a good foil to the richness of the protein.\n\nRisotto vert-pre / Epinards, Edamamaes, Courgettes:  At first I thought my aunt was truly puzzled by my translation from French, but assuring us she wanted the vegetarian offering of the afternoon I must say it turned out quite nicely with the Carnaroli rice cooked to a medium tenderness in a creamy reduction of mushrooms and peas before being garnished with chopped zucchini, shelled edemame, and shredded spinach.  Rich, vegetal, and substantial in portion the dish was anything but light but considering I rarely associate risotto with French cooking I was rather impressed.\n\nPetit Basque Sheep\'s Cheese with Caramelized Nuts, Apricots, Grilled Bread: Listed only as a cheese plate on the menu this one was a bit of a letdown for me.  Don\'t get me wrong, I love Petit Basque, especially when nicely aged as this one was - but being in Montreal I couldn\'t help but hope for a local cheese and while the accoutrements were nice it just wasn\'t what I\'d anticipated at a $6 supplement.\n\nChocolate Profiteroles with sliced almonds:  A second bummer on the dessert menu were the profiteroles ordered by my mother - two small balls of admittedly nice choux pastry encompassing rather bland vanilla ice cream but thankfully topped with dense melted chocolate.  While admittedly not a fan of profiteroles to begin with the almonds were a nice touch, but not enough to save the plate.\n\nValrhona Molten Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream and Pineapple Mango Salsa, Caramel:  Another $6 supplemental dessert this one would actually prove to be worth the time, calories, and money. Beginning first with the cake - sticky, dense, and cooked to the perfect point to maintain the liquid center this oft duplicated dessert poured forth the dense 72% chocolate in plethora and although expectedly bitter the cocoa met an ample foil in the intense vanilla bean ice cream, sweet salsa and caramel, plus brown sugar crumble.\n\nThe Verdict:  In the end I liked La Chronique well enough; the setting is lovely, the service excellent, and the prices fair for the quality (and more so the portions) given, but in comparison to the rest of our dining in  Montreal it was largely unmemorable.  A nice spot to enjoy a leisurely lunch or romantic dinner they certainly have the skills to make a classic French meal - I guess I\'d just hoped for more creativity and better desserts given the cost of admission and supplements.'

S'Went there on a Friday night with high expectations.  This location has had a lot of turnover in the last several years.  Unfortunately, if things don\'t change at this location, it will be another short tenure.\n\nA plus to start with:  they have a great Antipasta/cured meat plate...really enjoyed it.\n\nMy wife had the Chicken Diablo which she was really happy with but my son\'s Chicken Marsala was bland and tasteless.\n\nFurther, how do you mess up a center cut filet mignon?  Well, let me answer you...first, you send out the steak overcooked.  Then, you make sure the "blue cheese crust" is able to be scraped off with your knife and set it a little pile on the side of the plate.  Lastly, I\'m not sure this was even a filet...it was thin and looked like a New York Strip that had been trimmed to look like a filet.\n\nLastly, service was poor.  Waitress was very nice, but often was not around. I\'m assuming there was another dining room perhaps?  In any event, in our dining room there were approximately 5-7 tables being served and after an uncomfortably long wait for our entrees, we were told that the kitchen had lost the ticket.  Really?  To their credit, they sent out a small serving of their pasta and it was the best think I ate all night.   \n\nI hope they shake out all the issues because it would be nice to have a stable restaurant in this location.'

We also each tried a little glass of sherry - the manzanilla on the menu - I've never had sherry before and can't really make an educated comment about it because I have no reference for what sherry is supposed to taste like - it reminded me a little bit of Sake - but I can be way off. It was interesting. \n\nFor food one of us had the Pollo Cubano which was ok and the other had the catch of the day - I was a little disappointed in the catch of the day as I thought the focus of the dish would be the fresh fish but it ended up tasting more like the batter smothered with the creamy cheesy sauce. \n\nI might go back to try some other items on the menu.Nothing to complain about as far as the service- in fact our waiter was great.  We would have tried the dessert if we weren't so full.\n\nThe live music was a great touch. Overall we enjoyed the ambiance but were disappointed in the food."

The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\n\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\n\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\n\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\n\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's."

Was kind of in a rush to get to my connecting flight on the other side of the airport, but had time. \n\nI ordered an everything bagel with plain cream cheese and tomato. I moved over to wait and watched as everyone that ordered before me and just after me received their orders. I went to the barista to get my order filled. She was very kind and walked to the bagel line to tell them what she needed. But she whispered something. Didn't sit well. First flag. When she gave it to me, she rolled up the bag though she hadn't done that for any of the other orders. Again, flag.\n\nAs I walked away I had the feeling that I should look in the bag, but didn't know where I was going and thought I should focus. Well, when I made it to my connecting gate, I was sorely disappointed to see that I had nearly NO cream cheese. Thinking that maybe they limit their cheese, I just started to eat is, but it was STALE! Not toasted... Like it was old... \n\nRuined my travel day. Already stressed and tired... Definitely didn't need that today. I don't recommend this stop. Go to Starbucks..."

Doesn\'t look like much on the outside, but the semi-crappy exterior usually speaks volumes about the food (in a good way)... there\'s something a little unsettling about a bright and friendly looking Berto\'s. ANYWAYS we went to this place last night. They had a lot of stuff on their menu that isn\'t on some other "Berto\'s" menus... like the 5 rolled taco supreme that my fiance got... rolled tacos, covered in everything that comes on super nachos (carne, sour cream, cheese, salsa... OH MY) - awesome. I got the bean and cheese burrito, which was also delicious. We\'ll definitely be back!'

S"Kan's Kitchen has new hours posted and they are 5 pm to 5 am!  So, not sure if they are still offering late night dim sum as an option.  Looks like they are targeting a different crowd now!\n\nNonetheless, we came a bit after 9 pm and noticed a steady stream of Chinese families there for a dinner too.  They had a Specials menu - all in the Chinese though.  The waiter couldn't do much with translating beyond 'beef, chicken, etc.' and ended up giving us the Midnight Specials menu which is happily in English!  All items are $4.99 each!  Score!\n\nWe ended up with:\n\n* Deep Fried Salt and Pepper Tofu ($4.99) - Little cubes of tofu that are deep fried and spicy.  We both enjoyed this.  \n* Steamed Chicken with Mushroom ($4.99) - A very simple dish and it's exactly as described - chicken and mushroom.\n* Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodle ($7.95) - This came off the regular menu and we ordered the noodles separate from the sauce.  (Y'know, so the noodles stay crunchy and don't get soggy underneath too fast\n\nOverall, we find ourselves there when we're looking for some authentic Chinese food without all the frills.  Sure, service is what you expect with only one waiter working and you need to wave him down when you want him.  But it works for us, especially when we're given the specials menu!\n\nUpdate! (12.11.10)\n\nDrove by this evening and they have shut their doors!  Nearby Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli confirmed that they are not CLOSED!"

S"Considering it's not much more than a lunch room for the surrounding offices, it's really not bad. Most of the sandwiches I've had there have been ok experiences. The service is quick.  \n\nI've noticed that they sometimes will spoil an otherwise really good dining experience by doing something like leaving pits in certain olives that appeared to be without pits. Or some of the cole slaw will be wilted. Or the shell in the clam chowder mentioned earlier. I don't consider these events fatal flaws, but y'know . . . come on. . . . a little more effort.\n\nI don't like how the line is laid-out. The path from ordering and paying to picking up your food and drink is convoluted and annoying. They could improve their flow and ergonomics and make take away some of the anxiety I feel before going there--and thus I might go there more frequently."

I was in a bad mood on the way over here because I was so hungry, and when I looked at their pretty average menu, I was still in a bad mood.  However, once the server came by, took our orders, and brought our drinks, my mood started to improve.  \n\nThe cafe itself is pretty quaint, with an obvious aviation theme going on.  The view outside is lots of tarmac, but it's still nice to see a couple planes chillin' on the runway while you eat.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which is as straightforward as it seems.  Scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese, and toast.  It also came with a side of hash browns.  The sandwich itself was actually really big!  The most surprising thing of all was that there was a lot of flavor packed inside there.  Usually, diners are fairly bland and easy on the seasoning.  My mood was way up by now.  Then some people walked in and I was entertained by the non-local people watching that I got to do.  The hash browns were also good, a bit peppery, but better than typical bland city.\n\nI would come back here if we were all the way out here at breakfast time for some reason.  It was reasonably priced, the service was great, the good was good, and the atmosphere was lovely."

The price was great, just under $5 for all that food.  However, it was not even worth the $5 I paid.  The other people I was with got their food first and thought it smelled a little off (the got rolled tacos).  I got my food and it had the same weird smell to it.  I gave it a try and tasted a rolled taco.  It had no flavor except the bad after taste.  The food may have been going bad, at least it smelled that way. Ended up throwing it away!

S'A very welcome addition to Central Scottsdale, Scottsdale Beer Company so far has proven to be awesome!\n\nI\'ve been there twice since their soft opening on January 3, and I must say I am very impressed.\n\nTo put it this way, with independent restaurants that have no existing brand or footprint to have as support, it is up to the owner/developer to create something that works, and that won\'t fall victim to the statistic of the ever-so-prevalent failed restaurants/bars.  \n\nI think the owners/developers of Scottsdale Beer Company have it right, and I wish them much success.  \n\nWhen trying out new restaurants over the years, I can tell that sometimes it takes a good amount of time for many places to smooth out the wrinkles and overcome the glitches that can inevitably happen with a new operation.\n\nWell, after these two visits, my experience was absolutely stellar from start to finish.  I have no criticism whatsoever! \n\nOverall, I found Scottsdale Beer Company to...\n\n...have excellent, attentive service from every employee encountered.  And it wasn\'t just solid service - everyone went above and beyond to see that the food, drinks, and overall experience was top notch.  You could tell that not only did they hire the right people, that they must have been well-trained to really care about their customers.\n\n...have very tasty food!  The fish and chips were amazing, the blackened fish sandwich scrumptious, and the desserts very good.  My friends seemed to really enjoy their selections too.  Extra points for very nice presentation too, with nice dinnerware, etc.\n\n...good beer!  Granted, their brewery is not at full speed ahead yet, but their guest beers were really nice choices for all tastes.  In most bars around the area, it seems IPAs predominate the "craft beer" taps.  Nothing against IPAs, but they are not my personal favorites.  I tend to gravitate toward Belgian-style beers, porters, stouts, bocks, etc.  In their guest beer list (which changes daily), they had a really nice Belgian quad and Russian imperial porter, both of which were top notch.\n\n...a really nice atmosphere.  It is apparent from all the TVs throughout, that this would be a great place to watch a game.  Additionally, even if it were packed, there is enough spaced to where it wouldn\'t feel crowded.  The decor has clean lines and feels urban and industrial, which I like.  There was even an artist there chalking up nice designs on their really large chalkboards.  Nice music in the background, but just at the right volume to where everyone can still hear each other.  On nice 75 degree days like today, I would guess the "garage door" style windows they had lining one wall to the outdoor patio could really make the place have an amazing open, airy feel to take advantage of the great Scottsdale weather.\n\n...was impeccably clean.  Granted, it is brand new, but sometimes that doesn\'t mean anything to some restaurants.  The bathrooms were super clean, as well as everywhere else.\n\nBottom line, it is not only apparent that the owners here seem to really care about hopefully turning this place into a cash cow success, but they also really seem to care about delivering a fantastic experience to their patrons on all levels (which is the key to that cash cow success!).\n\nI hope that they can keep consistency, and that many subsequent reviews from other Yelpers can exclaim about a great time as well!  Best wishes to Scottsdale Beer Company.  I look forward to returning!'

S"Brunch is my second favourite meal next to Lupper!\n\nI used to live around the corner to this place, so Sunday Brunch with my roommate here was a must. It is definitely an enchanting place, and the Eggs Benedict is delicious! (so are the waffles, french toast, etc.)  \n\nSo imagine this:\n\nYou wake up Sunday morning with a foggy recollection of the night before, your voice a little hoarse from possibly yelling, Let's do shots!! repeatedly at a night out with friends at the local watering hole (this tale is unconfirmed, so just go with it) You drag yourself to the couch, with a giant glass of water, and you sit there for an hour or two dozing in and out of consciousness, when your roommate finally rolls out of bed, and says, Im hungry, you? You grunt lightly signaling to her, that it's a yes, and you begrudgingly put on clothing that will help you blend in with humans. \n\nYou walk up the street, and you notice there are other stragglers for Sunday feeling about as good as you do. You happen upon a bistro that seems relatively incognito from the outside, but once inside, you notice the breakfast paradise you've waltzed into. There is a wooden motif, you see brick, and these gorgeous french doors. You plop yourself down, and look at the menu, and slowly humanity seems not too far off. An earl grey tea to gently coax you back into society, and once your food arrives, you realize that, hey I can deal with today. After breakfast, you take in the surroundings, and you feel full, and warm, and ready to start your day (at 3pm), which coincidentally is great time to start thinking about Lupper."

My mom stacked the quarters on the table and I played midget skee-ball until I felt like I tore my rotator cuff.

Prices are good for the amount of food and once you have been more than once the staff will remember you and your orders. The only draw back is that right now at lunch there is only 1 or 2 servers so you may have to wait a little longer for a drink re-fil or any other request you need after the food had been served. With that being said I still think the quality of the food, the price value, and not having a long wait to sit are worth it.'

S'Everything is overpriced in the Flamingo food court, but this has to be the single worst Vegas fast food experience for me. $8.95 for a ***TINY*** child size bowl consisting of a mixture of rice/chow mein and one entree. $3.95 for a large soda, $3.45 for a medium soda. Attitudes from the employees. The Vegas buffets are expensive, but even they are a better deal than this dump, at least you will get a lot more food for the price. I will never be back.'

S'Always one to try out new places I had noticed that SLo foods opened recently. Decided to check it out on date night on a Friday. We arrived at 7pm and there was only a group of 4  in the restaurant. A little disappointing but understandable with the fact that it\'s new, basically unheard of at that the parking lot was full but mostly with the customers most likely at the nearby Blanco\'s.\n\nI was thinking that the decor might be a bit trendy "LAish" a la AZ88 but instead, though very chic and warm it felt a bit more like an Italian restaurant.  Little impact on my rating but maybe it\'s the Tuscan chairs that weigh it down a bit.\n\nThere was only one waitress and the owner. Both were very kind and the owner obviously is very proud of the concept and happy to detail the food.\nI ordered the chicken ragout initially but was told they were out of chicken (because all their supplies are fresh...perhaps but a bit disappointing), so I went with the regular aubergine ragout. It was very tasty, with a side of rice. My date being a vegetarian had the brie sandwich. There too unfortunately they had ran out of the ciabatta bread and it was baguette that wasn\'t too soft (or fresh?).\n\nThere were a few other snafus during our meal. Our waitress would come, then disappear for a bit and not refill the water for example\'. The owner would come and check if we liked the food, offer a sampling of some of their soups, yet only return with samples of their turnip soup when we had just about decided to order dessert.  We decided to try out the carrot cake. Nothing amazing but it was good. The last glitch was that the waitress came to tell us their cardreader was down and that I would have to write my cc #. That\'s definitely a first for me.Minutes later when receiving our soup samples (after the entree) the owner said the machine was working....and in the end, the machine wasn\'t so we paid in cash thankfully.\nI\'d maybe go again to give them another shot in a few months but hopefully they can iron out their glitches and the restaurant can form a certain reputation for itself.'

Given, though, that this was my experience, I'll share it, nonetheless, and just urge you to try it in person if you're going to bother.\n\nMy partner (an immigrant from Mexico) and I tried the quesadilla, nachos, tortilla soup, and french fries (which were a substitute for elote / corn because the restaurant had run out of corn).\n\nThe quesadilla was unexciting.  It was a flour tortilla with cheese stuffed inside and melted.  The tortilla soup, my fiance says, tasted like chicken noodle soup with crushed tortillas in it.  The fries were soggy at best, and the nachos were an atrocity.  It appeared as though they opened a bag of tortilla chips, threw on scoops of beans, avocado, and canned nacho cheese sauce, and left it alone.\n\nBy the time the food arrived, what was once hot was cold, what was once firm was soggy.\n\nIt may be because I adore Mexican food... it may be because I had it delivered instead of going into the restaurant... or it may actually be something wrong with the restaurant.  I can't say for sure based upon one experience... I can just say my one experience hasn't left me excited to try it a second time around."

A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes.\n\nDear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare..\n\nI tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha.\n\nIn short, I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage."

She pointed out to us who our server was. Our server was busy taking the order of some people who had sat down 10 min after we arrived and were seated. The worst part is that these customers were not ready to order so the server spent 15 minutes explaining the menu to them. I was ready to leave after that but we gave her a bit more time. But when she went to another table of other customers who sat down after we did, we got up and left.\n\nWe want this restaurant to do well because it's in our neighborhood but I don't think we'll be back. The hostess noticed us leaving and offered to give us drinks to go and was apologetic about our crappy service. The manager saw us leaving but didn't seem to care. \n\nPerhaps this is not the server's fault as she wasn't aware that our table was in her station. Or maybe the person who took our drinks order could've also taken our food order. Regardless I blame this on poor management."

At 1st we thought they were employees because of the location of the bar. \n\nVery nice servers. I think they were the owners. (Maybe sisters. Idk) we didn't order any food but noticed a guy in the Val Hand Tossing pizza dough. And a family dressed in church clothes eating.

S'I was very excited about this restaurant opening in South Charlotte and done by local restaurant owners. It is billed as farm to table with local, fresh ingredients.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is cozy and quite lovely with fireplaces and stone.  It\'s located in South Park.  \n\nTo be fair, we came on the first Friday they opened. Our server took forever to get us our wine and she didn\'t know at all what she was doing.  She struggled opening the bottle, and then she poured a rather pricey red way over volume in the first pour.  She had to be prompted to stop pouring -  to the point that we did not get 4 glasses out of the bottle because she poured so much in the first glass.  In terms of wine, they ran out of the first bottle we ordered so we switched our choice only to be told they were out of it.  They were also out of the next bottle we picked.  So, the owner came with a recommendation.  When I asked if it was a similar price point as my previous selection, I was told "of course, we aren\'t THAT restaurant".  However, when he checked the wine, it was not the correct price point.  He did the right thing by us and discounted it a bit.\n\nWe ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were amazing.  Especially the gulf coast ones.  However, I asked for tabasco for them and was told they didn\'t have any.  Later, the waitress brought green tabasco but that\'s absolutely not the same. \n\nI ordered the arugula and walnut salad and it was perfectly prepared and tasty.\n\nThe entrees were a problem.  They were out of my first fish selection so I selected a fish on the menu but requested that they prepare it with an alternate to the fingerling potatoes.  I asked for more beets, a sweet potato instead - basically anything other than the potatoes.  The waitress told me they couldn\'t do that.  That made no sense to me since the menu had a listing of local farms they are patrons of.  Anyway, I decided on the shrimp and grits.  That was a really bad decision as the shrimp was overcooked, the grits were overcooked to a point of sticking together in a giant clump and the sauce was bland. I ate the shrimp (I was starving) and left the rest.  The owner asked me what I thought of the food and I politely told him it was "ok".  That once again, he needed to have tabasco or some seasoning available (this was a white wine based sauce and didn\'t have sausage).  He didn\'t seem interested in my feedback.  On the positive note, my husband had the grouper and thought it was outstanding. \n\nThe owner returned with a piece of cheesecake that is his mother\'s recipe which my husband gobbled down quickly. However, he did not apologize for the experience, thank me for feedback or invite me to return.  I might consider returning but there are better choices in South Park.'

S'The menu here is pretty sophisticated for such a casual place (which I love - great food that you don\'t need to dress up to eat). The people-watching is beyond compare, what an awesome neighborhood. We were told by a Canadian BFF that portugese chicken in Montreal was a must, so can\'t comment on the taste of the rest of the interesting menu (lots of fish). I had the daily special (quarter chicken mild, fries, salad, Stella Artois IPA for $10.49). DH had the half chicken medium with fries and rice, and a coke. Service was great, friendly (and cute! sorry DH). We waited a bit for the chicken, apparently a shift change inside between lunch and dinner. Really the wait was not terrible, but we got an apology. The chicken was really good - grilled with crisp skin but not charred, tender inside and very flavorful from whatever spice/herb mix they used to marinate/baste. They used a red sauce to add heat, and I found a taste of the medium was pretty hot (and hot enough for DH). They offer hot and "fuego" for those who like spicier. The flavor of the sauce was a little like buffalo wing sauce, but it was thicker and spread on top, not doused. The rice was the parboiled style (typical latino restaurant type) and pretty bland, but good against the hot sauce and vinegar from the dressing. The salad was romaine, super-thin sliced red onion (maybe pickled) and olives, with a pleasant vinaigrette. And there was just the right amount, more than a garnish, but not the type that seems to grow in amount as you eat it. I loved the fries, but it would depend on your taste - they were seasoned really well, as to size not shoestring (frites) but thinner than steak fries, and fried crispy but still very moist on the inside. I like that style a lot (pretty greasy), so ymmv. They might have offered ketchup or mayo for the fries, but we didn\'t need it enough to ask. Server spoke fluent french (as far as I could tell) and english (for sure!). Have no fear if your french is terrible or nonexistent! And seriously, the neighborhood and foot traffic is really chill and interesting. Curbside parking is available on the side streets, or small pay lot around the corner.'

It was the best meal I\'ve ever had for so little money.\n\nThe one bad thing, and that doesn\'t stop it from getting all 5 stars, the guy in the back said the pancakes were pretty huge, but I\'m from Texas so to me huge means "larger than a 14-inch hubcap" and these pancakes were less than half the size.  They were thick, and stuffed like I\'ve never seen stuffed before!   I could have eaten ten of them without feeling full, but again, I\'m from Texas.  \n\nI had the plain coffee, and it was a bit more bitter and weak than anything in Texas, but that\'s my fault!  They had a HUGE menu of coffee and I should have tried the Syrian coffee or a few shots of espresso.  They had Vietnamese coffee too, and that\'s usually strong no matter where it comes from.  \n\nThere\'s also a library on the wall behind the tables, Pittsburgh has free Wi-Fi, it\'s just spectacular.'

We ate outside on the terrace which was landscaped beautifully with ivy and flowers. \nThe service was terrible here. We had to ask twice for coffee refills, water, and even silverware. The wait staff seemed preoccupied.\nThe menu was traditional French. I had a country dried ham baguette sandwich which was very nice. Denis had the omelette. Again the food was great, service lacking.'

I had some yucky pieces of lettuce in mine, the chicken was kind of spongey and the tortilla chip crunchies just didn't taste good.... I dunno, not for me. I had the southwestern chicken salad. \n\nI'll definitely give it another shot. Hopefully my next one is better. I'll be rooting for this place!"

They have your basic meats chicken steak ground beef shrimp that you can get as entrees with rice and veg and they also have those same meats you can get in pita wraps with tziki sauce which is very good. The only thing I wish is they had more sides for wraps like rice or veg. They only give you the option of fries or salad but overall good spot for some quick good food. Don't expect to get great customer service though, the staff isn't rude but they aren't outgoing and friendly either"

Mr Charles has been around since the 80's, is a father/son business and are known for their chicken poboy( 3 piece, potato wedges and a roll).  I called in my order of chicken and fish and arrived just before closing.  I conversed with the father who rang me up and he couldn't believe I had never been there before since I've lived in Charlotte a while.  He was such a nice guy and reminded me of home when he asked for my last name to ensure he didn't know any of my 'folks'.......too funny.  I wasn't in love with how the fish and chicken was seasoned, the potato wedges were actually seasoned better, but I do plan to return for what I hear is a pretty mean turkey burger."

S'As a huge fan of the Maple Tree Cafe, I was really excited to help out a local business by trying out their new location at Lucky\'s. \nI wish that I didn\'t. And I won\'t go back. \n \n\nComplaints: [Hands down - the service]\n\n#1 - We were greeted at the door by a waitress who didn\'t even know the proper name of the restaurant. \n#2 - The waitress did not refill our drinks, even though the drinks were empty about 15 minutes before our meals came.. Yes, it was a long wait, which we were OK with. We know it is a new location. HOWEVER- Not having drinks while eating is just NOT OK. In fact, she NEVER checked back until we were finished eating... and we were there for quite a while.\n#3 - I ordered Maple Coffee, and the waitress finally asked if I wanted a refill. I said just coffee please. (2 are just too many.... despite being amazing). She brought another maple coffee. No water. No drink for my guest. In fact, the waitress was not happy about asking for another drink. REALLY? She obviously only wanted a larger tip. I tip 20% standard.. but I tip better for GOOD service. \n\n\n\n#4 - We were charged for a lunch item with our breakfast that we did not order. We did not receive it. In fact, that item was not even on the menu that we had. When we told the waitress, she basically said , "OH. I will have to check on that". .. not "Sorry" or "Yeh, you definitely didn\'t order that". She took our order. How could she not know what we ordered? \n\nIf you don\'t care about the customers, then it is very apparent to the customers... and they won\'t return. I realize that I am just one customer, but ...  \n\nAnd now... The good: \n#1 - The food is delicious. The menu is very close if not the same as the main location. \n#2-  I still won\'t return, but the atmosphere is nice... and there are tv\'s for a relaxed viewing of a sporting event. \n\n0 stars for service. \n3 stars for the cooking staff & behinds the scenes staff who  were working very hard to create good food.'

With comfortable dining outside with misters to keep you cool on a hot summer day you will have the resort getaway feeling without the large vacation bill.  Try the nachos for a starter.

S'Let me start right out by saying that this review has nothing to do with  food!!!  (Unless you count the onion rings appetizer which tasted like most deep-fried onion ring appetizers.)\n\nSome of you know me now as someone who LOVES tradition and history and preservation and stuff-like-that.  \n\nSo we came here for the tradition (great old supper club from the 40\'s), the history (an1847 stagecoach inn, later a stop on the Underground Railway, and a Speakeasy circa Prohibition) and the preservation (it\'s hard to keep a 150-year old lady going in style).\n\nSo we came to DRINK and PLAY, in other words, on a busy Friday night, in spite of, or because of, the fish fry.  We grabbed some stools but found ourselves giving up our seats to some lovely ladies who were waiting to be seated for the fish fry.  (Like I said, we weren\'t here for the food, but I gotta wonder why the fish fry was JAM PACKED CONSTANTLY.)\n\nAfter bugging the extremely convivial bartender about the history of the place, and begging to see the "wine cellar"/slave-holding-tank in the basement, he tossed his apron at someone and announced an impromptu "tour".  WOW!\n\nIt was cool to say the least, imagining the terrified slaves packed into the "secret" cellar, with its curved brick walls.  So we took turns squeezing in and out, then returned to the bar and proceeded to enjoy tons of conversation with the locals.  So, I\'m a fan!'

S'I was sick!  I came home with leftovers!  I would do this again and again!  This was the best!  I was told to come here from a friend and man was it the right choice!  The food was outstanding.  The only complaint is I only had one sitting.  The Suckling pork was great, but funny enough not the best.  The four of us had ordered apps, salads and soups and main courses, and had to stop on each serving to take it home, and we still had more to take home when all was said and done.  The spinach salad was to die for and I will be trying to make that at home.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the steak was cooked perfectly and the service was fantastic!  In fact, I read reviews before I left expecting less and got way more!  This morning we are making Suckling Pork omelets and for lunch, making steak sandwiches.  If you read anything about this place that is negative, then try it again - again, you can B*&^h, about places all day long, but really - good food is subjective, but well crafted food is unusual.  This placed - more so for a hotel restaurant, deserves a 5 star rating.  \n\nAs for being a personal Zagat or Berlitz reviewer, people take Yelp way to serious on all the details.  Sure - you can find this or that to complain about and knock a star or three off, but in the end, honestly try to read reviews with a grain of salt and get out and try new places.  We do and wow - we loved it!  Again - enjoy your time here and make this one of the stops you go to.'

It sells reasonably priced coffee and teas, it has a deli counter with various bits and bobs for creating sandwiches and salads and, randomly, it has a wee cabinet of 'freshly' baked pastries (this is similar to the kind of thing you normally only see in petrol station minimarts, I highly doubt they are actually made on the premises). Its one discerning feature is the AMAZING super duper fast WiFi (I challenge you to find a faster connection in any other Edinburgh caff), I would trek across the city for connectivity this good, however, they only let customers use it for 45mins.

I also ordered a chicken roti and a Grace pineapple soda.\n\nMy order was ready very quickly and I hopped into my car to go home.\n\nI put my keys into the ignition to go but settled back into my seat to taste a pattie. They were very hot which I like, the pastry was very flaky and the filling oh so deliciously spiced and unlike most places, this pattie was stuffed with filling, no skimpy, thin layer! Mmmm, it was worth the drive! I contemplated eating the other but I was a thoughtful gf and brought it home:)\n\nI brushed the crumbs off me and started driving home, my roti tempting me with it's curried aroma teasing my senses.\n\nOnto the roti...\n\nI got home, opened the bag and took my first bite, oh my god was my first thought! Heavenly! Beautifully spiced, saucy, flavorful, nice chunks of potato and the chicken, beyond tender and delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful and I will not be hesitating to drive back when my next roti craving hits me!\n\nI can't wait to try their jerk pork and jerk chicken, I definitely plan on getting some to BBQ!\n\nThanks Kim for your descriptive, well written review and thanks Mr Pattie for making your food so delicious!"

My one complaint, and I\'ve even written the owner on this before, is the service. Now i don\'t mind waiting for good food, that\'s not the problem, problem is you can never find a waitress. Need a drink refill? You\'re best bet is to walk up to the bar with your empty glass. The wait staff is very unorganized. I think part of that reason is because they hire mostly just family members, instead of qualified waitstaff. After 2 yrs of going to this place, we finally introduced ourselves to the owners. You would think they would have introduced themselves to us for how often we were there. Not a "friendly" dinner, but certainly GREAT food. And best pizza, hands-down.

S"Great no-frills Portuguese at a good price. \n\nA little difficult to get the lay of the land first.  When we visited in Sept 09, they were having some issues with the city as far as getting a new sign put up, so it was hard for us to find the resto.  Then, when we walked in, we were greeted by a huge grill loaded with chickens (they do a mean take-out business, it turns out).  The dining room was actually tucked in around the corner, a new addition to their grill/store-front.  But once we were in there, it was a pleasant little place to have a meal.\n\nWe didn't try the rotisserie chicken, which is apparently the draw.  Instead, my dining companions and I focused on their other meat offerings: the steak, the mixed (pork) grill and the chourico.  Everything was excellent and authentic.  And maybe it's because I'm a Bostonian and just used to paying a lot to dine out, but the prices were ridiculously  low.  Service was casual and friendly.  \n\nCan't wait to take my parents here, if they ever agree to come to Montreal with me again."

S"Set the wayback machine to November of 2013.  I am on a two-week journey in Edinburgh for reasons unrelated to food.  However, being a food blogger, I made a point to have at least one restaurant experience each day for the purposes of my reviews.  I figured that considering the amount of walking I'd been doing, I shouldn't have had any problem keeping my weight down.  By the end of the two weeks, I had gained ten pounds.  I blame restaurants like Nawroz for that.\nIs this a critical review?  Not in the slightest.  I'm only saying that with nearly every restaurant I've been in, I've never seen more generosity in service and portions than businesses specializing in Middle Eastern cuisine.  Okay, perhaps I would put them on a tie with the Greeks, but I would much prefer large portions of Middle Eastern cuisine than of Greek.\nYeah, I know, I'm going to get murdered for that one.  \n\nI'm not saying that Middle Eastern cuisine is better than Greek cuisine.  I'm saying that Middle Eastern cuisine is...clearly better, how can anyone argue with that?  I've said that certain cuisines become gateways to other cuisines; they stimulate your culinary curiosity while others are gastronomic thunderdomes.  Which would I put in the latter category?  Obviously American and westernized Chinese.  Even sushi is starting to fall into that category.  But gateway cuisines?  Indian definitely, French and maybe Dutch to lesser degrees, they all open our minds to new ideas, leading to other possibilities.  From Indian, you may try Nepalese, Persian, or Moroccan.  Of course, if one is talking technicalities, these countries are only lines on a map, and when addressing nutritional anthropology, what you get are hundreds of tribes migrating through history across Africa and Asia, sharing their ideas and techniques. \n \nComprehending that, suddenly calling a certain cuisine Indian makes no sense, as what classifies as Indian food is actually several different culinary methods which happen to occupy that region.  What classifies as Indian changes depending on where in India you are?  In fact, naming a cuisine not after a country but a people should be more appropriate.  Kurdish cuisine encompasses Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.  With that, there are quite a few foods which the average curioso will recognize.  You'll find falafels, humus, flatbreads, baklava, and shawarma.  So what should you do when given such variety?  You order it all.\n\nWait, what?  \n\nNawroz offers various dishes but one is a mixed collection of various starters.  So the five of us ended up getting large mixed plates of starters with only two mains, allowing us to share in the traditional Middle Eastern fashion.  You don't order a main and lift from it selfishly.  You order a mountainous bowl of food and open the plates of the table to share.  This is what you do.  Nawroz should be experienced each time as a gathering of friends and family.  Invent a celebration if you have to.  Someone's birthday?  A wedding?  Christmas (which they celebrate at Nawroz ironically), or how about the traditional Iranian new year...which is actually called Nawroz.  So the restaurant is named after one of the most boisterous events in all the Middle East; why wouldn't you take that opportunity?  It's like a restaurant that celebrates Christmas all year round.\n\nThe d\xc3\xa9cor is perfect with what it attempts to convey: culture and tradition with mild compromises to operate as a functional restaurant.  Red and black chairs over a tiled floor, raw brick on the walls with hanging rugs, tapestries, and paintings.  Various regional iconographies rest upon the bar.  I can feel the pride of the owners in their culture by the d\xc3\xa9cor of the restaurant and the quality of their food.  Even the hummus is molded into a fan, topped with olives.  The flatbread is fried, a new first and favorite.  The mixed starters ranged from contemporary to intimidating and I devoured each and every one.  Even though we had ordered mixed starters for five with only two mains, we couldn't squeeze another plate of food onto our table.  Everything was good and we still had dessert waiting for us--three types of baklava with Turkish delight.  \nI'll reiterate my previous point.  The various cultures of the Middle East know how to make people welcome and this is reflected in their restaurants.  Their food is munificent, huge portions at reasonable prices.  With Shezan and Nawroz being so close to each other (walking distance) I know that any future domiciles in Edinburgh would have to be in close proximity to this region so when I entertain visitors, I always have a place to go.  I am happy that my small home town has a Persian restaurant--so at least my absence from this cuisine would be short.\n\nDECOR:  9\nPLATING: 8\nSERVICE:  8\nFOOD:  9\nVALUE:  10\n\nOVERALL:  8.8 out of 10"

I used a groupon and it still cost my wife and I $20+ bucks. There\'s  way better places in this town to have a out of this world burger, and folks this ain\'t one of them. \n  First if all I hate spending this kind of dough when I\'m not being served. Second our food sat in a window for 5 min while some guy took over 3 orders. "really guy" come on. This location sucked ball ass too. Place Station sucks. Non-Union. It shows.  I have another shit-poun for this place I won\'t be using. Johnny Rockers. More like Johnny Crockers. I was like why do people think this is so great? I should of read the Yelp reviews before I bought 2 groupons to this shit hole. Won\'t happen again. After reading the reviews people had the same complaints.

S'First, off, I went on a Sunday night and the place was completely deserted. Besides my table of 5, there were 2 other tables of 2. This is never a good sign, plus it created a really depressing atmosphere. For the second half of our meal, I could see the chefs chatting the whole time, because they had nothing else to cook. \n\nWe all had steaks, and they were average: not really worth the high price tag. I ordered mine medium rare, and it can out medium-well, and lukewarm. At this price point, the wine selection was really lacking as well - they only had around 4 wines suitable to eat with red meat. \n\nThe food would have been reasonable at around half the price, but the atmosphere alone ensures that I will not be returning.'

S'This place used to be called Chicken Bonz, as they specialized in chicken wings and had a few other items on the side.  They were pretty good and I ate there all the time.  \n\nUsed to being the important part.  \n\nA few months ago they broke from the franchise and renamed Meat Chix and Wieners.  Really?  Who calls a restaurant this?  I tried it out a few times after the change but today was the last straw.  We walked in and ordered the usual, 6 WIngs medium for me, same for my wife, Ranch and Blue Cheese dip, large fries to share and two drinks.  Well they changed their menu and no longer have medium sauce or Blue Cheese.  What kind of wing place doesn\'t have Blue Cheese.  My wife changes her order to a Portabello burger with onion rings, hot sauce on the side.  Almost $25 dollars later we sit down to wait.  \n\nAnd wait...and wait some more.  \n\n25 minutes later we get our order. Did I mention this is a cook to order fast-food place.  Orders used to come out at lightning speed, sometimes before we had even filled our drinks and sat down.  Not anymore. We were assured several times that our food would be right out by who we think was the manager.  However she grabbed her bags from the office that was set up in a booth in the corner of the restaurant before we got our food.\n\nAfter all that waiting you think they could at least get the order correct, right? Nope.  My wife got her burger with their trendy version of french fries that look like little more than thick potato chips.  No hot sauce, no onion rings.  I get my 5 1/2 wings (one was a mutant or from a baby chicken) , ranch and no fries.  She goes to cashier (the only person no working outside of the kitchen BTW)  and let her know.  A few minutes later we get the onion rings, but no sauce or apology.  \n\nThe food itself was OK, but again used to be much better.  The wings were small and thinly sauced.  The order of "fries"  was small and not particularly good.  My wife did say the Portabello burger was good.  \n\nI really wish I didn\'t have to write this, since the previous establishment had been so good and we went there often.  Whatever changed in the past few months has certainly been a bad move on Meat Chix and Wiener\'s part, and I don\'t think they\'ll be seeing us again.'

Ii was in the fridges next to the sushi, and curiosity got the better of me. It wasn't so much a shit lunch, as a pointless one.\n\nBut for every clanger, there's ten works of genius.

So it doesn't really matter which Chinese takeaway you go to, you can expect the same thing.\n\nGili Gulu, unfortunately, isn't much different. I mean, it's a little better, in that the sauces aren't as thick. But everything is so sweet. I'm giving them 3* because it's one of the better Chinese takeaways I've ever had, but that isn't saying much. I had shredded chilli beef, which was OK. The beef was soggy, not crispy, but the sauce was suitably hot and the rice was nice and fluffy. \n\nDelivery was pretty prompt, and we did get a free bag of prawn crackers (and I do love prawn crackers), but I should really stop getting Chinese takeaways.

We had a voucher for $40, which was quite a lot for two people. For appetizers, we got springroll (2), goi cuon (1) and vietnamnese style dumplings (banh bot loc). The springroll was good, not greasy but the inside sticks to each other and lost the usual hydrated fluffiness. The goi cuon had no vermicelli but plenty of cucumber and herbs for the flavor, no complaints from me since I like my goi cuon with minimal vermicelli but I don't think this is the norm. This is the first time I had vietnamnese dumplings and they didn't impress me in term of the flavors and execution, maybe I'm biased towards the Chinese style juicy dumplings. The main dishes were much better though, I had the com suon - pork chop with rice (and fresh veggies), the pork chop is quite good, made with plenty of marinate, cooked to perfect tenderness. The rice is standard with rice, fresh vegetables and fish sauce. Boyfriend got the chicken with peanut curry sauce, I had a taste and it was pretty okay - quite peanuty! \n\nOverall, the food is pretty standard, good price with the voucher but Pho Lien is still the #1 in my heart."

Sometime shrimp paste is sneaked into veggie food, but here this was no an issue. I went for a medium hot curry with tofu and vegetable, with some rice on the side. I can't remember the name of the curry. My friend went for the pad thai minus the egg, and we scared the fried taro with thai sweet chilli dipping sauce.\n\nEverything was fresh, well spiced and tasted quite unique in comparison to many of other Thai restaurants in town which clearly buy in the same curry paste. Presentation was good, water was topped up regularly and the waitors were very attentive in general. We shared a bottle of nero d'avola. The prices are a little on the high end (\xc2\xa311.25 for a main), but overall the food was delicious."

S'Middle of the road Mexican fare served VERY quickly.  At least at this Uptown location where the lunch line blazes along.  Middle of the road isn\'t a bad thing in this case, just exactly what you would expect from a semi-fast food Mexican place with these prices.\n\nI generally stick to two things when ordering.  Crispy Tacos with shredded pork or the Nachos with seasoned ground beef.  With the tacos, eat them quickly or the crispy shells get un-crispy quickly.  For the nachos, whatever you do, don\'t look up the nutritional info on the website or they will be difficult to enjoy.  if you\'re into pain/guilt  though, go and just plug in "chips", no other ingredients, and see what the calorie counter shows. For basically any dish, you get choices of salsa (go hot!), beans, rice, queso, cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, etc, etc...\n\nEnd of the day if you want to leave cube-ville Uptown, don\'t have much time and want to get filled up with some vaguely Mexican flavored food, Salsarita\'s is your go to.'

Add a bottle of rose and a cola to this and the total for added bits and pieces came to \xc2\xa331 (so pretty much another \xc2\xa38 per person for the Poppadoms & Dips, Half a Naan Bread & Half Rice, a Glass of Wine and a Shot of Cola if we had done so - which is reasonable per person but was quite sneaky regarding the "chip [poppadoms] & dip").\n\nHaving said that, \xc2\xa315 per person for what we had was quite good.

There was nothing I would say that was negative about the food but also I\'d say that there was nothing spectacular about it either. \n\nOne of the dips that was served at the start with the poppadoms was a spiced sauce with chunks of lime!... It was odd as I first thought it was some sort of vegetable but upon realising it\'s super juicy sour taste I stayed away from that one. I suppose it was kind of mixing the super hot chili with the lime to get a balance...\n\n\n\\\\ G O O D   F O R \\\\\n\nGroups,\nCouples,\nFriends,\nBar,\n[Open until 2 AM which I presume the bar will be occupied mostly and also maybe for late night food servings - It delivers so I presume it caters for Take Away also]'

I ordered 2 of the combos that are supposed to come with wonton soup and rice. They delivered the principal plates instead which were more expensive and I did not get any rice or soup and when I called to let them know they refused to fix it. The Beef broccoli had a strange smell to it and the beef was grey. The poulet ananas looked like it was deep fried 2 days ago and then just reheated and it had a very small amount of sauce and burnt pinapple chunks.    Would not recommend.'

However, there's something not sitting quite right with me about my dining experience...the restaurant checklist in my head goes something like this:\n\nPerfect location? Check! (top of Leith Walk, across from the Playhouse &Cinema!)\nGood opening hours? Check! (open until 3am!)\nPretty Middle Eastern decor? Check! (Colourful glass lanterns galore!)\nDelicious food? Check! (my stuffed vine leaves were fabulous, and the falafel   shawarma wrap was a tasty, good sized portion)\nNew discoveries? Check! (Pomegranate Ice Cream, creamy, smooth, delicate YUM!)\nBYOB? Check! (and no corkage charge either!)\nExcellent value? Check! (3 courses, including a tip worked out at \xc2\xa320 per person!)\nGood service?....hmmm!\nGreat atmosphere?....erm!\n\nMy checklist grinds to a halt at this point!\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was a nice enough place to come and eat, and I think it'd be a perfect weeknight / late night place to grab a bite to eat, but given we were on a birthday night out, it just didn't feel we were looked after enough to make it special.\n\nI've been in many other BYOB restaurants where you're given ice buckets, and the waiting staff have still poured out your glasses of wine (and kept them topped up!), but here we were just left to fend for ourselves. I suppose we could have asked for ice buckets, and probably would have been given them...but that's not the point!\n\nAfter sitting down we seemed to wait an age before we were given menus and our order was taken, although the food actually came quite quickly once we had ordered. After another long wait, we had to ask to see the dessert menu as they didn't seem too fussed about giving it to us. Further request for water to be topped up and the bill followed.\n\nIt certainly didn't have the same, lovely atmosphere that Hanams manages to achieve, but it was good food at a very reasonable price, and I'll certainly be back for more of that delicious Pomegranate ice cream. I just think I'll maybe give it a miss if I'm looking for a venue for the next special night out."

When you walk in, the decor is pretty modern/asian with a plexiglass floor. A couple tables have running water through the plexiglass. I mean it's a great concept. Not too practical though. Their specialty is this crab dish that I saw kept being pushed around. It was New Year's. I wasn't trying to get smelly. \nThe patio area is pretty cool.

"Salt n pepper Scott" rocks behind the bar, as does our beloved Scotty, for that matter - like Manhattans? Ask for Scotty! I do wish the menu would change a bit, but we come here so often, the lack of variety is kind of our own fault. Scotty DOES know!'

S"My husband and I took both sets of our parents to Olio, prior to a Pitt Basketball game. Our reservation  was at 5:30 and we barely made it out for the 7:30 tip off! The service was THAT slow. Our server was very sweet, but she was clearly overwhelmed and didn't have the support to handle her tables effectively. \n\nAs for the food...we started with a few pizzas. They were good, but I can't help but compare to local Neapolitan-style titan il pizzaiolo. And honestly, there is no comparison. Olio's crust was slightly undercooked leaving it very doughy. The toppings were average quality and the sauce had a 'tomatoes-from-a-can' flavor. \n\nMost of our party enjoyed the entrees. I thought my husband's chicken Marsala had odd proportions of the (tiny) chicken entree to the side of pasta. All of us agreed that the pastas were overcooked. Al dente pasta is the simplest aspect of Italian cooking and should be a given, whether dining at a national chain or on the Amalfi coast. Again, the canned flavor wasn't cooked out of the tomato sauces, and my meatballs were hard as rocks and completely lacking seasoning. The best thing I had all evening was the Casa salad. That's a start, I guess.\n\nWe had to leave for the game, so no time for dessert. Something tells me we didn't miss much. \n\nAt least Olio's predecessor (Joe Mama's) didn't pretend to be something it wasn't!"

S"I was greatly surprised by this place. As a lot of restaurants in this area are closing down, this place opened up 7 1/2 months ago. An older gentleman was working the counter and told my girlfriend and I all about the place, the food and answered all of our questions and even gave us some history on a lot of the foods. Not only did he take our order, but he cooked the food and delivered it to our table, 3 courses and took them away. Some Great Mediterranean Hospitality. This place was a breath of fresh air as we go to restaurants who don't greet us and don't care about us or even have time for good conversation, this place was Great and will be on my dining rotation for sure. I can see myself eating here all the time. I had the Gyro and it was GREAT and even reminded me of when I was a kid in Chicago eating a gyro, it was that good and I helped my girlfriend finish her Veal sandwich, that was so tasty and smelled great. \nMy ethnicity is part Greek, so I love this food anyway, but this place was GREAT and will recommend it to many people in the future. See you soon. If you are going there for a quick meal, probably not the place, but give it a try, I know you will love it as much as I do."

S'On a visit to Montreal from NYC, discovered Kamela completely by accident. I biked past it, stopped as it looked very interesting and cool and vowed to come back that night. We did and I considered it one of those lucky "finds" you sometimes get lucky enough to just discover by accident when traveling. Its a very small place in the "Plateau" near Park Fontaine, a tiny bit out of the way but well worth a visit.\n \nWe had cous-cous which was classic and perfect. Well prepared, very flavorful, portions were huge. Prices were very reasonable. Our server I believe was the owner and after our meal he even offered us mint tea on the house, a nice gesture of hospitality. He did the traditional impressive pour of the tea from about 4 feet high. Friendly warm atmosphere, and a cozy place with very good cuisine. I really enjoyed Kamela\'s and would go back to anytime, so go check it out if you have the chance.'

S"My Dearest Federico's,\n\nIt's been a while since we last spoke. I'd like to say that I've been busy, and just haven't had the time, but that would be a lie. The truth is, I've wanted to write, but it just hurts too much. I miss you, Federico. I miss everything about you. The rolled tacos with Guacamole and cheese. The Carne Asada burritos. The morning wood. \n\nI miss waking up, not grouchy, but eager, because I knew I'd see you on my way to work. I still remember the first time I stuck your meat in my mouth. I remember being nervous because I knew nothing about you. I was nervous that you'd see my Goldenly Bronzed complexion, and fail to realize that beneath the incredibly tanned skin, was a white boy who loved nothing more than to be stuffed by a Mexican's chorizo. But you didn't judge -- not once. Nope, you were a total gentleman. Instead of forcing it down my throat, you simply put it in my face, and allowed me to pace myself until I swallowed every inch. And I did. I remember being in my UPS truck, thinking about you every time I checked my mirrors and saw the stain you had left on my shirt from the warm juice that had dripped from my mouth. By noon, I was fully aware of the pounding I had taken, because I didn't shit right for a week. But I didn't care, some bubble guts are a small price to pay for what you were putting inside of me. I had to see you again. \n\nBefore long, I had completely forgotten about Ronald and that red-headed bitch Wendy. Fuck a Frosty, my mouth was fully committed to you, Federico. God we had some good times, didn't we? But, like all great relationships, we, too, faced some adversity. You know what I'm talking about right? The day of the dog, Remember? I felt as if I was slapped in the face that morning. Let me rewind a little bit. \n\nWhen the word got out about my new morning routine, my friends and family were against it. They would tell me how bad you are, and you will eventually damage my heart. They even stooped as low as accusing you of putting dog meat into my mouth. FUCKING DOG MEAT! But I wouldn't listen. I was in love and didn't care what anybody had to say. So you can imagine the anger, and sense of betrayal I felt when I pulled up to your drive through, and was LITERALLY greeted by a dog barking in Spanish through the speaker(100% True story). Without skipping a beat, I ordered my Carne Asada. I guess I was so used to pulling up and not understanding a single fucking word anyway, that I just took it in stride. I don't speak Dog or Spanish, so I wasn't even going to ATTEMPT to understand Spanish Dog.  But even that wasn't enough for me to leave you. Maybe my friends were right, maybe you WERE putting your dog meat inside of me. But I wouldn't accept that, so I quickly dismissed that theory, and convinced myself that maybe the dog taking my order was covering the normal woman's shift. What an idiot. But hey, we were young. \n\nWow, look at me. It's been years since our last rendezvous, yet, you still cause me to nervously ramble. I guess my love for you followed me to San Jose. Anyways, I just wanted to stop by and say hello. And that I can only hope that you miss my mouth, as much as my mouth misses stuffing you inside of it. I love you, Federicos, you're my favorite Mexican. \n\nForever yours, \n\nMat\xc3\xa9o"

S"Staying at the Hilton, I love the breakfast buffets this place offers! They always have my favorite, biscuits and gravy, bacon, sausage, french toast (or pancakes), some sort of potatoes, two types of scrambled eggs, fruit, lox/tomatoes/capers, and of course, the omelet station! tons of toppings to choose from, and they even have egg whites as well! she'll also fry up an egg any way you like it if you dont want an omelet/scramble. plus they have a side area of yogurt, granola, fruit to go, danishes/bagels, cereal, and more. Staff here are super nice, always getting you your drinks.\n\nHad dinner here as well, and unfortunately their dinner is just sub-par. We had 2 platters of cheese and crackers to start off with, and all the cheeses were yummy! First time I had sage cheese, and surprisingly, it was good, even with all the green! \n\nFor dinner, we had the pita and pesto hummus which was very good. Their fresh sourdough bread is amazing too! I chose their tomato basil soup, which I've had before, and it was good, but it's never piping hot. Their salads looked amazing too! Their dinner menu isn't too extensive, some fish dishes (the salmon seems to be a fave), steak dishes, and pasta. I went with the southern meal that I can't have regularly, shrimp n grits. The grits were made into crab cake portions, with shrimp and andouille sausage. It wasn't the shrimp and grits I was imagining, I wanted the grits to be more of a porridge, so was let down. But luckily I was too full, I could only eat a quarter of my dish anyways.\n\nGreat service, and we had 2 birthdays to celebrate, and the desserts they brought out were so nice! Would highly recommend them for their breakfast, although I wish they had hash browns as a potato option! Everyone raved about the salmon and gnocchi for dinner, so would recommend that too!"

The subs are $1-2 more than what I would look for in a place to visit more regularly, but I can't really argue with the spin these folks have taken on the Jersey Mike's formula. Meat's cut to order, toppings added as you wish, and the results were a winner at my place. Line was a little slow the day I stopped in, but that's because they were taking care of customers, not slacking and simply waiting out the timeclock.\n\nMenu and seating may be a little too limited for some, but I think there's enough of both here to give everyone an option that works for them. Pasta salad was an excellent side to add into the mix.\n\nI hope this place sticks as an option in downtown Lebo. I'll certainly stop in again."

No BBQ flavor at all! In fact, tastes like they add liquid smoke to meat! Gross! Coleslaw was soggy and looked like it had been thawed out and wasn't edible. Beans were like a refriend pile of slop and not edible.  As i was awaiting takeout, i was observing the service which consisted of 2 servers looking stressed out to wait on 3 tables.

Apparently this location has problems with people stealing napkins and ketchup, because there were none of the self service stations where you can load up.  \n\nThe person who took my order was incredibly rude.  There was no one in line behind me, and she kept trying to make me leave her counter while I was still putting my credit card away.  She told me where I could stand and wait 5 times.  \n\nThey pour the soda there, and she had managed to cover the outside of the cup with as much liquid as was inside.  Oh, and asking for a napkin to clean up her mess....that's a big no no too.\n\nAs I walked away, she proceeded to have a conversation with another employee about what a bitch I was for mentioning the sticky cup situation.  In Spanish.  I speak Spanish.   When they did toss my food at me, I had to ask for ketchup and napkins.  They asked how many napkins I needed. I would have asked for more if I had known that EVERY table in their lobby would be filthy.  Honestly, I probably would have felt better about eating out back by their dumpster.\n\nFinally someone did come out to clean the lobby.

We also ordered the tiramisu which was a very generous portion but I felt that it was over loaded with cream and lacking in flavour.\n\nImmediately after finishing our meal I was sick  (not food poisoning) which I imagine was due to the belly combo of spicy wings and *loads* of cream in the tiramisu.  \n\nFor the sub-par pizza and the price, we've decided to stick with what we know and not order delivery or pizza again.

S"I am glad to finally have a Pho restaurant on this side of town! My husband and I started with the Summer Rolls. I was glad that they were made with more noodles than lettuce. The only complaint about this dish was the peanut sauce wasn't to our liking. It was good just not our favorite in town. I had the #16 which is Pho with rare and well cooked beef, tripe, flank, and tendon. I was pleased with the soup. The tripe was a little chewy, but I've only found one place in charlotte where it wasn't so that was expected. Overall my meal was great. My husband had the # 11 (well and rare beef and meatballs) he finished the entire large bowl, which means he was pleased. \n\nThe place itself was very clean and somewhat quiet. There were just two other tables taken, so not too much chatter. Service was great. We tend to ask a lot of our servers because we seem to always need something. They were very nice and quick to get us everything we asked for. \n\nWe will visit again."

They also have the computerized drink station, which i love, because it has sparkling water for us that don't really like to drink soda. They have a nice living room style seating are with big leather lounge chairs. The staff is friendly and takes your order by name. I come here for a quick lunch every now and then. When i don't feel like cooking, and have limited funds. Great place for a fast food restaurant. Just a little bit above the rest."

S'We ordered food for delivery through GrubHub and everything was going smoothly. We got a call when the delivery guy got to our apartments, he couldn\'t find the place so my wife went outside to find him. Upon finding him she proceeded to hand her the food over the fence because the gate was locked, this would have been ok but he began by just handing her the big bag and 2 drinks all at once. Once again, this would have been ok but he wasn\'t polite and didn\'t seem to care that she was in process of dropping a drink while he forced the bag into her face. We let that go, went inside to enjoy our meal. Immediately we saw that the ranch dressing for the fried zucchini wasn\'t in the bag. The item specifically stated it came with ranch, who can eat them without ranch anyways? Now I try not to keep ranch in the house because it\'s so unhealthy, so we quickly called the restaurant(trying to have them catch him before he was out of the neighborhood) and they said they would contact him. We received a call back saying that the drive "can\'t make it" back. The man on the phone then proceeded to say that he would call him again to see if he can do it on another delivery. He called us again to say that driver would NOT return because it is too far    -_- If you google maps it from my home to the restaurant, it takes 5 minutes... FIVE minutes! Are you kidding me? Too far? I gave you a 5 dollar tip and you can\'t stop and drop off some ranch? Seriously? Terrible customer service. They asked if they could "hook us up" next time. And to that I say WHAT NEXT TIME? I chose delivery for a reason, I cannot just go out pick up some ranch seeing as I don\'t have a car. This completely ruined our meal plans as we had to sit and play phone tag, hoping the delivery guy would be bring us what we should have been brought. We asked for a refund and they still wanted to "hook us up", we insisted on a refund. In the end we had to get it from GrubHub but we got it. We asked for a manger and were told he would be in later. We left a message for him to call us back and we still have not got a return message. For future diners, if you\'re getting delivery, I\'d tip in cash so you know what kind of service you\'re actually paying for. That jerk didn\'t deserve my tip if I\'m not worth his time. It\'s unfortunate because I REALLY enjoyed the food, we both got the shrimp & chips and they were delicious. They won\'t be retaining many customers with that level of service.'

S'My grandmother brought my family here for my parents 25th Anniversary.  I made the mistake of Yelping this place the morning we were going.  I cringed with the low score and prayed for the best.  With this knowledge, I ordered safe all night, and I had a decent meal.  My family did not, and I got to see first hand many of the complaints highlighted.  The first warning sign should have been that on a Saturday night, this place was empty.\n\nFor the record, we did not have trouble with the cigarette smoke in the non-smoking banquet room.  But I don\'t think anyone was smoking much so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThe family all ordered coffee, and I started with a Cosmopolitan.  The waitress was great about the coffee refills and water refills.  The cosmopolitan was a joke.  First of all, it was the smallest drink I have ever seen, and it was so practically all cranberry juice.  At $7, I was over it.\n\nThen, a basket of bread came out.  The bread was pretty good.  There was a good variety and some unique things in the basket.\n\nMichael\'s one highlight is the number of sides you get with a meal.  Our meals included soup or salad, potato, and a vegetable.  Just like grandma would make.  However, the soup was not the quality of grandma\'s.  We all had chicken dumpling soup.  3 little dumplings with a debatable about being homemade soup.  Not too impressed.  Another table got the salads, and the salads looked sad.\n\nMeals:\nPrime Rib-  As my mother so deeply said, "For being a special, you would think they would know how to cut and cook this."  It was mostly fat and apparently pretty awful.  I actually think my mother threw it away when we got home.  My grandmother handed the waitress back the plate and asked her to dump out the excess sauce because it was mostly that.\n\nVeal Parm-  I played it safe and mostly won.  Two decent sized pieces of veal covered in cheese.  Safe choice.\n\nCrab Stuffed Shrimp-  For being over $25 you would THINK Michael\'s used real crab.  Nope.  These things were stuffed with filler and the portion was tiny.  Not amused.\n\nThe sides, however, were pretty good.  The twice baked potatoes were excellent and the fried zucchini was a score.  I would just order the sides next time.\n\nWe passed over on dessert fearing for more disappointment.  The final bill was right around $100.\n\nThe moral of the story?  Michael\'s recipes are ok, but the food prices are simply not acceptable.  I can say honestly that the, "Meh.  I\'ve experienced better." rating is completely accurate.'

S'Called in a "to go" Crazy Cheesy Crust large pizza with Sausage and mushroom at 5:50 PM.  Was told order would be ready to pick up in 15 minutes (pick up at 6:05 PM). Sat in the lobby and was given pizza at 6:30 PM.  Was so pissed off that I did not look at the pizza.  When I got home, there was a profound lack of toppings.  My wife told me not to grouse about it and that we ordered from this place to try it.  We finished half the pizza when she suggested I write a review.  I took a picture of the remaining slices as proof. Absolutely amazing these guys are in business.  If you use this location:\n(1) Add 15 minutes to the pick-up time they tell you.\n(2) Expect skimpy toppings\n\nOther than that, the place is fine.'

S'My breakfast here was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular but decent for what you might expect from a chain restaurant.  They appear short staffed.  One woman was hostess, server and cashier for the entire place.  One guy in the kitchen.  The speed of service and quality of the food weren\'t an issue.  The issue was the way the staff handles being short staffed.  No professionalism.  The server repeatedly complained to various customers about how she was so far behind and so busy because the manager apparently didn\'t show up to work.  I could hear her "sigh" loudly throughout the restaurant throughout my entire stay and could overhear her and the other employee complaining to each other about work.   \n\nI get it.  Boss flakes out and you start the day digging out of a hole.  We all face rough days at work.  The key is that the customer is not where the employee gets to vent frustration!   The customer wants an enjoyable dining experience without seeing and feeling tension and frustration of others.   I don\'t blame the server as much as I blame poor management.  Lack of support and training from a reliable leader is the downfall today.  This won\'t keep me from going to all Bob Evans restaurants. .. just THIS one.'

S"Tempus is really quite nice, and I say that as someone who tends to avoid drinking on George Street due to the high prices and the clientele.\n\nI've been to Tempus a few times, usually for drinks, but never seem to think of it as somewhere to go, most often it's a 'what's nearby' kind of decision. But maybe I should, as I've never been unimpressed.\n\nMost recently I visited with my mum and her good friend, who'd enjoyed a day at the Book Festival and the Fringe and wanted a drink and a bite to eat before getting the train home. We popped by, and whilst Tempus was busy, it was far from full, in fact we nabbed ourselves one of the nice booths (I was convinced it was empty because it was reserved, but no, it seems everyone else just preferred to sit at the high tables or at the bar, how odd). \n\nBefore we knew it a waiter had appeared, very attentive! We asked for a few minutes to decide and got stuck into the menu. Feeling in a cocktail mood we ordered one each (I had the Elderflower Tattoo - Sailor Jerry's, St Germain, apple juice and lime, beautiful but a tad on the sour side). As for food, Tempus does a great small dishes selection. These dishes are \xc2\xa34 each, or you can choose 3 and add chunky chips to make a platter for \xc2\xa314.50. Decent value for money. We had tiger prawns, chicken satay and salt and pepper squid (along with the chips and some salad). Mum's friend is vegetarian so ordered herb encrusted goat's cheese and a side of courgette fritters. The satay was delicious, easily the best of the dishes we chose, and the squid was very good too. The prawns were a little on the chewy side, but okay. And the chips were those big Jenga style ones and had a tasty garlicky seasoning. I'm assured the goat's cheese was good too, and having nabbed one of the fritters it was tasty and the tempura batter light. Yum.\n\nTwo cocktails, a glass of wine, a sharing platter and two extra dishes came to \xc2\xa344. That's really not too bad at all, especially for George Street. The interior decorations are smart, as are most of the clientele, but you don't feel out of place in your jeans. And the waiter was super attentive.\n\nTempus is definitely on my radar from now on."

I like my wings crispy and that's how they're done.\n\nEach night of during the week, they have specials.  The one I remember best is on Tuesday cuz it's 49 cent wing night.  Yeah!\n\nThe quesadillas are good too.  If I remember right they come in two sizes and three or four varieties.    \n\nHave tried a couple of sides, cajun curly fries with side of melted cheese for dipping and their onion rings.  They have something call Sloppy Fries, loaded with all kinds of stuff, which looks and sounds like a meal in itself.  Haven't tried yet, but whenever we see them come out, boy they look and smell good.\n\nOwners are really nice too.  They're always walking around and checking in on patrons to make sure everything is ok.  Very friendly folks.  \n\nThere are several TVs mounted so you can catch the games, throw back a few brews and munch away.\n\nHope you enjoy!"

But I "accidentally" came across Vegas Express Sushi because they supply Glazier\'s market with sushi... and they are GOOD.  Their takeout sushi is superior to the dried out crappy stuff you can buy at Vons or most gocery/deli stores.  Their cooked rolls compare to the ones you can buy at Costco, and their raw nigiri is very fresh.  For the price, you are definitely getting the next best thing to stepping in a sushi joint.  Also, they have awesome large party platters!  I\'ll be posting photos of their takeout and menu this weekend.

No Flo with her attitude here.\n\nThe food is good,  the service is good and the prices are inexpensive. The decor is definitely late 80's. Now for some detail on the food. It is classic diner breakfast and lunch type stuff. Omelets, pancakes, hash browns, thick toast. I've only been there for breakfast but it looks like lunch are burgers, chili, BLT's, etc. Back to breakfast. I don't know about the guy from Glendale who came here looking for a gourmet experience. This isn't the type of place. No crepes... Anyway the food is just really good breakfast food. I usually go for the ham and cheese omelets but get to taste my wife's pancakes and man are  they good the texture and flavor are great.\n\nNow the service. Really fast and personable. But it is almost like that Seinfeld diner episode. Every waitress has a certain build and I guess it must be the dress code but all the waitress wear short denim shorts, kinda like long Daisy Duke's. All voluptuous, all of them call you hon like the other yelper says, and they all seem to be veteran waitresses knowing how to handle everything and make you feel like a regular.\n\nGreat neighborhood place. We live between here and Scott's Generation Deli which is another great breakfast place so we end up going to both a lot. Scott's has more variety and interesting stuff on the menu plus Karsh's bakery is next door. But Pinky's Cafe is solid in what it does and the service is great. I highly recommend it if you are nearby."

S'Espresso stazione can be found at the city center, not too far from the trade fair. The small bar is cozy, there are newspapers to pass the time and you can take your espresso outside to sit in front of the bar. The staff is cheerful and you will see the owner preparing espressos just like the rest of them.\nBest of all: the guys at espresso stazione roast their own coffee! You will see and taste that in the espresso. I found the espresso to have a complex and full taste with subtle sour notes. This is rounded by a nice, dark crema, of a gray-brown color. You can buy the Tostino coffee in the bar.\nBoth the bar itself and the quality of the espresso are outstanding. Highly recommended!\n\nespressorato-blogspot-de'

Popular with those who work in the area you want to get in early to guarantee you get some soup and they once ran out of baguettes (hot BLT in a largish roll sufficed).\n\nThe staff are friendly and happy to make things up for you, and there is always an interesting selection of music playing in the background while you queue or wait. All in all a great place to get your soup and sandwich."

S"The first thing I noticed when I got my tacos was the quality of the meat. It wasn't that fatty, nasty looking crap found at other taquerias. It was lean, quality beef and pork (not perfect, but just enough fat). Other places need to take note... you can't get away with serving that nasty crap and expect people to come back.\n\nI got the three taco special  for $5. That's a bargain, considering it also comes with rice and beans. In typical street taco fashion, each one is served with onions and cilantro atop doubled up tortillas. They could have used more onions and cilantro, but at least there was a good amount of meat on each. Both the carne asada and the adobada could have used more seasoning, but the quality of the meat made up for it.\n\nThis little taqueria has only been open for about 6 months. They're located in the same strip mall as Smith's on Tropicana and Hualapai and are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\n3.5 Stars (kick it up a notch with the seasoning)"

Everything is very heavy and unhealthy, though. Be prepared to gain the freshman 15 very quickly if you eat here a lot. They try to rotate dinner foods, but everything starts to taste the same after a while. They clearly reuse foods from one day to the next which is pretty sketch. The servers tend to be pretty nice, though, which is surprising considering the messiness of the student patrons. I think I may've eaten dinner here once after no longer being on the mandatory meal plan, and that's totally ok with me."

S'Last night we had ordered a pizza from Papa Johns; We decided on the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza and had it delivered.  It was delivered on time, however when I bit into it I found a sharp chicken bone, about an inch long and half an inch wide.  The bone was razor sharp.  I\'m thankful I hadn\'t accidentally swallowed it or cracked a tooth on it.\n\nWhen I called this Papa Johns location, where I ordered the pizza, I told them that I found a sharp chicken bone in my pizza and all the person said was "OK".  He didn\'t ask if I hurt myself or attempt to make the situation right by offering a replacement.  I then asked to speak with a manager where she didn\'t offer any empathy either and just said "What do you want us to do for you?" in an annoyed tone.  I explained to her that I frankly would like my money back and that I\'d also like the number to the distract manager so I can let them know about this situation since I didn\'t feel that it was being handled appropriately.  The manager stated that they would refund the pizza and would call me back with the district manager\'s number, however I never received a returned call.\n\nAlthough we are a frequent Papa Johns customer, I feel that because of this experience, we will not be ordering from here again.  Not only do they have poor quality standards, they also have poor customer service and don\'t follow-through.'

You get in line and order your basic item (burrito, tacos, other things) then customize it as you sidestep down the counter. One thing to remember: you get a lot of food. Last time I got a burrito and ate the whole thing and regretted it. Not because it wasn't good, but because I was like a python that had eaten a wildebeest. \n\nThe food isn't fancy, but I don't think it's any worse than Pedro's, and for a lot less money. Also, you can drink beer! I love a fast-food place where I can booze it up. \n\nThe people who work there tend to be a mellow bunch, which I also like."

S"Nestled in an easy to miss corner of the almost dead of weekdays Kitchener Market, it's easy to miss. It's one of those places you hear about from a friend of a friend, one those tiny hole in wall bars with the best food, or mysterious restaurants with only a single table for two that you hear talked about every now and then but no one knows where it is. That's the kind of place Breadbaron is: a real hidden gem.\n\nBreadbaron is a sandwich counter at the Kitchener Market. Quiet, unassuming, you wouldn't give it a second glance if you passed it by, but if you did stop, if by some random chance you did decide to grab a sandwich boy are you in for a treat.\n\nMade by classically trains chefs, Breadbaron has fantastic sandwiches. Their bad days result in merely good sandwiches and their good days? Well, their goods days are something to be experienced.\n\nThe one thing you really need to understand is that Breadbaron makes their sandwiches from scratch. I don't mean they buy their ingredients from from some bulk supplier and slaps them together, I mean if they made any more of it they'd be filling chicken troughs with feed and forging cast iron.\n\nThey source all their ingredients locally, vegetables and meats from local farms and their own gardens, cheeses from low volume regional craftsmen, and more, but this isn't something like picking up a pack of meat from the store. No, they cure their own bacon, smoke their own brisket, they turn huge slabs of meat into those things we'd recognize in a store. When you get a sandwich from Breadbaron you aren't getting something anyone could throw together, you're getting something really unique.\n\nThat's the kind of place Breadbaron is.\n\nForget decor, forget atmosphere, if you're looking for a really good sandwich, and trust me you are, then checkout Breadbaron."

S"With the large amount of sporty 'old man' pubs on Easter Road, I was pretty excited when this place opened up as a gastropub.\n\nWe finally found time to head along and try it out a few weeks ago.  There was a pub quiz on so it was pretty busy and we had to sit at the bench in the window, which was fine. The stools were a bit high so made eating slightly awkward, but alas! The atmosphere was very laid back and chill.\n\nThe pizza's are BOGOF if you buy two drinks, so we decided to check them out. The mister had a black pudding & egg pizza which was delicious! I had a chorizo & something pizza which wasn't really anything to write home about. We were sat next to two American girls who'd been in the night before and said the pear(?) salad was amazing, although the soup they had the night before wasn't fantastic. So I think the pub may be struggling a bit with consistency when it comes to food. But they are fairly new still, so hopefully all these things will get ironed out.\n\nLooked like a good selection of beers and spirits. Something to please everyone.  Nicely decorated.\n\nWould definitely head back for a drink... verdict is still out on the food tho. Might give them another chance, but not in any hurry."

S"Stopped in to check this place out today as we were in Kitchener.  Since we had already had lunch and it was around 4 pm we ordered the Galao coffee.  I had a strawberry cheesecake (NOT made here - bought in) and my partner had the coconut tart (actually more like a muffin or cupcake).  The Galao is nothing special.  It's a simple Latte - on a par with MacDonald's or Williams Coffee Pub but twice the price.  My cheesecake was overwhelmingly sweet to the point where I couldn't eat it.  The coconut pastry was heavy as lead, dense, and had little to no flavour even though there was plenty of coconut in it.  Two desserts, 2 coffees $14. and change.  The server was a wonderful young man who took alot of time explaining the desserts.  Yes he got a nice tip even though the food was so-so.  The noise was horrendous as they were showing the World Soccer matches on every tv (there are several) and the crowd was drinking and watching the show. The restaurant is clean and new, not classy - very casual, kind of diner style.  We found the menu prices to be very high and were glad we had already eaten.  A side of vegetables or potatoes for example 6.99 and sandwiches around 10.95.  Definitely Toronto pricing here and not what I expect in a plain neighbourhood setting with paper napkins and a large take out counter.  We didn't try the chicken so we can't comment on that or the other mains, but since the prices are steep, I doubt we will be driving there again as there are so many other options.  Really I kind of doubt this place can survive with these prices and that atmosphere.  The breads are brought in from Toronto, ditto the desserts - the only thing made on the premises in baked goods is the Pastel de Nata which was sold out, and we've had plenty of egg tarts before now.  The chicken was still turning on the grill at 4.pm.  Everything is overpriced unless you order from the take out menu.  Three stars is for the service and to give it the benefit of the doubt."

So when my friend and I decided to try the latest addition on the Mound, I was very excited.\n\nThe menu is very reasonably priced. Although i didn't try a starter (as wasn't that hungry) - I throoughly enjoyed the haddock goujons and curly fries. The batter on the fish was delicious and extremely light.\n\nI liked that next to each dish on the menu the recommended wine is shown next to it, which is helpful for those unsure what wine to drink.\n\nI had a lovely house chenin blanc which was very nice indeed.\n\nThe staff were extremely friendly and we were very lucky to get the best seat in the house (in the right window as you come in) with the most beautiful view all the way down to Princes Street and over the city. I would definitely recommend booking this table if you're planning a romantic evening, or again, a lovely place to take friends and family as it's a really nice, relaxed atmosphere!\n\nMy friend felt it reminded her of a Swedish restaurant she'd been in and I can see what she means, with the very open plan, minimal style.\n\nDefinitely will be going back.

S"Went here for the lunch buffet, which was only available for a short duration during summer I believe.\n\nIt was not too expensive however there is not much to choose from, only four types of pizza were provided along with a salad bar. The salad bar was very small and only had one dressing, and the only vegetable was Roman lettuce.\n\nThe pizza tasted alright, albeit it boggles me that they put hot-dog sausages in their crust, which were very dry and tasteless.\n\nTheir ice cream machine didn't work :("

It has some TVs with Sky News on usually, and some departure boards so you know exactly how fast you have to down your "last pint" before the train home.\n\nThe toilets are clean, mainly because the staff have to unlock them for you from the bar - it\'s either a great idea, or horrible if you\'re in dire need of them like some folk I saw!\n\nFine selection of draft lagers and beers, and cheap-ish by station standards.\n\nFine.

S'This used to be an A-OK restaurant when they first opened. Who doesn\'t like a square burger and have it cooked to order?\n\nBeen coming here on and off since day ONE. Usually the food is pretty tolerable and it gets me to my next location - Wally World. Just park the car in the middle of the parking lot and you only have to get out of the car once.\n\nThis location seems to always be a little tricky. The French Fries are normally cold and we have to go up and ask for some fresh ones. The Burgers and Chicken Sandwiches are not too bad depending on the roll of the dice and whether it is a full moon or not.\n\nService is rather poor and the inside could probably use a makeover. Today they asked me for my name and somehow they interpreted (Mark) for Bark. Could this just have been a Freudian slip or are we making Dog noises at me?\n\nIt almost seems that ever since the famous Dave Thomas left the picture this place has just gone downhill in general.

That was a time when the Queen Elizabeth Hotel had a half dozen excellent restaurants down along the concourse.  \n\nYears later the whole complex was scaled back or closed.\nThe Beaver Club was cut back in space by 50% or more and went from top notch to tacky under different operators.\n\nI can see from the new web site that the space has been transformed to its original elegance.

Bill came to $26 so I am guessing there was a delivery fee which I failed to check. \n\nPizza #1 - Thin crust, extra bbq sauce, chicken and pineapple.  It was perfect.  I wish I had some right now.\n\nPizza #2 - regular crust, extra Robust tomato sauce with jalepenos and pineapple.  It was pretty good though I preferred the other.\n\nWings - Spicy and "slimy".  I don\'t know what it is with these places.  Seems I have only had non-slimy wings from our friends at BWW. Hm.

I thought hmmm not everyone can do biscuits and gravy justice maybe I'll check it out. \n\nThen I looked them up on Yelp and found that Sandra Dee is from Louisianna! Jack pot!

I guess they try to immitate Japanese restaurant in Korea. Well, it works, kind of.\n\nI had a craving for Bibimbop but they were out of ingredients-- huh? what? really? yeah.... so I orders Hoideopbop which is Chirashi sushi. It wasn\'t bad at all.

S"Summary: horrible service, mediocre food. I came here because the restaurant I wanted to eat at for Japanese ramen, was closed between lunch and dinner. I was starving so I walked across the street to Sushi ste-Catherine, because I figured they would have ramen and the outside looked big and modern, unlike a hole in the wall or mom and pop shop. The restaurant had about 8 people inside and many open tables. I stood in the entrance and just sat down after waiting for a few mins because nobody acknowledged me. Finally someone came and gave me water and a menu. I realized the menu said all you can eat sushi and soda for $20 some dollars. I went up to the cashier and asked if I could just order 1 thing and she gave me an a-la-carte menu. Of course no one came to take my order until I had to stop someone waking by, and ordered spicy beef ramen and a Sapporo beer (they only had 2 selections of beer). My food came out really quick but it was soba, not ramen!!! I was so hungry, I ate it anyways, and didn't complain because I'm sure no one would of cared. As I ate and read a book I was surprised in the amount of people that came in to eat with such bad service. The 2 booths behind me kept complaining as well. The soba was okay. Normal flavors. Nothing to rave about. When I paid ($14), I gave the server a MasterCard and she looked at the card like she's never seen one before, and then told me they only take Canadian cards. Luckily I had cash. Not worth your time, trust me. There are so many better options on the same block."

So lets get to it, the food.\n\nI ordered the philly cheese steak, which must I say delicious. It was loaded with well everything that's supposed to be on a philly cheese. The only problem I had with it was the portion of it. I only wished it was bigger, because it didn't last quite long. \n\nHowever, the fries were, so-so. It kind of reminded me of french fries from McDonalds and it wasn't quite so unique and didn't stand out. And well I believe with the appetizers with wings, there are fries under those wings as well. The fried pickles wasn't so bad either, but I felt it got a little soggy a little too fast. It could be that the water didn't come all the way out of the pickles before they fried them. \n\nOverall though, I would definitely come back. It had a great atmosphere and I would like to try a couple more things on the menu. (The cute waiter swayed my vote to 4 stars, haha)"

S"This restaurant had only been open for about six weeks when we visited.\n\n\n The food is a strange mix of the kind of tastes which instantly transport you to Greece, with a few dishes that carry way to much lemon. The tzatziki and gigantes were fabulous, for example, as was the halloumi. And the sea bass was awesome. However the stifado was not pleasant; the beef was beautifully cooked, but instead of the familiar rich taste of onion, it was far too lemony. And it wasn't just me - others at the table found the same with some other dishes too.\n\n\n I'm not sure whether the chef is over-compensating for western taste buds, but if they were to back off from the lemon, I'm sure it would all be good.\n\n\n My other criticism would be that there was simply far too much food, and so a lot of it got wasted. Our party all have hearty appetites, but there was no way we could finish much more than half of what was on the plates.\n\n\n The restaurant itself is lovely inside, and would be ideal for both couples or for quite large groups. And the staff are extremely polite and attentive.\n\n\n Hopefully we just caught things on a bad day, or they're just getting into the swing of things, as I'd dearly love to have a reliable Greek restaurant in Edinburgh. I'll go back and try a second time, but if it's the same then, it'll be my last visit."

S'NEVER AGAIN!!  My Girlfriend and her family live in Casa Grande.  I was there and we ordered delivery.  I got a large pepperoni and some wings.  They have an insane delivery time...it was over an hour.  Fine, I can live with that.\n\nHowever, after I took the food upstairs, and after the guy left, I noticed the pizza box was open.  I opened it all the way, and it looked like it fell on the side of the box before it was delivered.  The pizza was smashed up against the side of the box.  Not the lid...the side of the box.\n\nAdditionally, the wings looked the same.  There was sauce all up the side of the box, as if it was carried on the side.\n\nAnd Mr. Delivery guy:  When I pay with a credit card, and I am required to sign, you should bring a pen.  Come on.\n\nI will NEVER order from here again.  I should have read the reviews beforehand.'

S"Normally a 5 star spot on account of the pizza alone, the affordable and filling lunch special is awesome, and the people who work there are usually very friendly. My recent visit left a bit to be desired, though. The cashier took a while to get to us, and there was no line to speak of, only one person in front of us. My friend got his order in, and then when it was my turn they ran out of sausage pizza, so I had to have it run out to my table. Not the end of the world, this has happened before and they usually have my second slice to me before I've finished the first. This time, it took quite a bit longer. It seemed like they were unprepared for the large groups of kids' soccer teams, but that's probably the same crowd they get every Saturday. All that aside, it's still a delicious slice of pizza, so I'd strongly recommend it to anyone."

We've had so much tasty fish from them in recent months - wreckfish, flounder, shrimp, halibut, tilefish, clams.  The fish is so tasty - you just need a little salt and pepper and that's it. Almost all of it is from the Carolina coast.  Now they're selling Duke's Bread and Dover Farms produce and they're about to team up with Pasta and Provisions!  They've fulfilled my dream of coming home after work and stopping for super fresh local seafood for an incredible dinner. This is one of the best additions to Charlotte in quite some time.

S'We went to the 3563 Saint-Laurent location and had a miserable dinner/time. The review gets 2 stars for the waitress, who was awesome, that is the only good thing this place has going for it!! 1.) The escargot came out almost cold, everyone knows that escargot is to be served hot. 2.) It took forever to get the bread, which should have been automatic, the service overall was very slow. 3.) The music was a bit loud, but it was ok, tolerable, we could still hear each other, and then the "MOD", aka "the owner\'s daughter" came in, apparently heard her jam by Britney Spears and decided to crank it up. We decided that it\'s better to freeze outside, than go deaf listening to Britney inside. We already ordered out food, so we felt bad leaving right then, and decided to stay. 4.) After waiting about an hour (no exaggeration) for our food, we "dared" ask the manager if they were understaffed that night, since we saw our waitress running around and apparently prepairing some food in the kitchen as well (she was warming up our bread earlier), and overheard the hostess saying so to another table, and got a response,"Noooo!" Packaged up with an eye roll and some attitude on the side. Are you kidding me?!!!! Is this the kind of service a restaurant provides? Is this how customers get treated?!! Nobody talks to me like that, especially in a place where I am a paying customer! Shocked and appalled we were! Shocked and appalled, I tell you!!! Thankfully our waitress knew how to calm us down, and get the situation under control, b/c I was about to slap the bitch! To cut the story short, when the food arrived it was gross, I hated mine, and my companion got sick from his. I couldn\'t resist but tell the waitress that she is too good for this place, and that she should leave. I don\'t know how other locations are, but the St.-Laurent location is plane HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING, DISAPPOINTING, and SUCKS ASS!!!!!!!!!'

S'OK been ordering here the last 3 mos now and will prob continue. The first time was before moving and they offered to help us move if we needed the muscle. That goes way above normal customer service if you ask me. Last month we ordered for the fights it was a bit late and their driver already went home for the night so dude makes his gf deliver to us. We had been driving around Jerome all day and barely made it back in time for UFC. Anyways they saved the night. They were out of fresh basil so he did tomato and fresh garlic. I dont really like strong garlic tastes or smells but this pizza was awesome!!! They will pretty much make you anything you want too.\n\nThe other night we ordered but we had run out of beer  so guess what. They charged us for a six pack and picked one up on the way!!

Never did it again because although initially the chicken was yummy and juicy, the leftovers was dry and not good at all.  That's what our chicken tasted like today.  I was very disappointed.

S'I am shocked at all the negative reviews I\'ve read! All I can say is that they must have cleaned up their act here or something because we had a great experience. \n\nWhen we walked in there was a line out the door, which I partially expected on a Sunday but this was a HUGE line even for the time of day. Then it hit me... duh.. it\'s FATHER\'S DAY!!! No wonder it\'s busy. I guess dads like pancakes too. :) \n\nAs we walked in, the hostess told us it\'d be about a 10 minute wait. She gave us a card with the name of a sports team on it, and other people had the names of famous people. When your table was ready they called the name on the card. I was sitting there laughing each time a name was called. It was very effective and got your attention if your table was ready! "Gordon Ramsey party of 4 your table is ready! Buzz Lightyear, table for 2 your s is also ready.".. I think Paula Abdul\'s name even made an appearance. \n\nWhile we waited I hopped on Yelp to scope out the reviews. Then I saw the rating and what people had said about a server named Tekeyah. I was expecting a horrible long wait, slow service  and no refills.  I didn\'t know what was coming. And, I even thought about leaving to go to another breakfast place nearby. \n\nWe were tight on time, and figured there was probably a wait anywhere so we stayed. Right on the dot about 10 minutes later we were taken to our table, and the server walked up with a smile and greeted us very promptly. Her name? Tekeyah. My boyfriend and I looked at each other across the table and thought uhoh, we\'re in trouble now.. based on the reviews we had read about her. \n\nI tell you what, Tekeyah was nothing but nice to us and very attentive. She was slammed with tables and she still managed to come over and keep us updated on the status of our food. The only downfall was that we ordered breakfast potatoes instead of hashbrowns, and we didn\'t get them until the end of the meal because hashbrowns were brought out instead. In her defense, the eggs benedict is not on the menu so it isn\'t somthing that normally is requested, and substitutions probably need to be added in the system manually. I\'ve been a server and I can say that things like that sometimes slip your mind when you\'re dealing with a crowded dining room. When we told her about the potatos she was EXTREMELY apologetic, and very nice. \n\nI asked her for a refill and got it right away. Tekeyah was very friendly and I would absolutely go back based on how polite she was. After reading the other reviews, I\'m thinking perhaps she had a bad day and had other tables who had been horrible to her on a holiday or something similar, before she had served the other reviewers who were unhappy with her service. Who knows, I can only vouch for my experience and I have no complaints. \n\nI only gave 4 stars because of IHop in general, it\'s ok... just not my fave.'

Their service is always nice & friendly when we either take out or dine in. The cook also had us taste their shrimp rangoon, so delicious. The one thing I'm not sure of is.. if they're actually still open. My mom dialed their number a couple times & got nothing. Whenever we'd pass the place it didn't seem like they were.

S'the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever had at a fast-food restaurant.\n\nI arrived at 8:45pm and the place was packed.  3 employees on the line and 3 cooking.  You could tell they were working hard to get everyone served quickly.\n\nI ordered egg rolls with my meal, and they had just sold out.  It happens.  He asked me if I minded waiting for a fresh batch, and I told him it was no problem.  Well, it did take a while for them to be ready...to the point that most people might have started getting mad.  But, here\'s why I was impressed:\n\n#1.  I have no idea who the manager was.  Everyone was on their game to get it done and you could tell that they genuinely cared.\n\n#2.  While I was waiting, they apologized and I knew they meant it.  Two of them asked how my day was.\n\n#3.  I was offered a cup to get something to drink while I waited (I hadn\'t ordered a drink).\n\n#4.  When I left, he said:  "I\'d like to offer you a coupon for the next time you come in.  Since you had to wait as long as you did."  It was an unexpected but nice touch.\n\nIn times that it\'s so easy to get pissed off about things that are beyond anyone\'s control, it\'s great to see that people actually care about serving customers.'

Further, their bread is always delicious and soft.  I usually go for a baguette with chicken mayonnaise and salad which only costs about \xc2\xa32.50.

S"I'm not sure we were in desperate need of a piadineria in this town (we can hardly get pizza right), but such is life in Montreal.  You can't always get what you want, but, if you try sometimes, you just might find you get a piadina--an artisanal one, at that.\n\nWhat is a piadina?  Well, as you you might have gathered from some of the other reviews, it's a flatbread native to Naples and environs.  It's cooked up fresh on a griddle and is then used to envelop some savoury fillings (meat, cheese, greens, etc.)--kind of like an Italian wrap.  \n\nL'Artisan Piadineria has too many toppings, too many options, for my liking.  Scale back the menu and go with straight-up hits, would be my advice to the management.  My advice to you is to go with one of the daily specials.  Also, think juicy.  The flatbread itself is pretty dry.  It benefits from a choice of fillings that is going to be both a tasty and a juicy combination.  Unfortunately, many of the options on the menu aren't going to deliver on that promise, but, then again, many others will.  Our best bet was a super juicy sausage number that was called the Napoli, or the Neapolitan, or something like that.  We figured it had to be good, given the provenance of the piadina, and it was."

Came out after about 5 minutes. Looked great except for the canned mushrooms. Why can't pizza joints use real mushrooms. It would add so much to us mushroom lovers.

If only I could achieve the same result in my home toaster. The raita was pretty good, too; nice and sour.\n\nI liked our entrees.

Slightly thinner than the normal Bock I drink, but tasty nonetheless.  \n\nI didn't try the food, and to be honest, I don't know why one would come here expecting anything other than crappy Az-Mex, but people were eating it and seemed sated by it.  \n\nIMO, just come here to catch some sunset/evening brews before or after you hit up El Encanto."

S"Went to the Edinburgh Larder Bistro a couple of times, first time for brunch, second time for lunch.  On both occasions, I had a voucher deal, which is always great to try somewhere new.\nThe brunch was OK, mine was actually really good, I had the smoked salmon on home made bread, the only downside was it was actually a very small portion and that I was still famished afterwards. My brunch buddy had the veggie full breakfast, which was fine apart for a lump of potatoes and carrots that didn't have their place on the plate, and would have been better replaced by a home-made tomato relish or something else.\nThe lunch was OK, but not exciting.  We had leek and ham soup, which was delicious, with some crispy bacon. Thumbs up for the soup!  However, the choice of mains was fairly limited, so we opted for the coley.  The fish itself came perfectly cooked, the chips were OK, but the steamed broccoli and cauliflower were a bit sad and bland.  That dish could have really done with a bit of a 'wow' factor!  Oh and last but not least, they forgot to bring the two glasses of wine we had ordered.  I had to ask for them, which means that they arrived after we had finished the starter.\nOverall, not a bad experience, but the place doesn't live up to its expectations, which is a real shame.  I do like the wooden decor though."

I\'ve been here so many times and I must say each dish was very tasty and yummy! \nOh, btw, this location was another restaurant called "new dynasty"; Now "Kanbai" take the place and did a renovation. It\'s very clean and beautiful now. And I have to say: foods in Kanbai are much better than New Dynasty!!!'

S'Located about 1.5 miles north of downtown Chandler, Magic Kabob is a great addition to the Chandler ethnic restaurant scene.  The restaurant has just opened and I visited on a Sunday afternoon and the grand opening sign was flapping in the breeze.  I ordered the Chicken Kafta sandwich lunch special which includes either french fries or soup.  I went with the soup which was a tasty crushed lentil.  The kafta was wrapped in a thin pita and had a garlic sauce with an assortment of chopped pickles which was excellent.  Normally in I think of kafta as a finely ground meat, but in this case there were chucks of marinated chicken.\n\nThe restaurant is open 7 days a week for lunch and dinner and I will definitely be stopping by again to try some of the entrees like grilled lamb chops or vegetarian ghallaba which is a savory Lebanese stew.  For vegetarians there are the usual options for a middle eastern restaurant (tabbouli, fattoush, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, hommous, and baba ghannooj etc) and few specialty items.'

If you like Chinese food, you will love this place. It also has two cool bars inside. \n\nI highly recommend this place.

First, the food cost us $63.00 after all was said & done. That was for 3 of us...one being a child. Ridiculous amount of money for what we got! \n\nBaby back ribs...full set ...was more like mini, over cooked, half rack at most. They were absolutely disgusting. \n\nThe roll that comes with the ribs was a top if a hamburger bun. Are you kidding me? You couldn\'t spare the whole bun....and not to mention...nice "roll". Not what we were expecting...that\'s for sure!\n\nChicken wings were overly breaded & sweet...again, absolutely disgusting.\n\nCaesar salad...I\'ve had better salads at McDonalds. Ok, where do I begin once again. Fake bacon bits??? Really??? To my knowledge, Caesar salad does not have bacon bits. Never mind fake ones! Hello?!?! This "Caesar salad" was more like a pile of romaine lettuce with fake bacon bits, croutons & who even knows what kind of dressing it was...but it sure wasn\'t Caesar! \n\nFrench fris...soaked and I mean, soaked in OLD oil . WOW...\n\nFood took over a hour to get here...$63 dollars later & we\'re all still hungry ...don\'t waste your time with this place or your money. \n\nAbsolutely, without a doubt, BEYOND disgusting.

S'Had some business in the hotel so instead of leaving and eating else where i figured why not try the place out. \n\nThey remodeled the beginning of this year so the interior looks pretty damn nice and very clean. \n\nI asked around and it seems everyone agreed on the Old School Burger. Ignore what the menu says about two thin patties the patties are thicker than normal sized patties you find at any fast food joint. If this is thin to them i\'d love to see what a normal patty or a large patty would be. \n\nHow\'s the burger you ask? If In-n-Out wasnt a fast food chain and had took their time to make a burger, the Old School would be the Double Double. It tastes damn close except for two things: i ordered it with no onion where as In-n-Out i would ask for grilled onions, and the sauces are different. In-n-Out i\'m pretty sure uses thousand island, Cafe325 uses what they call "Mighty Mo" sauce which looked and sort of tasted the same but i\'m pretty sure it\'s home made.\n\nThe fries were SUPER crispy and firm but not hard and still soft in the middle. Also they were salted with noticeable chunks of sea salt not regular table salt. \n\nOverall this was a pretty good lunch.'

S"We attended the Germany-US match public viewing while on a business trip to Bretten, Germany. A colleague invited us to watch the match at P10 because of the beach-y atmosphere. I admit, it was nice having sand on the deck and it did feel like a beach.\n\nWe watched the match on the big screen under a white tent, which seems to be a permanent fixture. The couches were big and there were a lot of pillows. There was no sand where we were sitting under the tent. The selection of food was a bit disappointing, only small snacks and light sandwiches. Drink selection was good. Don't come there hungry.\n\nAfter the match was over, we went to the sand area and sat around and drank. We closed the bar at around 11pm. Unfortunately the owner seemed very upset with us that we had not left yet and that we weren't leaving as fast as he would like. My german isn't very good but he was kind of arguing with my colleague. I'm not sure what they were saying.\n\nThe beach chairs were nice, the wait staff was attentive, the crowd was interesting. I'm not sure it was the best place to watch a soccer match. Definitely more fun after the match was over. There are umbrellas, and beds with canopies and those beach chairs with the canopies too. Overall very cool. Would go again."

S'I am a fan of most Latin cuisine, I was eager to try central american foods. When I moved here in 1997 I had seen this place on my way downtown thinking, wow looks kind of shady. About a year later, my husband said it would be worth it to at least try. I was glad he suggested it. We\'ve been coming here for 10+ years now.\nThe current interior is more of a restaurant than the previous decor which was very eclectic, they had murals painted on the walls, lattice partitions, fishnet hammocks strung up giving it a very "backyard of someones home" feel. A few years ago, the motel attached decided to renovate the exterior, and the owners of Salvadoreno took the opportunity to update their interior, now its tables and chairs, brown tones.\nThe food has remained consistently delicious. Everything is fresh made. They have a variety of pupusas, filled corn tortilla pattys, from beans and cheese, loroco (native sprout), and the revuelta which is refried beans, cheese, and ground shredded pork (known as chicharron). The Plato Tipico is the Salvadoran typical plate, it combines a mix of the staples, a pice of grilled steak (carne asada), fried sweet plantain, a drier cheese similar to feta, a small lettuce tomato salad, and my favorite, casamiento, which is a rice and bean combo that is cooked together and is so tasty!\nAlso on the menu are pollo asado, taquitos, carne asada plate, steak encebollado (with onions), seafood cocktails (coctel mariscos) and fresh drinks (aguas frescas) such as horchata (a rice water drink, with the addition of ground pumpkin seeds, ensalada, a chopped fruit punch drink, and various drinks on roatation. A variety of latin beers are also offered.\nPlease check this place out, its in a bad hood, sure, but the cooking is like someones mom invited you over for dinner The staff is warm and friendly, and if you happen to be there on a night when a soccer game is on, it gets rowdy!'

But do not let the Chinese-only specials menu and the green tea in plastic cups deter you.\n\nI second the pork and duck combo, as well as the Shanghai fried noodles and the soy sauce chicken with rice.\n\nI found our server struggling a little with translating the specials menu (breakfast specials, $3.75, lunch specials in the $5 area). At the same time the smiles and enthusiasm completely compensated for the slight language barrier. \n\nThe food, price and setting alone would earn it three stars (not a place you'd bring a date), but the service is so great I give it the four.

Also, the cafe in the Red Rock has deals like a T-Bone steak for $10.\n\nHowever, if you like reliable, consistent Chinese food, and like Panda Express, this is going to be a predictable experience that won\'t wow nor disappoint you, just deliver what you come to expect.\n\nIt\'s a good clean spot, with nice service, so no knock on Panda Express at all.'

Yes, it is Pizza Express, but the make over with the modern d\xc3\xa9cor and pretty comfortable chairs, then I was happy to dine here and what is more, I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe new gluten free options means that I had choice here and I thought the pizza was pretty yummy. It is a standard base used - no options on size and thickness but it is thin and crispy, with the right amount of crunch. There are a good range of toppings available (sadly no Sloppy Giuseppe) and my la Reina was tasty and well covered with toppings.\n\nA nice addition is the mini bites with coffee. Dessert is available but you can also get coffee with a range of mini desserts when you want something sweet but can't face a full dessert. There is an option of a gluten free brownie and despite my brownie fatigue, it was really good and just enough to round off a meal.\n\nSo as Claire C has mentioned, there's deals aplenty for Pizza Express so its worth checking before heading here but for tasty food, good service and nice surroundings then it is worth a visit.

Both restrooms were filthy ( and for my husband to say a men's bathroom is bad, it has to be bad). Never, ever have I had such an icky taco bell experience.

S"I love this place because it's right next to my dorm and also, it's one of the few Mexican restaurants that I've found that actually sells a Mole (molay') dish (chocolate and poblano chile's if I'm not mistaken). Try the chicken Mole and you'll really like it... very authentic.\n\nChips are great, as is the salsa. You can tell its family owned... you can ask for Mexican cokes too I think. I've gone here twice and I'd go again whenever the stomach callers.\n\nSometimes they have a wandering mariachi guy. I always feel awkward when they come around because then you feel like you have to tip, but I think he sensed we were poor college students so he didn't come by.\n\nI'm not sure what you ordered that you didn't like (to the first reviewer)."

Same owners as Kaizen Sushi and Red Mango.  \n\nThe food is pretty good and the combo meal specials they have for parties of 2-3 are pretty reasonable.  The wife and I ordered the "The San" combo which included a ton of stuff including kimchee pancake, and 3 meats.  We were stuffed beyond belief.  \n\nThe atmosphere and decor are pretty nice although I do have to say that the quality of the food at Mother\'s Korean BBQ is still a bit better than this place.  Still a solid choice for late night food but not the best.  The service was also quite good although we were the only ones eating at 11pm when we were there!'

S"I'm always excited about a new Mexican or burrito joint in town. I welcome the addition of GSB. My first impression is that it's a clean, friendly addition to the Madison burrito sweepstakes. The service and venue are great; the food, barely OK.\n\nI ordered the chicken burrito and it was well-assembled with pico and chicken, minus the bean and rice fillers that most of us can do without and that I, in fact, usually omit when going to Chipotle or Qdoba or other burrito joints. \n\nThe veggies and salsa were great -- they seemed fresh and had a nice kick. The chicken, however, tasted heavily salty and didn't appear to be the quality cuts of white meat that I would hope for. It reminded me less of Chipotle and more of Taco Bell. \n\nMy suggestion for more stars would be to upgrade the chicken, but since GSB is a chain, this might be difficult to do. Don't try to hide lower-quality meat by salting. This might fool the 2:30 a.m. bar-time crowd, but not many others. While I'm not ruling out trying them again, I will pass on anything containing chicken."

It was a touch underwhelming.\n\nOverall, we said: "A Room in the Town is a smart place, with good, attentive service, but the quality of their dishes doesn\'t match this. Take the pointless croutons out of the soup, and the glob of vinegar off the egg, and you probably had two good but unremarkable dishes. I\'ve always enjoyed my trips to their William Street place, but can\'t say the Dundas Street branch made such a positive impression. Maybe I\'ll pop by to try their dinner menu, at some point, as I like the set-up and suspect the kitchen is capable of producing better dishes than I was served, today."'

Y.U.M.M.Y.\n\nI got a square egg patty.  swear to jesus.  square (think it was to go to an egg mc muffin)\n\npancakes.  and biscuit yummy.\n\nsausage. greasy.  seriously? okay, i knew it would be greasy.\n\nhad to ask for my hash brown (was forgotten), so the nice lady gave me two.  and then i had a heart attack.  unfortunately, no one working there was smart enough to call 911, so i died.\n\nlo siento, pero no mexicans working there AT all, so service was SLOW.  Every senior citizen, bless their little old hearts, was in line in front of me.  and.  I SWEAR TO GOD the cashier had to get her phone out to add.\n\nSo I ate my last meal, took a Lipitor, but it was too late.  I died.  No one called 911, since the staff can\'t read nor add, and the elderly didn\'t have cell phones.'

It was probably the best roll I've had for that price in the whole city.  \n\nBesides the food, the inside decor was very pleasant and it wasn't overly noisy.

Well obviously the people in this area have no taste buds cuz the food was trash, slop, garbage. I ordered the garlic shrimp which was suppose to be spicy...wasnt spicy, was slimy, and the sauce was gray, the noodles were chewy and tasteless, they tasted stale, and the bell peppers in the shrimp had big chunks that had rotten spots on them....gag! To top it off we arrived at about a quarter to 3pm...the menu said lunch prices until 4pm. We ended up paying almost $20 for two which should have been about $15 according to what we ordered. Not sure if there is waiter service or not because as soon as we walked in the door a toothless man in a filthy white shirt handed us menus so we sat down. Then a woman comes and takes our order. She brought us our food and drinks. Turned out toothless man was the cook. I had a view of the kitchen and noticed rivers of water running down the walls over his cooking area.  I want to throw up after just a few bites of each thing...if ever in las vegas DO NOT EAT AT CHINA JOE'S. Contemplating calling the health department if I am sick tomorrow.

I think that the curry chicken we ordered the first time only seemed as good as it did because, in comparison to the overly-sweet butter chicken, it was appropriately spicy.  The second time around, however, we avoided the butter chicken and found that everything was too sweet.  In fact, the curry was not spicy at all.\n\nFurthermore, service was slooooooowww.  Like, 20 minutes before we ordered slow.  And 10 minutes and three requests before I could have a replacement fork slow.  So...

We got there and I can say that I understand it\'s Saturday night and about 11 so I am giving them the benefit of the doubt as to the cleanliness of the floors and stuff. We thought it was cool that they have "tablets" on the table now so we ordered our apps with the tablet and then the server came over. "What y\'all drinking?" Ummmm hello. How are you? Ok so two strikes by this point. Next thing I know the server, our server, is cleaning a table next to ours and she takes a broom that has probably been in the store for at least 5 years and sweeps the table top off. There was only like two straw wrappers and maybe a lemon wedge on the table. She just took that old nasty broom and swept the table top!!  CHECK PLEASE. I have worked in this business since I was 14 and even then I would have never did this. Ridiculous. Called the manager and cancelled our order. If she can do this in front of us and about 5-6 other tables there is no telling what she is doing in the back when we can\'t see her. NEVER going here again. Disgusting.'

We went a few weeks ago and there were kids in there (unsupervised) that were at least 9 or 10 that were climbing up the slide, on top of the slide, running around and just being really rambunctious.  Granted, kids are kids and they were just having fun, but a little girl was coming down the slide when one of the boys was climbing up and she ran right into him.  We ended up leaving because my son started trying to copy the little boys and it was just getting a little too rough.  Not sure what the solution could be.

I also ordered ribs that had no meat on them and what meat there was was dry and hard. \n\n\nWhen I called to complain (it has to be really bad for me to do this) the attitude was defensive and unapologetic. \n\nJust avoid; If a place tries hard and its just not good enough then fair enough but the corners cut by these guys and their general disregard for customer satisfaction makes it feel like you've been robbed."

S"Just like the Yelper below me says POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE is correct.\n\nI was on my way home when my mother asked me to pick up gyro sandwich for her. I was at the smiths next door so this was the closest place to pick one up. I walked in and the guy at the counter was playing a game on his phone. He didn't even look up at me when I clearly walked and and said Hi. He also didn't say anything. \n\nI picked up a menu and looked through it to see what types of gyros they have. I ordered it and he just stared at me like he was in such a piss poor mood. I was looking around behind him to see if there was a cook or someone else there with him. From what I can see, this jerk was the only one working. \n\nI did not want this person touching my food and just already pissed me off with his bad attitude. I started looking through my purse, acting as though I was getting my credit card. I lied and told him I forgot it, and then walked out. I will NEVER EVER go back here.."

S"I stopped by on a hot Sunday afternoon, after my massage, and just when I thought the massage put me in a good mood...no no, it's the tasty cakes, delicious poke, and the unexpected guava filled malasada that was given to me, that put in in a super great mood.\n\nThe poke was pricey, but it is what the market price is.  My half pound of container filled with poke came out to $7.77.  I got the creamy sauce with a hint of sriracha, green scallions and white onions.  I would like to try the shoyu and the garlic sauce next time.  \n\nAll the cakes look so delicious, but because I am on a healthy streak, I limited myself to two only.  I got the chantilly ($4) and guava cake ($3.75).  My bf, who doesn't have a sweet tooth, kept coming back for more bites while I was enjoying the chantilly cake.   It was a moist chocolate devil cake, with two layers of custard like frosting.  It has the perfect level of sweetness (not overly sweet).  Yum yum.\n\nThe guava cake was delish.  I had that the next day prior to hitting the gym, and the cake was still so moist.  It truly tastes like guava.  Gosh, I wanna head back for more, but I can only do so on a cheat day. \n\nThe owner is such a friendly and awesome person.  He gave me a guava malasada and that is such a nice gesture.  I totally did not expect that.  Also, it shows how detailed he is since that guava malasada choice must be due to my selection of the guava cake.  \n\nI can't wait to go back and try other tasty cakes and a different type of poke.  Yum Yum Yum."

What surprised me though was the presentation. It just wasn't slapped together. Cooks took their time. The toppings were fresh. Turkey and ham was cut and the cheeses were sliced perfectly. Let's just say that you got your money's worth. The kids who are picky, both enjoyed the kids menus and the plain beef tacos looked very good.\n\nService was excellent and laid back. \n\nI also split a chicken quesadilla. Let me tell you God's honest truth. That was the best 3.99 money ever spent. I swear, It was the best quesadilla I ever ordered but then again I have never ordered a chicken cheese Q. It's extremely larger than your average Q.\n\nThe negatives was none except it was located in an open air casino. And the music was awesome. Either classic hits from Sam Cook or The Miracles or 80's hits like Soft Cell or Modern English. Very eclectic tastes"

S'THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!!! Now, I will start by saying that this is McD, so you get what you pay for and shouldn\'t expect more. HOWEVER, with that being said, I think that this is worst fast food cst service I have ever! This McD is right across the street from our house, and since we were is a hurry, we decided to drive thru. I am actually not  a McD fan, I do like their chicken nuggets, and frequently drive thru for a large Dr. Pepper. Tonight, my husband and I drove thru and ONLY ORDERED: 20 CHICKEN NUGGETS, 2 LARGE DR. PEPPER, & a MEDIUM FRY. That is not a large order, not complicated, or any reason to receive the \'service\' we did. We were told to move forward because they were waiting on our chicken nuggets. OK, no problem. PROBLEM: SIX CARS GOT THEIR FOOD AT THE WINDOW BEFORE I SENT MY HUSBAND IN TO GET OUR FOOD! He got it and we drove away, just to find out that we were MISSING OUR FRYS!!! Are you SERIOUS!??!!!! We went back and went in to get it corrected and give the manager a piece of my mind!!! Besides some shallow "i\'m sorry\'s", they gave us our nuggets, and some \'fresh frys\' which were no where close to being fresh! I really CAN NOT believe the \'service\' we received there, and vow to go out of our way to go to another McD from now on, or pay a bit more & go to our FAVORITE chicken spot, CHICK FIL A!!! Friendly, nice, accurate, and even though it is still a fast food place, they SERVE YOU, come to you table to clear it, and refill your drinks, all with a happy attitude! Oh, and did I mention the FRESH FLOWERS ON EVERY TABLE?!!! Yep, now THAT is cst service that goes above and beyond the call of duty!!! ;) My advice to them: RETRAIN, TEACH CST SERVICE, ESPECIALLY TO THEIR MANAGERS!!!!'

S'Let me start out my review of "Wienerschnitzel" by saying I resent the fact that they dropped "Der" from the front of the name! In my heart it will always be Der Wienerschnitzel! That being said, I have always been a fan of this little hot dog joint. The location I frequent is on Rainbow near Oakey. The store is always clean and the service inside and at the drive thru is always prompt and friendly. The buns and dogs are good but they are basically of the store bought variety, so it must be the chili. The chili is a straight forward beef laden red with a thickish texture that keeps it from running off of the dog. It has a very distinct flavor that is unmistakably Der Wienerschnitzel. My favorite item is the chili cheese dog which have a slice of melted cheddar on them. The fries are actually very good as fast food fries go. They are thin cut and cooked perfectly crisp which makes them great for sopping up the leftovers on your "chili paper" (the name my kids gave to the chili remaining on the hot dog wrapper after the dog has been consumed). I can\'t imagine anyone out there that has tried Der once in their lives, but if by chance you haven\'t, you should give them a try.'

S"Latino food in Durlach.\\\n\nWell, unlike t'other reviewer, I didn't go into the kitchen, so I can only review this from a consumer point of view. \n\nWhich, in short, was: yum! Two friends and I ate early and outside; service was prompt and friendly, the beer was cold, and the food was tasty. I had the chicken burrito, which I found very nice -- plenty of cheese, a good balance of chicken to other ingredients, and the Bohnemus (bean paste) was dense but flavorful. The boyfriend had the mixed quesadillas and seemed to really enjoy them. The patatas bravas to start with were also yummy.\nFood presentation is slightly chi-chi (or schicki-micki as they say here in Germany), and the prices are slightly higher than your average pub fare to match this, but I regretted nothing; we had a very pleasant meal. \n\nAlso, in reference to the other review -- as an ex-waitress, all I can say is that if I were to go into restaurant kitchens all the time, I'd never eat out again. Almost all kitchens are somewhat appalling; it's best to just receive one's food and try to enjoy it without thinking too hard about where it came from. You know, like you should when eating an egg."

We only had about $35 Canadian left on our last night and this was definitely the way to get the most out of it. They had 5 different 4 course menus so you could pick your combination of food. Unbeatable.\n\nFood: Delicious. We had been to the restaurant next door the night before so had a pretty fresh comparison. To start we had the shrimp cake soup with greens. The soup base was under seasoned (we added soy sauce) but the shrimp cakes were extremely flavorful and the greens were bright and still had a bit of a crunch. The eggrolls were way too oily and just had salted bean sprouts in it...gross. The salt and pepper shrimp was incredible. I removed all the fried parts from mine and the flavor was still incredibly strong. The shrimp themselves were high quality.  The fried rice was flavorful but subtle ( soy sauce wasn't the main ingredient). Finally we had a chicken stir fry - amazing. The chicken was so moist and high quality and the vegetables were perfectly prepared. The food was so good and so high quality, I wondered how they could afford to basically give it away.\n\nService: Terrible. I am usually a very generous tipper, but this was a no tip situation. We got our first two dishes relatively fast. Then a huge party sat behind us, the place got a little busy and they forgot about us...for half an hour plus. When we were finally able to get the waiters attention(we were in a corner) he came over annoyed and waved us away as we tried to explain that we hadn't gotten our main dishes. He brought the dessert serving and then the check. When we tried to explain again that we hadn't gotten our main courses, he didn't believe us, had to bring another waiter over to verify before finally getting our food 10 mins later. Seriously, why would we lie about not being fed?? They brought the food with no apology. Terrible.\n\nWe get that our experience may be isolated, so take it with a grain of salt. Great deal, great food, questionable service."

S"FINALLY, I sample the notorious Fatburger, which we don't have up in the Bay Area.  And my reaction was--OK.\n\nYes, the burger was Fat.  The fries were also Fat, but that's the way I picked them, and I did like them.  Simple, potatoey, and no weird coating on the outside like some competitors' fries.\n\nI guess if you desperately need a fast food burger and you're in the gravitational pull of a Fatburger, you could do worse.  I prefer it to Fuddruckers and might even take it over In-n-Out, but Jeffrey's and Val's in the Bay Area are far better burgers to my taste.\n\nThis particular Fatburger seems to be brand new and part of a sprawling outdoor mall here on the edge of the desert north of Scottsdale.  It won't be the edge of the desert for long, of course, since Great Phoenix seems to grow like creepy fingers of killer space fungus in a Sci-Fi movie of some kind.  By this time next year it will be 20 miles in from the northern edge of Greater Phoenix, and the locals will see it as a quaint relic of bygone times in an aging layer of this megalopolis."

I don't recommend coming with a large group unless you want to dine outside. \n\nThe outdoor dining area is very beautiful. The Hear Museum is a very pretty place. I love the water canal and mock wo'o (swimming holes). \n\nMy largest complaint is that besides the Pesole (which isn't that great btw), nothing on the menu is traditional Native American Fare. As a Native person who appreciates the wonderful tastes and textues of traditional Native foods from the many tribes of Arizona... to have a museum that celebrates our cultures and yet doesn't celebrate our food is counter productive and disappointing. We eat more than frybread!!\n\nIf you're out at the museum and want a nice quiet lunch in a tranquil autmosphere this is a great place to dine.

S"Now, if this was a review of the food alone, this would have an extra star, but it's not, but I will say - the food was much much better than the naff service here. It was that naff, I had to dredge up the word naff in my own personal lexicon so I could reuse it from my primary school days, just for this review. \n\nWhen the waiter looks at you, realises you are asking for a takeaway, then looks away for a couple of minutes, apparently thats a signal to start talking. When we remained silent, and not just a little bemused, he looked back at us, looked at the pad, and picked up the pen. Oh... right, we're supposed to be giving our order. OK. \n\nHe leaves, so do we, to run an errand. We return, the food is ready, and we are given a solitary bottle of warm beer. My pro-feminism wells up... but really, I don't think it mattered who the beer was aimed at, we just had one to share. For a meal for two. I'm back into a bemused state wondering who this kind of service impresses.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, the food, it's nice enough, not too greasy either, but not memorable enough to make me want to go back to Bombay Lounge to deal with crap service again, not when there are other restaurants in town that provide better food and service.

S"Haven't eaten the food yet, so this is just a preliminary review.  I may add stars if the food is amazing.\n\nBistro Mobile is a pretty cool idea.  They make healthy homemade meals and deliver it to your house.  I thought I'd try it, so I picked up a LivingSocial coupon for it some time ago.  I finally followed through on putting my order in last week.\n\nWhen I called the number like the instructions said, I got a guy who barely spoke English.  I asked multiple times if it was Bistro Mobile, and I got a nondescript answer.  I hung up and looked up the number of their web site, which was right, so I tried again.  That guy WAS a (the?) guy from Bistro Mobile, and in his broken English he was finally able to explain that I could order from the web site and they'd take the coupon when they delivered.\n\nI went through the entire ordering process, and at the end it failed.  Told me to start over.  I tried again the next day with a different browser, and the menu had changed.  Whatever.  I picked new items, and it let me complete my order.  I picked 1pm on Friday as a delivery time.\n\n1pm Friday came and went, and no food was delivered.  I later received a call from the guy saying the menu was for next week, not this week.  I sent them an email from their web site saying 12pm on Monday would be fine.  At 12:30pm on Monday, I called as I was leaving my house to let them know they never delivered.  Finally that call got the food to me, as my roommate was luckily home to receive the food.\n\nI feel like it is a miracle that I now have this food in my hands.  Why was this so confusing?  I waited until my LivingSocial coupon almost expired, so I had to have been one of the last people to redeem.  They should have ironed it out by now.\n\nFix your web site so it works with all browsers.  Make it clear when the earliest I can receive my food.  Organize yourselves a little better so when I request a delivery time, I don't have to call and check up.  And hire someone that speaks English a little better so I don't think I called the wrong number."

S'If I could use one word to sum up the opening night at Serrano Manchego, it would be disappointing. Or, underwhelming. You get the idea. I so wanted it to be amazing, but it just wasn\'t and it could be and should be.\n\nI\'ve gone for 3 stars as I feel it\'s a compromise between what Serrano Manchego has got right, and what it\'s got wrong. The d\xc3\xa9cor alone warrants a solid 4, verging on to 5. The service and the food are definitely a 2 ("meh, I\'ve experienced better", I couldn\'t have said it better myself!).\n\nI\'m going to start with the good. The place looks fantastic. It\'s all exposed brick and wood with the logo stencilled on the wall. Lovely. Lots of space and tables. A definite thumbs up on this. And I love the concept, a Spanish pincho bar on Leith Walk. Only one beer on draught (Alhambra), bite sized snacks and platters, signature croquettas, great! And erm. That\'s the good. The d\xc3\xa9cor and the concept.\n\nThe bad? Well I\'ll start with the service. I\'m probably not being fair, as yesterday was their opening night (although as stated on their Facebook page this wasn\'t a soft opening, it wasn\'t an exclusive party, it was just open), but given the amount of time they\'ve spent into decorating and sourcing ingredients, they really ought to have trained their staff! I\'d be surprised if any of the bar staff/servers has worked in a bar or a restaurant before. Not one of them knew how to pour a pint, so the manager had to teach them on the job, and of course this meant that it took ages to get served (and what\'s with ringing up a transaction on the sole till before pouring the drinks?). And if you\'d ordered food you got a numbered wooden spoon in a glass, fairly standard. But the poor girls serving spent most of the evening wandering about in a daze looking for whoever had ordered that particular dish... The staff were all perfectly nice, they were just all woefully inexperienced. I ought to point out that I was with my boyfriend and sister, both experienced bar staff and servers, so as you can imagine we had little tolerance, but even if I\'d been there alone I\'d still have been frustrated.\n\nAnd the food, oh the food. A great concept doesn\'t make up for poor execution. There\'s a nice sounding selection of cold and hot pinchos, as well as tostados, platters and the croquettas of the day. I don\'t know if this will always be the case, but they only had one croquette on yesterday, which was haggis. Or was it? I was definitely told it was haggis, but biting into it you\'d never have known. Sure, the herbs and spices tasted a little like our national dish, but the texture was creamy and the colour was pale and the taste was bland. What was it?! We also ordered a dish of olives. What we got was a small plate (not a bowl, which would have made more sense), of pitted olives that looked and tasted like they\'d come straight from a jar. I don\'t buy jarred olives at the supermarket, I don\'t expect to be served them in a bar. And pitted, who serves pitted olives?!\n\nI\'d like to say everyone else\'s food look great, but judging by the table next to us that isn\'t the case. They\'d ordered a platter of manchego, blue cheese, walnuts, quince and raisins that came with no blue cheese. There was an explanation for this, but I didn\'t catch it, and given they\'d only been open for 3 hours at this point I sincerely hope they hadn\'t run out. Then came the tostados, or bread with a topping. Standard, I know, and I wasn\'t expecting anything brilliant from a basic open sandwich, but they just looked so uninspiring. Fortunately none of the food is expensive.\n\nI actually feel annoyed about it all. I wanted Serrano Manchego to be brilliant. They\'ve had a great Facebook presence and I know I wasn\'t the only local eagerly awaiting its opening, and it was packed last night. I want to give them a second chance, because I truly believe that they could be great if only they improve. Please guys, the problems I\'ve identified should be easy to fix! I really hope that in a couple of months time I\'ll be writing an updated review of 4 or 5 stars.'

S'wanna know my idea of a "5 star steak?" then just take a look at the 2 photos i\'ve posted on my yelp profile. wherever i go, i search out the best bovine offerings. here in edinburgh, after several inquiries, i decided to try this place in search of superb steak. it was tough to get in over the weekend but i landed a table sunday night expecting 4-star or better beef, especially considering the reputation of scottish beef. i began with their "award winning" mini-sausages. not bad; there were several different tasty varieties served up. i opted for the ribeye, advertised at a mere 8 ounces so i didn\'t expect a hearty portion. i got a quality steak, cooked perfectly to order but nothing special and very, very thin. suitable for a really good steak and eggs breakfast. could my mild disappointment be because steaks are just different back home in the states? the two scottish steak afficionados at the next table mirrored my not-so-great verdict. one of them said that the american chain ruth\'s chris was the best steakhouse he\'d eaten at and even though it\'s a chain i agree it\'s leagues ahead of mckirdy\'s. shame, since this place came so highly recommended. but i thought their curly fries (which i dipped in a lovely stilton blue cheese sauce) were just as good as the steak and that\'s never a great sign.'

S'Rascals made itself very well known in a short space of time via the magic of the internets. I kept seeing pop up on every form of social media outlet, and those burgers are not something that go unnoticed. And so one Sunday eve at the sensible time of 5pm, me and my fellow "rascals" (as they wrote on our \'reserved\' sign) rocked up for burgers.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive and pretty much all of us were stumped at what to get, the choices were so plentiful. They handily mark out which burger-filling options are GF, and they also do GF buns (winner!) I can\'t remember the last time I ate a burger in a bun, like a burger should be eaten, rather than with a fork and knife, forgoing the gluten-filled roll.\n\nI ended up going for the one with chili, without the chilli! There are so many fillings in each burger: mine had bacon, cheese, Rascals sauce and chilli con carne (but, without chilli - like I said). The patty was big and chunky, the meat nicely cooked (not over done) and the Rascals sauce was ace. The chips were also nicely fried and crunchy, proper chunky ones too.\n\nI think we all (seven of us) had different burgers, and they were all finito, with fingers licked clean. I admired Joey\'s choice of Chicken Strips with added chorizo (this is on top of the normal burger, mind). And the one Jennie went for cracked me up: Cheesey...something or other. The name just made me laugh. Another had steak strips on top, and another (the Belly Buster) had so much black pudding some had to be left ont he plate, as well as onion rings and lord knows what else.\n\nOne thing is for sure, these burgers are bursting with fillings, the patties themselves are more meaty than most, and the portion size (burger, bun, fillings and chips) are so generous, and definitely a great deal at around \xc2\xa38 a burger.\n\nAlso, if you tweet a picture of yourself with a burger and tag it #BurgerSelfie you get a free chocolate fudge cake! Woo. So we got three of those to share.\n\nAll round great meal. The interior of the place hasn\'t been changed since the previous business, which was a slightly classy sports bar. There are small televisions put into the walls around the whole restaurant. The interior itself is quite...forgetabble, or just bland. It doesn\'t really mark the business or make it stand out. What does is those burgers, and that\'s all you\'ve come for, right?'

S"The Press Box reminds me a bit of a peacock. Now bear with me here, I'll explain. A peacock is a very nice bird, but somewhat average, until you get to the back end...the tail. \n\nThe same is true at the Press Box. Upon entering, it is definitely a sports bar. I was there on a Wednesday evening, and there were a smattering of regulars in the long, rectangular bar area.\nA sign beside a door in the back announces the patio is open. Exiting through this door,  you initially find yourself in a small room you feel you shouldn't be in, for varied different reasons. Another door on the right leads you to a very large and leafy double-tiered patio area, and this is what makes the Press Box a destination for me.\n\nThis is the tail of the peacock, so to speak, fanning out in the rear and quite possibly larger than the main building. \nLarge oak trees emerge from the timbers and spread out umbrella-like over the seating area. \nIt should be said I'm a fan of outdoors seating areas in general, but this is a great area for balmy summer evenings. \n\nTwo dartboards hang in the left corner, and the top tier to the right supports live musicians 2-4 times a week.\n\nOverall, your basic sports bar during colder months, but one that offers a little something extra during the nice outdoor times."

S"Nyam Nyam is a really friendly Italian restaurant which offers great food and service for its prices.  It's less than a minute's walk from George Square and so is ideal for satisfying any post-class huger pangs.  It feels inviting inside with its cosy size and comforting decor which makes you feel right at home.\nTheir menu is excellent with plenty of authentic Italian dishes ranging from calzones to homemade ice cream.  I went for the spaghetti carbonara which was delicious and creamy.  The smoked bacon which they use is amazing and enfuses the whole dish.  \nThey're not stingy with their portion sizes either and I'd recommend it for lunch or dinner any day!"

They've recently made a very conscious effort to significantly improve the look of the place.  \n\nContrary to the view of another reviewer, the food is pretty authentic (you can judge by seeing the number of Chinese families eating there on Saturday mornings for dim sum) though I suppose it depends on what you order.  While I was born in the area, I travel to China often Dim sum is decent (I wouldn't say it's stellar by any stretch but again, relative to the other options in the area this is probably the best place for dimsum relative to value)."

S"I'm actually a big fan of hole-in-the-wall restaurants hidden away in hard to find nooks and crannies, and Aromas didn't let me down!  The decor is cheap, the fluorescent lighting makes you feel like you're sitting at the DMV, and the evening techno ballads from the adjacent martial arts shop mixed with the restaurant's Bollywood music makes you wonder if you're in Gilbert or an after-hours club in Mumbai (I guess Islamabad would be more fitting in this case).\n\nI arrived about 20 minutes until closing and was quite grateful that the restaurant owner invited me to come in and have a seat.  Since it's Ramadan, I tried out the evening buffet which was a bit small but still had about 6 or 7 meat and veggie dishes.  Honestly, I can't remember the names of all the dishes but all I can say is they were good, but oh so freakin' spicy!  I'm a glutton for punishment when it comes to spicy food, but several of the dishes carried such a kick that I was reminded of the time one of the cooks at Cyclo went nuclear on my Pad Thai!  Thankfully, there was enough mango lassie and buttery naan to keep me from weeping profusely and throwing in the towel.\n\nI would recommend Aromas if you're looking for a break from the norm.  The menu offers Halal and Vegetarian entr\xc3\xa9es at an affordable price, and the service was good.  The decor has much to be desired, but I usually give tasty food a priority over accommodations.  ;)"

S'Being invited to dinner one doesn\'t have the privilege of choosing the spot so Blu Burger Grille seemed an ok spot to join out of town guests. WRONG...Before I arrived I checked the site out and was disappointed to read an awful review but I went with an open mind.  I arrived before my party and walked into the grille to check it out.  I had to take a step back from the scent of fried oil or so it seemed. The grilles sq. footage is small with patio type tables and booths.  The host or cashier greeted me (chewing gum) and told me to take any seat I liked.  I opted for the outside patio while waiting for my party.  No one even ventured out offering me water nor did they take the time to clean the tables covered with grease. Finally 15 minutes into my wait a server  came out and asked if I wanted a drink. (Maybe he didn\'t see me at first). With water and a menu before me I browsed to see my options. The menu, original and entertaining, offered Step 1-6 Build Your Burger, clever "Lettuce" build your burger selections, salads, sandwiches and sides. Well guess what, my dinner companions call and ask where I am.  Yep they picked Blu Burger Grille but at The Summit and thank goodness for change of venues.  Like night and day, so was the Blu Burger at The Summit.  Yes the menu was the same as were the booths and chairs but that was about all.  The Summit was clean with a fabulous stocked bar and excellent service.  My burger topped with mushrooms, onions and gorgonzola cheese was perfect.  The sweet potatoe fries crispy and tasty.  If you are craving for a burger try BLU BURGER GRILLE but at The Summit.'

This was surprising because I had heard from friends how the bartenders were creative and extremely knowledgable. \n\nAnd although it wasn't crowded, it took an extra long time for us to receive our food.

The pizza was definitely half off, but since we added several toppings, each topping was 75cents additional- SO WORTH IT!! We created a monster pizza (all meats minus ground beef, and topped it off with jalapenos to create that neede ZING).  The only missing ingredients were tomatoes & mushrooms! BOOOHOOO!!\n\nWe also had a bucket of sliders, which were pretty legit!! Also, garlic parmesan twister fries, which I always get at the local PT pubs!!

Wanted to keep it simple and familar for this new outting at a familar restaurant. \n\nThe pizza was what you\'ve come to expect from Sbarro\'s. Greasy, stiff and tasteless.

S"I do normally go to subway 3 times a week. Today when I went in at 9.45pm I ordered the food and the food is good but there are 2 workers working at that time a boy and a girl. After me and my wife took the food and sat down at around 9.50pm they said u must leave by 10 because we will close at 10 and I said OK. In between one old woman who finished her order and when she left those workers are commenting on her and I can hear that clearly. That's not the way how they should be they should have manners.\n\nAnd the main thing exactly at 10 lady came and said u must leave now and I requested for 5 more minutes.and she said OK but immediately after a 2 min she came in again and asked us to GET OUT and I got obsessed and I asked her do we need to stop eating right now and leave can't u give us 5min and immediately another guy came with a shouting voice and said GET OUT right now. I haven't faced this type of experience anytime in my life. He then said GET OUT right now or we will call cops. I don't know that 5 more minutes after closing time is a big crime. I said OK and we left the food on the table and we left.\n\nThis is the bad bad experience in whole life and I don't want to go to that subway again. I don't know about other workers but these 2 are so so bad and I dont know why subway hires such a bad guys.\n\nPlz guys give customers some respect and plz learn manners go to some school.\n\nAnd also when I asked for Avocado in my sub he said we will not serve Avocado after 9.30pm and when I speak to the store manager a day later they said they will serve till closing time. Is this the way they tell lies to customers by not providing the available item. \n\nThanks,"

S'This restaurant looked great on the outside, once we got in however, things changed drastically for the the worse. The hostess was unfriendly, seemed annoyed that she had to get up and walk us over to our table (that was not clean, she asked us to wait while someone could come to wipe it) even though the place was practically empty. \n\nThe server was nice, she tried to perk up the place but when I asked for her recommendation between their "signature" mac and cheese and a dinner potato she hemmed and hahed because she didn\'t like either. That was not a good sign. When our food came out it was disgusting. My husband order the brisket- you could tell it had been boiled (what a waste of meat) and was completely fatty, the potato was hard and the chili was absolutely canned. \n\nMy pulled pork was soaked in water, so much so that the BBQ sauce wouldn\'t stay on. Disgusting mac and cheese went to top it off- bland and slimy. I was absolutely dissatisfied and especially considering the higher prices it was awful. Never coming back.'

S'I have been to this one many different times as it right down the street from my house and it is on the way home from school. I love taco bell; however every time I go to this location it is like there is something major wrong. \nAt first I thought that it was because I went during an off time, I used to work at a Taco Bell in CA and know that food only stays good for so long and during off times you will end up with the end of the containers or you will end up with gross old food.\n\nSo I did not write a review because it was just my timing. I waited and went at a busy high traffic time; and still was not happy with the quality of the food.\n\nEvery time I order the soft taco supreme they are always like wet and stuck to the wrapper, with the meat soaking through the wrapper. Thought at first this was me because it took me a whole 10 mins to get home; so the last time I actually just drove out of the drive-thru and sat in car and looked tacos they were already like that; I order mine special so that they cant use the premade stuff; yes as employees we would pre-make some of the most popular items to make it easy to give out, like the soft tacos; pinto and cheese.  \n\nThe beans on the nachos every time where cold and so gross! I am just wishing that they would pull it together because it is on my way and super convenient when I want something before I hit home.'

I like getting chicken wings with my beers, but these guys send you to the Roberto's next door to get food. That kinda sucks bc Roberto's doesn't equal wings/burgers/bar food. \n\nThe drinks here are ok, though nothing to get excited about. \n\nI'll prob return here, but mostly bc it's close to people's houses."

S'If you don\'t want to read through my drama, just beware to DOUBLE CHECK your order if you come here.  The food is fine - like any other MacDonald\'s - but they have a tendency of getting orders wrong ... for me anyway and no, I do not ask for any kind of unreasonable custom order.\n\nI am putting my grievance here because the managers there just don\'t seem to care.  On several occasions this particular Micky D\'s has gotten my order wrong.  A nuisance at first but I was willing to let it go one time ... two times ... three times. \n\nAbout a month ago, I\'d already lost track how many times they have gotten our order wrong.  I didn\'t have a receipt but I did call the manager because I wanted to let them know they should work on training employees about reviewing orders.  It has happened one too many times for me not to speak up.  She was apologetic and even tried to rectify the situation, "Come by next time and I\'ll still let you get your order for free.  Tell them Corrinda said it was ok."  I was like, "Whoa, that was awfully generous" and thanked her.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I had to take my daughter to the ER for a scorpion bite.  This Micky D\'s is barely a block away so I sent the husband to get our dinner.  "They forgot my McNuggets."  Well, this stressed out mamma with a screaming baby in the ER with the worst pain that anyone could possibly imagine was not going to take this sitting down.\n\nI drove back to the Micky D\'s with our order and receipt and asked to see the manager.  I told her about our most recent experience in addition to the missing McNuggets.  She was apologetic, saying her minimal, obligatory apology and sent me on my way.  She said something about just starting but that got me even more pissed off that she was defending getting orders wrong.  There\'s no excuse.  Don\'t even get me started on the fact that she hardly spoke English, which I believe may have contributed to her reticent behavior.  Come on now, at the managerial level, communication with customers is pretty vital I would think.\n\nI left flabbergasted that my money wasn\'t refunded - not even that it wasn\'t refunded but it wasn\'t even offered -  but I knew I had to take a breather because my daughter needed a mamma who was calm and collected.  No point in getting steaming mad.  "You got your nuggets so just let it go!" I told myself.  \n\nThe next day I decided to get our "free breakfast" because it was a hellish night before to get up early and make breakfast for everyone.  When I dropped Corrinda\'s name to the cashier and how she was going to comp my next order, she asked for a receipt, I said I didn\'t have one, and she was going to ask the manager what to do.  A minute later she came back and told me they couldn\'t give me the breakfast for free if there was no receipt.  I told her get the manager out here so I can explain.  She goes to the back again and comes back out a couple minutes later and says that the manager approved.  Again, I wonder if this is a training issue because i would have expected for this  manager to come out and talk to me.\n\nThe restaurant itself is nice and there is a playground.  The food is fine - tastes like MacDonald\'s.  I will be coming here as little as possible for the sole fact that my orders have been incorrect on so many occasions that I\'ve lost count.  The manager\'s don\'t seem to have a good handle on training their employees and the managers themselves don\'t seem to know how to handle customer issues.'

S"My boyfriend and I had been attempting to cut down on the number of takeaways we were eating, and had been doing so well... until last night when laziness and a desire for curry overcame us and we ordered from The Raj.  We'd not ordered before, but being Leith residents had walked by a few times and had heard of 'Curry In A Hurry' so thought we'd give it a go, and set to choosing what we wanted from the leaflet pushed through our letterbox a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe deal advertised on the front is for two curries (chicken, lamb or veg), two rice, a naan, poppadoms and two 'free' beers for \xc2\xa318.95 - pretty decent. It doesn't specifiy any further than that, but it would appear that despite ordering two chicken curries (Sag and Pasanda), two rice (albeit one of them Pilau), a naan (Peshwari) and poppadoms we obviously didn't qualify for the discount! Perhaps our tastes in rice and naan meant we were disqualified - it would be a better idea for the leaflet (and the website, I checked) to specify what rice and naan were included... Our total was \xc2\xa323 (which was about 60p more than I'd calculated off the menu....).\n\nThe rice was fine, although the container wasn't completely full like most are, and the curries were decent. The sag was nicely spicey, and my boyfriend said he'd be happy to order the pasanda again. And most importantly to a poppadom fiend  like myself, the poppadoms were absolutely fine (is it possible to get a truly excellent poppadom? I don't know, but you can certainly get bad ones).\n\nI can't say anything was particularly outstanding, and it's annoying to find out when the delivery arrives that you have to pay \xc2\xa34 more than the advertised deal... but the food was okay and delivery was prompt (though not quite as swift as the half an hour I was told on the phone). We may well order again, but with so many Indians to choose from we'll probably keep trying to find 'The One'."

S'I have never ate at Port of Subs before, so I decided to stop by one day to buy lunch.\n\nI like how they slice their meats and cheese fresh, but damn, they are really stingy with everything inside your sandwich! I went with the medium (8") No. 5, which contained Smoked Ham, Turkey, and Smokey Cheddar Cheese. The cheese especially was sliced VERY thin, I could barely even taste it! I wish the lady who was working could have put more layers of meat in my sandwich as well, to make up for those thin slices. \n\nMaybe I just happened to come in on a bad day, but there is nothing special about this place. The sandwich tasted okay and got me full, but I can\'t think of any reason why I would want to come back. I am actually a fan of Jersey Mike\'s Subs. Same concept - they slice their meats and cheeses fresh. I have not visited a Jersey Mike\'s here in Vegas yet, but the locations I used to frequent when I lived in California were awesome! They would really load up your sandwich with all the ingredients, it always tasted good, and the employees were friendly! \n\nI should have spent my $6 across the street at Panda Express or even Krispy Kreme! Ah well, at least I can say that I finally tried Port of Subs.'

The staff smiled and was very attentive and friendly.  Despite ordering late, my food arrived just a minute or so after the rest of the party's food did, and it was wonderful.  I ordered a creamy shrimp and scallop dish that I do not recall the name of exactly, but I'd recommend it.  Ask for a little oregano and some olive oil on the side, and add it to your taste.  Amazing.  (I'm a little particular in the tastes I look for, obviously... )\n\nAlso, the location is great.  It's on a hill overlooking the Las Vegas area, and the windows were so wide as to make the best use of this view.  It was spectacular.  You could gaze into the clear skies for hours.  They also have a bar area and a gaming area with their own players club, but neither of those things interested me, so I don't have a review for those.  But the food and the service was very good.  The decor was nice, as well, with wooden tables and wine racks, and stone elsewhere, but I didn't notice it as much as the view.."

Two people, who I presume are the owners, told me they didn't have shredded pork so apologized and told me that they put more sliced pork...and the gave me a Sprite can. I thought they were pleasant and that was cute they gave me a drink. \n\nWhen I got home I destroyed my food. Sure I was hungry, but I ate fast because it was good. The pork had a nice balance of flavors and was super juicy and soft. The egg bake was yum. Their fish sauce was a bit more vinegary than some other places, but that works really well for the meats. If it was good lukewarm then for sure it will be delicious fresh and hot at the restaurant. It was a great portion and it was $7.51 including the tax...it's a good deal. \n\nI will be back for sure!

The first time I ordered for me and my group of vendors, the chicken tenders came out dark brown, to the point where if you left it in the fryer any longer, they would have burned.

They had also switched out the chicken tenders I had ordered for someone else with a regular $6 burger (I'm assuming). Luckily the vendors didn't care since they were really hungry and I didn't over-pay on anything since $6 burger is more expensive than the chicken tenders.\n\nI honestly have no idea how they could screw up so badly on our orders two times on two different days. Both days they weren't busy, and had enough staff. The second day I think the manager was working (she was the only one wearing regular clothes, not the uniform), and they still managed to screw up our order.\n\nSo if anyone goes to this place, make sure you double check your order is right, I don't think they can handle huge orders or even the lunchtime rush correctly, and it's a huge shame because I really like Carl's Jr a lot, just not this location."

Full menu is served all day. \n\nTheir burgers are simple but delicious. I've been pleasantly surprised by their breakfast choices.  My favorite thing to order here, by far, is the chicken club toaster. I ask for it with honey mustard instead of mayo and they are always happy to comply!\n\nThe fries are so-so, they never seem salty or crunchy enough for my taste. I do like the tater tots, and their onion rings are delish!  I'm also a fan of their mozzarella sticks with marinara.\n\nThe drive-thru can get slow, but parking in a stall isn't that big of a deal. Sometimes, at peak times, it's faster to park in a stall than attempt the drive-thru!"

We had really planned on bar hopping the better restaurants this evening to try various bites but the menu at Valentino's was too nice to pass up. The restaurant has a fine dining menu and a more affordable grill menu. Not sure what the FD side brings to the table but beating the grill fare for the price, would be a staunch task.\n\nMy wife loves shrimp cocktail and I am a steam clam away from total bliss so the starters pinned our smile meters right away. We both had traditional pasta dishes that were authentic, delicious, and served perfect al dente.  I followed dinner with a nice Tiramisu and coffee and  we were fat and sassy.\n\nAngel, our waiter was a joy and really bent on customer service. Between a great personality and wonderful service he garnered my best tip of the weekend award.  Restaurant is small. Probably only 12 or so tables but very good and in. Vegas terms very affordable...  Try it"

S'Perfect place for any vegans or vegetarians visiting town.  They all seem to get a kick out of the whole premise of the place. Think of it as starring in your very own imaginary "Gay Vegan Nazi" episode of Seinfeld. Obey the rules or get banned for life. Be insulted or made fun of. Do not step out of line by asking for something like "salt" and definitely do not request to turn down the volume if the owner is listening to bad, loud disco.   \n\nBut most people go not in spite of but because of the service. They get a kick out of the deliberately bitchy attitude that contributes to the Spirite Lounge\'s mystique. That said, after a few visits the "attitude" begins to feel like an elaborate and contrived schtick.  Once the novelty wears off, you\'re left with the food. And it seems like the restaurant has been running on fumes for the past few years after its heyday earlier in the decade. The fact is the food (although supposedly a rotating single menu without, of course, any choice) always tastes the same and thus gets boring very quickly (and I have begun to have the sinking suspicion that the sad truth is that it was just not very good to begin with).  In other words, a fun restaurant to try once for the novelty of the experience/surroundings. Go once and forever rest in peace.'

S'Rocky Rococo is a place to go when you give up.  If you are in an area with very limited options, it\'ll do.  Do they have great customer service, fine ingredients or a non-conveyor belt products?  Absolutely not.\n\nTheir pizzas feature bland thick layers of cheese, a sour and sodium filled sauce and toppings that will not kill you, but are not exactly satisfying.  I grab super slices.  They range from the inedible glob-mozzarella filled crust (ick - more on this later) of the "Mother Lode" (their spelling, not mine) pepperoni or sausage to a variety of seasonal/daily offerings \n-- my favorite is the is the "Perfect" with sausage, \'shrooms, green peppers, onions and tomatoes.  \n\nThey have a modest salad bar with passable options.  If you get the unlimited trips, you also get a bun made of wood pulp (I believe their bread sticks are also made from wood pulp).  \n\nThe service is filled with some of the dopiest/pokiest cashiers in the world.  If you get the manager (a husky gentleman with a mustache), he\'ll treat you right.  \n\nNotes: \n\nThey have free wi-fi.\n\nThe super slices are hit and miss.  You may have the slice of the week, slice of the day and the pepperoni and sausage super slices on some days, other days their may be nothing out there.  That end of it is not managed consistently well. \n\nTips: \n\nThe "Mother Lode" anything may kill you.  They roll their crust in a massive log of cheese.  It\'s supposed to be melty, but it never quite gets there, so it\'s a "real and present" choking hazard.\n\nThey box their super slices in cardboard.  After a while, the crust gets really soggy and turns into school cafeteria pizza - real rank. Make sure to inquire about the slices that are most recent because they come somewhat crisp.'

S'God help me but I was trapped at this resort and had to eat lunch here.  Yes, I only ate here once, but I got the idea that the circle of cilinary hell I was in was typical.\n\n- 1 Star - Wierdly dark.  Came in at 2pm on a weekday and what lights were on (most those over the bar were OFF), were dimmed down to the strip-club level.  To encourage more drinking?  To save electricity? Just flat out weird.\n- 1 Star - Horrible, dreadful food.  A quesadilla should not be served cut up in to slices and stacked on top of each other if the slices are so watery with oil, so underdone, so glutinously sticky that each slice cannot be pulled away from that below it.  And what\'s with the bizarre "chipolte" sauce poured over my stacked mass?  It was like watery mayo with orange coloring.  Foul beyond words.  The pico de gallo was okay, though!  But then there was the side salad.  Old tasting lettuce, chunks of flat-fridge-tasting tomato and croutons that came out of a stale bag left open since... not sure when.  I don\'t think I have left a salad untouched in years, until today.  How was the dressing for the salad?  Oh, hi, nice to see you Mister Plastic Bottled blue cheese.  \n- 1 Star/ + 1 Star - Server.  I sat at the bar, and with about 12 stools available, there was only one other taken, so it was not busy.  The bartender was attentive, not neglectful.  But there could have been some warmth, some pleasantry?  Right?  I mean, take a few moments to ask... something beside the basics - whatcha want?  No?\n+ 1 Star/-1 Star - The music.  It\'s like the 80\'s are alive, and kicking here at the ole Sangria.  Sort of cool but not as this is just not *that* sort of place.\n- 1 Star - The Price.  Once again, as with the other eaterie on property, it\'s like they know they have you by the short-hairs.  A quesadilla and small salad for about $20, without any drink (water! free!)?  Ridic.\n\nThere isn\'t much more to say about this place other than it is the 2nd restaurant on the premises of the Scottsdale Resort and Conference Center.  I understand that the pool bar (which was not open the few days I was here) serves food from Sangria\'s, so SSDD is the vibe.  What Sangria\'s and it\'s snazzier (but still crappy) sister joint, the Palm Court, need is a food facelift.  They could get away with being mediocre in so many other ways (decor, out-dated vibe in general) if the food was good.  But it\'s not even fresh! \n\nThis resort needs to step up their food game.  Maybe they can get away with serving slop to the conventioneers, but the fact that they had rooms available at last minute notice when the rest of Scottsdale was booked up speaks mightily to the poverty of their food quality.  Again, a sad "avoid" vote.'

No, there is still no seating. (Eating while standing is not going to kill you [but those fried twinkies and oreos might.])\n\nYes, new and improved: they now even accept credit, debit, and charge cards!

During my stop here, I've had the chance to try:\n\n-Carne Asada Tacos: Carne asada is seasoned well, making it rich and flavorful. Probably some of the best I've had in town.\n-Tacos al Pastor:  While not as memorable as the carne asada, it's still a very solid taco. Good, but not awesome.\n-Carne Asada burrito: I managed to get a bite of this from whom I was eating with. It's basically what you get in a taco, in burrito form (with rice, beans, etc.). Much too heavy for me, so I'd rather stick with the tacos.\n\nAll in all, a solid trip. I would eat here again, but wouldn't go out of my way for this place.

The chef comes out and greets you before you are waited on, and your food is brought to you on carts as opposed to a waiter struggling with 10  burning plates in his hands.  The atmosphere is also very peaceful and quiet.\n\nThe food IMO is excellent.  The dinner salad is simple, refreshing, and not overpowering.  I highly recommend the New York steak and the ribs.  However, I have heard that the pasta dishes leave something to be desired.  \n\nAlso, do not leave without getting dessert.  They do a table side bananas foster and cherries jubilee which they prepare in front of you (nice presentation and tastes delicious!), and they also have cheesecake served with a seasonal fruit and fruit sauce that has a nice, refreshing flavor.  (perfect for neutralizing the palate after a large dinner.)\n\n-Aaron, I don't think you ate at the Yukon Grille.  They don't even have anything on the menu that is $3.49 or $7.99, nor do they serve steak with eggs.  I think you confused Yukon Grille for another restaurant inside Arizona Charlies.

At first glance Betty Boo's doesn't appear to be much more than just some hole-in-the-wall but beyond its' modest exterior and decor is a wealth of delightful true southern home cooking. I had the BBQ chicken, the collard greens and the mac and cheese while my husband had the tilapia with the same sides. First, the servings were enormous. After stuffing our faces we still had THREE full containers to take home. My chicken was fall off the bone perfection with a tangy sauce but my husband's tilapia put my chicken to shame. Pan fried, lemony goodness. The collards had a great texture with none of the bitterness you can sometimes find in greens and the mac and cheese had that true homemade quality without a creamy sauce but just good sharp cheddar. Gluttons that we are we also had to take home some of the banana pudding and that too did not disappoint. \n\nBeyond the quality of the food I must say how much I also liked the charming owners. This is a brother and sister team that between them have over 40 years of cooking experience. The sister is family taught by her grandmother from South Carolina and the brother is a CIA graduate and has worked in some of the finest restaurants in the world. I know all of this because of how friendly and welcoming they both were. These are people with a sincere and kind heart who genuinely love to feed people.\n\nI will most certainly be back and I plan to bring everyone I know with me."

There are plenty of what I call the "Big Giant Burrito" places, but here is why I think Moe\'s stands out above those others.  They give you free chips and salsa with your BGB.  They have 5 kinds of salsa including a tasty tomatillo salsa which is my favorite.  Less than a week old this Moe\'s was running fairly smoothly.  The line for food was 3/4\'s of the way to the door, but it moved quickly.  The staff assembling the BGB\'s did a good job of moving the line along.  \n\nHere is the one bad thing about this location.  The cash registers, salsa bar, drink machine, lid & straw station, etc, were jammed into a corner that has a support column right in the middle of it.  The 100 flavor coke machine didn\'t seem to be holding things up too much, but salsa bar, lids & straw station did cause a bit of a traffic jam. I was able to get my food, drink, & salsa, find a seat, eat and get out in about 40 minutes.  \n\nSo even though it was busy it wasn\'t too bad to get in, eat and get out.

For just over $11, you get an offering of ceviche, freshly made guacamole, chips and two croquettes of two kinds-potato and meat served with a side of delicious aioli.   The ceviche was nicely prepared-you could taste the freshness of the fish balanced by the acidity of the citrus it has been marinated in.  The guacamole also was well done although scooping it out in the narrow serving dish was a tad difficult.  I think the croquettes, however, stole the show.  Biting through the brown crispy shell allows you access to the warm, soft potatoey gooey-ness on the inside.  Dipping them into the aioli was a decadent treat.  The Dirty Bird sandwich is also noteworthy.  Served on a cuban roll baked that morning, it is an exciting blend of shredded and marinated chicken, chipotle, jicama, roasted corn, sweet potato, and cilantro with a harisa aoili dressing.  It is something I could eat every week and never get bored of.\nSince the kitchen is located within the Cardinal, there isn\'t any dedicated seating per-se.  Rather, have a seat wherever you like in (or at) the bar and they will bring the food out to you.  Since I was already over-caffeinated up from an earlier stop, I did not try any of their coffee offerings but if they are even half as good as their food, I will be a big fan.  And with it being open until 3 am on the weekend, I may also be a frequent fan as the food would go well with a few cocktails consumed beforehand.\nA great find!'

S"I attended a reunion at La Serenata and I found this resto is as Italian as the Olive Garden, only much more expensive. We were offered a set menu with selections that, IMHO, were non-Italian. Can anyone tell me if snow-peas and stewed carrots are truly part of Italian cuisine?  I don't think so. They had the nerve to charge an extra $5.00 for rapini because i didn't like the vegetables on the set menu. A plate of tortellini and penne that came on one plate,that's gross in it's self, with a generic bottled rose sauce.I had that replaced with a green salad but it was pretty much tasteless. Now I may be too critical but when you order a grilled fish, should it come looking microwaved and greasy?   \n\nNever mind this resto being overpriced I could forgive them for that if the food was at least good, which it wasn't."

The carne asada is about on par with most of the "bertos" around town, the portions are a little smaller than Filibertos, and the prices are about what you would expect. The only above average thing is their hot sauce, it\'s smokey and wonderful. I\'ll certainly be back, I like to spread my Mexican food love around the town, but they opened right next to a Filibertos, a bold move and all, but I just like Filis more.'

S'Dinner for three last night. We stuck to the authentic Chinese side of the menu, and on the waiter\'s recommendation ordered one dish for each of us: half duck no bones, potatoes/eggplant/peppers, and spinach in garlic sauce. The duck was good though the "pancakes" were cold. The spinach was acceptable (and looked like a popular dish, considering how many other tables were ordering it). But the best thing hands down was the eggplant dish, which had the best sauce I think I have ever tasted. You will like eggplant after trying this dish! There was plenty of food for all of us, and we even took some home afterward; the vegetable dishes are large portions. Price was totally reasonable. Only real complaints are that the "hot" tea was barely warm, and that we had to flag down our waiter to bring the check, even though we\'d been sitting over empty plates for quite a while.'

Then when I saw that they are open till 2:00 AM on Fridays & Saturdays, I was so excited to actual have something open past 10:00 PM in this area. This establishment is .06 miles from my condo. I ordered a pizza and salad online, was charged a 'processing fee' of .49 cents, which isn't a big deal but kinda lame in this day and age of 'paying with plastic'. Also there is a $2.50 charge for delivery, which is the norm just about everywhere. It took almost an hour for my food to get here. They must be busy??  Pizza was really good, I will say, hot, cheesy.   Salad was good too. The delivery driver pounded on my door and didn't say 1 word to me, just handed me my food, I said thank you, he turned around and left. Is this the reason why there are no reviews on this place?  Hmmm, I wanted to give this place 5 stars but couldn't.   Food is a 5, customer service a -3, so I gave it a 4. Give this place a try, maybe pick up your pie, I know I will next time."

S"I was in Tate Modern in that London fairly recently. Now, I'm not big on modern art (or art in general) but there was one installation that really riled me. Basically, it was a collection of little leather cubes arranged in a supposed 'random' way. And the sign read 'er, yah, it's like a metaphor for the banality of existence and the arbitrariness of prejudice'. Yeah, ok. Just looks like leather cubes to me.\n\nThe reason I'm telling you this is that horrible memory came back to me in Beirut. My main course was Lebanese lamb with chips. I swear they stole that installation from Tate and served it to me. It was so overcooked it was almost impossible to eat. My dining partner had basically the same, but with beef (which was equally overdone). The pickles we shared for starter were from a jar. In fact, the only good point was the sausages which were nicely spiced, if a little salty.\n\nIt's a real shame, because they've made an effort with this place. The staff were friendly, if a little inefficient (the guy next to us got his main at the same time as his starter), and it's nicely done out. It's just the food was awful.

S'The only thing better than a 3 hour Golden Girls marathon when you\'re feeling socially tapped-out is a copious amount of Indian food delivered right to your door.\n\nI discovered Cari Mela about 2 months ago coming home from a gruelling Advisory Committee meeting that had me obsessing about the Bilbo Baggins quote: "I feel... thin. Like butter scraped over too much bread." I got home, went online, ordered from Cari Mela and it was good. \n\nSo last nite, same deal. I got home from the Folk Fest on the canal and called in Cari Mela. Thirty minutes later, I\'m chatting it up with my room-mate, dishing out a sizeable portion of Aloo Gobi (potatoes and cauliflower), Sag Aloo (yummy spinash), Chana Bhuna (chickpea dish), some garlic-and-hot-pepper rice as well as some naan and puri.\n\nFirst thing I notice is man, this is really salty. And that\'s saying a lot. As a general habit, I believe in rigorously salting everything I eat above and beyond whatever went into it while cooking. So yeah, if I think this is salty, it totally is (fact confirmed by my room-mate). Still - just cause it\'s salty, doesn\'t mean it isn\'t a yummy rewarding experience...\n\nThe Aloo Gobi was just fine in my book. Nice greasy sauce and thick well-cooked chunks of patates and cauliflower. Same with the Sag Aloo and the Chana Bhuna. Both super oily and flavourful and went a long way towards healing the remainder of the morning\'s hangover. \n\nThe breads were al-right... Nice thick chunk of naan (I would have appreciated it more if it had been oiled-up - but whatev - I have oil at home) and the weirdest, flatest, least-greasy puri I\'ve ever had in my life - whereas everywhere else I have it it comes as a greasy, soaking wet piece of deep fried bather, this one was flat, slightly moist and very bready. weird. \n\nAnd that was my night in with Cari Mela!'

And Sushi Khan bought Sushi Moto, but are waiting for the change over of the signs facing the street.  So if you\'re meeting a friend there, it\'s Sushi Moto (so\'s you don\'t get lost)......if you get a frequent eater card after you dine there a couple times it\'s Sushi Khan as it says on the card and menu.\n\nThat being said......this is by far the best place to go for "ALL YOU CAN EAT" sushi.  Some places get skimpy and serve you smaller portions.  Or give you a time limit and take their time making your fish.  But here, it\'s Fantasy Roll time,  or Royal Flush Roll, or Rainbow Roll...or whatever roll you happen to wish for or see on the menu.  They\'ll even make you a nice plate of Tuna Poki as part of the all you can eat.  And in a timely fashion.\n\nIt\'s $19.95 for lunch (45mins) and $24.99 for dinner (1hour)\n\nMy friend Jessica and I go quite frequently.....she has a sushi chef she fancies there that see calls "Kitchen Boy"....I think she has a little crush she doesn\'t want to fess up to....yet.   The bad part is that I don\'t remember "Kitchen Boy\'s" real name, so the last time I was there I called him that......I thought I was gonna end up in a hand roll. ( note to self : don\'t do that again unless you\'re a cute brunette chick )\n\nSo the benefit and a very recent one at that, of eating at Khan frequently is the Frequent Eater card....after you\'ve had 9 glorious seating\'s your 10th meal is free.  YAY FREE SUSHI.....that\'s better than friggin\' Christmas.'

Instead you get pita before your meal.  It comes with onion and feta.  You can ask for mint and eat it with the bread, onion, and feta.  Sounds weird, but that is common in Persian restaurants.\n\nEggplant dip is very good and is a must in any Persian restaurant.  I wish they had more than one eggplant dish, though.

S"I love Claim Jumper's restaurants and this location is no exception.  Frankly it is the best location I have ever been to and this one recently opened inside the Golden Nugget.  They have all the usual fair including the full racks of baby back ribs which are my favorite.  John S was my server the day I came in.  I placed my food order as soon as I walked in and spent some time browsing the drink menu which is probably the opposite of what the staff is used to.  However, I was starving and saw no point in drinking on an empty stomach.  John was more than happy to comply.  I ended up ordering the full rack of baby back ribs with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.  I also ordered a small caesar salad and a belini which tasted quite good.\n\nTheir service is awesome.  I walked in at dinner time and was seated right away.  A food runner brought out my caesar salad within 5 minutes of ordering.  Another food server also brought some bread but I asked them to give it away because I wanted to lay off the carbs.  The drink came 5 minutes after that.  And then after probably another 5 minutes, the ribs came.  These guys really brought their A Game because I am used to waiting almost an hour for my food at the locations in California.  As soon as I finished up a plate, someone walking by would offer to clear it for me.\n\nThe food is of course tasty and filling.  The drink was scrumptious.  John rang up my order in no time at all.  Honestly, I was probably in and out in 30 minutes - which was totally fine by me because I had 10 hours of Electric Daisy Carnival to head to.\n\nDid I mention that they are in the Golden Nugget?  Of course I did!  But you know what is really awesome?  You can get anything on their menu sent to your room for room service for like $5 more!  I know, crazy right?  Why settle for boring hotel fare when you can eat Mongolian beef and brocoli!  Needless to say, I highly recommend this location!  :-)"

S"I always come to Red Lobster for my 'special occasion' dinners.  This time it was for my birthday and as usual, I was not disappointed.\n\nWe went early 4:45pm, because I KNOW when you show up to any Red Lobster location at a more traditional dinner time (6-7pm) you're in for a wait.  Being as we were there early, the restaurant was not busy.  Our server was friendly and prompt and the food came quickly and was delicious.\n\nI must say that they've really improved their Caesar salad in the last while.  It used to be tasteless and brutal (one of the only things I didn't like about Red Lobster), but lately they've changed it.  The dressing is more tasty and they have added chunks of cheese on top, which are lovely.\n\nThis time we chose to order their Endless Shrimp special, which I must say is great value for the money.\n\nIf you ever have room for dessert (which I almost never do, ESPECIALLY after endless shrimp), I definitely recommend ordering the key lime pie.  It's tangy and sweet and the perfect end to a delicious seafood meal.\n\nWe'll definitely be back for our next special occasion dinner!"

S'It is a cafeteria, I say this with all of the negative conotation that comes with that phrase.\n\nLocated in the beautiful Viad tower (former dial building) on the 2nd floor is this dimly lit cafeteria.\n\nThere are several stations including a sandwich station, grill, "world" and salad stations. At each station there is a small illegible at a distance sign of what is available.\n\nMost food is made to order, which is problematic as I had to stand in line for over 10 min with a tray to get my meal, then there was another line to check out.\n\nI ordered the salmon, which is not on the menu but the raw fish was on display. \n\nI ordered the fish and it was slapped on the griddle with a generous amount of clarified butter, there goes the healthy idea. Th fish was over cooked. As a side I selected a grilled vegetable salad that was ok but lacked flavor. The combo was about $6 with out a drink which seemed steep for a cafeteria.\n\nThe one nice thing is the fact there are several condiments at the exit, including buffalo sauce which was nice.  The sitting area is clean and nice.\n\nOnly eat here if you are stuck in this building and pressed for time.'

She's always really nice and pleasant and double checks everything.  To me, that stands out since I've been to this location over a span of several months to a year.\n\nIt can be a little slow sometimes, but they do make the food to order.  Corn dogs are a staple here so sometimes I have to wait a few minutes, but they are the freshest, tastiest corn dogs around.\n\nRoot beer floats are pretty good here, too.

S"I wanted to give 2.5 stars.  The food was pretty good, definitely better than average for Madison BBQ.  There were a few disappointments that have been mentioned by a few other reviews, such as the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce instead of homemade variations.  The beef brisket, although tender, was a little on the dry side and lacked flavor.  The pulled pork and ribs were much better.  Oddly enough, the cole slaw comes with the dressing on the side.  With most salads, this is what I prefer, but cole slaw needs time for the dressing to marinate cabbage, a green that's not made to just be eaten raw without some kind of major seasoning.  The Mexican street corn was delicious and unique to Madison.  The bread that came with the dinners had an odd flavor, like it had been deep fried in old oil.  If they could kick up the quality of the sides, I think the food could be really really good.  All in all, I'd have given the food 3.5-4 stars.  \n\nWhat brought the score down was the odd service and the setting.  The folks that take your order seem to be pretty disorganized and slow, whether it's the man that rang up my order incorrectly and kept asking me personal questions (not the owner Pete), or the young 10 year-old girl, who although cute, reminds me a little of child labor.  The place itself is a huge warehouse with a random, eery cowboy statue at the checkout counter.  \n\nI can see this place being really good if they can kick up the food a little and get a better-trained staff.  Right now I still prefer Smoky Jon's BBQ on the East side."

S"Le Di-Vin has recently appeared beside its French counterpart, La P'tite Folie, a restaurant that has long been an established and frequented culinary establishment at the west end. \n\nLe Di-Vin is all about wine exploration, so if you're the kind of person that likes to try two or three different wines of an evening, or possibly more, then this would be a good place to start. You can get pretty much every wine sold here by the glass, bonus, because it can be really annoying if you venture somewhere and there are about two wines sold by the glass, none of which you're keen on. There are times when ordering a bottle of white wine to yourself is not a good idea...actually, you should probably never do that, because it's probably classed as a cheeky bit of binge drinking. With more than 60 wines to choose from, this is an extensive and really well varied menu.\n\nYou could also add to the Frenchness by ordering a cheese board or some charcuterie items, and the bar serves other light bites.\n\nLe Di-Vin has gone for a traditional, fairly relaxed look, so it's not one of those wine bars that's overly polished and too stylised for you to feel comfortable and enjoy yourself. The bar area looks great, with the wine bottles stacked to the rafters, and there's a fair bit of table space, plus a small mezzanine floor."

The waitress was so pleasant and was at our beck and call since we were the only ones there. I had the meat pastry appetizer which was delicious. Like an egg roll wrapped in filo dough. It was a cinnamony/almondy/meaty spring roll, if you will. And the lamb tagine was succulent, I just had to pull the meat off the bone with my fork. And the cous cous was fluffy and perfect. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water.\n\nI have to say, though, that the 2 $$ sign rating is a tad misleading. It should be $$$. I think that $35 for a lamb tagine (though delicious) should be rated with 3 $$$.'

Smoking is allowed on the patio but I wish it wasn't or at the very least banished to the far end of the patio so as not to impede upon those entering and leaving and to allow some non smokers to enjoy the outdoors more. \n\nI stuck my head inside but really nothing impressed me enough to recall what I saw by the time I write this.

S'okay so I love Taco Bell but today was the worst customer service ever...I go through the drive thru and order my steak cantina bowl...then I\'m asked if I would like to donate and I politely say that I already have...well then I hear in the back ground "she\'s lying" how rude...thank goodness I had taken a pic of my donation cause I used a silly name...I get to the window and tell the cashier she\'s very rude for calling me a liar an show her my pic that I donated...she looked at me and said "we\'ll that wasn\'t here" seriously does it matter which Taco Bell I donated at? I just smiled said thanks I will just talk to the customer service rep since you obviously don\'t have good customer service skills an drive off...now I\'m hungry an pissed bad combo!!!!'

S"This place is 4.5 stars for me. I've been coming here for many years ever since they opened. This place is ALWAYS crowded during dinner time, if you come around 6-8 you will probably have to wait unless if you made a reservation, this is particularly true on the weekends. I have tried numerous appetizers, pasta entree, burger entree, and cheesecake desserts. Overall, the flavor of the food is great, the presentation is also commendable and the portion is very large. Because of the large portion, on some of their dishes they offer 1/2 sizes. The interior decoration is very nice, 2 floor high ceiling, golden deco, very spacious and many different sections. They have a full bar overlooking a great view. When you order pasta, they always bring out parmasan and shred it right in front of you. Love their pesto and sundries tomatoes. They also always bring put a basket of wheat and white bread after you order. Entrees range around 12-18 dollar. Appetizers around $8-12. Their appetizers are pretty big too, i ordered the avocado spring rolls once and i was able to eat it as an entree. The avocado spring rolls are amazing, i highly recommend them. They are different than any other spring rolls you've had. Perfect flavor and consistency over a crispy shell. If i remembered correctly, there are 6 large half pieces of spring rolls. The cheesecakes are around $6-8 per piece. Very large size served on a large plate, can be shared among 2-3 people. Drinks are around $7-12, pretty good as well, great mixed drinks."

S"Hungry for some good Corned Beef, I whipped in here today for lunch.  This is a smallish place, not fancy but comfortable, & I didn't see a lunch combination special on the menu, so I asked for one anyway, & here's what I ended up with:\n\nA nice bowl (not cup!) of Chicken & Matzah Ball Soup (their spelling) to start things off, & it was delicious!  Then there was my 1/2 Hot Corned Beef on Rye sandwich, neither piled up sky high nor skimpy, but in between, & on plain bread with a bottle of mustard there on the table to add your own.  There was also a small cup overflowing with fresh cole slaw, a tasty Kosher pickle spear, & a slice of cantaloupe.\n\nThe Corned Beef was lean, tender, & tasty.  Everything else was good too, & it all added up to a nice lunch for the price, $7.95.  My only concern is that I'm not sure I could have ordered anything different from the menu & still kept the cost down.  With that said, I'll go again & hopefully see you there!  ... but not on a Saturday when they're closed.    :-))"

S"I have to start off by saying I only allot two stars to the restaurant aspect of East Sides. I give the bar 4 stars. I sat in the restaurant for the first time and had terrible service. The waitress left us for long wait times more than once. We waited probably 5 minutes for a table and when we were seated it took around ten minutes for the waitress to show up. We ordered everything we wanted, and about ten minutes later our soups showed up. Around fifteen minutes after our meals showed up. The food was delicious though at this point I was frustrated with the service. The original waitress did not bring us our food and it looked more like a younger hostess helping out. Not only did she bring all of our food she had to refill our soup, bread and drinks as we'd been waiting. I did not see the waitress again until she prompted us to finish our food asking around 2 times in five minutes if we were done yet, then bringing over the bill. I was very unimpressed to say the least.\n\nWhen Ive visited the bar at East Sides the food comes quick, the waitresses are very friendly and are constantly checking to see if you need something refilled. They also offer you parmesan cheese with your soup unlike the waitresses. \n\nI can't knock the food as it is always delicious but if when i come back to this restaurant I will never leave the bar."

S"Me and my family arent a 'Sunday Roast' type of family. We would rather sit around and eat something a bit different, or \n\nToby Cavery however, is somewhere that I could eat a sunday roast any day of the week - and I'm sure many people do. I'm not going to explain the whole process again, because I'm sure you have read it in all of the other reviews - but instead I'm going to focus upon what the actual food is like. The meat is always brilliantly cooked, and while you cant go back for more meat, you do get a decent sized portion. You can go back for as many vegetables as you want - and they are all pretty decent - not maybe the best tasting vegetables I have ever tasted, but nice enough.\n\nThe sweets (if you can fit one in afterwards) are pretty decent as well - although I have never actually finished on. A case of my eyes being bigger than my stomach I feel.\n\nThe pubs themselves are a bit dark and old mannish, but for what they do they are decent enough and cheap. Excellent really."

But this place is terrible from location to customer service you can barely see the place and once you go in there you will never want to come back.. The employees are scared to work because the owner watches them like a hawk like they're in prison campus it's completely sad.. Normally Wingstop gives you free extra ranch if they forgot to ring it up but they also made me pay for it and swipe my card all over again it was a disaster.

S'Not a fan.  While the ribs and steak may be great, I can\'t say; stay away from the seafood.  The first time I was there, I ordered the Ahi Tuna, safe bet as all that needs to be done is proper seasoning and a kiss from the grill.  Second time, same thing - Ahi.  It was good.  Third time, I figured I would try something different; bad, bad mistake.  Calamari and shrimp, supposedly grilled.  They were overcooked and rendered inedible.  The Calamari had the consistency of rubber tire, the shrimp was tough and almost tasteless were it not for all the oil that it was floating around in.  It was horrendous.  The type of oily that leaves you nauseated.  I sent a letter to their head office and to their credit, they sent me a gift certificate to try again.  \n\nI tried again, last night.  The "special" was Mahi Mahi.  I love Mahi Mahi.  My companion and I ordered the Mahi Mahi.  He ordered his blackened with Cajun seasoning and I ordered a simple grilled offering.  Half my fish was relatively cooked, the other half was almost raw.  \n\nHis was cooked but was far from "blackened".\n\nWe had a third dinner companion who ordered the ribs and was very happy with them.\n\nI won\'t be returning to Baton Rouge.  I believe that when something is offered on a menu and/or announced as a "special\' that the kitchen is capable of delivering a properly prepared dish.  \n\nIf you plan a dinner at the restaurant, apparently, you are quite safe ordering the steak or the ribs; I do not recommend the fish or seafood, with the obvious exception of the Ahi which is, frankly, rather hard to screw up.'

S"Zawedeh is an utter disgrace to Lebanese cuisine and does it absolutely no justice and is indeed a disservice. Zawedeh purports to be a fine dining establishment ... this, my dear friends, they are not. If this is fine dining then I must be the bloody Queen of England with a clitoral hood piercing! Far from it and sadly mistaken. The only fine dining factor that strikes me about this place is their exorbitant pricing. You will not, I repeat, you will not get any value for dollar at this place. \n\nTheir Fattoush salad was amateurish rubbish at best. How on God's green earth does one fuck up a salad? \n\nThe houmous was corned with salt. I have never encountered a hummus that I didn't like until tonight. I swear to whatever higher power there is that may or may not exist ... I wouldn't be at all surprised if they simply went down to the M\xc3\xa9tro Market and picked up a case of houmous and threw a shit tonne of iodised salt and maybe some proprietary rat urine in there to call it their own. Seriously, how do you fuck up houmous?\n\nThe next nasty item I ate were these weird egg roll looking things with some kind of overly salty cheese inside. They tasted mediocre at best...and that's me being generous and not saying that it was a complete waste of an opportunity to vomit all over their dinnerware. You know that vomit taste in your mouth that lingers after you've had a good vom? Yeah, that's the taste of a five star meal compared to this filthy cheese brine. \n\nWhat really pissed me off even more was one man's insistence that I try these crunchy pita chips that they were obviously trying to rid themselves of. Those are salty too. They put that shit on everything. I asked for some fresh pita and was met with a begrudging nod. I've never been to a real restaurant that got their pita bread packaged from the supermarket because that's exactly what this place was like. Stale overcooked pita with their proprietary trademark excess salt on top. \n\nLastly and definitely my least favourite was the strawberry cheesecake. It was frozen solid and was probably about a week and a half old served with a mouldy strawberry on the side.  \n\nAlso, the waitstaff are treated so horribly and with such disdain by the higher ups at this place. \n\nSo the moral of the story is if you don't want to be served shitty Lebanese food for obviously too much money then stay the fuck away from Zawedeh. \n\nInstead of this place go elsewhere. Please go elsewhere. The best Lebanese fine dining to be found in the city is Restaurant Daou on Faillon or Marcel-Laurin. They have been around for forty years and they know what they're doing. Also try La Sir\xc3\xa8ne de La Mer near Jean-Talon and Restaurant Ezo on Acadie. \n\nHappy eating. Cheers!"

S'Morningside is slowly winning me over, and Gourmet Pasta is definitely one of the reasons why. Firstly I\'ve got to say I never expected the Italian influence to be so prominent in Edinburgh; this has to be, at the very least, the twentieth "Italiano" outfit I\'ve come across. \n\nFrom the outside, it looks like any other deli and I have to say the food they stock is extremely authentic Italian...I hardly noticed an attempt to even try and seem healthy! Dried pastas and olive oils looked imported all the way from Italy, and the cold food section was brimming with pies, cold cuts, and all sorts of ready made pasta dishes. They also serve hot meals to eat-in and to the left of the food counter is a little surprise: a well hidden eating area! However, it\'s really quite small, and although it was empty during my visit, I wouldn\'t bet on getting a seat there for dinner. Pizza and pasta quite typically form the bulk of the menu. \n\nAs if this wasn\'t enough, they even make cakes to order... not just any cakes either, but the gourmet stuff, naturally. When I took a look at the list, and I wondered if it\'d be a little hedonistic to order oneself a whole Italian Blackforest Gateaux!\n\nThis store, still owned by Italians of course, has been open for a mind-boggling fifteen years, and they seem to have paid homage to the Scots with a Haggis ravioli (I did a double take) which I actually recommend! I\'m not a fan of haggis, but in this form, i\'ll take it.'

OK this was mostly a Menu which was harder to understand than the other kind and maybe I\'m not real good at reading anythinj other than Pictures and some GREAT Reviews on yelp, the ones written by Friends (someones Friends, right).  You KNOW I LOVE YOU!!!\n\nWho ever though of "Build Your Own" must have known someone like me... Except I usually have CHEESE, Tomato Sauce and Crust... If a plain Cheese Pizza is Good, then......

Until last night It has been years since I have had a PIE for the Woofman.\n\nDessert...Hummmm, How do I word this?  S\'mores Pizza... Before I say Two and a Half yelp stars, I\'ll call it a Poor Dessert to Bare the name S\'mores!!!  NOTE to the Owners***  On this Dessert and on your Dessert one person is saying right here..."Go back to the Drawing Board" or, OR Ignore me... I\'ll still eat your Pizza and go somewhere else for Dessert!  I\'m NOT mad... This is a NOTE to help YOU! Woof!  I\'ll go somewhere and learn to use spellject!\n\nAppetizers? Hummm... Last Night I was HUNGRY and really wanted something, Appetizer or two before the Pizza... Instead of making a second note to the owners, I\'ll ask someone else to make some CREATIVE and Delicius Pre-Meal options, ideas so the Woofman can eat the competition, not that he could not anyway (being a Woof)... Pretzels come to mind!  Thinly Sliced ONION Rings like the Cow Fish Onion Straws.... Something from a Great Horror Movie or an Idea for the Next Horror Movie to come out in the Spring!  Woof... these are the clues: "Hot" Sweet Potato Chips (NOT reheated - Made-to-order) or Zoo-kini (Zucchini) Chips (like at Nolen Kitchen) or how about Bacon Wrapped, Sausage Stuffed Jalapenos with Bacon Marmalade Dipping Sauce!!!\n\nVery Good Service!  Most of the Servers are VERY Good with Children...They took GREAT Care of me!!! \n\nNo Way this is a Sports Bar, right? ? ?  Place looks GREAT...Like Chucky Cheese for Adults with a lot of kids too!

The sudent chefs and waitstaff seem to be getting in the swing of things and I have to say that they are turning out some amazing food. \n\nI ordered the meatball sliders (sans bread) with sour cream mashed potatoes. The portions were large and the sliders were well seasoned and served on a skewer atop the creamy potatoes. \n\nI am a green iced tea fanatic, so I had to try that. I wish I had thought to ask for it to go so that I could drink it all day.  Delish. They mentioned a Japanese brewing technique...I would pop by just to pick up  green tea.\n\nNow,  with the soft opening they offered a free dessert with entree and I had to try the warm chocolate cinnamon sugar churros and the hand made Mexican  chocolate ice cream shake.  I think it is at the top of my chart for sure. \n\nOf course it was raining today so I was a happy camper and lunch was enjoyed with my bf. All in all, it was a pleasant experience, with students a bit nervous, hoping to please, and great food with decent prices. I will check-in each week if I can. It's fun to see how things progress through the semester. \n\nForgot to mention the pricing.  We were served complimentary Mediterranean salad and a bread basket.

Pinapple Shrimp, Shrimp with vegetables, Shrimp with corn, and fried shrimp to name a few.  They were all good.  Fried rice was tasty too.  The service was fast with refils on drinks.  I was not too impressed with the entrance though.  There is a big crack in the tile at the entrance which looks tacky in my opinion.  But then again, this is a chinese buffet so......\nAll in all not the best I've had but A-OK."

S"I went to Susie's for lunch the other day. I got it to go, as I was alone and don't like to eat at restaurants by myself. There was only a few people inside and the food seemed to come pretty fast if you eat in. \n\nI probably waited about 20 mins for my to go food. I thought the restaurant was in need of a remodel. But they don't seem like they have the greatest hours, as they close at 5pm. So it is a lunch place, not a dinner place.\n\nI got my food and took it home. I live not even a mile from this place. I ordered Sopes. They had shredded beef, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and salsa. I thought they were very comparable to the ones I have had before, which were homemade. \n\nI would like to go back for lunch, but as I'm not home much for lunch it might be difficult! Definitely worth a second chance!"

S"The plan was to make homemade teriyaki portabello sandwiches for dinner and on the drive home I realized that i was tired and did not want to cook today.. So I turned to the never fail you Yelp searching for something good to eat. Guess what happened, I found Chicken Bonz... \nI happen to enjoy a good wing every now and again and decided that this was a perfect fit for what my taste buds happen to be asking for, something spicy, crunchy, tasty and all around amazing. \n\nIf your still with me this is where the fun began, we drove over to C. Bonz and when we arrived the place was packed, and I mean no place to sit and 4 person deep line packed. After taking in how busy this place was we started scanning the menu, I see that 12 wings are roughly $12 but on the special little chalkboard below the menu i see scribbled in chalk that every day is all you can eat wing day for $11.99, You better believe Mr. Raymond went for the AYCE for 11.99. I ordered the Hot BBQ which was really good but did not have the kick that I was expecting. This wings happen to be huge and the atmosphere was okay. Some of the clientele seemed a little shady but as long as they do not try to snag my wings it's all good. \n\nObviously I enjoyed this place and yes i would go back but here is the breakdown of good and bad.\n\nGood:\n1. The chicken wings are on steroids and are gigantic\n2. They are cooked just right and had the perfect amount of sauce \n3. The $11.99 Price point is Money!! not in literal terms people.\n4. The service was awesome, as in friendly\n\nBad/ Downside:\n\n1. It took FOREVER to get our food\n2. You have to pay for any ranch or dipping sauce there is non included\n3. The dining area is small- I don't know that this is a bad thing..\n\nMy star rating of 4 stars is all due to the quality of the wings. The one star loss was due to the long wait for the wings when initially ordered. \n\nOverall, I say YES... Try this place at least once, this is a great alternative to your normal cookie cutter Buffalo Wild Wings type place.  Enjoy!!"

S"I have been to The Black Door 2 times in the last week.  For those not familiar with it, it is pretty new and located 10 feet from the entrance to the Double Down. \n\nBoth evenings I went there every person I encountered, from the door to the bar were awesome.  Friendly, cool and inviting.  The place a has a nice vibe. It looks cool, isn't saturated by smoke yet (which is  a plus) and comfortable. \n\nThey have a small stage  that has 2 stripper poles  (1 on each side) of the stage. I am not sure if that was left over from when it used to be a place they held drag queen competitions. ( Or so goes the story I was told). When a band isn't playing they have a large screen tv (above the stage) playing great music along with the music videos. It's a nice mix of music too. \n\nThe stage is fairly small but great for a smaller lounge/bar. They have a few couches, a few VIP booth areas and several booths around the edges as well as along couch at the entrance. \n\nThe bar along with the rest of the place is a cool vibe and place to hang out. The bartender on both night I was there cam from the Ice House. He books bands etc too. Really good guy. \n\nIts a great concept and cool vibe to the place. When I was there they other night I tried the food and was pretty impressed. I didn't expect food that impressive in an area known for dive bars.  \n\nThe prices are slightly higher than is typical of the area but I hope they do well since the concept is great.  It is worth checking out and you are just  10 drunken steps to the Double Down to make your evening complete.  Good job Back Door!\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars  is the sound is weak for a venue  (supposedly) part owned by Dave Navarro. I would expect great sound. It was less than impressive.  The soundboard is behind the stage. Not sure what genius thought of that since  you can't hear correctly or  adjust sound if you are behind the stage.  That is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review. I am hoping they will fix the sound and I can update my review to 5 stars."

The hostess said that the bar seating was open, so we sat at a high-top table and waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited. \n\nThe place wasn\'t terribly busy, and several servers were waiting on the tables surrounding us, so to not even get an "I\'ll be right with you" in 10 minutes was a little lame. After a while, the match was already starting (and not displayed on any of the TVs - we were going to ask if we could have one of them changed to the right channel) so we just went across the street and picked up some beer and sandwiches and went home to watch the match. \n\nI\'m sure we\'ll try going again sometime, hopefully we\'ll actually get to eat there next time.'

S"I am a coffee snob. There, I said it. More times than not, I am super disappointed with  what some stores are shilling as espresso. I mean, a shot of espresso (or three) is the best way to judge a coffee shop, in my opinion, because it is the coffee at its finest, yet still incredibly simple. And to be honest, the espresso I had at Gallup (soon to be Crescendo Espresso Bar and Music Cafe!!!!!) was probably the best I have ever had. Which is saying something, because I've tried some amazing coffee in my time in Rome, Paris, and of course Zingermans in Ann Arbor, MI.\n\nThe tiny little cup filled with dark, rich, and bold espresso smelled heavenly and tasted even better. Oh, and strong. LIKE WOAH strong. But of course, that's how I like it.\n\nI was all about the interior (total coffee house vibe with plush chairs and tables for a group) and the staff was incredible. There is a new gluten free menu coming soon along with brand new owners. So far, I'm totes digging what they've done so far.\n\nI WILL BE BACK!"

S"This is a loverly little Thai place, just off the Meadows in Edinburgh. I was starving the other night and in desperate search of food when I (happily)  stumbled across this place.\n\nIn a rush to fill my rumbling stomach, I boringly opted for a vegetable Thai Green Curry. It arrived so quickly and I could smell the fantastic aromas coming off the plate. The food looked really appealing and so I eagerly dove in to get started. \n\nThat's when I saw it. Slimy, beige tofu lurking in amongst the vegetables. My heart sunk a little bit as this point. I hate tofu - always have and probably always will. It's just weird, to be honest, and not something I especially look forward to eating. That being said, I did try a piece, in the hope that I would magically be converted to a tofu-lover. No such luck.\n\nNow, I realise wholeheartedly that I cannot fault this place for serving me tofu that tasted like tofu - that would be crazy! I'm sure that in my desperation I completely missed the mention of it on the menu, so it was most likely my own fault, but I'm just putting it out there, to other tofu-haters: beware! If you don't like tofu, don't order tofu! :p\n\nThat being said, once I had carefully separated the tofu from the rest of the dish (trying desperately not to be spotted by the staff and be coined as that annoying, picky customer that everyone hates) the meal was really good! Just the right amount of spicy and nice flavours to top it off. It was pretty much your standard nice Thai curry. No real wow-factor, but a very satisfying meal nonetheless.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is great too and the staff were really lovely! I'd definitely go back here. Maybe next time I'll simply avoid the tofu! :)"

S'Why am I giving another pizza chain a 5 star review? Because they have a rewards program then keep earning me free pizzas that actually do taste good. I order online and every time you order papa point accumulate. It only works if you order online for the papa points. Not only do I earn points when I order but they just randomly give me enough points for a free pizza for ordering. Once over super bowl last year I did a coin toss online and guess correct so they gave me a free large 3 topping pizza then too. They also often have a promotion where when you buy a pizza online you get a free pizza on your next order.\n\nI usually always pick up my order because I feel like a lazy ass having them deliver me free food. I still give a tip as a thanks. They always open my pizza and show it to me to make sure it is right. The pizza here is good and the ingredients are fresh. the crust is tasty and goes well with the free garlic butter in each pizza box.\n\nStay away from the chicken poppers.

S"I visited Sammy's this past Sunday. My first impression was that it was a good place to watch sports. I was pleased that they offered Pepsi products and told the bartender that I was the designated driver as I ordered a Diet Pepsi. My friend and I went to one of several open tables.\n\nIt was a typical dive bar with great televisions. The wings were very good and our bartender was very attentive. Sadly, the waitress who came on midway through the first games completely ignored our table. My friend and I had to get our own water. \n\nI was appalled when a man (presumably the owner, who should know better) walked in smoking a cigar. The stench alone was enough to turn my stomach.\n\nI was further appalled when I saw that I had been charged for my soda and the few refills I had. Really?? Very few bars actually penalize the designated driver by even charging for one soda, much less charging that person for refills. At $2.25 each, it would have been cheaper for me to drink beer. If she had been kind enough to tell me that refills were not free, I would have ordered water as a refill. I'm surprised they don't charge for that (and they probably would if they could). I did express my surprise to the bartender and she said she had to follow the rules. Hopefully this review will have the owner revising those rules.\n\nAll in all, I will not go out of my way to go to Sammy's. I know of many other great sports bars (dives and nice pubs) who seem far more appreciative when I spend my money. \n\nHopefully the owner will extinguish his cigar before walking through his pub. And hopefully he will revise his policy of giving a designated driver a free soda for being responsible and driving drinking friends around the valley."

This was my third time to this location, and once again I was not impressed.  This is the third time in a row that they have messed up my order.  This was the worst.\n\nI am vegetarian, so I typically order my Mexican pizza with rice instead of beef.  I do not have problems at any other location, so I figured I would order it on this visit.  \n\nWas charged an extra .60 for the "rice", got my stuff, and headed home.  I was starving by this point due to working all day.  I ate my pintos and beans, and proceeded to dig in to my pizza.  I ate one of the little triangles, and realized that something didn\'t taste right.  I looked closer only to discover there was rice ON TOP OF the beef!! I almost threw up my dinner on the spot!\n\nFuming, I immediately grabbed my receipt and called the store.  I asked the lady on the phone (who doesn\'t speak English) for the manager.  After trying to explain three times who I was asking for, she put me on hold.  \n\nAround five minutes later, a lady got on the phone.  She didn\'t speak English either, and had nothing to say after I explained my situation.  I told her she needs to talk with her employees about paying attention to order\'s because some of us don\'t eat meat.  I also got into the disgusting details about what happens when we do eat it.\n\nNeedless to say, nothing was done, and I\'m sure my complaint fell on deaf ears, but I at lest got to voice my concerns.

It seems that the afternoon/evening shift is the best time to go but still, it's hit and miss for me. They often forget my sauce packets, the 7 layer burrito is more often than not 2 layers of just guac and sour cream with a tiny bit of beans, the bean burritos almost never have cheese. It is very close to where I live so I have gone multiple times and will probably go again many times but it's not my favorite Taco Bell."

S'We were killing time before an event started. We were hungry. Once we spotted the Sett we knew exactly how we would fill our time gap.  \n\nThe Sett is laid back,  no one really cares what anyone else is doing. You order and pick up at the counters. The burgers are pretty good and they come with fries. I think the flavored fires are an upcharge of about $0.50. Not the fastest food in the world, but that is what happens when food is not precooked and sitting under heat lamps. Small but quality craft beer list, including 3 Floyds.'

S"This is the only eating establishment within walking distance of my shop.  This is probably the first time I have been in there in maybe a dozen years.  It hasn't changed much.  The first owners tried opening Saturdays and a group of us would gather almost every week for breakfast, then it got hot in the summer and they closed Saturdays until fall and then opened Saturdays again and just about the time they built back a regular Saturday crowd it was summer again, they closed and we moved to Cocos (now bulldozed at Maryvale and Indian School.).  They are on the fourth or fifth owners now and I have had a few lunches picked up for me over the years.  Ironically two of the guys I used to go to breakfast with were there eating lunch with their parents today.\n\nWhen I first moved here in 93 an Italian pizza/pasta place had recently gone out of business at this location and the suite was vacant until the Corporate Cafe opened, IIRC, the fall of 94.\n\nThe menu is sort of eclectic with some American standards, a few Middle Eastern and a few Mexican.  Each owner seems to have added a few things to the menu and it is now about twice as many items as were on the original menu.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch and everything on the menu is available any time.  The food is ok but not great.  It is priced right for what it is.  This time I had a mushroom swiss burger ($5.75) that came with my choice of salad, fries, cole slaw, soup or potato salad and an iced tea ($1.75).  I got the salad and it is iceburg lettuce with a couple small pieces of tomato and cucumber.  The hamburger came dry with a packet of mayo and ketchup on the table.  The lettuce, tomato, sliced onions and pickles are on the side. For my taste the meat was too well done but still a bit juicy, I get the impression that is the way it would come even if I had specified something else.\n\nThe main customers are people who work in the area and quite often sales people take local clients there.  It's an industrial type place that fits pretty well in this older industrial area.  It is clean and the colors are pleasant.  Like this whole area of town it isn't as busy as it was a few years ago."

S"I LOVE Papa Johns so it really sucks that this is the papa john's that delivers to me. In my 2yrs of living here papa john's has yet to ever deliver my order 100% correct. They always forget something, have the wrong toppings on the pizza, or just bring the wrong order all together. I don't know why I even bother but it's really the only delivery place in my area. Now, I even ask to speak to the manager when I order to ask him to personally check the pizza before it leaves and it still ends up being wrong. Several times I have been charged incorrectly as well. I am in the restaurant business so I can't understand why this place has such a hard time getting it together. It surprises me they are still in business but I'm sure it's because papa john's (as a chain) has such a good rep. This specific store puts the name to shame. If I didn't already have a good job or I had some extra time on my hands I would go apply for a GM position there just to whip that place it to shape. I'm so annoyed by it! Lol\nOn a good note- the staff and management are very friendly. In my opinion this store most likely lacks thorough training and strong leadership.

S"I initially posted this under the Sundance Cinemas - but no, I'm talking about the restaurant that is on the floors above the movie theater.\n\nI had a nice evening dinner at this place. Although the view from the rooftop is pretty limited,  loved the very airy+snobbish atmosphere. If you're yuppie hater, this might not be the place to be, but it's not that heavily sophisticated. I mean, it's still down to earth, and I didn't feel awkward with my very casual outfit. It's a very nice spot for a date.\n\nMy friend and I ordered sweet potato fries, mojito for me and 7on7 for him.  For entree, I had grilled salmon on top of green salad ($12.50, and he had open faced crab-melt $11.50). My mojito was pretty good. Just the right amount of mint leaf, but not over whelming. Food was pretty decent, too. I just loved spending relaxing Sunday night in the warm air.  \n\nA caveat is that if you run into a pre- or post movie rush, the service can be very slow. It didn't bother me so much since I was chatting away with my friend, but if your friend is not the conversational type, you might struggle to fill the void time."

S'Amazed this has no reviews on here already as it\'s been open for business for as long as I\'ve been aware that Indian food exists I reckon. That said, for such a centrally located restaurant, my visit here a couple of months ago was the first time I\'ve ever been in, although I did make a point of sending colleagues there earlier in the year and they liked it.\n\n\n There\'s nothing major about the place to set it aside from much of the competition - prices are what you\'d expect (reasonable and not astronomical), service was efficient and good natured and the waiting time between ordering and the food making it onto the table was negligible. The staff were though more than happy to make us "the hottest thing going" when asked and so we ended up all giving our tastebuds a roasting with a very hot, though not unpleasant, dish which we may have christened "Satan\'s Ashes" although my memory\'s hazy on that point. The rest of the normally spiced dishes were very tasty and the wine list was of a decent size and price, considering most folk probably opt for lager anyway.'

S'Neulich war ich das erste mal im La Dolce Vita.\n\n\n Die R\xc3\xa4umlichkeiten fand ich sehr ansprechend- abgesehen von der traumhaft romantischen Lage des Restaurants in Durlach am Saumarkt. Es ist gem\xc3\xbctlich eingerichtet, wenn auch etwas dunkel - f\xc3\xbcr den Winter genau richtig. Im Sommer kann man wohl auch drau\xc3\x9fen sitzen, was ich mir sehr sch\xc3\xb6n vorstelle.\n\n\n Die Bedienung war freundlich, aber etwas unsicher bis hilflos in manchen Dingen- es war aber auch sehr viel los. Insgesamt war ich mit dem Service aber zufrieden.\n\n\n Ich entschied mich f\xc3\xbcr zwei Speisen der aktuellen "Weihnachtskarte". Leider war hier nicht ganz klar, ob die Linsensuppe mit Zander als Vor- oder Hauptspeisenportion gedacht war. Auf Anfrage hie\xc3\x9ft es: Hauptspeise. Jedoch wurde mir angeboten, die Suppe als Vorspeise zu servieren- wof\xc3\xbcr ich mich auch entschied. Eine gute Wahl, wie sich sp\xc3\xa4ter herausstellte. Ich musste recht lange auf die Vorspeise warten, daf\xc3\xbcr war der Zander frisch angebraten und diese ungew\xc3\xb6hnliche Kombination schmeckte vorz\xc3\xbcglich! Ein wirklich sehr positive \xc3\x9cberraschung. F\xc3\xbcr diese Vorspeisenportion der Suppe, die aber recht \xc3\xbcppig war, wurde sp\xc3\xa4ter der volle Preis kassiert. Ich sah dar\xc3\xbcber hinweg. \nDie Hauptspeise hingegen hatte den \xc3\x9cberraschungseffekt eher in entgegengesetzter Richtung: ich bestellte Lammkottelets, die selbst in Ordnung aber nicht spektakul\xc3\xa4r waren. (Ja, ich war verw\xc3\xb6hnt von der Vorspeise). Spektakul\xc3\xa4r waren jedoch die zum Lamm servierten Spaghetti, die auf der Karte lediglich als "Pasta" angepriesen waren. Diese waren derart scharf, dass sie in meinen Augen ungenie\xc3\x9fbar waren. Schade, aber ich war ja schon fast satt von der leckeren Vorspeise. Die Beschwerde (dies wenigstens auf die Karte zu schreiben) wurde vom Service mit schulterzucken fast ignoriert. Die Pasta meiner Begleitung war hervorragend. Vom Vorspeisenteller h\xc3\xa4tte ich mir etwas mehr versprochen.\n\n\n Insgesamt denke ich bekommt man hier gute Essensqualit\xc3\xa4t zum angemessenen Preis. Ich k\xc3\xb6nnte mir vorstellen, dass Gerichte der Hauptkarte (oder Mittagstisch) solide udn frisch gekocht und ohne Firlefanz sind. Die Pizza sah sehr gut aus. Gerichte von Sonderkarten lassen wohl \xc3\x9cberraschungen offen- in beider Richtung.\n\n\n Das Personal war ober der F\xc3\xbclle wohl etwas \xc3\xbcberfordert. Dies ist nochmals zu testen.\n\n\n Das Ambiente ist angenehm.\n\n\n Ich werd\'s wohl nochmal ausprobieren. Vielleicht im Sommer?'

How authentic? I saw the cook taking apart an entire pig.\n\nThe steamed dumplings are delicious little pasta pockets of soup and hearty to. A plate of 5 dumplings will stuff you like a thanksgiving turkey. The rest of the whitey-Chinese food is also awesome even though not authentic. Shanghai noodles are a meal and a half, as with every other meal. The crispy beef isn't a huge nugget of breading with a tiny bit of meat, you can see the meat through the breading and they are fresh and tasty. I've been there more than a few times and never regret my meal. \n\nThe restaurant looks spartan; decoration is not urgency here. Just tables, a giant screen TV playing Chinese television. Both menus are flavour explosions, service is OK, delivery is speedy. Local Chinese take-out acquisition complete."

S'This location is closest to my house so we go, but every time they get our order wrong! This am hubby went and ordered me the mcmuffins that are on special without sausage as always, and the woman would not give it to him for the deal. Excuse me - same sandwich minus the sausage! It\'s actually saving them money. So instead the woman decides to put egg and cheese mcmuffins instead which comes with ham. That is NOT what I ordered!!!! If I wanted meat on my sandwich I would have ordered it that way but I\'m a vegetarian meaning I DO NOT EAT MEAT! So in good nature I removed the ham from my sandwich but could still taste the yuck flavor of the meat, and thinking to myself what has customer service come to?! I thought they\'re slogan was make it your way at least one time or another.  They also originally forgot my oatmeal and my hubby\'s sandwich too. Not to mention when ordering through the drive thru after ordering 1 thing they say,"Is that it?" No I still have 10 more things to order and after each item I order they say that. Really?! Shouldn\'t they say something along the lines of"is there anything else I can make for you/get for you?" The way the say it makes me and I\'m sure others feel as we are inconveniencing them to do their job they get paid to do. So what exactly are you paying then for?! Poor customer service, loosing profits  because of incorrect orders irate customers that won\'t return and I could go on. If this is what they get paid to do then each of them should get a raise!!!'

S"Smell, No Taste is a Liberian-owned restaurant that has been serving up traditional West African fare in NoDa for over two years, and has built quite a reputation among Charlotte's African community.\nSmell, No Taste offers goat soup: rich, garlicky, with an ethereal heat that you can literally feel moving down your esophagus, burning the impurities out of your body. Chunks of meat, some with untrimmed fat, float in the liquid. Don't discriminate; put the entire piece in your mouth and chew, and wonder at the tenderness of even the gristle.\nDon't be alarmed if, like my companion, your eyes start to run or sweat beads up on your forehead while sampling the soup. That's supposed to happen. Smell, No Taste is typical of West Africa in that the food is hot, but it's not the top note furnace blast you'd expect from, say, Mexican or Indian food. There is the initial sear, but the real magic is in the slow burn. The heat builds and builds the longer you eat, leaving some tasters feeling rather like the lobster who doesn't notice until too late that, hey, isn't the water getting a little warm?\nIf things get too heated, for God's sake don't drink water--your head may explode. Instead, opt for something sweet, like soda, to gently counteract the crackling flame. \nSmell, No Taste serves their goat soup with the traditional ball of fufu, a 2-pound (I jest, but you're not gonna be hungry for a while) wad of cassava yam that has been pounded into a dough-like consistency. Pinch off a bit with your fingers and dip it into the soup, sucking the sticky substance off with relish. \n\nThere are other traditional offerings such as egusi soup and okra stew (delicious!!), and the cook, Musu, is a beautifully kind lady who will come out to the table, explain things (her English is limited but the man at the cash register is fluent) and try to tone the spices down or up to your preferences.\n Prices are right in the $10 range, so feel free to range away from the goat in search of more flavors."

It isn't that far a drive from work for me and I was in the mood for a real submarine.

All for $6.05 plus tax.  \n\nTaking the sub to go, I drove to a local park.  Sitting in the shade of the picnic area, I opened up the white paper wrapper and took in the Super Sub vista.  It looked so good and tasted even better.  \n\nIt was so good, that later in the week I went back and ate another Super Sub just to check if they made them tasty every time.

Not even the swanky bar/lounge/bowling alley in the heart of downtown Chicago by the Magnificent Mile charges as much for the same amount of time we went bowling. And this is the outskirts of Madison, Wisconsin. \n\nThe price per game is not clearly marked at all, unless you go on the website. Unfortunately, we walked in off the street...odds are if you're reading this and on the internet in general, you won't make our mistake. I mean, caveat emptor...but I am pissed. The guy at the counter didn't even bat an eye at our incredulity, it seems like this happens ALL the time. \n\nAs to the bowling alley itself, drinks are decently priced for Madison. The equipment is not particularly modern, but you're not bowling with rigs from the fifties. The selection of bowling balls is bad. The finger holes are all super tiny, and I have long, slim fingers, so it's not like I have particularly large fingers. The alley was also not super crowded, so there should have been more adult-sized balls available. The alley was fairly clean.\n\nI'll never come back here.

I have been in search for the best burger in Charlotte (a perfect 10 burger is an In \'n\' Out Double Double) and figured I\'d try Topz.  Granted I can\'t expect Topz to compare to In \'n\' Out and I liked the option of a "healthier" burger.\n\nI did get the all angus burger on a healthy wheat bun, but felt the burger was average overall.  Nothing overly flavorful or juice about it.  On top of that, a side option was fries, which is imperative to have with a burger.  The fries were average too.  I noticed them taking the pre-cut fries out of a manufacturer\'s bag.  Sigh.\n\nOverall, my impression of Topz was average.  I\'m disappointed because I thought it would be a great alternative by having a "healthier" burger, but I think when you get a burger, you have to throw health out the window.

S'BEWARE AND STAY AWAY!!! HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT AND RELATIONS!!!!\n\nToday, I decided to ignore reviews and give them yet another try. Disappointed like I was 6 months ago, but I was hungry. \n\nI ordered a Greek pizza since Niki\'s pizza shop was closed. It came with gyro meat, tomatoes, onions, provolone and feta. I asked for no gyro meat since I\'m vegetarian. The guy on the phone said "no problem". I asked if I could get extra vegetables in place of the meat since they would still charge me for meat anyway and he said "no problem, I\'ll make it good for you."\n\n55 minutes later (when I live 1/4 mile away), the driver calls and says he can\'t find my place. I said it\'s it\'s 4 blocks from you. So I I flagged him down and accepted the order and I tipped $25 on a $22 bill. I got inside the house and opened it, it smelled great, looked overly cheesy and heavy with none of the extra vegetables I was anticipating. \n\nI call the guy on the phone and he says I gave you extra olives and feta. I said "I didn\'t want extra olives or extra feta since neither of those are vegetables."  He said "i gave you extra tomatoes" and I said "that\'s a fruit and I wanted extra vegetables."  He argued continuously with me instead of asking how he could fix it, his response was to talk over me and tell me he gave me extra feta. I told him to pick it up and give me my money back. He refused and hung up on me. \n\nNever again! Read the reviews and take your fellow yelpers advice.  Stay away for the simple fact that your money should go to people who make food the way you ask.'

Because I was among the youngest patrons yesterday, and I'm pushing 40. \n\nI met a new colleague here for a business lunch because he had just moved very close to Arrowhead. This location is right around the corner from the Mervyn's, with Macy's on the other side. It was mall food, not some awesome back-east deli. I had a roast beef. It had a decent amount of meat (but nowhere near the pic on their website), mayo, lettuce, tomato. I could have made this at home with better tasting unprocessed beef from Midwestern Meats. No option to toast the bread? I personally hate sandwiches on untoasted bread. The fries were nothing special. The wrapped cake slices were so smashed they were completely unappealing. How long have they been sitting there? The man behind the counter of the baked goods sub-section was rude and weird, but all the other staffers were pleasant. Last but not least, I felt the price was way too high. Almost $12 for a meh sandwich, fries, and a large drink? With no table service? No thanks, Miracle Mile."

S'I really wanted to like this place. I had heard some good things about it, but I was disappointed, although I can\'t speak for the food b/c I walked out. Arrived on a Friday afternoon, around 5pm for an early dinner with my kids. We stood near the hostess stand and stood there and stood there. NO one appeared to be working there. After about 5 minutes the bartender walked from behind the bar and saw me, she looked at me, but didn\'t say anything or ever acknowledge me. She got some drinks for someone....looked at me again...ignored me. Didn\'t say a word, no gesture, nothing. She went back behind the bar, so I walked over there and asked if I was supposed to seat myself. In a tone, that appeared that I was bothering her she said "yes, but we\'re really busy". Actually they weren\'t, but considering she was the only employee I saw downstairs, they were understaffed. There were only 4 tables occupied in the restaurant area and the bar still had open tables. I left b/c clearly they were not staffed to serve dinner and serve the Friday happy hour in the bar. So, I don\'t blame the staff, I blame the people who run the place. Even if they had been busy, for the bartender to ignore me after looking right at me twice just rubbed me the wrong way, even if we were supposed to seat ourselves why wouldn\'t she say that, like every other restaurant that has self-seating.'

S'Leung Yue Hot Pot on King is my "go-to" Chinese Hot Pot place in Kitchener.  The restaurant is located in the same location as the now defunct Castle on King Restaurant.\n\nFor those who don\'t know what Hot Pot is, from Wikipedia: it consists "of a simmering metal pot of stock at the center of the dining table. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leafy vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, dumplings, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce. In many areas, hot pot meals are often eaten in the winter."\n\nWhen we go for Hot Pot at Leung Yue, we always go for the All-You-Can-Eat option, so that we can get more of our favourite items.  The staff has always been friendly with us, and has always been helpful.  We love the great ingredients for the Hot Pot, including beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, among many others, which are freshly prepared.\n\nAs another reviewer also pointed out, because of the large amount of food, Hot Pot is best experienced with a large group of people.  If you are open to new dining experiences and have never tried it, I heartily recommend it... it\'s a lot of fun!'

This place is about as stingy as it gets.\n\nI got a normal 12" and I swear even the bread looked shorter.  They put my 4 pieces of meat and a little cheese down and handed the sandwich off.  I asked for spinach, she put 3 pieces, I said a little more please, she gave me 1 leaf, I said, more please, and she looked at me with some scared eyes and gave me one more leaf.  I think she was afraid of being fired for putting more than 5 leaves of spinach on the sandwich.  Same thing with tomatoes.  Finally I just said screw it, its not worth begging for veggies.  Told them to put it in the bag, I paid, I left, I will never be back.\n\nThere is another sandwich store a couple doors down, do yourself a favor and just go there.

S'I did not know Rebel\'s Pizza and their great-value large pizzas went out of business. I\'m going to miss the grandpa that stood outside that promoted Rebel\'s Pizza.  He looked exactly like the UNLV rebels mascot with his white mustache and cowboy hat on.\n\nFortunately, the new owners who repositioned the business and retitled it as "Whazzup Pizza" are friendly and excited to get their name out there.  It is a family owned business: Cindy is from New York and the main owner is from Sicily, so they both come from the roots of great pizza.\n\nWhen I heard it was $3.99 for a large pizza I laughed.  I thought the owners were delusional because that\'s way too cheap.  However, I learned that each topping costs $1.00, so it kind of evens out. Okay, not bad. Smart marketing if you ask me. I didn\'t feel cheated because I only ended up paying about 8 bucks for a large pepperoni/sausage and a drink.\n\nAs for the pizza, it\'s pretty good.  I did not like how the bottom tasted doughy, I always think it should be a perfect light brown hue.  However, they were generous with the toppings so it wasn\'t too much of a problem. I\'m gonna make sure to ask them to cook the bottom more next time.\n\nOther than that, what can I say? It\'s perfect for a broke college kid like me.  They have a ton of specials like two slices of cheese and a drink for $3.99, pizza and wings, and a great sub menu.  They are just starting out, so I\'m sure they\'ll have time to perfect their pizza and interior in the future. Oh yeah, the interior.  It\'s pretty bland and cheesy but charming in a way. It\'s like they had no idea how to decorate a pizza restaurant. There are teddy bears and those kitchen art decorations you can find at Ross for like, $10 or something.  Plus there\'s a couch and a coffee table because..I don\'t know. It\'s not bad, but kind of funny in a good way :)\n\nI love pizza so I\'ll probably check them out again in the future. If they bring the old grandpa back, I\'ll definitely come again.'

S'The boyfriend, friends, and I went here this past weekend. We were looking for a good breakfast, with good service... and barely achieved either.\n\nI\'ll just describe my omelet, as there were 6 of us, so that would take quite a bit of time.\n\nI ordered an omelet with lobster and cheese, avocado on the side. The "lobster" was pretty tasty.. (quotations because i\'m not sure how real it was.. i\'m guessing it was the cheap precooked kind) ..the omelet was terribly dry and overcooked, but the massive amount of cheese in the middle helped. I also got 1 orange juice.. why just 1? Because our waiter never came back. And it took 3 times of asking "can we get a box to go?" for him to FINALLY give us one.\n\nI suppose the plus to this place is the wide variety of choices. They really do have anything you could possibly imagine, mixed into their omelets. (They also serve pancakes and waffles)..\n\nWhen we went to go pay, the girl at the register was more than pissed off when we split the bill 3 ways. It took me no more than 22 seconds to circle, dot, and check what belonged to whom. And the whole time, she was sighing, and rolling her eyes. Yikes.\n\nI will admit, only 1 person from our group of 5 left our waiter a tip. Sorry. Not so much though.. he was an awfully inattentive server.\n\nThe pumpkin bread was good, but microwaved...trying to mimic "fresh baked" hotness. Well, if you\'ve ever microwaved anything before and then let it cool, you know it gets rubbery and hard as a rock, right? Bingo.\n\nIf you want cheap-close-to-dennys-but-not-dennys style food, enjoy yourself here. just don\'t assume to be treated like a customer, more like a bother.'

S'"Filthy" isn\'t a strong enough term. Try "infested."  NEVER, EVER AGAIN. No matter how much I adore Bell\'s Sicilian pizza (which I typically order to carry out), the filth of the place is overwhelming. Took my mother into the dining room Friday evening. We were promptly seated (table nearest the kitchen and the wait station, constant employee traffic) and given beverages and menus via the hostess, who promised our waitress would take care of us soon. For the next 20 minutes, no employee acknowledged our existence, although we quickly placed our closed menus at the edge of the table to signal our readiness to order. As the minutes ticked away, I tried not to look at the foul carpeting, which appears to have been last cleaned approximately never. A cook emerged from the kitchen and quite literally shouted over our heads to a waitress at the far end of the nearly-filled dining room because he couldn\'t read her writing. (Have these people never eaten in a restaurant themselves??) Even still, we waited... until I absently flicked at one of the dozens of dark spots on the wall above our booth. It flew away. INSECTS ALL OVER THE WALL. If that\'s how the front is maintained, what must the kitchen look like??? We reopened the menu, found beverage prices and left money on the table. There was no indication that any of the waitresses or the hostess even noticed. DISGUSTING AND INEXCUSABLE. The place needs to be shut down and fumigated. Are they afraid they\'d lose money if they closed long enough to CLEAN? Do they pay anyone to clean anything? I\'ll never go back.'

It's very moderately priced, a round with cart is only about $30 (varies by time of year and residency).  The course offers beautiful views of Camelback Mountain, downtown Phoenix, Tempe and Papago Park.  It also is usually not very crowded, though sometimes the rounds can be a little slow (which can happen even at higher priced clubs).

I\'ve been here and poured salsa over my nacho chips and just taken the burrito home to have for dinner. The salsas - yes, more than one - are excellent. Flavorful and tasty and yummy.\n\nThis is a nice little Moe\'s in Ayrsley. Expect the "Welcome to Moe\'s" and the magnificent salsa bar. The staff are super friendly and super fast!

Yet another restaurant that can't cater for large groups. \n\nThe food wasn't really my bag. I didn't want the cook it yourself option (not a fan of handling raw meat at my dinner table) so I opted for a ready made beef soy sauce curry and fried rice. The rice came 10 mins before the main event unfortunately which I nibbled on to stave off my hunger, and once the beef arrived I found it bland and tasteless. Watery, lots of veg but hardly any beef. The pork dumplings I shared with Tanja were nice and flavoursome though. Probably the only thing I liked. \n\nThe atmosphere was lacking a bit in my opinion, too bright and not somewhere I'll choose to go back to.

Sitting eating something badly cooked, mumbling 'it's fine, thanks' when asked, and then coming on here to moan is less than ideal, I know...\n\nBut anyway, here I am. I really had high hopes for The Saint. It had been recommended by a friend, the web site and menu looked lovely, and the restaurant itself is attractive - dark wood, candles, and an open fire. When Jason suggested we go there, I was excited.\n\nThe menu is limited at lunchtime to soup, omelettes, eggs benedict and a couple of open sandwiches. You'd think that would make it easy to get things right. But my mushroom and blue cheese omelette was a masterclass in how not to do it. It was overcooked to the point where the outside was blackened, there was barely any cheese or mushroom, and it came with a pile of dry rocket leaves that were probably fresh last Tuesday. \n\nBeing me, I chewed my way through it, paid, and then whinged once we got outside - and bought a cheese roll in Kay's bar when we stopped in for a pint on the way home."

S"Sandstone Cafe is a bit off the beaten path.  It sits right next to a Fry's on the Southeastern corner of Ray and McClintock, tucked away on the side in a strip mall.  We recently purchased a $1 Groupon for a $15 lunch through a promotion that they involved themselves in.\n\nI'd love to tell you that the food was amazing and that the service was perfect, but I can't.  The reason?  They were closed on the one day that they were participating in the Groupon promotion that only lasted for Friday, from 11am to 6pm.  My wife and I went there for lunch near 1:30 and noticed that their parking lot was completely empty.  When we pulled up to the door there was a sign stating that they were closed until 3pm.  What kind of restaurant runs a promotion for lunch and then is _closed_ during it?  I feel like the people running the place have cheated their potential customers out of the chance to try their restaurant.  \n\nBottom line?  I won't be returning to try their food, even if it's close to my job, because I feel that honesty and integrity are necessary components to running a good business, and I don't want even my mere $1 to contribute to an establishment that runs without them.  If I could give them zero stars, I would.  I cannot recommend that you stay away from this place enough."

S'I\'m sorry but this is the worst Thai  food I have eaten in 10 years. Living in Los Angeles, you get a chance to try all sorts of thai food, from the authentic to the \'americanized\' versions.\n\nEven the review that is posted on the wall in the restaurant says at the bottom "nothing really great". The small portions are a direct relation to the reason the prices are low. It\'s like ordering kiddie meals.\n\nThe reason they even get one star is because the owner is very friendly, but she needs to know that her brother cannot cook and he needs to find another gig. \n\nI ordered the Penang curry and spring rolls to go. The rice paper of the spring rolls was not closed correctly and it came apart as I was picking it up (see photo). The Penang was tasteless and watery. all the four small bite sized chicken pieces were bland and felt like they were thrown in there at the very end.\n\nI cannot fathom how people can give this restaurant anything more than a 1 star. I know the owner is nice, but this is a restaurant, and quality of food is what i\'m rating.'

She finally called a female latina supervisor over who had little more grasp of English and said she could give me a senior discount which would make it less than the price of the BOGO jalapeno thickburger they charged me for.

Good place to try and emulate. That said, the beef sandwich was very good size, the hot peppers and sweet peppers were very tasty and the flavor was great. y only complain was that the beef was a bit tough.... If you ever ate a Portillos Italian beef, you would know that the beef should just fall apart and be very juicy... Seemed to me that maybe the beef didn't quite cool long enough....

S"Skibo Cafe is run by Carnegie Mellon Dining Services, and it's not really worth going to unless you're a freshman stuck on the meal plan.\n\nThe basic problems with Skibo (like many CMU dining locations) are that they have a reasonably small set of ingredients, and that they cook with tons of grease.  Despite what appears to be a fairly varied menu, all of the sandwiches, subs, paninis, and so on are pretty similar (just in different shapes), and greasy.\n\nThe few reasonable items on their menu include the salads (the chicken and artichoke one is pretty good), the desserts (they're from Gullifty's, which manages Skibo and the Underground), and the frozen yogurt (which makes good shakes, but is cheaper by itself).\n\nHaving been stuck on the CMU meal plan for freshman year, I found the baked penne with basil sauce reasonable (although it is far from healthy), and ended up succumbing to the frozen yogurt far too often than I should have.  However, if you're not stuck on the meal plan, walk the couple blocks to Craig St., where you can find *much* better food for less money."

Two of us ordered their 10 oz. filets which were fork tender and came in a delicious dark colored peppercorn sauce accompanied by asparagus and potatoes/or carrots.  We all had a dinner salad which was plentiful and very tasty.  The balsamic dressing was delightful.  One of our friends ordered the blackened salmon and the other ordered the ribeye steak.  They were both very pleased with the food and the way it was prepared.  We did not get dessert.   We have already discussed going back soon.  We were very pleasantly surprised.

So on my break, I took the short walk over and ordered the meal that included 3 tenders and fries.\n\nThe breading on the chicken tenders is tasty, a little bit sweet. But it's not as crunchy as I would like. The chicken though is super moist and tender. It also comes with a huge basket of fries, the type made from freshly cut potatoes with the skin still on. Their special sauce (dare I say?) reminds me of Raising Canes' sauce: nice and peppery.\n\nOverall, this is a solid place to turn to at the food court when you're looking for freshly fried chicken tenders.

A wee place tucked in between Foodies and Tescos near Holyrood Park, it serves up packed wraps and salads at amazingly lower prices - and after only one salad, I know I'll be back.\n\nIt was the Weeping Tiger wrap that I came here for, but my evening meal plans scuppered that. I'm going out for a bucket of meat* later that night, so a wrap packed full of pulled pork did not sound sensible. I opted, instead, for the Roasted Veg Salad with Pesto. It was a nice wee box of fresh salad and quite a few bits of roasted aubergine, pepper and onion in a delicious pesto dressing.\n\nThe Weeping Tiger wrap is where it's at though. Joe A kindly let me have a bite, and good LORD. It was almost the same price as the salad (\xc2\xa32.95 vs \xc2\xa33.50) but lawdy lawdy. That was some amazing, tender pulled pork and the sauce it came in - sweet, spicy. It's only on Tuesdays and Fridays, and apparently they fly out the door. I love it when a place that does simple things (sandwich, salad and lunch options) becomes famous for one thing - and I can see The Weeping Tiger wrap becoming Let Me Eat's signature dish.\n\nI will come back on a night when I'm not eating a bucket of meat in order to have the Weeping Tiger wrap - and soon! 4 stars from what I tasted, the friendly staff, and how efficient and quick they were even on a sunny, Friday afternoon rush-hour.\n\n\n*Shebeen, they do actually do buckets of meat."

They also offer dinner roll\'s but we always say "nothing but cornbread" as we love to crumble the hot fresh cornbread up in our pintos as well as the collard greens. We also like the idea that they have soft butter on the tables so it spreads easily and melts quickly in the cornbread which is also a great treat. The collard greens are fresh and cooked to perfection. I like mine with a little vinegar as well. Hope others will go and try this as well as other items.

S'I\'ve been in MTL for a while and I\'d heard about Bar-B barn for awhile. I decided to take my Van visitors there got a late dinner after picking them up at YUL. We ordered the whole hawg, and the half chicken and fries to split. They charge 4$ for sharing which I\'m not a huge fan of. The portions were huge but very tasty. If you like "traditional" BBQ this probably won\'t be your cup of tea. The ribs are parboiled and have a sweet sticky sauce. I happen to be a fan of this method so I was happy to chow down on the ribs. The chicken was delicious as well plump, juicy, well seasoned! Yes the decor probably hasn\'t changed since it opened but I\'m a fan of retro so I was a happy camper. We had so much food we had to take some home. Just a good the next day.'

You didn't want to venture to the doors because of the bums that hung around outside begging for food or money. \n\nBut today as I am sitting here I can honestly say WOW they did an amazing job on the remodel. They even took away the outdoor section where the bums used to be. The manager is walking around asking how everyone is and that's a great thing! Give this McDonald's another shot guys!"

The breads are baked fresh in the morning so you'd want to go in on the earlier side to get the best selection (raspberry scones are really nice). The pizza oven is fired up around 11am; tried the duke and it had a lovely thin crust. Definitely worth a return trip, or two or three."

Lots of blue hairs the other day (tis the season).\n\nWent with my friend for lunch...got the rib/brisket basket combo.  I think that's what I'll be getting from now on.  I got the beans again which were okay -- with the amount of BBQ though I could do without the sides really.\n\nI think Ruggs will be outgrowing their place quickly -- that's my only current 'complaint' is that during busy times it isn't conducive really to large crowds.\n\nPerhaps during lunch they can reserve the front 2 parking spots, cone them off, and set up tables out there -- maybe a bit hot during the summer...but would have provided more seats.\n\nKeep up the good food Ruggs!"

Granted, the address was in a different Jimmy Johns\' radius; however, because our location was "so far outside of their delivery radius" (exactly one mile away from their store), the CSR wanted 5 dollars guaranteed gratuity. When I laughed, because I obviously thought he was joking about charging as much as a sub to go one single mile, he said, "well I hope you have a good night" and hung up.\n\nNormally, I love the staff of Jimmy John\'s.

I got the Ham and Cheese and she ordered the Turkey Breast.  I LOVED this sandwich, the bread they use is very tasty - perfect crunch after being heated.  Ham/Cheese and all he fixins were perfect in my book.  I will go back and try the pizza by the slice.  I also like their fries - seasoned steak fries. \n\nThis location is in a very small and old strip mall next to a dollar store.  Inside is very clean and staff is friendly.

S"This place is a dive, a dump, in a shady strip mall off an industrial part of West Grand Avenue, on the west side of the Valley of the Sun. But it has excellent Pho!\n\nIt is only fitting that my 900th review on Yelp! is a review of a Vietnamese Pho Restaurant. This is the 77th DIFFERENT Pho restaurant I have eaten Pho noodles in over the past 2.5 years on Yelp. That's about 31 new Pho restaurants a year I have been averaging. More than one new Pho Restaurant  every other week! \nTroi Oi!\n\nAlso, over 20%, or 1 out of every 5 of my reviews are for places that have never been reviewed on Yelp before. FTRs as seasoned Yelpers would call it. So suffice it to say, I don't mind venturing out and trying new places. And once in awhile, I find a little gem. \n\nPho Old Saigon, like I said, is a classic Viet dive. Grungy strip mall, simple tables and chairs, no fancy decor, and gruff service. \n\nBut when I ordered my current favorite beef noodle combination, Pho Tai Nam (rare and brisket of beef), a large bowl for only $5.95 (small is only $5.50), I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe bowl was placed in front of me, and I could smell the deep, rich aroma of Star Anise in the broth! This is the essential smell (and flavor) of Pho! And the broth wasn't too muddy, so I knew that the broth was cooked with the flavor coaxed out of the beef bones and ox tails to create the rich aroma with plenty of Star Anise adde. It was heavenly to inhale!\n\nThe beef was decent cuts of meat, and the Nam was tasty. They gave me a full plate of condiments, and something I rarely see outside of only a few places in the Little Saigons in Westminster and San Jose:\n\nNgo Gai!\n\nNgo Gai is the long, green, saw-toothed basil like veggie to add with the 2 stems of basil leaves they gave me to veggie up my noodle soup. Plenty of bean sprouts, green chilis slices, and a large wedge of lime were available, too!\nPerfect!\n\nI took a small condiment dish, filled it half with Sriracha and half with Hoi Sin sauce, and was ready to go!\n\nI tasted the broth first, all by itself, nothing floating in the soup, no added condiments yet, no sauces. Just beef broth! This is how I taste the the quality of the broth before I eat. \n\nMmmmm. It was the best broth I have tasted in a Pho soup in many months! It equaled in flavor to the best places out of the 77 places I have eaten Pho. \n\nI sat down and watched the SBTN (Saigon Broadcast Television Network) that was playing on the TV, and started slurping! Dipped my meat into my half/half sauce, ate it, then chased it with a good slurp of noodles and broth. It was good stuff! \n\nThat bowl of Pho filled my tummy from lunch time to well into the late evening, too!\n\nI had a Vietnamese Coffee with condensed milk to go with it. \n\nThe place was nearly empty, only a gathering group of Vietnamese local men converging into the early afternoon to talk and eat. \n\nThis is the best Pho broth I have tasted in the Valley, and in many other areas up and down the coast. \n\nThe place isn't for everyone. It is hard to understand the staff, the place is dumpy, and it isn't in the greatest neighborhood. But if you don't mind a good Dive Diner atmosphere with excellent Pho broth and bargain prices, come here, breath in the broth, sip it, then start slurping!"

Considering I am more man than just two bites, this place needs to step it up. They do give you chips to enjoy along with your burrito. However, I would rather have had a second burrito without the extra cost. At least with places like Chipotle, I feel as if I am partially full and not just running on empty.\n\nOverall, the burrito was small, the taste was fine. If you want to get a great burrito sometime, head over to one of the many hundreds of other good Mexican restaurants and leave this one to rot away."

It is so good and worth the price.\n\nThe menu changes day to day, but there are some things that are always on the menu.  Each day there is a special meal, too.  Everything I've had has been really good - the cheeseburgers, the steak and egg sandwich, the egg and polish, and the barbecue chicken sandwich.  It's cheap and it's really good - consistently.  The fish sandwich is the king, but it's all good.  (Not a place for vegetarians, though.)\n\nThe service is always friendly and pretty quick.  \n\nThey only take cash, which can be inconvenient, but it's worth running to the union to get some cash for these sandwiches.  And you don't need much because it is so cheap.\n\nThey now have donuts, too, from the donut stand at Springfield and first.  \n\nOh, the years I wasted walking past this place and not ordering.. don't make my mistake!"

S'Our group of 4 wandered in on a Friday night, in an attempt to support local businesses near our house that we haven\'t tried yet.  It\'s a small place, with a handful of tables and booths, but we were seated right away.  Mason, the resident teenager, was quick to get us drinks but was unable to tell me what white wine they had available nor did he offer to check.  Oh well, I\'d already had almost a bottle at happy hour anyway.  \n\nThe 2 men of our group decided to share the meatball and pepperoni pizza, and immediately described it as "a fantastic voyage".  The meatballs were flattened like pepperoni, and flavorful.  I started with the greek salad, which was great but had iceberg lettuce rather than a darker variety.  I had half a Sicilian too (ya know, for weekend leftovers), which was thick and bread like.  Another one of us ordered the penne with marinara, which looked good with a side of garlic bread.\n\nService was great - Sara, our waitress, was very friendly and told us they were a small mom and pop restaurant and they appreciate new business.  When the Penne came out before the pizza\'s, she apologized and offered us a free dessert.  When we couldn\'t decide, she offered us two......complimentary!  The cannoli was okay, but the Zeppolis were a.maz.ing.  Small balls of dough, fried, with powdered sugary goodness.  Mmmm!  \n\nThey also do delivery and takeout, and we\'ll definitely be back!'

S'Orocco Pier is one of the swankier joints in town. Actually its really a hotel, but is known as a restaurant and bar venue. \n\nLike its more humble friend down the road, The Boathouse, Orocco Pier\'s restaurant doesn\'t have the greatest vegetarian selection. It serves such appetising meals as a "roast suckling pig" (for a bargain \xc2\xa36.35). In the end I did settle for the gnocchi, which tasted nice, but was clearly geared toward people who liked to look at their food more than eat it. The restaurant tends to offer more fancy schmancy dishes like "crab linguine" or "sweet and sour duck leg" (okay maybe not fancy in China, but it is for South Queensferry). For all of these main dishes expect to pay a varied amount of somewhere between \xc2\xa37 and \xc2\xa315.\n\nThese dishes are presented a very lovely fashion. But I\'m someone that tends to like big portions if I\'m splashing out. Maybe I\'m just a glutton and need to appreciate the aesthetic of food decoration more. But for now this isn\'t really my cup of tea.\n\nI should add that like a lot of places in town, Orocco Pier does offer yet another fantastic view of the Forth and the Forth Bridges.'

I have been there early enough  to see that they do make a lot of them in the morning. \n\nIt's a takeaway sandwich bar with really fresh and tasty sandwiches. . Its Italian so don't expect complicated sauces etc, just pure fresh ingredients and good combinations of salamis, tomatoes, mozzarella salads etc. The Meadows are a stone's throw away so when the sun is out, grab your food and head there for a picnic. \n\nUnlike other yelpers I actually really like Rudi's and his sandwiches. \nIt reminds me a bit of home : the sandwiches are there and ready if you want something with a million sauces and fillings then there is a subway down the street for you. If you want small changes or some particular combination with the ingredients on offer, the guy is always happy to make it so long as it is not panic time in the shop."

S'I happened on Positano the last time my parents were here because my mom was in the mood for Italian food.  Mid-week, the four of us were the first diners  and while we were there no more than two or three other tables appeared.  Fortunately, between the four of us and our hilarious waiter, we never had the feeling you often get in an empty restaurant, and indeed were made to feel so welcome we stayed for quite a while.\n\nOur meal was excellent - we felt properly Italian in ordering and sharing loads of different dishes, eating a few bites here and there as everything arrived and not having typical "main" meals if that makes sense.  \n\nWhile the food really was wonderful and wholesome and comforting, what made Positano really shine was our waiter.  He laughed at my dad\'s ridiculous jokes, bantered with my husband, and was charming to my mom.  He even brought us extra tiramisu (on the house) when my dad raved about how good it was.  \n\nI would absolutely recommend Positano, and think that while it would be fine for a couple, it\'s best for groups so you can eat properly family style.  \n\nAt the end of it, having consumed two bottles of wine and several different dishes, the bill was so low (around \xc2\xa370 I think) that my parents had to read the bill twice to be sure we had actually been charged for everything we ate.  We had.  \n\nPositano has a lot of competition in Newington but does offer a special and affordable dining experience that can\'t be matched.'

S'I love me some Hawaiian BBQ. This L&L is my go to spot whenever I have a craving because its close to work. I usually get the teriyaki beef or chicken entree "regular" size, and ask for 2 scoops of mac salad and one scoop of rice. The regular entree comes with your choice of meat, and then 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop mac salad. They also have a "mini" size which is your choice of meat, but a smaller portion, and then one scoop rice and 1 scoop mac salad. Prices are fair, I paid around $11 for my meal and a small drink. The cashier is always friendly and the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time. I will keep coming back here.'

S"Four olds converged on Edinburgh's oldest Gastro Pub. On the pavement the sultry summer was at its sticky hottest. Inside this ancient space with its north facing windows the air was pleasantly cool. \nAssembled at their window side table the old people ordered drinks then ignored the menu while they engaged in a frantic catch-up. Eventually the waiting staff managed to secure an order. \nI had oxymoronic 'open ravioli' and thought it quite delicious. Then I chomped down on a veal chop (veal T Bone). Again, very nice. \nThe coffee with which I finished underlined a recent discovery that Scots no longer need to fly to Milan for a decent Espresso."

S"Another place in Pittsburgh that I thought I had previously reviewed but somehow missed!\n\nBraddock's Street Side Grill/Bar resides inside the Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel - a Marriott property. There is an entrance from both the street and from inside the hotel.\n\nIt's a small bar, but it's a good place to hang out, drink, and grab a bite to eat, assuming you want to eat earlier. They don't serve food here past 10:00 pm or so - which is kind of lame. Because of the nature of the downtown area in which the hotel is located, there are not a lot of residents - so most of the restaurants seem to close early. It's a damn shame too - as this place is missing out on offering more service to both hotel patrons and others in the area.\n\nI stayed at this hotel 3 years ago for 3 days. During that stay, a majorly scary bout of severe weather pounded a large area of the upper midwest, including the Pittsburgh area - with unprecedented thunderstorm activity, flooding, and Tornadoes. Many of the hotel guests gathered in the Bar to drink and watch the Weather Channel and local weather station reports coming in - there were myriad Tornado watches and warnings - some not very far from Pittsburgh.\n\nI pounded a few beers and single malt scotches during that scary period, and ate in the bar every night.\n\nThis last stay this past week - we came in to order food - and were informed that since it was after 10:00 pm - no food was available. I'll say it again - LAME! EPIC FAIL!\n\nI like this little bar - but it's hard for me to give it more than 3 stars due to the food hours..."

It seems to be a pretty popular place for weekend brunch, as the place was still packed when we got there at noon.\n\nI ordered the Spinach Breakfast Boret, a homemade Cinnamon Roll, and spicy Hot Chocolate. Although I walked out of the restaurant packed to the gills, it was well worth it. The Boret was much like spanakopita and came with grilled veggies. If I lived in Madison, I would have the Cinnamon Roll and Hot Chocolate on a weekly basis - at least. They were THAT good.\n\nI think the most unique part of the meal was the fresh bread and apricot butter that came free with the meal. Be sure to save room for this - it's a treat."

S"I'm not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.  I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  It's refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.  Amazing.  Only in downtown do you meet people like that.  This is a great Subway.  Go here and skip the others."

S'What a fun time!!  I attended the 6 hour Smoking and Grilling class this past weekend.  There were about 22 folks that attended.  The instruction was good and there were lots of food.  Good introduction to lots of different smokers and grills.  The school actually offers lots of the equipment for sale and after checking prices on the web their prices appeared to be better than can find on the open market.\n\nThe class started at 10AM and had a snack at about 2PM and lunch at about 3:30PM.  So by the time 2PM came around everyone was very hungry....especially after doing all the food prep and the anticipation of a great meal.\n\nA couple of suggestions....when I went I missed the part about bringing your own drink.  Six hours of class and eating with nothing available was not as enjoyable as being able to crack open a cold adult beverage.  Most of the actual grilling was done by an employee and a limited amount of grilling was done by a few students.  It would have been nice to get more hands on the grills.  In addition, the store was very inefficient on getting checked out and took way too much time.  A better POS system is needed.\n\nI did end up buying a bunch of stuff in the store.  With the decent prices I like to support a local business.\n\nIf you have a chance to attend - I highly recommend this program.  They also have a steak class and a sea food class (I signed up for that one next month!)'

S'Alright so in general when it comes to Italian food I am indifferent - even Olive Garden makes me happy. However, on a trip back from up north I stumbled into Gerardo\'s in Payson. Ever since then the bar for Italian food has been set very, very high.\n\nSo about this place. It\'s new. As in new enough to not even have a sign that lights up or any decorations new. No fear, I don\'t need a circus to entertain me. I simply mention this because if atmosphere is something that matters to you... then you may want to wait.\n\nThe service. The staff is new. They either come by too often to ask how you\'re doing or they seem to be off doing something in the back. But I say this as someone who kind of dislikes people being at my table too often - I guess this is my German side of me where I just want to enjoy my meal in peace. Time may improve their service. It was nice to meet what I would guess is the owner and lead cook.\n\nThe food. I\'m not an Italian and I couldn\'t tell you what is "real" Italian and what is not. I got my staple, chicken alfredo. What was my impression? Meh. I felt like I could have cooked something on-par with what I got... and I\'m no cook by any means. There was nothing that really smacked me in the face and forced me to call my mom about. I like my alfredo as thick as you can get it and this was a little oily. Don\'t get me wrong, I woofed it all down.\n\nWith that in mind when I think of Italian food I think of gluttony (no offense). I think of ordering a meal and getting it and going "oh shit, I have to eat all of that... and then have seconds... and then dessert?" This was not the case here, I eat like a bird and I ate it all and was still hungry... then I ate my kid\'s pizza... and was still hungry. Maybe I was just extra hungry but again I compare this to Gerardos where every time I\'ve been there I\'ve made 3 meals out of my order.\n\nWe did order the bruschetta and according to my girlfriend (and bruschetta lover) it was pretty good. She gave it a 7. I gave it an 8 because I generally don\'t like bruchetta.\n\nWould I come back here? Maybe. I think it has some growing to do, but this is coming from a non-expert Italian food eater here so take it as you will.'

I wait. And wait. At 3:21 it had been exactly one hour since I placed the call. I called them back and she assures me it'll be here any minute since the driver was on the way. I wait again. And wait. I call her again, I tell her ok it's been another 10 minutes, I am 2 miles away and the driver was already out the door and supposedly on his way to me ten minutes ago, at that point it was over 20 minutes later than what they told me. Waiting over an hour for a pizza? Nope. So I tell her to cancel the order I was going to go to a place that'll actually serve me food. She tried telling me to void the transaction it'll take so long for it to reappear on my card. I was like ok, void the transaction hahah, I don't care about the wait. She wasn't happy about that, and ANY GOOD MANAGER would of apologized and told me to take the pizza anyways and ask how they can make it up to me. Not this one, nope! When I told her I was leaving to get food she told me TO WAIT FOR THE DELIVERY DRIVER to tell him to take the pizza back. I mean REALLY?!?!?! Their delivery drivers don't have cell phones?? Hahah wow. I told her too bad, and I left my house. I went to sonic, got my food. When I arrived home Pizza Hut had just showed up. They took DOUBLE THE TIME they told me.

S'In Edinburgh on my honeymoon. My husband and I ate here two nights in a row not only because it was in walking distance of our B&B but because this is REAL Italian food! We were in Rome two years ago and fell in love with the food. Last night we were in the mood for Italian after eating too much "Scottish" food the last few days. We knew it was a risk trying Italian food anywhere other that Italy but we read the reviews and decided to give it a try. \nI have to say both times were the best meal of the year so far and my husband and I agreed that this may be the best two meals we have on our entire honey moon and we still have 9 days left!\nTry it you will not be disappointed! Did I mention the price is reasonable?!'

S"Not too much in the way of vegetarian options, but , in all fairness, it's possible that they'd be willing to substitute meat options with tofu if asked... even if it didn't specify so on the menu.\n\nMy friend and I opted to split a tofu and veggie dish. You can order the dish to be shared for an additional fee of $2 and we didn't want to get the fooditis sleepies by eating a whole portion on our own. I guess we were both expecting substantial sized dishes meant for sharing but instead we got a portion that wouldn't have been enough for myself alone. We ended up fighting over the small bowl of steamed rice to attempt to fill ourselves up... which also came at an additional cost.\n\nMaybe I'm a tad too accustomed to the generously shareable portions and complimentary steamed rice bowls that are common in Toronto, but in my hungry opinion paying $30 for one sparsley-filled dish and a side of rice, only to be left seriously jonesing for more food is a bit on the ridic side.\n\nStill searching for a Vietnamese spot in Montreal to make a fav.\n\nIn short: Staff was nice enough, food was overpriced and forgettable, and the wait time was close to 30 mins even though the restaurant was practically empty."

S'So, my son and I were driving around trying to figure out what to eat for dinner. I was craving for Chinese, but he wanted chicken. So, we went to Asian Express. They have both Chinese and Thai food. I got their Special Fried Rice and Panang Chicken. As we were waiting for the order, the cashier said she forgot to ask if I wanted some other things. So I got charged a $1 for two little ego rolls (one banana and one veggie). Both of the egg rolls were fantastic. Along with the egg rolls, I got the littlest Chinese container with steam rice. I was sure good with some Teriyaki sauce on it, then finished off. After that, as I was opening the container for the Panang Chicken, it had this unusual smell, but tried it anyways. After a couple of bites, I kinda liked it, but will have to get back to you the details, because I ate Mashed Potatoes and gravy from Popyeyes. My son had chicken and mashed potatoes from Popeyes!!! Overall, I like there food and the service. O by the way, the cashier asked me for the Panang Chicken how spicy do I want it. I was a big chicken and only got 2 stars. Chat with you lata!'

The place seems to divide opinion, but I rather like it, and often pop in for a quick drink, on my travels.\n\nOverall, we said: "as a quick lunchtime stop, I was really happy with what was on offer at Grand Cru. It was a filling lunch for a very reasonable price, with the quality of the soup and the panini more than acceptable.

S"So Domino's is Domino's, right?  You must know what you are getting--I don't have to tell you the pizza, breadsticks, chicken strips, pretty good in terms of getting what you pay for.  However, this location gets the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations (less than a mile from my house), and although this location has been prompt and delicious, this is more a review about the man himself, Mr. Domino and my online ordering experiences with him.\n\nMy friends, why would you spend $17 on a Domino's pizza when Papa John's will give it to you for $11?.  Not to say I'm a broke hobo, but seriously, the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and 2 at the places I frequent.  My biggest irk with Domino's is that they advertise $11.99 Any Speciality Pizza and if you change 1 item, say you don't like mushrooms (not saying that's me, could be, not saying) and trade for something like black olives (even trade, no?  Sometimes I even end up with less on the pizza because I don't like meats all that much and substitute veggies).  So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!  About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.  $11 any pizza, up to 7 toppings, any toppings.  Pretty much my BFF.\n\nPJ's.  Go for it."

S'We had been to the Vinnie\'s on South Blvd before, but decided to check out the one in the small downtown area of Matthews because it was closer to our house. \n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday night and there was little to no parking left.  Who\'d have thought?  We were seated right away inside, though.  Most people were drinking at the bar or seated outside where they could smoke.  \n\nVinnie\'s is a very casual -- but fun -- place.  It always seems very lively and full of regulars.  Newbies, don\'t be alarmed -- they won\'t bite.  It\'s the kind of place I would have loved to hang out regularly with my friends in my younger days.  \n\nIt was $1 domestic beer night AND there was a buy one, get one free appetizer special going on.  Wow!  We ordered two baskets of the fried pickles for the five of us.  As a rule, I do not eat pickles.  I do not like them.  However, when you coat them and fry them up, they suddenly become so much better.  They were tasty, but crazy salty.  \n\nEverything on the seafood/bar food menu is reasonably priced.  For my entree, I went with the Salt & Pepper Catfish.  A lot of people I know don\'t like catfish.  And I don\'t like anything too "fishy" tasting.  Catfish, though, I love.  It came with several breaded and fried pieces of catfish and a mound of huge thick fries.  Everything tasted great, but I think I overdosed on fried foods.  I stopped about three-quarters through my meal.  It was just too much between the appetizer, main dish, and side dish.  \n\nOur server was great, too.  Very friendly and attentive, despite working several tables.'

When I opened my order once I got back to work I realized it was all wrong. I ordered the cheese steak and asked for no mushrooms on it. It was mainly loaded with veggies with a lot of mushrooms. I figured well at least I have onion ring I get to enjoy only to find out that they gave me fries which were mostly soggy and uncooked. I also got to the bottom of my root beer to find little hard black plastic like specks. I only noticed them after feeling them in my mouth and in my throat. I have no idea what they were and I generally would not gripe so much but the fact I paid $15.19 for a drink half sandwich and onions rings is outrageously stupid. Needless to say I will never go back there nor will I ever promote this place of business since they cannot read a receipt, listen to customers and have no level of cleanliness with the crap I found down in my drink.

I asked for a toasted breakfast sub with Black Forest Ham, American cheese, their yellow Egg concoction (about a week old usually), onions, cucumber, and peppers. \n\nI keep forgetting that subway American cheese is white, I should have just gotten their cheddar.\n\nThe toasting was poorly done and the customer service was pretty bad. Needless to say I'm not impressed, in fact -to help potential patrons: I'd like to let you all know that the juices in store cost $1.49-$3.15 but you can get more variety juices from the vending machines for $1.25."

S'The Old Town Pub has been a fairly consistent option for a beer and a sandwich when you find yourself on the west side beyond West Towne Mall.  Over the years I\'ve been to the OTP numerous times, mainly because I found myself in the area and could think of nowhere else.  The bar is tucked away in a strip mall across from Woodman\'s.  There is very little else in the area and the OTP kind of comes off like a place that has never really worried about competition.  The overall feel of the place skews toward the regulars parked at the bar, but it never seems too unfriendly, just a bit insular.  There is a element of west side townie to be found on the weekends too.  This can lead to the usual aggravations like waiting at the bar for a drink while the bartender serves up all the people he knows, or the waitress engaging in long conversations with the tables around you when you desperately desire another beer.  Conversely these type of things must seem warm and welcoming if you happen to be a regular, which explains why there are so many of them here.\n\nThe food at the Old Town Pub is fairly standard bar food.  My father used to swear the chili here was the best in town, but I think the recipe was changed a few years back.  Don\'t get me wrong, the chili\'s still quite good but I believe they switched from shredded to ground beef and he says it\'s just not the same.  I\'ve had a few decent sandwiches here over the years and everything is usually pretty good, but I stopped getting burgers because they never seemed to come out as ordered - either too well done or not enough.  The last few times I\'ve been I\'ve gotten the chicken wrap with the fries, which is perfect with a couple of bottles of Capital Amber.  I recall that when I first started coming here with my parents in the mid-90\'s the "house beer" was New Glarus Edel Pils, which was impressive since most places didn\'t carry micro taps back then.  I don\'t believe they still have this on tap, and I\'ve had a few unpleasant experiences courtesy of unclean lines so I generally stick to bottles.  The tap selection isn\'t that impressive by today\'s standards but it is serviceable.\n\nThere is a nice set up of boothes along the back wall that gives you a little more privacy than the regular tables closer to the bar.  There\'s several flat screens throughout the OTP and the last time I was there it appeared that they have the MLB package.  I even didn\'t get any dirty looks cheering for the Cubs during the last series with the Brewers.  The weekday lunch and dinner crowds seem to be a bit more laid back than the weekend set, and the fryers are usually on pretty late into the night for appetizers.  The Old Town Pub is not usually the kind of place you actively seek out unless you\'re a regular, but I\'m happy it is there.  Plus, the murals in the mens\' room are worth a visit by themselves.'

S"This is one of my favorite lunch spots while I'm at work. Even though I work downtown, I make the drive up Charleston to eat here when I'm craving a sub. Even though it's super tiny and looks like a shack from the outside, it is probably the best location I've been to in town because of the efficiency of the staff. There are usually only 2 people working during lunch and still they are able to serve a small line of customers, man a drive thru window and still get orders out quickly. Most people take their orders to go since there are only 4 or 5 seats at a counter, so I'm usually the only one eating in the restaurant. The manager here is really nice and always seems happy to be there even though he's at work! The only downside is the parking...since this is such a small location, there are only about 3 spots in front. If those are full, you have to park in a nearby shopping center and walk over."

Although I have to admit that I may not be very objective as I only ever order the same dishes, which I really like! These are: the  Singapore noodles, the Special chow mein and the King Prawn Szechuan.  My flatmate is a big fan of their spicy shredded beef, which tastes nice but lacks vegetables for me! \nIt's best to go and pick up as it takes much less time than getting the food delivered.\nI have visited the restaurant downstairs before, they have a very nice mussels dish that is not on the take-away menu, which I strongly recommend.

S"The one thing you will not do here is leave hungry - assuming you stay long enough to place your order, of course, and that is part of the problem.\n\nSome restaurants you expect to not be terribly fancy, so you go in knowing that. In this case, the outside doesn't look like much, but it gives you hope that there is a quaint little joint on the inside. Be prepared for what lies within.\n\nThe floors are bare, the tables sparse - it's like a scene out of Pacific Heights, and not when Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine fix up the house. I'm talking after Michael Keaton removes all the fixtures, so all you have left is a bare floor and a card table.\n\nThis isn't to say it's bad - it's just completely unexpected, especially if you've been here before. The cute little Italian place that used to be here? No more.\n\nIf you make it this far, however, the service is solid, and the food good - and you get plenty of it, so sit back and enjoy. Just don't lean too far or the card table may collapse."

S"The Blue Agave is theoretically the seafood side of the Mexican restaurant, Gardunos, at the south side of the casino. I have friends in the Palms management but I'll tell them the same thing I'm telling you: This is a horrible mistake. \nFirst time I went there (in the company of a columnist for Nevada's biggest circulation paper) I found it very difficult to find service. Finally I was able to order a been and a dozen oysters. The chef literally rinsed the oysters in water. Don't try that at home. Tastes even worse than it sounds.\nSecond time I went there during a three-day alternative music festival. I was dying for some seafood - but should have hit the buffet. Again, sitting at the bar waiting for someone to take my order. It took about 15 minutes for one of the floor waitresses to come by with a menu, half of which was unavailable. (One of the reasons I sat at the bar, or sit at the bar on any night, is for quick service. A huge mistake there.)\nI ordered a mixed seafood roast, which is a creamy thing most of the casinos have at their seafood bars. It can be quite tasty. In this case, I actually received their version of seafood gumbo, which I grudgingly ate anyway despite a passing resemblence to cat vomit.\nAlso, the margaritas are terrible. \nThe coolest thing about this place is that all the rock and roll people who wandered in there while I was there had something to laugh about that weekend. Seriously, you will ask out loud if there is service available and then you will wish you hadn't."

Also has a late-night menu (10-1am)\nService staff could use a little more knowledge/urgency.\nNo Cuervo gold tequila available for margs and were out of ale on tap.\nThey need to rethink the music.\nNeed a focal point out on the patio (it's a little dull out there)\nOverall, happy to have another option in the neighborhood.\nWill give it another try soon!"

S'I ordered delivery, and it took over 2.5 hours to get to me because the woman could not find my apartment. After 1.5 hours, I was calling on the half hour to see what had happened. They told me the deliverywoman was "on her way," that she was "at my apartment complex" and then finally, at 2.5 hours, they told me she could not find my apartment number. If they would have let me know that much earlier, I could have given better directions; none of my other delivery folks seemed to have that kind of trouble and my complex isn\'t *that* big. I asked them why they didn\'t have her call me and have me help her find me, but they couldn\'t explain. Finally, as I was putting on my shoes and coat to get some food elsewhere, she showed up at the door. \n\nThey didn\'t charge me for the food, which was good, because it was cold anyway!\n\nOnce I reheated the food, it was really great.

S'Rude drive-thru staff. Was asked to repeat my order two more times after driving up to the window to pay.  Not sure who was working but she had blonde hair and kept staring at me -and not in a good way. Did not smile once.  I said thank you to her twice and not even a "you\'re welcome" or "thanks."  They weren\'t even busy.  Nope just asked if I needed any sauce or ketchup and when I said no thanks, shoved the food at me.\n\nI know it\'s a fast-food job and not the best pay in the world, but if you are going to work in the drive-thru or be expediting to the customer, you at least need to know how to be polite to the customers.\n\nAlso, I live about five minutes from this location and when I got home and sat down to eat the Whopper I ordered, it was barely even warm.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  The meat patty was dry and not juicy and hot like a fresh burger ought to be. I know it was not made fresh because how could the sandwich be barely luke-warm but the fries were hot?  Most likely will not return to this location, unless they make some much needed improvements.\n\nI suggest that if you do visit this location and have a bad experience, to take the survey and tell them about this place.  Not only did I take their survey, but I also copied the link from Yelp for this location and noted in the comments that quite a few other people have had negative experiences here.  Suggested that maybe a change in the employment and or management may be needed.  They should send someone through from Corporate randomly a few times to see what us customers are talking about.'

S"Roll up, roll up for the Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe experience! There are quite a few locations to choose from, but the one on Noblestown Road is my regular stop. Now, if you know Pittsburgh, you know its residents have a love for the hot dog. All sorts of hot dog eateries have come and gone, but Brighton Hot Dogs (as I like to refer to them) has been a mainstay, and rightly so.\n\nThe hot dogs have their own unique taste, and that's key to any successful hot dog joint. Hot dogs you get at restaurants shouldn't remind you of ones you can make at home. To me, they should be better than that. When I think of great hot dogs, I think of cheese Coneys from Skyline in Cincinnati, or Yocco's hot dogs with their funky chili sauce out in Allentown, PA. Brighton fits this bill as well. The flavor of the hot dogs they use is unique on its own. They certainly don't taste like any of the supermarket majors I've had, which is a plus.\n\nLike Yocco's, Brighton Hot Dogs' chili is a thinner type of chili sauce than a full-blown meat and beans type of chili. It's there to complement the hot dog, not overwhelm it. The consistency is spot on. Add some mustard to it and you have one terrific chili dog. I usually get a pair of them.\n\nThe hamburgers are also good. Now, these remind me of the types of burgers I would grill up myself, and that's just fine. It's a basic burger and you can get whatever myriad toppings you'd like on it. I usually just go for mustard and ketchup and some lettuce. It's not a huge gourmet burger, but it's tons better than anything McDonald's or Wendy's are serving just up the street. The homemade taste is what counts.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be a Pittsburgh eatery if there weren't fresh cut fries. Lo and behold, Brighton has those, too. It's funny, when I moved from Pittsburgh for a few years, the one thing I seriously missed was fresh cut fries everywhere. You just start to take them for granted after a while. And when you move to a place where everyone uses frozen fries mainly, you really start missing them. Anyway, Brighton's fries are tasty and as often is the case around here, go great with some vinegar on top.\n\nI've also enjoyed the breakfast here, and this place definitely gets crowded on weekend mornings. Heck, you can't beat the prices for all the food you get. The pancakes are awesome, as are the eggs and sausage. It's a basic breakfast menu and it satisfies greatly. Brighton Hot Dogs is really about getting good food at a sweet price to its customers and not about bells and whistles and all the sort of things that jack up the price of a meal for no real reason.\n\nOne of my favorite things at this location is the wacky drive thru speaker box they have inside the restaurant. It looks like some sort of relic and always seems to be turned up to 11. It adds to the low key and charming atmosphere.\n\nThe staff is always super friendly and the food is always served at a decent pace. The prices are perfect (the combo number one is two hot dogs or a hamburger however you like plus fries and a drink for six bucks) and the food is really good. So if you like hot dogs or groovy breakfasts at a nifty price, Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe is the place for you. Sometimes the classics need not be improved upon."

While not the best middle eastern food (I would recommend Boustan for that - just a block away) - but their pizza is unique. They got an express location as well that serves faster - this is more the sit-down place. \nExcellent stuff!'

S"Lane's by FAR has the best donuts in Madison.  And the best prices.  Less than a dollar for many of the donuts.  Try the persian with chopped peanuts on top.  The cake donuts are perfect too.  Really, you can't go wrong with any of them.  And at a fair price - all the other places that sell donuts in town are overpriced and inferior quality, in my opinion.\n\nThe cookies are a little expensive but quite tasty.  They were out of my son's favorite donuts when we last went and he really liked the cookie sample.  The woman behind the counter said we could just take the sample box home for free!  Everyone that works here is super nice and doesn't mind when I ask them a million questions about the flavors.  I will continue to support this local business forever!!! So happy they reopened!"

S'What can I say... Well they are very busy at this particular Jack-in-the-Box! I frequent Jacks all of the time. I love their Big Cheeseburger for $1.29 and their free tacos when you purchase with the receipt! I always get it the same way, all of the time! I asked for them to add tomatoes and they were going to charge me extra for it. I said "No" and asked if they were a franchise. No other Jacks will charge for an add item. That is one reason why I pick Jack! Of course they were a franchise. I was fine with that then I told them to only add chipotle sauce and left it at that. It took forever to get my order. When I got the food I ran out the door. When I got to my destination I looked at my burgers and they were both plain except for one which had mayo and ketchup on it and NO Chipotle Sauce as requested. I tied calling back to complain but the phone rang and rang and finally switched me over to their fax machine. I plan on requesting the correct order when I go back there this afternoon. This is the second time I have been to this particular store. I went there over six months ago and had a problem with their kiosk that you can order from. It didn\'t give me my change back and I complained to the manager. She was not going to give me my money back and I complained and told her to run the video and she finally just gave me the change from the register. She made me look like an idiot and liar. I vowed never to go back there again, but unfortunately my wife and I were hungry and did not feel like eating at McDonalds. I will go back to get my order correct this afternoon and after that will not return to that store again or any of the same franchises...'

I\'m a chicken teriyaki man myself, but all I had to choose from was BBQ chicken (which is not quite the same thing), so I opted for the BBQ combo plate which features a little bit of everything.  It was good; no complaints here.  I went with a friend who ordered a couple of sushi rolls which she said tasted fine; she later commented it was "a step above the sushi they sell in grocery stores" and awarded it 3 stars.  I\'d give it 4 just because the chicken/beef/short rib was decent, and the owners were nice.'

Not too cramped, plenty of room, great menu and especially compared to other cafes in the area the prices are really good!\n\nKind of quirky - you must check out the Bill Murray portraits for sale all over the place i don't know the artist but they must really love bill murray brilliant!  \n\nPersonally, I love the Roamin Nose, the menu is fab, the location and decor, the food is always perfect and the price is excellent ....."

S"Having your credit card mysterious declined when you check into your hotel is a rough start to a week long trip in Vegas.  Before I would be able to check on this strange twist of financial fate, I needed to grab a bite to eat.  Budgetary concerns lead me to this Burger King located in O'Shea's Casino.  \n\nBig mistake.  Should have gone with a different lowbrow option like Subway or McDonald's.  After being inundated with attractive women left and right all over the strip, it was like a sucker punch to the kidneys to be served by the staff at BK.  Now, I know I'm being harsh, and they were all sweet old ladies (or at least old ladies), but damn... way to burst my bubble BK!  \n\nThe food was your standard Burger King fare, but left me feeling a bit sicker than normal.

S"A newcomer to the Spring Mountain scene, I'm glad Shanghainese cuisine is starting to make itself known to the Vegas Asian food scene joining the ranks of Bund Shanghai, Edamame, and 1900 Asian Cuisine.\n\nWith my father's side being of Shanghainese ancestry, perhaps it is somewhat of a birthright for me to evaluate the quality of such aforementioned cuisine. Having sampled all the other restaurants except for Edamame, I can say that A&K is the best of the bunch, but I wish the others well since competition will only push and sustain the quality of offerings all around.  \n\nA little primer on Shanghainese cuisine:  the flavors tend to involve dishes enhanced with salted meats/preserved vegetables, often blending sweet with savory, lots of seafood (being close to the sea), and all kinds of wondrous carbalicious concoctions involving dumplings baked/fried/steamed, savory rice cakes, thick pan-fried noodles, and buns filled with meat/chinese veggies.\n\nXiao long bao (soup dumplings) and sheng jian bao (pan-fried pork buns) are popular staple items that are fun to share in groups dipped in some vinegar and ginger so be sure to try these if they are available on the menu.  If you've been spoiled by places in Taiwan or LA/Vancouver, it may not be up to par, but it definitely satisfies the craving.  \n\nThe sweet and sour spare ribs are just like my mother's recipe, a delicate balance between soy sauce, rice wine, rice vinegar, and sugar glazed and crisped to perfection around wok charred spare ribs meant to be enjoyed immediately to retain the fragrance off of the wok.  Don't even dare mistaking this dish's namesake with the Panda Express concoction with the toxic red sauce and deep-fried styrofoam coating in their sweet and sour dishes, this is the real deal!\n\nThe dungeness crab served with rice cakes was the real show stopper (see photo).  Fresh crab coated with a wondrous trinity of ginger/garlic/scallion is delicious enough on its own, but add a bed of glutinous pan-fried rice cakes with chili paste, and one's tastebuds are transported to Shanghai Shangri-la.  If you're feeling less spendy and indulgent, the rice cakes with pickled cabbage or chinese spinach is a good alternative.\n\nThere was a soup dish on the menu whose name I can't recall that contained salted pork, chinese squash, and thin squares of scrambled egg with a frittata-like consistency, that provided a nice contrast to the typical bold dishes described above with delicate flavors and velvety textures, so if you see something close to that description, it is a nice intermission between the fireworks of flavor noted above.\n\nSome dishes that missed the mark were the salted pork soup with tofu skins (a bit too salty) and the fried yellow fish with pickled vegetables (great flavor but the wet ingredients negated the crispy coating on the fish).\n\nAll in all, a solid addition to the neighborhood with tasty Shanghainese dishes that won't leave you feeling Shanghai-ed.\n\nPro-tip:  They have fresh pressed juices (most including carrot) that are on the house if your food bill exceeds a specific threshold (somewhere in the 30s I think), providing a nice palate cleanser post-dinner."

A fixed price for two people (and another for groups) to discover a few items on the menu, with appetizer, entr\xc3\xa9e, and dessert options. It would be the easy option for clients who want to try many items on the menu.

There are some workers here that remind me of my friend's mothers, so polite, so friendly, so willing to help you. The red bean buns are a family favorite, along with the cassava cake. We picked up a few items here before visiting family. They were so happy to see the treats that we had brought them. Really, somehow, I was hoping to find something new.

After suffering lame and incomplete attempts at shakes in CA restaurants, it's really nice to be within reach of a solid shake maker.  The only thing we missed, was a warm apple pie.  :)"

They have loads of different choices coffee wise, as well as numerous teas, chai tea and italian sodas.  The desserts are delicious & the owners are more than willing to customize anything you ask them to. They left the rooms of the house pretty much as-is so it's not all wide open.   A great place to get together with friends or sit in a cozy chair & read a book.  I was there during the dead of Winter, but the front porch is probably really great in the Spring & Summer!  They also have wi-fi."

One is for the mesera, or the waitress. One is for the cocinera, or the female cook. \n\nIf you order their regular pupusas to go, you can get 6 pupusas for 99 cents each. Their specialty pupusas remain regular price. \n\nThey make everything to order. It's delicious, flavorful, and simply good. I'm a fan."

No.  Grenache?  No.  Cava or Prosecco?  Nope....but they have Andre!  Maybe it was just because of the sale and the inventory hadn't been restocked but it was very disappointing.  My husband did find a 12 year old bottle of Mondavi Fume Blanc (he has some obsession with Mondavi Fume Blanc....he went to the winery once and sampled it and loved it....) which we purchased just because but it has this orange-tang colored hue to it so we'll see how it turns out.\n\nThere are tables and couches there if you want to eat in as a cafe but I'm not sure if I would go back for that.  \n\nI did enjoy that the Temple basketball game was being shown though!

I thought the food was well-presented and offered good flavour combinations, with the venison dish really hitting the spot. The curious conclusion to service was a rather strange to end things, but hey ho.

S'While this place is not very huge it definitely does not lack in flavor. I was first introduced to their great tasting grub a little over four years ago when the place I worked at used to be located down the street. One day after finding out someone had helped themselves to my lunch, I decided to place an order for a sandwich and a large ice tea. \n\nWhat I received can only be described as one awesome sandwich. Meat and cheese were piled high and the veggies tasted like they came right out of a garden. Each bite made me happy and sad at the same time. Happy that I was feasting on such delicious food yet sad that because of my huge hunger this cold cut master piece would soon be gone. LOL OK so I may be putting a little to much on it but that was one seriously good sandwich! \n\nThey always offer the best tasting meat and cheese (dofino hmmm) and their selection of bread (nine grain, honey wheat, white, and sourdough) is great also if you are in the mood to mix things up a little. They also serve salads and soup if you are looking to complete your comfort food combo but by far your best bet is to go for the sandwiches. My recommendation is the complete picnic if you are REALLY hungry as this will fill even the largest belly guaranteed! So if you are tired of nasty and tasteless subs and those dumb $5 foot long commercials then give this place a try. Your stomach will thank you!'

I have been to Raku (which was delicious!) but I have not tried Ichiza. We walked in and was seated right away on a late Saturday night....9:00pm. I thought the decor was tasteful and there are a lot more tables compared to Raku.\n\nAfter looking at the overwhelming menus (picture menu, sushi menu, yakitori menu) we decided to try a bit of each thing.\n\n1. Salmon Carpaccio was good and probably my second favorite of the night.\n2. Pot Stickers was a bit of a disappointment.\n3. Soki Soba was my favorite dish of the night. The noodles were not soggy and the pork was so tender.\n4. Chicken breast with salmon roe....I'm not a big fan of salmon roe but I heard this was good, but the chicken breast was dry. \n5. Shitake Mushroom was decent.\n6. Yellowtail was dry with too many onions.\n7. The Tuna Tartar I did not try myself as I was full from the soba, but I heard it was just ok and sweet.\n8. Pork Belly was fatty but it was a bit tough to eat. \n\nOverall I think this place is decent and for the price its worth it. I will definitely return just to have the soba.

S'It\'s a Wednesday night and I didn\'t feel like cooking. What\'s a hungry guy suppose to do? You guessed it... Go out! I check around to see who\'s available for some good cheap  eats. A friend of mine gets back to me saying she received a free birthday burger email from Red Robin\'s. Why not I say. I don\'t mind being the buy one (thats me) get one free (thats her) person in this deal.\n\nWe get there around 7:30. The place is huge. Busy? It was normal I guess for a Wednesday night. Workers? Tons. \n\n"Table for two please" I tell the young male host. "Just a moment" he replies. He then goes around the half empty restaurant talking to the different servers. He comes back and says "Please have a seat in the waiting area. I will seat you when the next table is available."\n\nI might of been a little tipsy from drinking before hand... But seriously... "When the next table is available?" I might not have the powers like Haley Joel Osment, from Sixth Sense, to see people in the empty tables, but what I can see is about 30 tables which I could be sitting at. So we do what we can do... Wait.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, we ask the host if we can sit in that empty table next to the nice people who seem to be enjoying their meal. "I\'ll have to check with the server of that area" says the host.\n\nAbout 8 minutes later... The manager comes out and asks us if we have been helped... Since we\'re the only people waiting for a table, I assume he\'s talking to us. "Yes sir. We\'re waiting for a table. Apparently its standing room only in here tonight." I smirked. "Come with me", he says. \n\nWe walk across the restaurant and he seats us in a booth. Sweet. We go to the only table in the restaurant where the lamp over the table is out. "I dont mind the mood lighting... But can we sit someplace where I can see my friends face?" I requested. I know... I know... I\'m just asking for something to "happen" to my food but i\'m pretty much past that point.\n\nThe nice waitress moves us over a few tables and everything seems to be at peace in the universe now. We crack open the menu\'s and decided on two good looking burgers. Our order goes in... And we wait.... And wait... And wait...\n\nThe family next to us, who appeared to be waiting for a long long time, finally tires of the wait and gets up to leave. The manager quickly catches them and asks if he could do anything for them. The father explains that they have been waiting for like 30 mins for their food and their kids are hungry and they are leaving to get food. The manager offers to pick up their tab if they agree to sit and eat. The family leaves. Great... I\'m stoked.\n\nEventually... Our food comes out. After a careful inspection, we eat. We pay. We leave. \n\nOh and my burger was alright. I got the A1 Peppercorn burger. The description says "Sizzling, hickory-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack cheese, A.1.\xc2\xae peppercorn spread, crispy onion straws, onions and tomatoes on an onion bun. It\'s a taste explosion!"\n\nI was upset that I couldnt give this place ZERO stars but I guess the burger was good enough for me to give them one star. I also thought it was cool that if you sign up on their website they send you a free burger coupon on your birthday. FYI, I read somewhere that the Peppercorn burger is one of the unhealthiest ones you can order there. Great. It just keeps getting better!\n\nTo see the yummy burger, check out the pics!'

S'I highly recommend this restaurant - 5 stars!  If you are looking for an authentic Italian experience with personality and delicious food you need to try this place.   Everything is made from freshest ingredients daily. You do not want to miss out on this quaint little restaurant in Kitchener. The owners, Johnny and his wife Shelly have owned this restaurant just under a year and what an amazing experience we had the other night.  First we started with an assortment of meats, cheeses and olives dish for the table, and it was fantastic.  The Caesar salad and dressing was from a homemade recipe that was truly one of the best I have had.  For one of our guests by request they added anchovies to the top. We had a party of 10 with different entrees from Pizza, a lobster, seafood and pasta dish,  Mussels which were so good that one in our group doubled the order and had it for the main course.  I had the Beef tenderloin with a cream sauce that was just amazing.  Others in our group had the pizza and said it was outstanding.  Desserts were just as scrumptious with an authentic Tiramisu and since we were there over Thanksgiving they had a really great pumpkin cheesecake. Truly a hidden gem - reservations are a huge plus - thank goodness they could accommodate us!'

Annoying to me but probably popular with most. \n\nMy lunch arrived in 4 minutes. The fries were  hot and crisp, the bun was fresh and the veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, onion, jalape\xc3\xb1os) were all crisp and cool. I don't know what sauce they put on it but it complimented the sandwich perfectly. \n\nI recommend this Carl's for quality food, fast, friendly service and good value."

S'Takara is one of the worst sushi/sashimi restaurants in town. Not only was the food disappointing, but the ambiance was rather lackluster, with cheesy 80s muzak playing in the background. The biggest annoyance were the prices; without question, you are not paying for the quality of the food, but rather for the high rent the owners are forced to pay at Les Cours Mont Royal.   \n\nI cannot comment on the entire menu, but I can comment on the dishes that my friend and I ordered:\n1. Seaweed salad: rather bland with a thick tasteless "ginger" dressing on the side.\n2. Soup (don\'t remember the name): the taste  of the buckwheat noodles and a single tempura shrimp in broth was actually not bad, although not worth the price. \n2. Sashimi: too thin and poorly sliced with a few bones here and there. Some of the pieces looked as if they were torn off of the fish -- which goes against traditional the Japanese art of food preparation .\n3. Hand roll: fell apart upon carefully picking it up.\n4. Green tea: tasted like the cast iron pot.\n5. sake: well, can\'t go wrong here (thank goodness)\n \nIf you want to pay the same high prices, I would suggest  Zenya, located near La Baie -- it\'s less traditional, but you\'ll pay the same price for better ambiance and delicious, well prepared Japanese cuisine.  If you"re not limited to the downtown core, Maiko on Bernard and Mikado on Avenue Laurier are also very tasty.'

The steak was pretty thick and very delicious. A friend had an omelette with biscuits which he said were delicious and another friend had the three hotcakes plate, which were huge! At least 6 inches across and quite thick! Someone else at the table was in a lunch mood and had the bbq special.\n\nThe coffee was good and hot and refilled often. Sodas are the canned variety, so no free refills there. The waitress has probably been there for years as she was friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nIt's inexpensive food, cooked with care. Enjoy it!\n\nNote that they DO NOT accept cards of any type, so bring cash.\n\nBonus: depending on the winds, you can stand in the parking lot and watch the planes on final approach into the Charlotte airport."

S'RUN AWAY. They may have a Pizza Hut sign and Pizza Hut food, but with the service you get, you would think you are in a back alley getting surgery from Michael J Fox. Metaphor aside, this location is TERRIBLE. Spend the time to go to a different location. They have an average of 2.5 stars for a reason. I placed an order online at 8:09 that was followed immediately by the email saying my food will be delivered at 8:39. At 8:20 I missed a call because I\'m busy enjoying a laughter filled night in with my boyfriend. I check my phone to see the time at 8:21 and saw that I just missed a call from a number I didn\'t know.  FYI - I\'m new to the area and AZ in general so every number is foreign to me.  I check to see if I have a voicemail from that number......NOPE....I go on about my night.  Fast forward to  8:59 when I checked my phone again (20 minutes after my food was supposed to arrive), I get frustrated thinking the food should have been here.  I look up their number and give Pizza Hut a call **SPOILER ALERT** It was Pizza Hut at 8:20pm.\n\nI call back, asking what\'s going on and instead of getting any information, I get told, "Hold on." Then I\'m talking to someone new. Adam. Who I can assume is a manager, maybe? Anyway, I come to find out that my card was declined (thanks Chick Fil A and your security breech) and that they cancelled the order after I didn\'t answer my phone (because no American has more than one credit card). I bring up that I didn\'t have a voicemail from said caller which contradicts their policy/protocol which IS to leave a message. Said manager ADMITED that she (female caller) didn\'t follow protocol and had no sympathy that now an hour has passed and I\'m a very unsatisfied client. Did you get that?.. The manager ADMITTED that they didn\'t follow proper protocol for this situation.  Adam, like a robot, kept repeating, "the best I can do is give you a $5 credit."  Adam said they canceled the order after I didn\'t pick up the phone.  That\'s how disposable of a customer I am?? You\'re too lazy to leave a voicemail?? What if I was taking a shit? Screw me, I guess since I missed your call I don\'t get dinner tonight.  I\'m supposed to have pizza hut\'s number memorized and know that a random 623 number was them?? Oh wait.... I would assume any reputable business would in fact leave a Voicemail if they needed to get in touch with me. \n\nOk well I\'ll remember that the next time I\'m hungry. Oh balls, that\'s now. Well at least I have credits. They\'re low in fiber, just like everything else...because they\'re NOT FOOD! What could have made it right? Say "I\'m sorry," I\'ll give you a different card and you get someone to bring me the dinner I ordered. But who am I? I\'m just a simple girl with simple expectations.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and DO NOT expect any customer service from this location. Go elsewhere. I will be driving to a different Pizza Hut just to avoid this kind of awful handling of issues that arise. I know things happen but the way you deal with them is how you retain customers. Shame on you Pizza Hut.  I asked Adam, "Is it worth it to you to lose a customer who just moved to your area over a $16 order?"..... Apparently the answer is YES.  Employees don\'t follow protocol and do their due diligence to ensure their running a smooth a customer focused/customer satisfied business.  Worst Franchise EVERRRRR!'

Then I saw a guy in the back making my kebabs in a real grill, wow, that was a good sign for me, once done he brought it to me and when I opened it I found a complete meal with a little bit of everything, a yellow rice, raw white onions,tomatoes,cucumbers, grilled chicken and 4 pieces of pita bread. The chicken was very tasty, the rice was a little bit dry with no salt (but it has potential) the raw veggies had no dressing at all (I don't know if they are supposed like that of if they forgot to do it) and the pita bread was ok, to be honest I have tasted better ones.

S"'Restaurant' is a generous label for Annabelle's, it's really a caf\xc3\xa9, and a small one at that. Normally absolutely packed in the late morning / early afternoon by geriatrics, I can imagine this being a perfect place for a cup of tea and a good reminisce for them. Unfortunately, if you are not quite at bus pass age then you may find it a bit dull for your tastes. There is little atmosphere and it can be a bit uncomfortable when everyone else is a good 50 years older than you.\n\nThe food is good, but I honestly cannot see how they can justify the prices. There are the standard scones and cakes and all you could want for afternoon tea, as well as a few different sandwiches and pasties / quiches. But all of them are horribly overpriced. Maybe if you are a pensioner that has saved a bit of money and are happy to pay more for the better quality food (which cannot be argued), but seeing as Annabelle's is located right in studentville it seems they are alienating a lot of their potential customers."

S'Darren W. has a degree in Creative Writing from Fantasy Island University, as a result, his reviews on Yelp are useless -so this is the first official/actual review of Burgerz and Dogz in Mt. Lebanon. \n\nFor a burger and a dog, not  a bad place if you like bland non-salted meat.  Salad, not so good.  You will find a much better burger (light years better) down the road at the Galleria (Houlihan\'s or Mitchell\'s) and only pay a couple extra bucks for it.  \n\nI recommend the skinless hot dog as the natural casing is too hard to bite through and pushes the toppings on the rest of your dog when you try and bite through it.  (undercooked skin is harder to bite through than crispy skin so all the toppings get pushed to another region of the hotdog when you bite into it).  They use the Vienna brand 100% beef hot dog.  I feel this hotdog is not salty enough and have never liked it, so if you are craving salt in a hotdog, this hotdog is not for you.\n\nThe hamburger, not bad.  I ordered mine medium-well and it was done appropriately.  I ordered mustard, ketchup, onions, and French fries on my burger.  Did not receive the onions (no biggie) but the burger was done good and the rest of the toppings made it very good except, my ketchup was in packets in the to-go bag instead of on my hamburger, not cool!!!  If I were eating my sandwich in a car, I would have been extremely upset when not received the way I ordered it!  Again, the actual meat was bland, no salt.  NOTE: One should not have to "salt" a friggin hamburger from a burger joint!!!  (This seems to be the norm in Mt. Lebanon.  Any restaurant or sub shop in Mt. Lebo is bland because entrepreneurs doing demographic research think that because an area is "upper-middle" class, the people want bland, non-salted "good-for-you" foods.  Read my review of Lebo Subs, right across the street.  Well, I don\'t go to a freakin burger and dog place to eat healthy!  So in reality, the burger was bad because they missed 2 of my toppings (ketchup and onions) and the meat was salt-free.   \n\nI had a salad there last week.  Their Italian dressing is horrible.  The Italian was not creamy but someone\'s "oil-and-oil" interpretation of Italian -tasting like it was made in someone\'s basement, hello botulism!  Horrible!  Let\'s not be creative, just serve Italian dressing!!!  Never again!  (But to be fair, this is a burger and dog place, not a salad place.  They just end up alienating vegetarian family members.)\n\nSo, ok to go to this place if you are fine with bland food.  Just order your hamburgers "well-done" (as the meat is nothing special) and get the "skinless" dogs and forget about the salads.  If you are a person who craves SALT in their junk/fast food, this place is NOT FOR YOU.'

All of the sauces and things I didn't know what they were, rather than describe them to me, they had me try! Just like I was in someone's grandmother's kitchen; a good feeling. The kitchen is right behind the counter so you see your food being prepared, cooked and served. All the better to ask questions while they do it.\n\nOn the down side they were out of falafel and a few other dishes when I came in around 7pm on a Saturday evening. The place was deserted, I even asked if they were open. \n\nAll in all a charming place and nice find of a new restaurant and gracious hosts. We will definitely come again!"

S"Ok, I still think the prices are slightly high for the dinner combos but only slightly.  So why am I upgrading this place to four stars?  Because on a hot summer day while the wife was at work, my car started spewing antifreeze so I had to let it chill.  I hadn't gone grocery shopping lately so there wasn't much to eat in the house.  The only non-chain pizza place that delivers to our house is terrible, so I decide Chinese would be good.  I call this place to make sure they deliver here and they said they do but it may take a little longer.  They're in Charlotte; I'm in Fort Mill 3 counties, 2 states, and 3 townships away (but still only about 5-6 miles).  I called back a few minutes later, placed my order, and it was at the door 25 minutes later fresh and hot!  The fried rice was actually very good and the moo goo gai pain was again decent, although just a little more chicken would have been nice.  Still, for not having to cook or clean up dishes on a hot summer day, this was definitely good."

There is no option to switch it out with house fried rice or lo-mien for a couple extra bucks. Which is kind of odd because even small chinese places in food courts will give different sides.

S"Words that come to mind : fresh. Quality. Authentic.\n\nFood : by far the best seafood I've had in this city. The menu had a wide variety of seafood/fish and each platter is better than the other. I've always said that food of good quality never needs to be over spiced or fancied up. We ordered a little bit of everything and nothing disappointed. The oysters tasted like the sea, they were large and super fresh, amazing. The stuffed calamari is definitely something new for me and I really enjoyed it. The Elounda special, which is a tower of zucchini, eggplant and saganaki (fried cheese) with delicious tzatziki is a great option for nibblers like myself. The fried anchovies are simply addictive, I definitely recommend you try them. But my absolute favourite was the octopus. I've had my fair share of octopus and it was cooked to perfection here. \nThe dessert (those honey ball things...:/) was great and the Greek coffee was a delight.\n\nService/staff : A+. I love the fact that the owner is present and active in his restaurant. He had a great energy. The whole staff really, from our delightful waitress who suggested the wine to the guys who bring water and bread, was great.\n\nDecor/ambiance : the decor isn't out of a Home&Garden magazine, but it's quaint. Everything was very clean (including the bathrooms).\n\nNote : I've read people complain about the prices, but really, I don't see what the problem is. A lot of things are market price and the portions are very fair.\n\nSuggestion : if you want several appetizers, ask for half portions."

S'Due to several restaurants in the Mint Hill, North Carolina being without power this evening my wife and I had a late evening romantic dinner at Subway. Arriving at 9:00 pm we placed our order, took out food, and found a table. Just about the time I finished my sandwich, pushed back from the table, and took a big sip of my diet coke, the restaurant went dark. Looking across the darken restaurant, I said, "Excuse me" which caused one of the young ladies to look around the corner and say "We close at 9:30." I told her that my wife was still eating, to which she repeated, "We close at 9:30" (yes she was blond and apparently thought that her being blond affected my hearing). I replied that closing time was when you stopped letting new customers come in, not when you turned the lights out on your customers. "Oh, are you still eating?", she queried. I tried to explain that my wife was still eating and that it was very rude to simply turn the lights out on your customers, especially without informing them that you were closing and going to turn the lights out. I thought about accidentally falling in the dark. I know some attorneys that would loved such a case and I have always wanted my own Subway. I told the young lady that I had never seen anyone so rude. At which she became magically polite and turned the lights back on so my wife could see how to toss her uneaten food in the trash can so that she would not have to clean the table. My wife, being the lady she is, gathered up her uneaten food and all the papers napkins, straw papers (even picking one up out of the floor - which I would never had done) through them all in the trash. Then, when my wife asked for her name, she disappeared in the back. \n\nSo beware, if you decide to eat at this Subway in Mint Hill, and if you do, you had better be out by 9:30 or take your own candles!'

Yay! not too hot, though - and went superbly with rice\n... all finished off with two serves of coconut rice.\n\nFood servings were ample, with the above (and a bottle of red, of course) filling two tummies rather nicely.\n\nCannot stress how good service was, wait staff were friendly and responsive to our every need.\n\n(QUESTION OF THE DAY: I saw that hot chips were also on the menu, what is it to do with Asian restaurants in Scotland serving chips?!)\n\nI did take a pic of the food but my stupid phone seems to have eaten the pic. :( If someone buys me a bright new shiny iPhone 4S, I promise that it won't happen again."

Perhaps he wasn\'t handling food directly, but he\'s grabbing chip bags, trays and other items right next to your food. Thanks for spreading the germs, dude.\n\nAs a starter, at least we managed to enjoy the tortilla chips & their wide selection of salsas.\n\nFor the main course, we ordered some grilled veggie burritos enchilada style. When they arrived, we were highly disappointed. The enchilada sauce didn\'t taste that good and the burrito contents were mostly cold.

S'J\'aime vraiment ce foodtruck. Depuis la crise \xc3\xa9conomique en 2008, le Grill Cheese est le Sandwich du Peuple! Le Sandwich r\xc3\xa9dempteur qui au lieu d\'\xc3\xaatre principalement viande,fromage,salade/l\xc3\xa9gume susbtitue le tout par une simple - mais efficace - tranche de cheddar ou fromages de tout genre. Ce merveilleux sandwich offert par P.A Gargantua offre la simplicit\xc3\xa9 mais bien fait, sans raccourci. 1) Vrai pain au lait 2) Cheddar de l\'Ile aux grues. \nIl va aussi plus loin dans les classiques du Grilled cheese "pimp\xc3\xa9" avec  le Grilled Cheese Bacon - avec du vrai Bacon. (pas de raccourci, c\'est un bacon qui baigne et cuit dans son gras 1h de temps ce qui a pour effet d\'avoir une cuisson parfaite c\'Est-\xc3\xa0-dire le c\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 croquant-gras). Ils ont aussi le classique double, le v\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9tarien, le gargantua. Maintenant c\'Est clairement la pi\xc3\xa8ces de r\xc3\xa9sistances du lot. Un Grilled cheese avec chili con carne, cr\xc3\xa8me sure. Vraiment excellent. En Dessert, on y offre le Grilled cheese avec confiture rhubarbe et fraise qui est tr\xc3\xa8s bon aussi. Les prix sont de 5-6 a 10$ le sandwich. Pour satisfaire sa faim, il faut, \xc3\xa0 mon humble avis pr\xc3\xa9voir un budget de 15-25$.'

S"I stubled across this place on Leith Walk by chance as it isn't obviously signed nor is it well established yet in the area.  It's aiming for a fresh, Mediterranean feel as the owners are Italian.  Inside it's clean and light with a small number of tables and an impressive deli counter with fresh ingredients.  The service is friendly and the menu offers a good selection of cakes, sandwiches and Italian specialities like pizzas, calzones and pasta dishes.  I had a ham and pineapple pizza which only took about five minutes to be prepared and tasted amazing.  The base was nice and crisp and the topping was delicious with good quality cheese.  Not only was it tasty, but it was filling too and only cost \xc2\xa34.\nIt's a shame Elm Rose doesn't do more business as it offers friendly, quick service and great food at reasonable prices."

S"My friends and I went to this restaurant as part of our week of Mtl a table. \n\nThis adorable restaurant in the upper parts of Du Parc street is cozy and welcoming. That was a wonderful start!\n\nThe night only got better with the food. Very Mediterranean, these tapas were the perfect size, very reasonably priced and delicious. The mango salad was a winner with very differing tastes of fruit, cheese and greens mixing exquisitely. The tajine d'agneau, the tilapia ceviche, the calamari and more. We were three and ordered 3 tapas each. This way we shared more and experienced a wider variety of tastes. That was one of the keys to this night being great-every dish was strong yet delicate. \n\nThis was an amazing restaurant and I will definitely be going back."

S"Apparently, Honeycutt Coffee moved?! At least according to their former Yelp page it did. Nope, folks, still in the same place.\n\nOh well, I'll go ahead and contribute another review, and up my rating to five stars. \n\nWhy? Honeycutt Coffee is becoming a Saturday mainstay for me. \n\nFinish my training at Crossfit 347, hop on over to HC get myself an Iced Toddy to cool down on the drive back into town. \n\nAs you'll see in the pictures, the atmosphere is warm and inviting in an otherwise boring Maricopa Strip Mall. \n\nThere's plenty of cozy furniture to read a book or catch up with a friend, and large / small tables are available for whatever you need to get done. \n\nYou can tell the owner is invested in the community, which is awesome. On my most recent visit (today), there was lots of Maricopa High School Rams Athletic attire adorning the walls. \n\nSo far, I've only tried an Iced Tea, Iced Toddy with a pump of Salted Caramel. The Toddy is strong and will wake up the sleepiest of folks. \n\nToday, I tried the Teddy Bear Latte at the barista's suggestion.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of milk-based, syrupy sweet beverages (a la Starbucks, gross) but this was delicious. The TBL has both Salted Caramel and Spiced Brown Sugar in it. \n\nI'll definitely be ordering this beverage again. The barista today was kind enough to remake my drink (accidentally ordered it hot) even though the mistake was mine. Now that's great customer service! \n\nOh, speaking of customer service, almost forgot ... \n\nMake sure you sign up for a punch card. Think it's buy 10, you get the 11th free. And unlike traditional paper punch cards, this one's like a gift card: You can preload it! Also,  I think if you load a certain amount, HC adds extra money on to it. \n\nWhen I started mine, Eric the owner was nice enough to credit my last three weekend's Toddys to my card. Thanks, Eric! :)\n\nRemember, this place closes early afternoon, so check the hours before you go. \n\nThanks for brightening up my weekends, Honeycutt Coffee team!"

S'Horrible service, inedible food, tremendous swivel factor. But, my drink was fine.\n\nTheir advertised drink specials are good, but most concentrated on shots and low-end liquors (think Smirnoff for $3). The "service" at the bar was hard to come by, although there were at least two bartenders working.  I asked for a minute with the menu, and spent the next 20 minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order.\n\nOrdered the shrimp special which was not very special at all.  Although there were 6 grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good, the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless, watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli, steamed but otherwise unadorned.  At $12.99 it was definitely not a good value.  Plus, it took for-ev-er to arrive. The gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special, and his cafeteria-style serving arrived in about 30 seconds.  That didn\'t make me very happy for him, however, as it looked equally disgusting.\n\nI cannot recommed this place for anything other than a drink, although the pool players seemed to be having a good time.'

S"So so disappointed. Ate there a few months ago and was pleased but went back last night and was almost insulted by what I had been served. I was informed that the dishes were sharing sizes which I felt okay paying $20 for (I was a party of two).  I was then told that the dish was best eaten as a thali so I said sure. When I received my lamb and okra dish I was given only bones with no meat at all, this is not an exaggeration. As well in the thali I was given about a tablespoons worth of humus, a few triangles of pita bread and rice with a tiny salad. For $20 !!! I have eaten all over Montreal as I have lived here for years and I've never been so ripped off. The waitress, although very kind and understanding, could not offer us anything other than a few shots, which although was nice, did not fill my belly up at all and I was still starving. Finally our bill came to $63 as they charged us for two thali's (my boyfriend got two pieces of meat with his, so he gave me one of his)- so they charged us for two thali's despite me asking if it was meant to be shared based on how expensive it was.  I was actually rather insulted and offended by the whole thing. I could have and should have cabbed it to Park X and got the same dish for a fraction of the price and left full and satisfied and cabbed it home for less than what I would have paid to have eaten there. Sure the ambiance is 'cool' but is it really 63$ cool? No. This was a really really unfortunate experience which I wish I never had. This is the first time I am writing a review but I felt it necessary as this place caters to a younger generation for the most part and for many of us times are tight and going for a dinner out doesn't happen as often as we wish and thus one wants the experience to be fulfilling and satiating - which this was not. At all."

The food is always bad, cold, cooked, or served wrong, despite the easy order. ( Ice in a drink. REALLY? Ya can\'t even get that right McDonalds staff worker? )  The equipment is always broken, place is dirty except the parking lot ( More on that in a minute)  the staff do not speak English but work positions where they need to, and never  get the order or change correct. \n   I had complained several times about the staff member who goes out and waters the parking lot every day. McDonalds corporate offices ( not in the deserts of Az of course)  tell me it is policy to wash the parking lots fully every day. REALLY? Even when it is clean? Really? The whole parking lot in a huge strip mall McDonalds? REALLY? Even when you have 200 cars backed up at drive through? Is this the workers only job? He sits out there on the curb holding a hose. He does not clean the restaurant or the bathroom or help serve the million people backed up on line? Hey I want that job. ( insert sarcasm here) Hey MIKEYD"S you do know we live in the desert right?\n    I used to go here every morning on the way to work for my cafe fix but I stopped last week. I will never go back. Last week the man with the hose was outsIde smoking!( yes a cig, it was lit, and yes he did inhale!)  He was also just aiming the hose in the air letting the water squirt into the air. No, thank you for asking, there were no trees, flowers or plants nearby, just cement. Not a clue what he was doing. Just wasting water in the desert and smoking. SMOKING???????Did I mention he was smoking? EWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Oh BTW, did I mention he was smoking????? Smoking around food?

The napkin bins apparently have never been cleaned as they\'re caked with every dried up condiment imaginable. \n\nEvidently I\'m a glutton for punishment since I have been back a few times to give them chances to redeem themselves, yet return to work after eating and felt sick, twice.

As far as the food, they have a very extensive and varied menu that looks really good, pretty much anything you could want and priced reasonably.   We ordered our wraps and sandwich, but they were out of the sides except for chips, a soup or pasta salad.  We each ordered the past salad, but because they were out of utensils (we were told the boss did not bring more forks that day) we were given the salad to take home, ok.  My grilled veggie wrap was very good and the gyro my friend had was also good.  The main problem with this restaurant is that there is no ambiance, not one bit of character or decor to really speak of.  No air conditioner or even ceiling fans as it seemed very warm inside.  Quiet background music would be nice, too.  There could also be outside seating in the area just outside the door. and maybe happier employees.

My boyfriend had the 3 eggs overeasy, bacon,toast, and homefries. The bacon was really good quality and was thick and cooked perfectly for me . Eggs are eggs as is toast. His homefries looked delicious and were nice thick potatoes. He said they were very tasty. The coffee was very good as well which for me is essential for breakfast. I have lived in Bellevue a couple years now and this was my first trip into the diner. It has a counter and several booths with some tables in the back. Very typical 1950s like. So if anyone is ever near Bellevue and needs to grab a bite for breakfast, I would recommend stopping in! They also serve lunch which again seemed like typical diner fare. Coming here I feel is more for the unique diner experience rather than the spectacular (not saying it was not a decent breakfast) food.'

Subway is usually consistent, but this one doesn't have the currently advertised oven crisp chicken nor do they have the veggie burger type patties.  They seem to be a little skimpy with the food too.  I only stop here because it's on the way home.  Much prefer Jersey Mike's though."

While their inside is pretty clean and nicely renovated, I never go inside, so my review is in regards to their drive through. I would say that 9 out of the 10 times that I go there, they mess up my order. I have just grown to expect that I won't get what I ordered. Ask for grilled chicken? You'll get crispy. Ask for coffee with no sugar? It will be sweet as hell. Oh, and also, over the past couple of months I have noticed that they NEVER fill up their fries all the way anymore! Good grief."

S'I wish I had read further into the reviews, where I would have found out that their Happy Hour at night is mainly beer and well drinks. I was excited to try a new place out, so me and the BGB went and checked out the place after his shift at work. The bartender was really nice, but the only person in there at midnight-ish on a Friday night. Apparently the kitchen closes around that time, but he was still able to get us some bar food. He was really nice though, so good customer service always rates high with me.\n\nWe split some chicken fingers and fries, which were good. Nothing breakthrough about them, but they certainly weren\'t bad. Apparently you have to get there a little earlier to get the full menu. Tab came out to about $27... most of it were my two Long Beach Iced Teas (at full price) vs. BGB\'s two Cran-Vodkas (at happy hour price).\n\nBut the place was just so dead. It was almost uncomfortably dead, as the only people in there for a while was me, the BGB, the bartender, and two other guys. On a Friday night. Now, I know Henderson\'s not exactly the swingin\' night spot that older brother Las Vegas is, but still, that was super-dead for a bar. One review said it was super smoky, but I certainly didn\'t have that problem. It was fine to me. There wasn\'t really anyone even in there to smoke!\n\nNot a bad spot. May check it out again someday, seeing as it\'s right down the road.\n\nOh, one more note: People were complaining that Steelz is a "gay bar" and it\'s like the downfall of good wholesome Henderson or some BS. Steelz is about as much a "gay bar" as Del Taco is "authentic Mexican" or Fox News is "news." Maybe it\'s gay-owned, gay-friendly and gay-welcoming, but it\'s not a gay bar. It\'s a bar. It\'s 2012. Get over it, people.'

S"thai food is one of those simple pleasures in life that makes me so happy.  and this restaurant down a short flight of stairs and cosied up in a stockbridge basement just does it right and i always leave with a smile.\n\nsunday night and a quick dinner needed by me and the boyfriend.  i immediately knew i want some sort of asian food, leaning toward wagamama, but suddenly my brain and my stomach shouted THAI!  and off we went.  we were greeted very warmly upon entering the restaurant and shown to a table right next to their very pretty christmas tree.  one of the things that i just love about ruan thai is that the tables in the front room go into these little alcoves, clearly indicating that this used to be the basement of a grand house.  but i think the alcoves just make the place look cosy and intimate.\n\ni couldn't resist my favourite thai dish and order the pad thai with king prawns.  we also shared the crispy chicken spring rolls with some green tea to drink.  the spring rolls arrived quickly and were very crispy, piping hot on the inside, and very delicious to eat!  i was sad that the portion was a wee bit small, only three to spilt between us but it would have been a good size for someone that wasn't sharing.\n\nafter another short wait in which a very nice waitress wiped down our table and refilled our tea pot with hot water for more green tea (free of charge!) our mains arrived.  the boyfriends spicy chicken curry looked yummy, but i have to say my pad thai was the star!  lots of noodles, five huge king prawns perfectly cooked, bean sprouts and springs onions all wrapped up in a perfectly cooked omelette with a side of peanuts and hot chillis.  i'm a wimp so gently pushed the dried chillis away from my delicious noodles but scattered the peanuts across the top, squeezed a bit of lemon over it all and dug in.  oh my, pad thai you make my heart and my tummy happy.  i think i said about three times that this was the best pad thai in edinburgh.  this restaurant just seems to get it perfect everytime!  the sauce is super flavour with just a touch of spice, the noodles are well cooked, and the prawns...oh the prawns!  huge butterflied king prawns that were fresh and delectable and just simply glorious.  i'm reliving this meal typing the review and it's just magic really.\n\nalso something needs to be said of the service here.  the waitresses are so nice and so helpful and seem to just appear right when you need them.  they bring food quickly but don't make you feel rushed and are so warm and welcoming that you could probably stay all night if you wanted.  \n\ni seriously love this place!  it may be a bit expensive, but thai food generally is.  and the quality you get is so worth the price.  i just wish i could justify ordering that delicious pad thai for my dinner again tonight!"

The new location still doesn't have seating, but it is clean and shiny. \n\nWhen they re-opened closer to my neck of the woods on Carson Street, I had to check them out to see what the fuss was about. They do make a damned good hoagie - love the pepper relish. \n\nTips: \n* They have been regularly running out of rolls and meats since they re-opened, so make sure you get there early in spite of them saying they are open till 7PM.\n* You will probably still have to stand in line, but the line does move quickly. \n* Enjoy the people-watching as all walks of Pittsburgh life love this establishment - from contractors to businessmen to tattoo artists. \n* Order the original with the standard toppings."

I got the trio sampler with Luau Lydia (pineapple and macadamia nuts), Cranberry Kelli (cranberry and almonds) and Mimi's mix (apples and cashews). They were all very good but the Cranberry Kelli was my favorite. \n\nThe one and only reason for 4 stars versus 5 stars is they do NOT put enough fruit in their chicken salad. We got maybe 3 pieces of fruit per scoop. Enough to let you know that if they put a proper amt in their it would be amazing! There is a lack of balance between nuts, fruit, and chicken salad. if they got that straightened out I would 100% give them 5 stars!!"

The restaurant has an amazing "Top Gun" atmosphere with its cool jet fighter vibe combined with a lot of humor.  But the real reason you go is the food and service and it is truly top notch.  If you are with the family or with a big group of guys you have got to order the 28" pizza.  It is like an aircraft carrier in size and tasty to boot.  My wife loves the wings and the sandwiches which always satisfy.  If you are looking for a great place to have lunch or a nice dinner you gotta go to Saguaro.  Great place to go before the game and for sure I am ordering their 28incher for the SUPER BOWL.'

S'Ever since I was a kid I\'ve always loved McDonalds. I can\'t really put my finger on it but I\'m sure it has something to do with Ronald McDonald and the happy meals. I\'m not going to review the food at this location, because lets just face it we all know what McDonalds taste like. What I will review is the service, location and general overview of the restaurant. \n\nService: These cashiers are hard workers you will see the same smiling face day after day when you come by and order your usual and trust me there are "regulars" at this location. Often times I\'ll be waiting for my order and someone will step up to the line and even before they open their mouth the cashier will say #5 with large sweet tea. The customer will simply nod their head. These cashiers know their customers. The managers here are also  very pleasant. This McDonalds has less of a turnover rate then some of the companies I know. I only have one cashier I try to avoid because she just always seems to have a bad attitude. \n\n\nLocation: Overstreet Mall, Uptown Charlotte.  This is one of the busiest lunch areas in Charlotte. From about 11:45-1:30pm you have thousands of people walk-running like herds of cattle through over street. When I say walk-run it\'s really just that! They don\'t walk and they don\'t run it\'s like a very fast pace walk, which almost feels like if you get in the way they are going to run you over. It takes some time to get used to once you start working uptown. Oh and heaven forbid you\'re a slow walker... you\'ll get some pretty mean stares to the back of your head.\n\nGeneral Overview: They actually just remodeled this location last year so it looks so much better. It\'s much cleaner and the seating is a lot nicer. At other McDonalds you don\'t have to wait very long before getting your food and at this one it\'s about the same, but because of the mass amount of food they have to push out they have a system. There are two separate lines. You have a line to order your food and then a separate line to pick up your order. Try not to get confused because it can be very confusing to newbies and throws us regulars off.'

Nonetheless, it has a friendly atmosphere, pleasant, efficient service and some great food to offer. \nThe menu has an extensive range of classic Italian dishes, as well as some lesser known ones.  In particular, their pizzas are amazing with thin, crispy bases and tasty, generous toppings.  I went for the mushroom and parma ham which was suprisingly big more than adequate for a filling evening meal.  \nIn total our meals came to about \xc2\xa310 each, including drinks which was more than reasonable.

S"Wow, this place is fantastic!  \n\nA work colleague took me here and I can say this place is excellent for both quick service and a great place for a power carb lunch!  Basically, like the name mentions it's all about pasta goodness!  Behind the counter a chef asks you what ingredients you like (mine had shrimp, black olive, sausage, mushroom, green pepper, garlic) and then you choose from 4 different pasta's and your preference for sauce (white, rose or meat/tomato).  I chose the rose!  Also they ask if you would like a splash of white wine for some extra flavour.  I said what the hell as it was Friday today!  They also give you bread and a garlic oil dipping sauce on the table (I avoided due to afternoon business meetings!).  All in it was under $10 with tax!  Seriously amazing value!  Especially in this day and age when a lunch at Carrefour Laval food court will easily cost you $12 - $13!  Probably one of the best value resto's in Laval or a great place to eat if you are running a marathon tomorrow!"

But at the same time, the greasy, poor quality, probably not remotely Chinese food always gets to me. \n\nSummerhall Kitchen offers the usual array of takeaway standards. There is a big menu, but that usually means the ingredients aren't fresh (another staple of a cheap takeaway). They do offer some money saving offers like the student deal for two at \xc2\xa313.50, and they also offer a 10% student discount.\n\nOverall this place isn't that expensive, but at \xc2\xa34-\xc2\xa36 for a dish, you could still go elsewhere for far better quality."

It filled the job of sports-pub but didnt really seem to have any other appeal - good drinks, good music, good crowd.\n\nIf you want a pub to watch a game in, with lots of atmosphere (shouting, spilling beer, not my oxygen to go around) then this is your place.

S'Overall:\nCute mom & pop operation buried in the airpark.  I ended up not even looking at the menu and simply ordering one of the \'lunch specials of the day\'.\n\nLocation:  \nSafe neighborhood, but this place is hard to spot amongst all the other small businesses there.  Understand that this place is north of Redfield.\n\nOrdering:\nTypical \'order at the counter\' style.  Limited beverage supply in fountain form.  Decent beverage supply in an easily accessible fridge.  Also:  Pickles are the only things that come with a sandwich.  "No chips.  Only pickle." They have a sign to this effect (in large letters) next to the chips.  \n\nPricing:\nA bit on the expensive side for the quantity of food given.  I paid $18 and change for 2 decent-sized sandwiches, 2 chips and 2 drinks.  You\'re paying for a bit of small-town ambiance, the charm and service of the folks behind the counter, and the quality of the food and preparation.  \n\nAnd what about the ambiance?\nThis isn\'t Starbucks:  You won\'t be referred to as your drink order, or expected to \'come pick it up yourself\'.  Expect to get into a conversation with the folks that work there.\n\nIn the end, it\'s a cute place that I plan on revisiting (especially on pirogi Wednesdays).  The frequency of my visits will only be limited by my budget.'

Turns out I didn't really need one for 8:30 pm on a Saturday night.  The place wasn't that busy.  \n\nThe atmosphere was very comfortable and intimate.  We were seated downstairs at a corner table.  I liked that the Medusa logo was casually placed through out(including on the glasses) the restaurant.  It had a European decor to it with a modern twist.  80s music played in the background all night and I loved it!  Michael Jackson's Billy Jean and She Bop by Cindi Lauper totally made my night!  There was also some Richard Marx in there.  Ok.  \n\nOur wait staff was very attentive.  No water glass went empty.  Orders were taken promptly.  We got bread and the little pizza appetizer quickly.  Our salads were a good size.  I found mine quite filling.  I had the cucumber & tomato salad and my daughter had the caesar salad.  For my meal I had the Cannelloni alla Romana, which was typical cannelloni.  I found it to be delicious and filling as well.  My daughter got Spaghetti \xc3\xa0 la Gorgy, which is spaghetti, prosciutto and peas with a creamy white sauce.  Not what she expected, but she did really enjoy it.  It was a huge serving and far too much for her to eat.  Thank goodness for take out containers!  \n\nMy only issue was after a nice meal I love a little something sweet.  We wanted to split something, but they only offered gelato from next door.  I had drank a lot of water and the temps were a little cool in the restaurant so gelato was the last thing I wanted.  They did give my daughter a scoop for free and I tried a small bite.  It was very tasty!"

Restaurant is smaller and setup in a true Vietnamese quick and casual style!  You know by the stack of chopsticks on the table and Chinese soup spoons stacked upside down that this is not your "Quebec Vietnamese stir fry"!  \n\nThey have a great simple menu with many items sub $10 and a few others that are sub $15.  This is my kind of place!  \n\nI ordered the #28 chicken, beef and pork with noodles.  It came out very nice on a plate with salad + I ordered the Imperial rolls.  Imperial rolls were a bit smaller but tasty none the less!  Food was tasty and with my brother\'s dinner it was $31(with a 15% tip added in).  \n\nAlthough L\'acadie is high volume traffic (NYC Style) I\'ll come back to test out the Pho!'

You come in with a great selection of fresh ingredients ranging from fresh shrimp, blue crab, tilapia, salmon, etc. \nThere are also fresh veggies and meat section there\'s a selection of thin sliced beef, thin sliced chicken, napa cabbage, bok choy, etc....\nI really liked the tom yum style broth. Now remember when you cook this stuff in your broth it takes on the characteristics of the food you put in. Like mussells....Tom Yum and Mussells. Strong flavor. Dont forget to strain out all the stuff with your strainer so you don\'t thicken your broth! \nThere\'s also a gelato station and a shaved ice station with coconut gel, and grass jelly, mung beans. This is an asian specialty. Very simple food yet complex flavors and texture. Uhm oh yea. If you\'re not used to shabu shabu style eating....this is a little different. If it\'s your first time. It\'s a little messy....yes if you don\'t use chopsticks then there\'s gonna be a little mess. There are also different types of noodles that can go into the boiling pot of death. It was very difficult to get the noodles out of the pot. \nSo I really want to go back again. I wanna try the stuff ON the menu and not just the hot pot.  I also wish they served liquor. But because the other menu wasn\'t offered, the noodles were hard to get out of the pot, and there\'s no liquor....I\'ll give it 4 stars. GREAT PLACE! Don\'t get me wrong.

We got a Margherita, a Champion Supreme and some wings.  The pizza's were OK but there was a distinct lack of ingredients on the outer rim of the Margherita.  I like pizza crust (to dip in sauce) but this was to much.  Fortunately they threw in some extra pizza sauce (on purpose?) so it made up for it a little.  I am not a fan of sausage and peperoni but the Supreme was well balanced with ingredients and others in the group seemed to like it. The pizza crust is pretty good, not greasy so that was a big plus.\n\nWe also ordered wings and their Gold Fever sauce.  The wings were a good size and were, well, wings.  The Fever sauce was fair but I am not a fan of buffalo chicken wings and that is what the Gold Fever reminded me of.  If you like buffalo wings then you will probably like their sauce.  Me?  I opted for some ranch so I was satisfied.  \n\nI enjoyed their cheesey bread sticks, they had a good amount of garlic and that made them very good.  Hmmmm!  Garlic cheese bread sticks.\n\nSince this place is to far for delivery we opted to pick the pizza up.  It is right on our way home from work so chances are we will stop in again."

S"We had originally intended to go to Q Karaoke, which is in the same run-down shopping plaza. But they had a long wait, which caused us to start wandering looking for something to do. Then we found this place! I couldn't believe how nice it was inside compared to the outside parking lot. The place is very stylish and modern, clean, and well-decorated. \n\nBecause of their slightly high prices ($20 an hour or $150 drink minimum) we were the ONLY people there at 11:30pm on a Saturday night. This meant we got super attentive and friendly service from the bartender, waitress, room-helper person, and security guard. They showed us how to set up the touch screen device and adjust the volume of the mic. We still got a bit confused because the buttons are in Chinese, but once we got our queue going things were good. \n\nWe spent two hours singing our hearts out to classic rock and pop, as well as really new songs by artists like Katy Perry. They usually have MTV music videos for the newer stuff. Drinks are about $9 or $10; we didn't order any food. \n\nI can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can come here with even more friends next time!"

Anyway, what I like about BC is that they offer mini cupcake versions of their cheesecake, so it's smaller than a slice, which is sometimes too heavy. I had the strawberry white chocolate cheesecake, and well, it tasted like cheesecake. It wasn't GREAT by any means, but tasted pretty average. Next time I come, I'm definitely giving their food a try- the menu looks pretty appetizing!The staff were super friendly and McGill students get 10% with their student cards!"

The staff is always very sweet, upbeat, and fun!\n\nChipotle is by far my favorite place to eat because they are organic. Food with Integrity indeed. \n\nAs far as extra servings, I've never been charged extra for anything. Perhaps that's because I treat people with respect while some might bark out demands. Either way, Chipotle is awesome... and their guac kicks major ass!\n\nHooray for yummy chicken salads with pico!!"

S"Wifey and I went into this dinner with great expectations and high hopes as we are huge fans of alla familiga . The space itself is very nicely done and spacious but beyond that, things went downhill quickly. Service was slow. After we were seated, it took us one hour to get our food and we had no apps. The waiter seemed flustered all night and was sweating profusely. The lights had a short and kept flickering from bright to very dim all night. There was still drilling going on in the middle of dinner service. A centipede crawled across the table and I crushed it with the cork from my wine. I I showed it to the waiter. The waiter said he was going to get the manager, but he never came. We ordered the lamb ragu and the veal chop. The pasta was good. The sauce was nice and there was a lot of meat in it. That was 18 dollars and a good value. The veal on the other hand was $55. It was a nice cut of meat and well cooked but totally devoid of any flavor or seasoning. When you pay $55 for something you want to... be wowed. It wasn't even above average. I told the waiter that it needed a sauce or some seasoning. It took him 5 minutes to bring me a bowl of microwaved au jus. At that point we were basically done. Nobody ever came over to talk to us and there was a visible lack of leadership and organization. I like to go out and have eating experiences and I like spending money on excellent food. This place didn't come close to meeting expectations. I realize they just opened recently but I'm not taking another $160 chance there when I know I can do better elsewhere."

S"This is the best Hawaiian place I've had in town. I agree with other reviewers that Kalbi is not the best, and it is on the dry side...however there are plenty of choices with more than 35 entrees on the menu to choose one of the more delicious options.\n\nI myself love the affordability of this place; You really do get a lot with your meal---any numbered meat meal comes with Miso soup, macaroni salad, white rice and regular salad or steamed veggies. I especially love Maui chicken special, tofu salad and mango and avacoado salad here--all of these are out of this world!!! Salmon, meat dumplings and noodles are also above average.\n\nThis is by far one of the best lunch spots in town. I would not recommend it for dinner, unless it's a quick affair--the place has a fast-food type of atmosphere. However, if you are not looking to dine in style and just want some authentic-tasting Hawaiian food (this restaurant was highly recommended to me by a native Hawaiian co-worker), Maui Rose is an excellent choice.\n\nP.S. A variety of Hawaiian juices, drinks, snacks etc are offered for sale here that are more difficult to find elsewhere."

We only went there because Hawaiian Kitchen is closed, but when we saw the New England menu, we were hooked.  It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to get full-bellied clams outside of the Northeast.  I doubt if my husband will ever eat anything else there as he loves these clams so much.  I had the Lobster Roll (no it's not huge, but it's not $20 either.  You are not going to get more lobster for that price eating at a pier in Maine!) the first time and the Fish (Cod) and Chips the second time.  Both were great.  The Fish was crispy and succulent.  I was just sorry that I gave my third piece of fish to my husband.  I certainly could have eaten it myself.  I happen to ADORE the coleslaw.  Just the right mix of mayo and vinegar.  I did finish off my husband's portion, too!\n\nWe don't live close by, but we will make a trip when the seafood craving strikes us."

They have a few outside tables, which are really nice when the weather is good. \n\nThe problem, and it's a significant one, is the service. They have a walk up ordering system and every time I've been there, it takes forever for anyone to take my order. I've never been there when they've been busy. The final time I went there they had several people working there, but again, this weird kind of ignoring the customer thing was going on. \n\nI couldn't wait any longer and left. When they opened in that plaza, I was excited to have a new restaurant close-by. But now, I don't undergo the frustrating process of getting someone's attention to order there anymore, I just go to places where the entire transaction is pleasant."

I had some tasty sliders at a CMYE event and wanted some when I went back but I couldn't find them on the menu so it probably was something special just for the event or I just missed it. Instead I went with my 2nd choice the Angry Kimchi fries which sounded perfect on the menu. Chef Boyzie even brought it out himself and it looked delicious.  It was sweet potato fries with bulgogi, kimchi, various cheeses, fried egg, green onions, and jalapenos it suppose to be amazing but I didn't like it. It wasn't as spicy to my liking, it was more sweet if anything and not every bite had flavor to it, it was also cold which was weird because I didn't wait long at all for my food, maybe it was the beer. I'll give it another try without the beer though I think beer and Korean food always makes a great combination. I don't know. It's still worth the try since it's under $5.\n\nI guess it serves me right for not trying the dogs first but stay tuned I'm sure it will jump to 4 or 5 stars after I try some of their dogs. I have a feeling the Banh Mi Dog or Beef Bulgogi Dog will do that job for me. I might even like the Naked Dog which lets me choose 1 meat and 2 toppings to customize my dog."

It\'s a cute little bagel shop with a modern, retro feel, a decent amount of seating (booths and tables), a clean, peaceful atmosphere and super friendly & quick service! Oh and they have restrooms, a necessity for us coffee guzzlers. ;-)\n\nI got the whole wheat bagel with maple walnut cream cheese on one side and bacon scallion on the other (since I had a terrible mental debate deciding between the two). A rather fine bagel I must say. Very wholesome. The maple walnut cream cheese is delicately sweet and has tiny walnut chunks in it, a pleasant surprise!\n\nThe coconut coffee (a seasonal flavor) was deliciously flavored and was brewed pretty strong/dark, which I like. Perfect with some milk.\n\n1 star amiss just for the lack of coffee "condiments", and that the coffee isn\'t self-serve. Einstein Bros (around the corner) has all their coffee out on the bar so you can try every flavor and go back for seconds, along with spices for your tea and coffee. I would\'ve loved to add some cinnamon and nutmeg to my coconut coffee (and refill it multiple times) at Bruegger\'s, but def not a big deal! I would so go back/recommend to all bagel lovers! A great, fairly inexpensive ($1.70 for coffee in your own thermos) place for breakfast/lunch with friends or even your jolly \'ol self.'

I ate here because in the summer they have an outside food stand at the USX tower.  I remember being out of the taco that wanted.  So whenever a food venture is out of something that I want that immediately knocks off some starts for me.  The salsa options were great but I dare say Qdoba is better then this place.'

S'I cannot believe I\'m reviewing a McDonald\'s, but I\'ve been to this location three times, and all three visits have been less than stellar.  \n\nFor starters, the "drive thru" system is anything but convenient.  Getting in-and-out via the drive-thru requires you to take 2 full laps around the building - the way the entrance is configured, you must enter their parking lot via the side of the property.  You then drive counter-clockwise around the building to the spot where you order.  Then you drive to get your "food," at which point you\'re beyond the entrance/exit spot.  So, you have to take another counter-clockwise spin around the parking lot before you can exit.\n\nIt\'s a terribly inefficient system, and it\'s somewhat dangerous, as drivers leaving the primary drive-thru lane with their food rarely look for cars circling the building trying to get to the drive-thru.  It\'s difficult to explain... but go there once, and you\'ll understand what I\'m trying to describe.\n\nOk... entrance/egress aside, let\'s talk about this location.  It\'s a McDonald\'s, so the food is going to be exactly the same as you\'d find from any other McDonald\'s in the world (thanks corporate farming/food prep/chemistry!), which means the service makes or breaks the experience.\n\nToday\'s experience was especially interesting/frustrating.  I was in Verona, helping a coworker with some home improvement work.  It was around midmorning, and his kids were in the mood for McD\'s.  Since I was the cleanest of the group, I volunteered to drive and pick-up the grub.  I hopped into the car and made my way over to Mickey Ds, where the drive thru was backed-up (thanks to lack of dual ordering points).\n\nWhen I reached the spot to order, I started placing the order.  I don\'t often go to McDonald\'s, so I\'m not terribly familiar with the protocol... the first item on my list was identified as a "large #3 with Coke."  \n\nMcD\'s Microphone Dude: "Sir, Sir, Sir - I\'m sorry, sir - we don\'t have a large size breakfast item, we only do that at lunch and dinner, sir."\n\nMe: "Oh?  So they can\'t get a large Coke?"\n\nMDMD: "Sir, I\'m sorry, we only have one size for breakfast - we don\'t have large size breakfasts."\n\nMe: "Ok?  I only need a large Coke with that #3.  Not trying to Supersize or anything, just adding a large Coke."\n\nMDMD: "Sir, no - sir, we don\'t Supersize any longer.  We have large drinks, but we don\'t Supersize, and we only have one size for breakfast."\n\nMe: "Let\'s start over.  Could I have a #3 - the biscuit thing, with a Large Coke?"\n\nMDMD: (long pause) "Do you want a large Coke?"\n\nMe: "Yes, and the #3."\n\nMDMD: (long pause) "So, that\'s a #3 with large Coke?"\n\nMe: "Yes."\n\nMDMD: "Ok."\n\nMe: (long pause) "Can I continue with the order?"  (looked at screen thing and saw that he got the #3 with large Coke correct)\n\nMDMD: (long pause) "Yes."\n\nMe: ...ordered rest of meals for friend and his kids...\n\nMDMD: Ok, if everything looks correct, proceed to the first window, where we\'ll have your total ready.\n\nMe: ...drives around...\n\nKid at window: "That\'ll be $18.14."\n\nMe: "Sorry for the confusion - I thought you could order a large beverage with your breakfast meal."\n\nKid at window: "You can."\n\nMe: "So, why all of the confusion?"\n\nKid: "I don\'t take the orders here, I just take the money. They take the order at the next window."\n\nMe: "Oh, ok."\n\nSo, I go to the next window and the kid explains that he thought I wanted a large sized hash browns, and went to great length to explain that they don\'t have large hash browns, only regular size.  Ok, whatever...\n\nI returned to my friend\'s house only to discover they forgot to include the #3 part of the food order... so, we got the large Coke, but no biscuit or hash brown.  UGH!  I gave away my breakfast in the interest of not having to return.\n\n\nPrevious visits included a bout with cold/hard fries and a botched burger order (asked for onions only; got everything but onions), and a less than enthusiastic balding manager dude who seemed to act as if someone had just stomped on his toes a few seconds before I arrived to his window.\n\nThanks to this McDonald\'s, I\'m convinced that I won\'t need to visit another McDonald\'s ever again.  I think I\'ll go watch Supersize Me again, just for good measure.'

They offer buffet at lunch and a la carte after 5 pm.  I'm always reluctant about buffet but I have to say Tandoori Palace does it right.  They don't inundate you with a huge selection but rather a few prime choices of quality.  Items are super fresh since they don't attempt to put out trays of food en masse. Prices are great, restaurant is cozy and clean and the food is awesome.  Bring the kids on the weekend, cause even my picky eater enjoyed it, along with the other younglings that were present.

S'For years, I was a semi-regular at the original Ewn\'s on South Central.  But I am happy to say that this new place is much better.  Its smaller than the original, but the menu is better, especially with the addition of BBQ.  However, the wings are my favorite still.  The moniker "king of wings" is definitely appropriate here.  The wings are large, juicy and flavorful.  My favorite is the honey hot and almost always my go-to dish, but the southern style are a close second.\n\nI have had the BBQ  tacos, pulled pork and numerous sides as well.  The BBQ beef in the tacos was delicious and well smoked. The pulled pork, although not as good as my own ;-), was definitely top notch. \n\nTo date, I have had the mac and cheese, cole slaw,  french fries and most recently the yams.  All are really good and came out piping hot (except the slaw).  The yams are by far my favorite; sweet and just a tad bit savory at the same time.  Try them, you won\'t be disappointed.\n\nBut what I enjoy the most, is the service.  I believe that the owners are John and his sisters (unfortunately, I didn\'t get their names). They are extremely friendly and happy to help out in any way.  When ordering take out, they always ask me to sit and even bring me water while I wait - something that I have rarely seen.  When dining in, they come by and chat (when its slower) and really go out of their way to make me feel like family.'

S"Dear Mr. Sushi,\nI have been to this restaurant numerous times and I have enjoyed your bento boxes, sushi, salad, and soups. I was hoping to come here twice last week on different lunch dates, but as you were closed, I was unable to. I understand that business is slow when the school year is done and spring term exams are over, however in light of recent events, it has been made clear to me that you do not care about your loyal customers. I wanted to take some friends to Mr. Sushi on August 27, 2014. To make sure that you were open, I walked past your restaurant that day and saw indeed that the hand-drawn sign in your window said that you would be open August 27. I tried calling your restaurant to confirm later in the day, however I could not find a working phone number online and I was unable to reach the restaurant. At lunch, my friends and I walked over to Mr. Sushi only to discover that the hand-drawn sign had been changed from August 27 to August 28. We had to go to a restaurant we weren't keen on we did not have much time to eat. It's a shame that you do not care enough to properly inform customers about your hours of business. In a town where there are many competitive sushi restaurants who have websites and working phone numbers and are open during regular working hours (and frankly, better sushi...), you should be working a lot harder to keep your customers.

Importantly, the beers aren't ridiculously priced, either - sure, they're not cheap, but they're affordable. I've heard it's got a nice beer garden, but so far I've only visited it when it's been cold and dark, so haven't managed to try it yet. It's probably my favourite pub in the Edinburgh area, to be honst."

S"Really a 2.5...\n\nI was driving home one day after work thinking about what I was going to eat for dinner. I've been on a salad binge trying to lose the pre-holiday weight. Haha. So what do I see? A brand new Subway joint on my way home! Sweet! Usually I have to drive another 10 minutes out of my way but thats no biggie either.\n\nSo I roll in and apparently they've just opened a few days ago. So new that they dont even have credit card machines yet. So I step up and order my favorite roast beef sandwich. The prices are the same as other Subway's so that wasnt a big deal. The real kicker to me is how they make the sandwiches. What do I mean?\n\nI want the sandwich maker person to make my sandwich like if they were trying to put the place out of business. There are several Subways around town with specific people that make sandwiches with extra meat on them without even asking... Because really... It's not coming out of their pocket. If you really think about it, they actually gain more because of the tips they would be getting. I have no problem tipping a person $2 for a $5 sandwich if they make it heavy on the meat.\n\nSo the nice lady just goes and lays around 6-8 slices of roast beef on my foot long and was a little skimpy on the veggies. Oh well... I guess I'll have to try another sandwich maker before I write this place off and go back to my regulars."

And then the cashier told me that their signature mayos would be on rotation throughout the year not available all the time. So I have never had the garlic mayo which is basically why I wanted to at there in the first place.\n\nI will say that the belgan fries were good but would have been better with the signature mayos not the basic mayo they have. The burgers/sliders are another story. Extremely overpriced and the cooks don't listen well either. My roommate spent damn near 40 bucks at that place ordering food for us and the order was not correct. The cheese is extra and you would think for the prices they charge everything would be perfect but it wasn't. \n\nIf the prices were reasonable and the full menu were available all the time, then this place would be a gem. Right now it sucks."

S'I feel a little silly writing a review for a fast food chain because really, the food is the same no matter where you go - or it should be at least. But I have to write a review for this location because their service is so fantastic!\n\nI always drive through and am greeted by someone in a cheery voice. For example, "How are you today?" "I\'m good thanks, how are you?" "I\'m doing taco-tastic, thanks for asking!" or if you say you need a minute before ordering, "Sorry, we\'re all out of minutes, would you like some seconds instead?" I would accuse all the employees of being high on the job (it IS taco bell, after all), but they\'re all so perky that that can\'t possibly be it. \n\nOne time they forgot my cinnabon bites and I had to go back for them - no sweat getting them, but inconvenient because making u-turns in this town is a huge hassle. \n\nStill, even though the Warm Springs location is closer for me, I always come to the Horizon Ridge one just because they are so much nicer to interact with. One time at the Warm Springs location, they handed me my food and said, "here you go" and turned away. No "thank you," no "have a nice day," nothing! I don\'t get out a lot, and if the only interaction I\'m going to have all day is with a taco bell employee, I want it to be a pleasant one! (Boy that last line makes me sound SUPER pathetic.....)'

This place is so consistent. Enough talk about how one pizza place taste like New York. Really, stop it! I am from Brooklyn, NY and there is NO pizza in Arizona that comes close to tasting like New York pizza does. That is not a bad thing either. I'll tell you why. There is not a pizza joint in New York that tastes anything like a Red Devil Pizza. We truly are blessed to have pizza this good and unique in Arizona. Now, it has taken 50 years to open only 5 stores. I think the Bistro is the newest location. Whatever they want to call it is fine, it is still a Red Devil."

This place is a legit grab & go Mexican food - Decent quality grub, friendly staff, and consistency, which is lacking in similar franchises (Roberto's Tacos - Are you listening??).\n\nI tend to order the combo plates & carne-asada tacos with cilantro/onions. Sometimes my order can get a little lost in translation because of a slight language barrier (staff speak fluent spanish, and decent English - I however, can only speak English). Custom requests & substitutions are easily done, altho some employees might be hesitant at first to accommodate your request.

S'The noodles themselves are unique as they differ from the others around. The noodles at Sai Gwan are egg flour noodles and are not the wheat-flour "pulled" noodles as some noodle-heads are used too. I ordered the wonton "lo mien", which means "mixed noodle". The soup comes on the side and you can spoon it over each bite as you make your way through the dish, or sip it on its own. The noodles sit in a puddle of a soy sauce and oil mixture with sugar and white pepper with scallions (mixing is necessary). Coincidently, you\'ve just been witness to the shattering of a world record of how many times the word "noodle" can be used in a paragraph.\n\nThere are certain things you order at different restaurants if you have any clue what you\'re doing there. You\'re not going to a truck stop to order their version of Boeuf Bourguignon. To give this place a bad rap based on your own ignorance is unfair.

She actually seemed slightly hurt that I didn't believe her at first when she said my favorite dish was actually really healthy. (I forget the name but it was a corn tamale with cream- imagine a really moist piece of sweet corn bread... Ok that sounds a bit odd but trust me and the nice waitress when we say it's amazing!). My husband got a couple pupusas and they were delicious and filling. Don't let the size fool you! It being my first time there, I panicked and got the Salvadoran tacos because I know tacos and generally love them. While they were good (fried and topped with vegetables) I'd stick to my tamale and the pupusas... Or just keep trying other things the waitress recommends. Totally reasonably priced- 2 adults and a kid ate for under $30 AFTER tax & tip and we were pretty full. It'll take a serious amount of will power to not stop in the next hundred times I pass."

Asked for a small Coke and a carne asada burrito. When I drove up to the window I waited for three minutes before anyone showed up to assist me. The waitress then went on to say they didn't have Coke so I asked for Sprite. Before she went to go check if they had Sprite she rolled her eyes at me. She then came back, and stated they had Sierra Mist. You would think somebody would know if the restaurant they're working at carries Pepsi or Coke products. While I was waiting at the drive thru three gentlemen walked in and waited for at least five minutes due to every available person being crowded in front of the register since they were having such a hard time processing my payment. The three gentlemen, tired of having to wait for so long decided to leave. One of the waitresses noticed them leaving and very loudly and rudely yelled bye at them. I finally recieved my carne asada burrito after ten minutes of waiting and found the most disgusting burrito I had ever seen. It was full of cheap, old, wilted lettuce and resembled more of a philly cheesesteak in a flour tortilla than a carne asada burrito. It tasted like pure grease. Worst service and food I've ever had.

This place never fails to satisfy me. \n\nThey have this big cooler of three assortments of hot sauces, along with cheese, mushrooms, onions, and chili pepper condiments. The tacos are a fair size, though I had four to myself. The hot dogs aren't Costco sized, but with all the toppings in it made it sufficient. I don't know their hours, but it's always around at night when I swing by."

S"Decided to order some take away as I was uptown and was hankering for some Thai.  One word of mention it is mighty difficult to find a Thai restaurant open at 4 PM but LBT was just opening their doors!  Most Thai places I searched all opened up at 5 PM.  When I placed my order they mentioned it would take a bit because they had to get the kitchen opened up.  \n\nOrdered 3 dishes plus a salad, (Chicken Pad Thai, Beef Basil, Vegtable red curry and the Vietnamese papaya salad).  I would say that the best was the Chicken Pad Thai and the salad then the vegetable curry and then the Beef Basil.  The Pad Thai had a great flavour of the wok and was respectfully generous with chicken.  The Veg Curry nada good assortment of vegetables.  A small (and little disappointing) portion of rice was given.  The Beef Basil was the least because I'm use to a very fragrant version of the dish  This was good, but I've had better at other Thai places.  \n\nRestaurant is tastefully decorated and nice Thai music was playing in the background.  They had a deal on Yelp for $5 off your meal or 15% but I asked if it could apply to my takeout order and they mentioned it was just for dine in.\n\nI would return to this place because I thought it to be decent value for the money compared to my regular Thai resto.  They were friendly and apologized for the food taking so long."

S'I was looking forward to a meal at the 41 but I was quite disappointed. The space is comfortable and nicely decorated. However, the food and service did not meet our expectations - particularly based on the prices. The first problem we had was that the first three bottles of wine we ordered were sold out. This left us only with very high priced wine available to order. After some discussion the Maitre D\' offered us one of these bottles at a lower price to compensate. This was appreciated and was a nice touch.\n\nThe food was unremarkable. I had the burger and fries which was fine but could have used a flavour punch. My friend had the chicken "Kiev" which was very disappointing. We ordered the cheese platter and the creme brule for dessert. The creme brule was very small and lacked in flavour while the cheese plate did not have a great selection.\n\nThe service was very slow and inattentive. We had to request water and were often looking for the server\'s attention - to order and to pay.'

My visits were almost daily whether it be for a bite to eat at breakfast or lunch or a coffee during breaks, and the occasional pack of smokes if running low.  They also offer as many pointed out some grocery items, ice creams, fresh fruit and lottery.  \n\nI loved the convenience of Two Louies and the variety of options they have.  Everyday they have a special, and it was usually 6.50 included a candy bar (bite size) and a can of soda.  One Thursdays my office would go crazy as that was their Buffalo Chicken wrap day... I swear 1/2 of my office ate lunch there every single day.  They make a pretty good egg salad wrap and that is what I usually got when I went there. If you are local and need a quick meal that costs under $10.00 give it a try.'

They seemed to have worked out most of the kinks that another reviewer mentioned when visiting last summer, and on a recent visit, our food was good (I noticed some upgrades in ingredients from a previous visit) and served promptly. Every once in a while, the food will take a long time to come out, so it can be inconsistent.  But on the plus side,it's comforting to have a little, old-fashioned Pittsburgh tradition still left in downtown.  On the right day, you can get a great piece of cake too for dessert from Macys bakery, on-site.  We recently had a huge piece of confetti cake which was fresh and delicious.  So don't eat here if you're looking for trendy, but if you're fine with simple, better than diner kind of food (and you're not in a big rush), you'll leave pretty happy."

S"Pozoleria Guerrero is another little Mexican in the near-central Phoenix area.  Definitely not a bad experience and the atmosphere inside is a lot more pleasant than you would assume when driving by (think shady area).  Of course, this is the case with many of Phoenix's best Mexican spots.  \n\nThe atmosphere inside was nice, the server was really friendly and helped out almost immediately.  Pozoleria Guerrero is open on Sundays which is nice as well.\n\nThe menu is fairly extensive, including the usual assortment of tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and of course pozole.  I decided to go with their specialty and got the pozole Rojo.  For those who don't know what pozole is, it's a type of pork stew that has little pieces of hominy blended in.  The spicing is excellent, and it left me with a runny nose.  A normal bowl will run you $7.25.  Other items on the menu were reasonable, with tacos ranging from a buck to $1.25.\n\nThe salsa was interesting and really spicy but good as well, although the chips were thin and left something to be desired.\n\nAll in all Pozoleria Guerrero #1 was a decent spot and I think it comes down to whether you want to get pozole.  In the future if I get a hankering I will definitely be returning.  I can't comment on the tacos, etc. yet, but plan to try them in the future!"

This is Papa George\'s--We ain\'t no chain!" the owner said when I asked for a small menu substitution.\n\nI feel if your\'e going for teh Greek/Diner combo, you can\'t go wrong with the "American" Gyros, French fries, and if you have room later--baklava sundaes! (ice cream sundaes with baklava crumbs atop them.  Reflect on how unhealthily delicious that is).\n\nSunday brunch is also tasty, although perhaps not exceptional.  Again the service tips it from a 4 star to a 5 star review.  Additionally, they have a happy hour on Thursdays with $2 martinis (unfortunately, they\'re about as good as you can expect for $2).\n\nDon\'t fail to check out their weekly $5 lunch specials, though.  THOSE are fantastic.\n\nCan you tell I have a soft spot for Papa George?  \'cuz I do.'

S'This place finally opened after what seemed like forever.  I saw coupons for them in the Clipper before and when I would drive by, they weren\'t open for business yet.  Finally they opened and I saw a deal the Clipper\'s website for them.  I bought it back in July and juts used it today.\n\nThe style of pizza here is similar to Brixx, which means that\'s it\'s cooked in a wood burning oven.  What differentiates Stoney\'s from Brixx is that Stoney\'s offers a 14" pie in addition to the 10" in pie.  We got a "Natural Choice" to share.  It comes with banana peppers, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes.  It was decent, even though I am not a fan of wood-fired pizzas.  The pizza is cooked way to fast at a high temperature which means the dough never gets a chance to raise.  It is way too thin for my liking and each piece was only two bites,  I could have easily ate the 14" pie by myself.  The flavor was decent; toppings were ok.\n\nLuckily I also got 8 wings, and those were very good.  They were a bit pricey at $8, but they were large, flavorful, and fried.  Reminded me of wings I had while living in Buffalo.\n\nThe service was also good.  They recently converted from counter service to table service, which is a little odd.  The menus are still paper take menus and the fountain drink machine is accessible to patrons.  While it was nice to be waited on, I think counter service in this place would be far more efficient for everyone.  \n\nThey also have tv\'s at most booths, some of which were broken,  I could probably do without that, but you can just leave it off.  They also gave us each a free beer.  Something to do with them being promos or something but it was a nice touch.'

S"Ichiban is a fast food spot located within the Fashion Mall across from the Wynn.  The UFO shaped mall has a large food court with lots to choose from, but Ichiban is probably one of your best bets.  Ichiban is a Chinese fast food restaurant that serves quality and tasty food at a reasonable price.\n\nWhenever I'm visiting Vegas, I make a point to stop by at Ichiban and get a plate of their delicious teriyaki chicken and vegetable fried rice.  The teriyaki chicken bursts with flavor as its drenched with their teriyaki sauce.  The chicken itself is tender, tasty, and nicely grilled and goes great with their fried rice.  In addition, the Mongolian beef is also worth trying and has a bit of spice to tingle the taste buds.\n\nThe food portions are large and more than enough to fill you up.  The cost of two entrees and fried rice is about $6 and after you add a drink, your total comes to about $8 and some change.  I highly suggest trying Ichiban; you'll love the teriyaki chicken."

Repeat customers is the name of the game. As someone who doesn't have a disposable income I like vouchers, I use them quite a bit, and I've had both good and bad experiences. And oh man, I am so glad this was a good experience.\n\nThe space inside is lovely.  Large, good atmosphere, cool things on the wall.  There was quite a mix when we were in: families with children, couples on dates, bro/sis combos.  The service was good: friendly, fast, what you expect.  \n\nBut the food!  Oh hello tasty food.  For my starter I had the mussels and it was a huge portion!  Tasty as well.  My partner had the goats cheese and sweet onion and I had serious order envy, it was absolutely delicious.  For mains I had the pork loin which was so tender, so moist, the spices were perfect.  Partner had the mushroom strudel and claimed it was as delicious as it looked (I absolutely hate mushrooms and didn't even try it).  For desert: creme brule.  Perfection.\n\nMy partner and I had such an enjoyable evening at B'est because the food was exactly what we needed and the atmosphere was excellent.  We will definitely return (there was a cod with lemon mash on the menu that sounded so good I can't wait to try it).  So in conclusion, groupon vouchers sometimes give you a hole in one, sometimes not, and in this case groupon gave me a lovely, enjoyable night out with a plate of food I honestly didn't want to see end.

S'NEW NAME SAME OLD NASTY FOOD. This used to be called Lucky Star and recently changed to "21 Buffet". I was there about 1pm for their lunch buffet and met the lady at the counter who, instead of welcoming me, stated, "7.99" please. First impressions are usually tell tale...... I paid and was then seated by a very kind waitress. The sushi consisted of a few left over pieces that were as dry as beach sand, and had the taste of a moldy freezer. \n\nI proceeded then to the hot and cold stations where I was greeted by grease and the smell of soured steam water.....yuck. The fried items had an overpowering flavor of freezer burn and lacked any other flavor. The warmed clams were swimming in a sauce that was somewhere between bile and piss. In short, don\'t go. Save your $7.99 plus tax and take it to anywhere else....even the "golden arches" are better than this. Oh, the single star (vrs "no star") is for the delightful waitress who seated me.'

My husband and I were dining out and everything was perfect from service to food.\n\nBecause of the great experience, we thought we\'d take the family out during Father\'s Day. This turned out to be a bit of a nightmare. I don\'t know if the chefs changed completely or there\'s a different chef on different evenings of the week, but the food was not great. It was just mediocre. On top of that, the service was way off. There were 7 of us that evening and they couldn\'t remember what each person had. Unlike the first time where they delicately placed the food and settings in front of you, there was a lot of "clanging". It took forever to get the server\'s attention and to get our bill.\n\nMy in-laws\' were not impressed. We understand the experience would be expensive considering they are located in the Windsor, but everything else should be top notch or else what would differentiate it from any other Chinese restaurant where it\'s a fraction of the cost.\n\nMy husband and I would like to give it another chance, but not sure when.'

S"Could do better. Should do better... PLEASE do better JBaB! \n\nI really really wanted to love this place. All very impressive upon entry with excellent music playing, gorgeous timber effect wall paper and a industrial but clean decor. \n\nThe 'build a burger' option is great. If you don't see something on the varied and eclectic burger menu that tickles your fancy, there's a step by step process for selecting bun, patty, cheese, big extra and little extra to tailor your ideal burg. Our burgers were juicy and flavoursome but mine was let down by the extras I picked. The jalapenos were missed out and I felt short changed on the amount of pulled pork on my bun.  It took a while to attract attention of the staff so I had already eaten half my burger by the time the jalapenos were brought out. \n\nThe price on the menu is just for the burger (as the name suggests). For around the \xc2\xa310 mark charged, I would expect sides to be included. The curly fries were tasty but no different to any frozen curly fry from any pub anywhere. I really wanted to delight in the macaroni cheese burger but it just didn't really taste of much apart from fried white carbs. \n\nThe beer selection by the bottle is great- loads of interesting things to choose from although the menu would benefit from descriptions so that you can make a better guess at liking what you're getting. Eye wateringly expensive though. \n\nOverall, a good idea but prohibitively overpriced and not up to scratch in comparison to the rest of the burgeoning burger scene in Edinburgh."

Food seems good, but they had a timing issue for meals.  2 of the 4 meals ordered were cold because the others weren\'t ready.\nAlso, their "vegetarian" menu is not truly vegetarian.  Too bad, because I really enjoy a good peanut butter sauce.  A typical misunderstanding of "vegetarian" wherein fish and seafood products are ok (it\'s not vegetarian if an animal died to make it).  If that concerns you (fish sauce, oyster sauce, etc) you have to ask to make sure.\nBesides their Thai dishes, they have sushi too.  I recommend the dessert sushi for sure!'

I have to say Canada has not impressed me. \n\nIf I could give zero stars I would, the 1 start was simply because the folks there were friendly and the food was prepared fast. \n\nHowever, I ordered a personal size napoli (plain cheese). I took it to go since I'm staying across the street in the hotel. I opened the box to see that they didn't even cut the pizza. So now I'm in a hotel with no way to cut the pizza. Additionally the sauce was complete liquid that was pooled up on top of the pizza, I held it sideways to drip most of it off. Lastly, the pizza had almost no flavor. My guess is either cheap ingredients or frozen/non-fresh ingredients. \n\nHope Canada has better pizza elsewhere but I won't be here long enough to find out this time!"

S"I had wanted to go here for ages as I'd heard it was good so I finally had a chance the other night. In general appearance and ambience it's considerably more upmarket than your usual Chinese restaurant, and the prices reflect that. Mains are mostly around \xc2\xa310 (more for seafood), plus rice/noodles, and starters are around \xc2\xa35. I was a bit disappointed that the menu isn't very different from the typical Chinese offerings, but the quality was good. Not amazing, but noticeably different from the chopped mixed veg covered in radioactive goop that passes for Chinese food in too many UK eateries.\n\nI think the simplest description of this place is an upmarket Chinese restaurant. I wouldn't say the food was particularly special, but it was all nice, well presented by attentive staff in pleasant surroundings. So if you like Chinese food but want more of a restaurant experience than your local takeaway, this is a good bet. But I feel that for these prices I would like something a little more interesting on the menu."

S'If I could leave negative stars, I would. This experience starts a couple days ago when I ended up waiting quite a few minutes to even be acknowledged. Not a big deal, but I\'m the only one in line and it\'s 12:30 at night, so what else would be going on at this time? But I digress. In addition to that, "Roggie" was the most apathetic service individual I\'ve ever met (and I\'ve met my fair share). Not even the slightest bit interested in my order paired with a magnanimous amount of attitude. I ended up waiting an additional 6 minutes for a munchie meal. I left with a bad taste in my mouth as he said "bye" without saying thank you or have a great night. So I left an internal (Jack Listens) review to see what kind of response I\'d get. The manager, "Roland", assured me that he would speak to the individual I had mentioned in my review and that my next combo was on him. All I had to do was mention that he was covering my meal the next time I came in. Now that brings me to tonight. I thought what the hell, I\'ll go back. I did and was met with even more snide speech. I ordered the new breakfast burrito combo. I asked for egg white,  and (I wish I could type it the way it sounded), he repeats it back in the most stereotypical gay way. There is no other way of saying it. I asked for a Dr Pepper as my drink and he repeated it back to me the exact way I said it. I was shocked. He said to go to the first window to which I did. He said the total and I mentioned what I was told to. He looked at me and said in a snotty form that he knew nothing about that and that he would\'ve written it down. "Sorry bout that"  I said not a problem since it would be pointless to argue with such a dense an idiotic person. He then disappeared to get my food. After 4 minutes, a lady came to bring bring me my drink. I thought that was interesting. Another two minutes minutes and she came back. I asked her if she may have known about about the conversation with Roland, to which she replied the same thing said before, but even more attitude! I I then said that thanks to him, I would now take my review public. And with the most fake smile she could muster, replied,  "Ya. You do that!" I drove away to see "Rodrigo" (according to the receipt on this occasion) cowering in the corner which makes me think he knew exactly who I was and the conversation he just denied earlier. And before anyone thinks I am just doing this for free food, I will never be going back to to this establishment even if they PAID me. Yeah, it\'s it\'s that bad. Don\'t go here ever! As for me? Burger King sounds better. Better yet, I get better customer service at the 24 hour gas station nearby nearby then here. You\'ve been warned.'

S"It is Pizza Express so no real surprises. The conversion of the building in Morningside is really lovely and it is pretty airy and has a slightly different feel from the Pizza Express I visited at The Shore a couple of weeks ago.\n\nI did enjoy my visit but why a different rating from The Shore? I think the Morningside branch is definitely successful and this is part of the problem. Morningside doesn't have a huge amount in it - a few bars, cafes and Indian restaurants but for kid friendly places then PE is a magnet. Combine this with the offer of take away then it is bloody busy. Good for a manager, not so good for a customer who is hungry.\n\nWe arrived (after booking) and got our table quickly. We did arrive at 6.15 so if you are not a fan of little people throwing tantrums then eat later. This didn't bother us. \n\nWe had a voucher so 2 courses for \xc2\xa310. Starters we had were sweet potato risotto and a tomato and mozzarella salad were well received. Tasty and we were looking forward to our mains. \n\nNow I like a break between my courses but we must have been around 45 mins between courses. I am still not unconvinced our two gluten free pizza's were not given to another table. Anyway, it was a long wait and it did spoil our experience. My pizza was softer than The Shore version, not so much crisp which I very much enjoyed before. Still good but not as great as before. We were right beside the kitchen area and it was clear there needed to be more people on this section to cope with all the orders. People who arrived after us were out before us and 1hr 50 mins for 2 courses is not great. I was pleased I was heading home and not to the cinema. \n\nStaff are really nice and friendly but my stomach isn't that forgiving. I'll probably come here again as it is local for work but I'll probably eat more before, just in case I have a LONG wait..."

S"I wish Yelp had the ability to give half stars. So many places are better than a 3 star review, but aren't quite up to 4 stars. This would be one of those places. We stopped on our way to get my haircut, primarily because of the reviews it got on Yelp. \n\nThree of us got hot dogs, our youngest got a burger. I got the traditional Chicago dog, and it was pretty awesome. I could have done with the tomatoes being a little more bite sized, it would make it easier to to eat as opposed to 2 quarters of a tomato thrown on the dog. It was a little heavy on the onion, but that was easily remedied. It was still a damn good dog. My partner got the fire dog and kept saying how good it was, and the same can be said for the chili dog our oldest got. My partner got to try the 9 year old's burger and she said the burger was almost better than the hot dogs. So basically, you can't really go wrong with the food. Except for the fries. Not so impressed with the fries. they were a little soft for my liking. \n\nA huge plus for me, they have Hires rootbeer! I never see Hires outside of the Midwest. It's some of the best rootbeer I've had and I was so excited to see it here. \n\nSo the food would get 4 stars... however... \n\nThe prices, not so much. It's a little pricey, considering it's a glorified hot dog stand. They could do to drop it just a wee bit. the other thing that brought the star power down a bit: the service. I've been there twice now and both times the people who were working didn't seem too thrilled to be there. They weren't personable, and it almost felt like we were bothering them, taking them away from the tv. Which, by the way, is always set to something random... generally whatever the staff wants to watch. Get a better staff and drop those prices a smidge and you'll get a full 4 stars from me! :)"

S'I visited this business twice and had two different meals.  \n\nInitially, I had hear great things about the tacos.  The tortillas, however, are not made fresh.  They are prepackaged and reheated.  I can get that in a grocery store or Chipotle, so instead of tacos, the first meal I had was a mango salad.  It actually tasted excellent, however a large number of the mangos in the salad still had the inedible mango skin on, which seemed to me to be a careless mistake.  The dressing had great flavor and wasn\'t too heavy.  At $9 without tax or tip, this was a fairly expensive salad.  The portion was also small and I so I left feeling hungry.\n\nThe second meal I had was their hearty beef soup.  The flavors of the soup were initially excellent.  However, as I dug into the bowl, I found several beef bones, as well as a number of pieces of charred/blackened/burned meat.  There was literally a large piece that was probably about a square inch with a 1/4" thick burned crust on it.  It just seemed like careless cooking.  At $11 for a bowl that was relatively small, I again was hungry after eating.  The waiter seemed particularly enthusiastic about the beans, and I was still hungry, so I ordered a side.  $2.25 seemed like a high price to pay for a side of beans and it certainly was given how small the side was.  The beans tasted very standard and unoriginal.\n\nThe service I received during both of my meals (from the same tall, lanky waiter) was abysmal.  The restaurant was empty, but the service was slow.  I had to actually ask him for a menu at one of the meals and had to ask to receive water at both meals.  I also found myself having to ask multiple times to receive a water refill.  When my waiter was not at the table, I could hear him loudly conversing with a female cook in back.  They talked about a number of inappropriate things and also argued over which music should be played.  This led to a very eclectic mix of music, including songs that were cut off midway through.  The volume was extremely loud and would occasionally be turned up louder for portions of the song that the staff were apparently particularly fond of.   \n\nOverall, there are some fun flavors going on at this restaurant, but high prices, small portions, careless cooking/preparation, and an incompetent wait staff really ruined it for me.  I live in the neighborhood and there are too many great restaurants that are just steps away  to waste your time and money on this one.'

S'Dorcas is one of the best Korean restaurant in CU in my opinion. I love their combos because I always get to try different dishes. My favorite is their grilled mackerel. They give you tonnes of food as you can see from the pictures. The taste is not bad but they need to add more variety to their menu.\n\nUpdate: I retract my last statement. I went there again this weekend and their menu has a lot to choose from. The hot and spicy squid was really good.'

They were very friendly, asked where I was from, etc. I got a very good vibe from them.  \n\nThe hummus and Baba-Ganoush were delicious and came with a large amount of nice thin pitas. \n\nThe Kefka (sp?) dinner came with a large salad and rice pilaf.

Finally having one of us chase him down and ask for the things, the simple things that should have been brought. He brought 3 plate for 5 people and 6 napkins. Along with the beginning being horrible service, The salads we subbed for French fries was double charged according the the receipt on the tablet.

Either it's getting late or the people there are just rude as hell.  Sorry for the fuss, but this place deserve 0 star if possible for what they did.\n\nBecause of rude services, we did not think they deserve any tip.  Ate and paid the bill with a credit card, left and have fun in Vegas as usual.  A few weeks later, my friend saw her credit card statement with a charge from Alan Albert's that was more than what was shown on the her bill/receipt.  Alan Albert's had charged extra on her card.\n\nShe called the credit card company, fax them the bill (always good to save your bill/receipt) and the credit card company disputed with the restaurant.  Credit card company was able to get back the extra amount that they have charged.\n\nWhat kind of service was that?

They had a LOT of televisions with a variety of sports options, but it felt "unfinished" restaurant-wise.  A tavern sounds "homey," which this Beantown didn\'t feel. \n\nAtmosphere aside, I love the variety of food options they offer.  20 appetizer choices?  Wow.  The rest of the menu continues that variety, making it a tough call.  I went with the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which was very big and dripping with delicious hot sauce and blue cheese.  The fries they serve are very flavorful as well.  \n\nSo while the food at this location is a step above regular bar food, the atmosphere is severely lacking, making it not a good place for a "night out."'

S'Salad bar is great, has extra things like pasta salad, and unusual items such beets and chickpeas. Wait was only 30 mins and got to sit at the bar until called to dining room. Bar prices were cheap, good, strong drinks. . Prices for meal were excellent. Friday fish fry -cod & haddock under $12. Amount of fish was adequate, not an all you can eat but with the large salad bar you left full and often with a to go bag. Walleye was excellent.  Bands play weekends after 9 in bar area.  Great experience for us just passing through.'

S"I love this bar! If you've been here before and had a bad experience, I encourage you to try it again. The bar has undergone a change in ownership and management, a remodel, and the hookah and alcohol are now separate. \n\nThe drinks are inexpensive and very strong. (They aren't joking when they call them Stron Islands!) They have 2 dart boards and 2 pool tables for the game-oriented, and new booths for those who aren't. \n\nMy favorite night to go to Green Street is Tuesday. They have Outlaw Karaoke--the same awesome karaoke DJ who does White Horse Wednesday nights, but without the flooded bathrooms. Bud and Miller family bottles are only $2, and Mikey and Dan have a whole list of signature drinks if you're not into beer. \n\nOverall, Green Street is a great place to grab a drink, any night of the week."

Unfortunately, there were no dumplings left to be had, but the pad Thai, spring rolls and mu shu chicken were really good. Will be back soon.\nThanx Vincent!\n\n\nI'm very lucky that this place is just around the corner from me! Did the take-out thing yet again las night. Once again, no dumplings, but rather than getting upset, opted for the steamed pork buns (OMG GOOD!!), cashew chicken, and 4 spring rolls. Plenty enough for the two of us and at just $22.00, fantastic value. I so love this place."

Ummm... bad too-cool-for-school service.  We walked in the back door (which is right off the parking lot and is probably where most people enter) and stood around for a few awkward minutes while some dude who worked there (who we later realized was the OWNER) stared us down.  We even waved to him to see if he would give us an indication of where we should go to be seated - he actually just LOOKED AWAY from us and no one helped us!  What a great manager!  It is no wonder this place is always almost completely empty.  Surprisingly, we still sat down for dinner.  It is so uncomfortable in there - the chairs are folding chairs that I guess are made of bamboo or something, and when you shift forward they fold up on you!!  Unreal!!  I just can't believe this place hasn't shut down yet.  The dishes are decent though - since it is in my hood I will probably go back when I feel like eating some curry and getting treated like crap."

I normally call in my pizza order and then pick it up on the way home.  When I call they always know me by name and recognize that I'm a regular.  I rotate between three different pizza favors, BBQ Chicken (my favorite), Pepperoni/Sausage/Mushroom, and just a Cheese Pizza.  The pizza is consistently good.  The counter staff is always friendly and efficient.  You can tell this Barro's is very well managed.  I've never actually eaten in, so not sure about that experience.

A good cook knowing his business would be aware of this issue. The bread was average. If it was not for the groupon they would have gotten the sandwhch back. I took most of it home and fed it to my dogs. In the world of food its real hard to screw things up when others do it right. For this reason I give it two thumbs down and a no to return dining.'

The first time I ordered pizza last month it came burnt and the manager was rude and ofered no help when i called and complained. This time they did not even deliever my pizza at all. They claimed they call me, yet my phone never rang. I called after waiting over an hour and the manager informed me that the driver got lost, tried to call and since we didnt answer they canceled the order. I NEVER recieved a phone call. i had my phone next to me the entire time. They offered no way to fix this. he simply told me it was my own fault. Before i moved I ordered from dominos at least twice a month.. Now, I have been ordering pizza hut because the service at the lake mead store is horrible. The manager is rude and worthless.

S'We ate here because it was adjacent to the movie theatre at Town Square.  I think we shall also wait a bit before trying it again - if at all.  The decor/artwork, and atmosphere was attractive and interesting.  There was a live band playing mostly country music - with a great guitar player.  The music was so loud that we couldn\'t maintain conversation at the table.  The menu was interesting - we are not familiar with "lowcountry food" but we thought several things on the menu sounded appealing.  Our party of two sixteen-year-old boys and two forty-somethings ordered the fried alligator and the cornmeal fried oysters with horseradish sauce.My SO ordered skillet fried flounder entree, which was served on a rice pilaf of some sort.  He kept reaching for the salt during the meal and afterwards claimed that he "could have opened a frozen dinner and had a better meal than that."  I had a ceasar salad which was boring.  One teen ordered the mac and cheese and was picking at it so I asked if it was any good.  He replied, "actually, it\'s not" and admitted that he didn\'t like the spices in it nor did he like the way the alligator had been flavored.  The other teen liked his pulled pork sandwich.  All in all, a disappointing meal for $82+tip.  And that was with three waters and an iced tea!  When we got home, we agreed that it was too bad that we were disappointed because the restaurant has a lot of potential.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong menu items?  Then I read the previous posts.  Hope Louis\' can fix their problems and I also hope their other upscale restaurant at Town Square offers better fare!  Dare we try it?'

No matter what restaurant I go to, it always takes me an age to decide what to go for and the fact that I like pretty much about every food apart from mushrooms it doesn't make the choice any easier. Tapas is brilliant as it means I can try a whole bunch of stuff off the menu rather than just one main. I'm just back from Madrid and there's tapas absolutely everywhere, even in bog standard bars, it's awesome and I'm an even bigger tapas fan now than I was before. \n\nLa Tasca has an excellent menu and they do an amazing patatas bravas and the two times I've been here the service has been of an excellent standard and the food even better."

But its certainly useful if you're breezing in on your lunchbreak, or hungry and running for a train like Steph was. It's got the usual convenience cafe suspects on the menu - coronation chicken, spicy chicken and so on, but it's really low priced and the fillings are fresh. Inside there are a few seats if you want to stop by, have a cup of tea and read a paper in peace. It's clean and efficient - nothing too fancy but definitely functional.\n\nWhat separates cafes of this description from the uber cool continental coffee houses is how friendly the staff are. This place is no exception - the staff make sure you are well fed and served at super speed - all in all making it a much more welcoming environment.\n\nIt's not swanky, but the staff are nice and the food is good if you're just grabbing a bite."

What concerns, me, however, is the condition of the restaurant and the kitchen.  We decided to dine-in.  Initial impression was good - a fun little pizzeria with a pinball machine and a coin-op video game in the corner.  Another family was seated and appeared to be enjoying their pizza.  Things went south soon after we sat down.\n\nCleanliness is a problem for the restaurant.  There were flies buzzing all over and I was repeatedly brushing them off of our table, my kids and myself.  When the server brought a stack of plates, two of them were dirty and I had to exchange them for clean-er-ish ones.  The kitchen, visible from the counter by the entrance, didn't look super clean either.\n\nI was also a little offended that the flat screen in the corner was tuned to one of those Pawn shop reality shows.  I had to explain to my kids why there was swearing and threats of violence (things I would never let my kids see or hear normally) on the TV.  If the owner expects families to dine there, it shouldn't be the responsibility of the patron to ask the owner to switch to something more family-friendly.\n\nIt's sad - we really enjoyed our pizza but that I won't be returning because I won't be able to eat it without questioning the sanitary conditions it was made in."

S'I realized my faux pas with the last review.  Downtown Phoenix is the black hole of convenient delivery pizza.  Yes, there is Pizzeria Bianco but I have yet to find the time, motivation, and dinner companions to accompany me on a 3 hour wait for pizza.\n\nSo, we usually order from Domino\'s.  Partially because their Brooklyn style is pretty good and partially because ordering reminds me of a blog that had me laughing/giggling/snorting for hours: http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000707.php.  I occasionally find ridiculous stuff way funnier than most people would, and the thought of beef nuggets without footing is making me laugh at this very moment.\n\n*wipes tears from eyes and takes a minute to calm down*\n\nSo the ordering is incredibly easy once I stop laughing about whether or not I want the toppings on the right or the left.  And they have the "Pizza Tracker" which tells you what stage your pizza is in and who is completing the task.  I have to say that Wade has done a damn fine job and I\'m disappointed if we order on a night that he isn\'t working.  Not because other Domino\'s employees mess it up, we have just become fond of seeing his name.\n\nDomino\'s no longer has the policy of delivering in less than 30 minutes or your pizza is free, but they do come damn close.  Our pizza is almost always here in a half hour (another joy of the pizza tracker).\n\nMy only recommendation is to never order the baked dessert thingies; they always taste like garlic because they\'re made in the same oven.'

S"Elbow's pretty close to my flat, so I should really make an effort to come here more often!\n\nOutside seating is always good, until the clouds come and it gets chilly, in which case the interior of Elbow is just as nice.  The largest table downstairs was reserved, but we were there for almost two hours and no-one arrived... in fact the whole place was fairly quiet for a Saturday lunchtime. I ordered the burger with blue cheese - very nice, although yet another of those very thick burgers that you just can't get your mouth around, and the 'shoestring fries' are great (I've had the garlicky ones before too which are also really tasty). Friend had the goats cheese tart which he tells me was tasty too.\n\nThe service is usually pretty good, although for a quiet afternoon the barmaid could have been a little more attentive, however she was the only staff member visible so probably had a lot more to do than just serve.\n\nAll in all, if you're in the area, or live locally, then Elbow is a very solid place to go for a pint and a bite to eat."

S"Totally random stop for lunch in some area of town that I had never been before, but it does appear to be in the lower income part of Phoenix. Located in shady strip mall, I chose the random mexican over the random Chinese next door. It turned out to be an excellent decision. The food consumed here was a simple chicken burrito, which was $4.25 plus I added rice for an extra 75 cents. The chicken was cooked nicely, shredded and all white meat (rare for divey Mexican) and packed into a large burrito with the rice, beans (refried), cilantro and onions. A decent salsa bar was also available and the red sauce had a smoky flavor and the green wasn't watery either, but more a guac sauce. Cucumbers, carrots and shredded cabbage also on hand if desired. Some of my best burros in life have come from the worst looking places and areas and El Nuevo Taquito comes through in that respect. Mexican music playing in the background is also always a comforting sign."

S"Normally we'd go to CiCi's in Matthews (and I've even reviewed them before, if memory serves).  But lately we've been in the University Area more often, which means we're checking out a different location.\n\nIt used to be that this particular franchise looked a lot different from Matthews, but over time, the Matthews location seems to have been cleaned up with a different look, so I'm thinking that the Matthews location was either purchased by the same franchisee, or was told to bring itself up to certain standards.\n\nIn any case, the University CiCi's is a bit nicer overall, with a single buffet line, instead of two, and the decor is nicer too.  Also, the staff is generally a lot more friendly than in Matthews - rather than just yelling out the typically CiCi's greetings, and sounding like they are getting through their shift, they are actually interested in your well-being.  Or they seem like they are anyway.\n\nThe pizza itself is about the same, but the major different here is that if you don't see what you like - or even if you seem to be having trouble finding something - the staff will offer to make something up and bring it out to you.  This is something that all CiCi's will do, but generally you have to ask for it, and the University CiCi's goes out of their way to do it.  Big thumbs up for that."

Kids on scooters, ladies rushing to parking meters from the hair palour next door to put money in the meter with the smocks still on and hair in all kinds of conditions...lol.   Nice little menu of Soups, sandwiches, salads, wraps.\n\nOrdered the Salmon (encrusted with dijon mustard0 salad special of the day.  Was informed it was the last one and I did not go late.  Salad had fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, carrot and came with 2 slices of a nicely toasted bread.  The salmon was over powered by the mustard due to the large amount put on top, so I took some off.  Unfortunately, the salmon was under cooked.  Had a similar salmon salad at a restauant a few doors down recently that was better and less expensive, and that restaurant is much fancier.\n\nNote:  OPEN Monday thru Friday 11 to 9.\nNote 2:  Was advised to make sure the meter was feed, so as not to get a parking ticket.'

S"Erawan is definately a Hole-in-the-Wall restaurant . . . but it gives it character. You definately can't go on looks alone to venture into this thai-rant in the corner of a old strip mall. \n\nUpon walking in . . the cook is sitting in a booth on a computer, the host was texting on the phone but both were very prompt to recognize us and sit us down (granted we were the only ones there). For being a family ran restaurant - there was quiet a bit on the menu. And after placing the order - you watched the cook go into the back and fix the meal.\n\nOn our plates came Ginger Chicken and Green Chicken Curry with steamed rice. Both tasted delightful although I would have liked a little more spice in the Ginger Chicken.  And to finish off the meal a bowl of HOMEMADE COCONUT ICECREAM - such a cool treat.\n\nSo if you are looking to impress - maybe not the place to go. But if you want a quiet atmosphere, with family ran business and some good Thai food . . give this place a try. Just don't let looks deceive you!"

S'Checking Yelp for a place to get a decent burger, this place came up. Now I know that it didn\'t specifically say great burger but the reviews made me think I might be safe picking this place. \n\nWalking in I was glad there wasn\'t a ton of smokers. The bartender quickly came over and asked what I wanted to drink. I got my drink and menu. When I went to order I had to literally point to what I wanted on the menu because he didn\'t seem to understand "I\'ll just have your basic burger." It always worries me when a server/bartender doesn\'t know their own short menu.\n\nI sat playing on my phone for a 10 minutes or so when my food finally came. I instantly was not thrilled. First it was QUITE obvious that the burger was a bought in frozen patty as it was WAY too perfect to be fresh. Damn it, I knew my meal was now going to be only ho-hum. I get that fries are probably from frozen but for Christ sake can\'t SOMETHING show a little effort? \n\nThe bartender asked if I wanted ketchup or mustard. I asked for both. The ketchup came in plastic disposable togo cups. How ridiculously cheap does a restaurant have to be to not even invest in Ketchup bottles? You\'re so cheap you buy big containers of ketchup and portion it out? Sheesh. As I thought the burger was super mediocre. The fries are what you expected from bagged frozen fries. I didn\'t want to die, but it was not what I had been hoping I\'d get. \n\nThe atmosphere is a typical bar and the patrons are all white trash. Two women LITERALLY yelled across the bar at each other trying to decide of bj\'s were considered cheating for a married man. Seriously? Then one women bought the other a shot of B52. WFT? Are you 85? Is this 1982? Who still orders B52\'s? Good god almighty. \n\nI finally finished up my food, got my check, tipped well, and left. Maybe the pizza would have been a better choice and I might be miss out, but I really don\'t think I will ever go back.'

We ordered a little of everything from chow \nmein and honey shrimp ($1.25 extra) to beef and broccoli to walnut chicken. We didn't expect much flavor wise and being hungry we didn't care! The a/c thermostat must have been set on 68 degrees and after waiting to pay, finding a clean table and dodging numerous unsupervised children our food was cold.

And if you're lucky, the owner may join you in a sake bomb, though he insists this is not authentic Japanese tradition.\n\nI'm not a huge sushi person and was mainly brought along by my friends, so I can't comment on all the finer touches on the sushi and whatnot.  I can say, however, that if you ask really nicely you may be able to try a roll that the chefs are working on that is not yet on the menu, including a rib-eye roll that is absolutely delicious and friendly to those of us that shy away from sushi because of the whole raw fish deal.\n\nPrices are very reasonable.  This is an up-and-coming spot that is still fairly quiet, but not for long.  Come now before you have to worry about getting a reservation a week ahead of time.

I swear, service at Filberto's is slow, but this one seems to be slower then usual!  Also, its right near the end of the light rail at Main and Sycamore, so be careful with all the rail foot traffic that happens here.

S'Living in the Whitney Ranch area of Henderson, it\'s a pain getting into "Chinatown" for some more authentic Asian food. Fukumimi in SE Las Vegas is a godsend when the ramen bug bites (and it does quite frequently in our house), but any other Japanese cuisine, other than sushi, had us circling half of the valley on the 215 or 95 to get there, and with the a 2 year old, it\'s like driving with a time bomb. So when we noticed Yatai on our drive home from Fukumim a few weeks ago we got our hopes up.\n\nI\'m glad to say our expectations were exceeded.\n\nInterior: larger than you expect when you walk up, very low key interior design but modern. Very clean.\n\nMenu & Pricing: Large selection and the pricing is very good. We didn\'t see any specials, but the menu was large enough for us not to notice until we were talking the next day. Pricing was very good, most skewers ranged from $1.25 to $2.00, and other al-a-carte items were on par with other restaurants (i.e. karaage was $4.95). We ordered a grilled squid ($6.95 I believe) at the end of the meal that was big enough to be a meal for one person if you threw in a side of rice.\n\nFood: Delicious. There were no \'rave\' level items we ordered, but everything we did order will be ordered again. I did find the karaage on the bland side, but my wife, who\'s born and raised in Japan, told me that it\'s exactly the same way she would get at  izakaya in Tokyo and the other places in America serve it more the way mom\'s cook it at home.\n\nLocation: Make sure your car is locked.\n\nOverall: Definitely will be heading back with a group of friends very soon.'

S'We went for breakfast today.  I had the western omlet and my husband had the SOS "chip beef on toast". My omlet was light and tasted fresh.  My husband said the SOS was as good as his old navy days. He enjoyed it. The coffee was hot, fresh but a bit weak.  But nothing on the breakfast menu was over 6.95. Pretty impressive!  Its good wholesome food at a great price. The bill for 2 of us was $14.00 before tip. I definitely will be back. The waitress was ok. Not too friendly but pleasant. That and the coffee is why I gave them a 4.'

S'Sunday Late Lunch.  -  ISLANDS is always reputable and they live up to their famous tag line "grillin\' & chillin\'".  \n\nI would definitely consider this more of a "burger joint" than a Hawaiian restaurant.   I may be bias since I used to live in Hawaii and had the pleasure of enjoying local island cuisine for many years.   The only thing Hawaiian about ISLANDS is the reproduction decor and the addition of pineapple & teriyaki items on the menu.   ISLANDS BURGERS seems a bit more "Southern Cali boy - who had a knack for naming his restaurant\'s burgers after the places that he visited in Hawaii"...which is pretty much how this restaurant was founded.  \n\nDo not read me wrong and confuse my love for authentic with the passion of a dream.  These burgers are NOT fast food.    You can rest asured that you will get a good, decently cooked, restaurant burger, and it is BIG.   Other items available on the menu include, soups, tacos, salads, ect.  \n\nTwo people can easily split a burger, share an appetizer, and walk out stuffed full.   My favorite is probably the Kilauea Burger with avocado added.   It is a superb blend of spicy (jalepenos), creamy (avocado & ailoi), and crunchy (batter fried, thinly sliced red onion).   Suprisingly, my husband - who HATEs onion - loves this burger.    I think he enjoys it because the onions are mild in flavor and cut so thin they dont have the normal onion texture.  It is pure CRUNCH!    I always ask for extra chipotle aioli so that it drips from every corner of my mouth. mmmm.....   all burgers are served with an unlimited amount of fries.  \n\nThe atmosphere is casual, family, booth seating, w/a separate bar area.  I would compare it to a Chili\'s with a tropical surfer vibe.   \n\n I enjoy this particular Islands location.  It is close to the Fiesta Mall but not on the main mall circle.   It gets crowded but you are not fighting all the riff raff of the cranky exhaused shoppers.  \n\nBonus: \nFull bar with Blue Moon on tap.   \nMixed drinks are good and strong.   \nTuesdays - Kids Eat Free.'

S'Potentially a good replacement for the now gone Tempe Kyoto Bowl. The food is very good, and is prepared in front of you so you know it hasn\'t been moldering in a pot for hours in the back. \n\nThe employees upsell a little too much for my taste, but they\'re new and I think that will stop over time. They also bespeak the healthfulness of the food. (Well really, they talked up the "healthyness," but that\'s wrong, food isn\'t healthy. People are.) This may just be my own personality disorder, but I don\'t want employees getting that chatty with me when I\'m ordering lunch. Stop trying to convince me how good your food is Daniel Webster, just rustle me up a plate and I\'ll get back to you! Sheesh! \n\nIt certainly doesn\'t make me feel sluggish like overly fatty food usually does, it has a lot more vegetables in it, I was able to get my Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice, and it is comparably priced to Kyoto Bowl or Samurai Sams.\n\nWhile they just opened, which usually means you can\'t really trust the Yelp review until they\'ve settled in a bit more, it is part of a chain, so I don\'t think there will be much of a change. The food is yummy, it doesn\'t take long, and it isn\'t terribly expensive for what you get. (My Teriyaki Bowl was $6.80)'

S"Here's a seasonal review:\n\nMy fianc\xc3\xa9e's uncle treats us to the Thanksgiving buffet each year, and this makes the third year running. I guess I'm thankful for that. Hopefully, we get to do it for several years running, too because it's always a nice time. \n\nI've gotta be honest, the idea of going out to eat for Thanksgiving was really foreign to me the first time I tagged along as my fianc\xc3\xa9e's plus one. I thought it might be a really awkward time full of old bitties whose families don't visit them anymore or something.\n\nNothing so sad, though.\n\nThe food is always pretty decent. A skilled cook could spend the whole day preparing a meal and come away with more flavorful turkey and heartier potatoes, sure. For those of us who can do without the mess in our own kitchen, though--and can spare the cost--this is a suitable substitute, for sure.\n\nAlso, in an attempt to make this review have some utility for the other 364 days of the year, their bartenders know their way around a brandy old fashioned..."

(what they had on the menu was very limiting that month or week however many times they change it) So we decided to try 808. My plane had gotten in later then we planned so we got there around 9:30 pm. The place was still pretty full. Sparkling water and roy rogers(my drink under 21) my father had some sort of wine slash beer combo (not together) We order appetizers. ahi tuna dish that they have posters of all around casino, some rolls and then the appetizer sampler. For two people. We didnt finish it but wow... everything was good. That tuna was mmm. Wondering where the hell our main dish was I wait another 20 minutes after good conversation when I finally ask my dad. He informs me we had not ordered it yet. Wow. what? Why had I thought we had ordered. So we order promptly. They had our food out... salmon for me, halibut for the father... in record timing. Everything was spectacular. Downside I wish I could have had wine but alas too young still. I would go back, preferably when I can drink."

We are both two terrible broke college students, so this was sort of a "date night" for us. When ordering I asked the cashier if they had by any chance me any fresh fries. He said "ummm i dunno??" So I politely asked if we could get our fries from the next fresh batch. When we got our fries it was very clear that they were old and they were very cold. I went back up and asked him if we could have some fresh fries like I asked. He didn\'t apologize or mention anything about the situation at all. He just walked away and said nothing. So I went back down and sat at my table, waited a few minutes, and then he shouted "fresh fries!" Didn\'t even bother to bring them to our table? It was so rude. Not a please, or a thank you, or smile, or any  sort politeness or common courtesy from him at all the entire time we were there.'

I didn't care for the coffee.  At that time he mentioned within a week he would have the new menu put together.  Today I finally stopped in again and they have all the new signage and menus in place.  I ordered the breakfast plate and it was fine.  \n\nReal friendly owner.

Carina was efficient and friendly.\n\nWhat I wasn\'t pleased about was that their pickup counter closed 40 minutes earlier than the advertised time. I was getting a smokin\' deal on 2 large "Works" versions at the Monday Madness price of $8.99 each and my mindset had me very happy to cop 2 large for under $20, w/ tax. That I was forced to accept delivery over pickup skewed my "value" calculation by a hair over 20% which was a bit of a buzz-kill, but I was committed, and not about to stiff the driver on the issue. I just wish their website included an "hours may vary" disclaimer.\n\nThat said, I really, really like their pizzas. While theirs isn\'t the same as those made by real Italian moms and pops, and personal taste is always subjective, their offerings have always far exceeded my expectations, especially from a chain operation. I even sprinkled the supplied spice packet (not at all common for me) liberally, which was a surprise flavor upgrade.\n\nYeah, I know that my previous business, in part, enabled John Schnatter to become a multi-millionaire, and allowed him to grossly overpay to re-purchase the ugly, non-classic,  Camaro of his youth that he\'s so proud of, but hey, the pizza works for me.

S'Been here three times and man, this place is mostly bad. First experience here: party of eight, Friday night, every other place around (despite the negative temperatures) was packed. We sat, ordered drinks, ordered food. Place was empty. Drinks kept coming and after 45 minutes, we began to ask about our food. The waitress nervously informed us "it was coming". About 15-30 minutes later, we were informed that our ticket was lost and all food would be comped. \n\nSecond trip was St. Patty\'s Day -- they were advertising beer specials and corned beef and cabbage. Went to the bar to order and the exasperated waitress said "Nothing here is managed well!! It\'s going to take well over an hour for your food" We got Thai that night.\n\nThird trip (what, we\'re gluttons for punishment!) we were overcharged from the advertised drink specials. Waitress was very nice, but not great at getting things spot on (come on, fried potatoes do not count as a salad!). Other than that, things were okay.\n\nFood is fine -- typical mass distributor American fare, but not bad at all. Mixed drinks were weak. Waitresses have always been pretty good/fast and apologetic for their working conditions. I will go back, because I love the patio and the fact that it rarely ever seems busy, which is good when you are not looking for the typical college crowd hangout and just want a big place to order some mediocre food and have a few drinks.'

The pancakes were great, but the omelets were super salty, and the ingredients were the furthest thing from fresh.  The service was horrible.  They kept forgetting things, and it felt like they were trying to rush us out the door, even though there was only one other table there.  \n\nAnother reviewer mentioned having to walk through a service area, and it's true.  To get to the bathrooms you have to walk through a narrow service area that seems awkward.

It was so bad that I took notes on my phone.\n\nOne server was responsible for two separate dining rooms, so we scarcely saw him. Our salsa was ridiculously spicy for some reason, and we couldn't find anyone to bring us water or take our drink order. He waited until our plates had been cleared to offer us refills! \n\nI tried a carne asada chimichunga. I was served a burrito drenched in old-tasting grease, stuffed with bland rice with a few pieces of stringy pot-roast type meat. Everything we tasted was bland. I had to put hot sauce on everything. Isn't that the chef's job? \n\nAfter our disgusting meal, we had to wait about 20 minutes for our check. I was honestly about to dine and dash because it was THAT bad.\n\nThey claim to have over 100 premium tequilas at the bar. Save your money and go to Tequila Cantina on Boulder Hwy."

S"We stopped by for lunch today - it was good - but our first impression was that it is quite expensive. We \n\nspent over $24 for two sandwiches, pulled pork and brisket - 2 fries and 2 pop shoppe pops. Also, we ate \n\nin but were served in Styrofoam containers, cardboard boxes, ate with plastic forks and drank from the \n\nbottles. As per their brochure they own a meat trailer that goes to special events - I think they are still \n\nliving in that realm. Our buns (while fresh) were not toasted so became soggy quite quickly. The fries were \n\ncrispy - fresh cut and lightly salted - good job on those. The meat is apparently the star here, although I'm \n\nnot that impressed - it was good flavor and some original sauces, yes - but for the money (more brisket \n\nplease - a little light on serving size) we should be clamouring to get back to this place, which we are not. \n\nWill we go back? Maybe - if they come up with a cheaper lunch menu we're in for sure. As well, to the \n\nowners, watch some food network BBQ shows for ideas - you need to tweak your meat a little for better \n\nflavouring. As we left we were handed some promotional items - an envelope with a %10 off coupon for a \n\nreturn visit. The coupon they created inside was obviously self made - how do I say this nicely? You need \n\nto re-take the photograph professionally before for it's too late - it is of a bun of meat resting on four lettuce \n\nleaves - it looks awful. So.. bottom line with us, lower your lunch menu prices, toast your buns, use real \n\nplates, cutlery & glasses (with ice) on eat in orders, tweak your meat and after all of this if you only change \n\none thing - make sure it's that picture on your coupon. We are not being hard on this place we want it to \n\nsucceed, and know they will with some small changes. All the best to SOS."

S"Situated on the busy Bruntsfield Place, Globetrotter seems to do a roaring trade around 6pm.  As indicated by its bright neon lights its speciality is fish and chip, yet, as with many other chippies, it also serves sausage, haggis and stek pie suppers amongst other favourites.  \nThe service was friendly but a bit impersonal, although this can probably attributed to how busy the shop is around dinner time.  Everything on the menu is quite expensive with fish and chips costing about \xc2\xa35.90 and other classic suppers costing about \xc2\xa34.50.  At these prices most people would probably expect a near impeccable fish supper.  Whilst it wasn't particularly bad, there was certainly room for improvement.  The chips were pretty decent but the batter on the fish tasted a bit greasy and was wierdly thick.  The actual fish itself, however, was cooked nicely inside and the portion size was generous.  \nGlobetrotter serves quite good food, yet you may come away expecting a little better for the money you pay."

We did some walking on the weekend to identify which places could fit the bill and double-checked on Yelp to confirm and eliminate some options. This place did came as our selected choice being less than two blocks from the Bell Centre (where The Who were playing) and being a buffet, we can time our service ourselves. There were 4 of us and we arrived gradually over a 20 minutes period but the buffet concept did enable us all to eat at our pace.\n\nWith a good selection of soup, appetizers (including some sushi), entrees and desert, it was exactly what we wanted.

S"Ive been to at least 4 Noodles and Co in Madison and this takes the winner as the worst location oft the bunch. As one of the previous reviews stated, this Noodles and Co is dirty.  I stopped in during  non peak  hours on a Thursday ( 2:30). There were about 5 people there total, however, a few tables remained uncleaned  for the entire time I dined inside which was about a good 30 minutes. They didn't seem understaffed and there wasn't a rush of customers. I am not sure why tables couldn't be cleaned during this time. \n\nI order the large Steak Stroganoff as I always do.  My food was delivered to me fast, yet, was barely warm and my steak was a bit dry and overcooked. It was almost as if I got the  bottom  ends of the steak in the pot or however they keep the food until someone order it. My food wasn't good. I ate it because I was hungry and went without lunch for  the day. \n\nMajority of the staff seems to be college students and younger so I am  not expecting the finest food in the world but even for a place like Noodles, I am not sure how you mess up a simple order to where its barely warm. \n\nOne last note, I noticed the dude who took my order hands were disgusting. Fingers nails were dirty. I hope he didn't cook my food. That should have  been my first sign to leave.\n\n\nI am a believer in 2nd chances but I will skip out on this Noodles location in the future."

S"About once a week, the husband convinces me that we need pizza.  Ideally, we would get a real one made by people and not a chain.  But, this is often motivated by laziness and downtown Phoenix is the black hole of good pizza.  We would have to drive somewhere to get a good pie, and we're just not having that.\n\nI have a confession to make.  Even though I'm from Buffalo, NY, a city with as many pizza joints as Phoenix has Circle K's, I like Pizza Hut.  It was always the excursion for us growing up.  Sure, we could get a $5 large delivered from the place down the street, but Pizza Hut was an evening out.  A restaurant for pizza, complete with the low-hung light fixtures and the red plastic glasses, it was a special occasion.  And although their pizza was nothing like normal pizza, I developed a special fondness in my tummy for the pan pizza.\n\nAnd, I'm about to write a review for Domino's as a comparison to this debacle.\n\nWe ordered online + 1 star. The website said that it would take 90 minutes - 1 star.\n\nThey have blue cheese + 1 star.  The restaurant called to say that they no longer carry blue cheese - 1 star.\n\nWe ordered wings that were actually pretty spicy +1 star. They were breaded and had something sweet and sticky on it - 1 star.\n\nThe marinara sauce was watered down - 1 star\n\nThe delivery guy got lost, forgot the credit card slip and forgot the soda we ordered.  Then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it.  Then he said it would take him an HOUR to return with the pop. -1 stars.\n\nThe order was delivered in less than the estimated 90 minutes (minus the pop), he did come back to deliver the 2 liter in less than 30 minutes, and the food was as mediocre as I expected it to be. + 2 stars\n\nI would give a zero if I had to leave the house for this kind of service, but since dinner was delivered they earn 1 star."

S"I am a fan of Indian food, have dined in countless Indian restaurants over more than 20 years, taken Indian cooking class and traveled in India. Most Indian restaurants in the U.S. offer the same exact dishes: Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala, Biryani, etc. Udipi Pure Vegetarian Cuisine offers some less seen dishes from Southern India. I was visiting and at lunch here. The all-veg (woo hoo!) buffet had two soups (Rasam and Sambar), two types of rice (coconut and plain), a deep fried lentil donut called Madu Wada, idli (plump fluffy steamed lentil and rice flour pancakes) a legume dish made with urad dal (a type of lentil more typical in Southern India that I rarely see served in U.S. restaurants) a cabbage dish, and some familiar standbys such as Aloo Gobi, Navratam Korma, raita, assorted chutneys and naan bread. The spices have been toned down a bit from food in India but still have kick. One top of that they made me a mini Masala Dosa fresh to order. The filling was delicious but the dosa (lentil flour crepe) was pale and soft not cooked until it was golden and crispy as I like. The flavors were good here. Not outstanding but very good. I enjoyed my meal in a comfortable booth surrounded by murals of Krishna and Radha while Indian music videos played softly in the background on two flat screen TVs. The d\xc3\xa9cor is simple with some hanging cloth lanterns and a tile floor. Not a fancy place. Could be good for a first date because it's not overly romantic, just casual feeling. You could also bring children here if they have adventurous palates."

Major downfall, is that the salad menu is not in English,  only French.

The balsamic dressing was great. \n\nOnly thing that bothered me was when I ordered a water, that waitress responded "bottled flat or sparkling?"

S'J\'adore cet endroit. C\'est aussi tr\xc3\xa8s pr\xc3\xa8s de chez moi et aussi ,\xc3\xa0 mon avis, le seul bar "in" dans les environs de Lachine. J\'adore le fait qu\'ils n\'offreent pas de Bud ou Coors light mais plut\xc3\xb4t des bi\xc3\xa8res import\xc3\xa9es, soit des bi\xc3\xa8res moins habituelles. (Ex: Leffe, Luk, Cheval Blanc ect.)\n\nL\'endroit comme tel fait un peu pub mais classy, qui rapelle un peu le d\xc3\xa9cor du brutopia. Il y a une grande salle \xc3\xa0 l\'\xc3\xa9tage disponible pour \xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa8nements ou spectacles \xc3\xa0 un prix tr\xc3\xa8s abordable. L\'endroit comme tel est tr\xc3\xa8s bien entretenu. Les employ\xc3\xa9s sont chaleureux et la musique est vari\xc3\xa9e (de Sublime aux Colocs \xc3\xa0 Dylan jusqu\'\xc3\xa0 Aznavour). \n\n Je n\'ai mang\xc3\xa9 qu\'une seule fois \xc3\xa0 cet endroit mais je peux affirmer que c\'est tr\xc3\xa8s diff\xc3\xa9rent de la "bouffe" habituelle de bar. J\'aime beaucoup ce qu\'ils offrent comme plats, par exemple le plus pr\xc3\xa8s du fast food, et on est quand m\xc3\xaame tr\xc3\xa8s loin de l\xc3\xa0, est la poutine aux fromages bleus, sauce aux poivres et canard, qui est excellente. Le menu est tr\xc3\xa8s vari\xc3\xa9 et il vaut la peine d\'en jet\xc3\xa9 un coup d\'oeil. La cuisine est ouverte du mercredi au vendredi de 5 \xc3\xa0 9 mais quand la cuisine est ferm\xc3\xa9e, il est possible d\'amener ou commander de d\'autre restaurant...surtout quand vous avez beaucoup bu, rien de mieux que le McDonald qui est \xc3\xa0 2 min de marche. ;)\n\nLes prix sont tr\xc3\xa9s raisonnables, peut-\xc3\xaatre un peu plus cher que d\'autres bars du au fait qu\'on offre des bi\xc3\xa8res plus co\xc3\xbbteuses mais surtout plus go\xc3\xbbteuses.\n\nEn conclusion, les trois devins (Anciennement Trois Cochons) est un endroit tr\xc3\xa8s tranquille et surtout agr\xc3\xa9able. Prix raisonnables, bonne "bouffe", bon choix vari\xc3\xa9 d\'alcools et spiritueux, bonne musique. Si vous passez dans le coin, je vous le recommande.\n\nCheers!'

S"I give no stars! It should have been a sign to me when we were the only ones there! some other guest came in while we were there, but only 2 other couples. PuPu Plater was skimpy, no spare ribs, and the satay beef was very tough. Egg Rolls had tough cabbage in them, they did however have large pieces of shrimp in them, although the shrimp in every dish we had didn't taste fresh. The sizzling Rice soup was made with old tasting rice. I had Cashew chicken which should have been called celery chicken, cause that's mostly what was there. Plus the celery was hard and stringy. We order combo fried rice, it was good, but I didn't understand why I didn't get steamed rice with our two entres. Over all Resturant.com should remove them from their listing! thumbs down. Slow service too!"

After it cooled off, it is was good very very coco-nutty. The baristas does not seem happy to be there.  They were like "What do you want?  Anything else?  Thank you" ever forced to talk to you.

No need to drive to Cote-des-Neiges area to have some hot Pho soup. It's the real deal, but it may be more pricey 9$ for Large. No need to worry about the parking and again, it may be the only Authentic Vietnamese cuisine in the West-Island."

S'I was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing their sign in the plaza and looking them up online. One Saturday evening i finally decided to go over for a pint and maybe some food.\n\nIts hard getting a new bar going in Kitchener, where you will have more than 5 people interested in dining and drinking in your establishment. \n\nI was so turned off upon entering. 10 people all sitting in silence watching the hockey game while the audio was played over the speakers. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? i almost walked out right then. i felt extremely uncomfortable and I am a hockey fan. It was so quiet i felt awkward having a conversation with my guest, what were you thinking calling yourself a gastropub if this is the norm? You may have been looking for the term "sports bar". \nSecondly, you do not have a extensive craft beer list, no you dont. I  dont think having 3 mill st beers and 3 wellignton beers is extensive, They are mainstream craft beers in my opinion. especially Mill St, and Creemore. The "gastro pub 29 house beer" is Arkells best bitter from Wellington too. Thank goodness the bartender told me. I settled with Beaus Lugtread and got on with it.\nA drunk lady came in and started talking. Normally i would hate this but i was finally feeling like i could talk in a normal voice rather than a whisper. \n\nI had the poutine and it was really good. I was impressed by it. yummy!\n\nNOW; gastropub 29- do me a favor and get your sh*t together. I\'d really like to become a regular at your establishment.'

Then my attention went towards the machine - could it be? Could it be a La Marzocco, sitting on the counter of an atypical environment? Had to step in for an espresso. It was smooth and citrusy and made my evening happy.\n\nGod bless the hipsters for opening third wave coffee shops.'

There are probably 30 different curries you can order, all of which are incredibly flavorful and colorful.  They also have noodle dishes for the less adventurous, and Roti bread that's basically doughy mouth crack.  The atmosphere is first rate for a counter service joint, and the owners are incredibly nice and gracious.  Couldn't be happier about this new location. Highly recommended."

S'Horrible!  If I could give zero stars I would!   My husband and I walked in and sat at the bar.  The bartender got up from sitting at the bar and hung up her cell phone to take our order.  I asked for an absolut and soda which came out as an absolut and something that tasted like flat sprite, but didn\'t complain.   Our server came back to take our food order...a quesadilla and chicken strips then sat down with the only other waitress in the place and ate food 5 chairs down from us.  She then dropped off our food, which tasted like it had been frozen...it was completely lacking in flavor and the fries were mushy, and disappeared when her cell phone rang again.  When she walked by the bar, about 15 minutes later, I made eye-contact and she came over still on her cell phone to ask us if we needed anything else.  We asked for the check which she brought back and "thanked" us, again still on her cell phone!!!  The entire night the manager was standing in the kitchen, which looks into the main dining room/bar, witnessing the entire event.  The only good thing about this place is the ridiculous amount of TVs but it\'s not enough to have us go back again!'

S'I have to agree with Morton F. here in saying that I do not understand the appeal of Big Mama\'s.\n\nI wanted to try it out once because friends were raving about the great food.  I picked a time during breakfast when the restaurant was about 1/3 full, thinking that any lapses in service were due to the high volume of customers streaming through the place during lunch.  I was wrong, however.\n\nIt took our server about 15-20 minutes to appear to ask for drinks.  Before my party could order food, she rushed away.  We waited another 10 minutes before she reappeared to take our order.  Then, we waited for half an hour before anything appeared at our table.  We didn\'t order anything more complicated than pancakes and eggs.  When they finally did arrive, they were nothing special.  I think that our meal, from sitting down at the beginning to standing up at the end, took about an hour and a half.\n\nHonestly, a lot people argued with me when I told them that my experience at Big Mama\'s was less than stellar.  They attributed the long wait to the high volume of customers.  However, this is definitely not the case, as I specifically waited until the restaurant was less than half full to dine there.  If your idea of a "high volume of customers" is less than half capacity, then you need to rethink your idea of what a restaurant is.\n\nI would expect to wait longer for more difficult to cook foods, but for simple breakfast fare, 1.5 hours is unacceptable.'

We waited easily 10 minutes before the same gal came out and claimed she didn\'t see us sitting there (weird). We ordered cocktails (10 min wait). Ordered waters (10 min wait). The worst was when we ordered food and an expediter brought it out, but the crackers that came with the salmon tartare were covered in fennel which completely overpowered the meal. We had to flag down another waitress to ask for some bread to replace the crackers, and again, we waited 10-15 mins (for bread!). By the time I got my bread to eat my dish with, my husband had already finished his meal. For such a nice resort, I did not care for the service at all.

(I usually YELP restaurants before I go out  to eat somewhere but due to the last minute plans I did not have a chance to do so.) And I am thinking - $50 couldn\'t go too wrong.\nEnter the TWILIGHT Zone.....................\n\nOk.   so you have  an English sounding restaurant  but with an Italian Menu, Croatian  Greeter/Manager, a decor that is Southwestern with weird French accents; and such inept waiters who are unbelievable.\n\n  Let\'s start with OUR WAITER.  The manager promptly seats us.\n10 minutes later, our server appears- very friendly- but immediately announces he hasn\'t worked in months since working here years ago and we (unfortunately ) are his very first patrons sinc returing to work here!) .   He proceeds to tell us of his  past misfortunes and  subsequent travels around the world.  Meanwhile, we are thirsty and would like (at least some water) and perhaps order a drink.  When he is finished, I asked  what the house wine was - Response - "Gee, I don\'t know -it use to be Woodbridge but it may have changed.  He just stood there.  I asked- "can you please find out?"  He said "Oh yea - sure".  We also have  no tableware - nor menu.\nCan you spell I-N-E-P-T? \n\nHe came back to take our drink orders and tell us about the drink specials.  I asked if we could see a menu  (mind you we are already  20 minutes into the evening. )  He laughed and attempted to make light of the fact that we had no tableware nor menu.\n\nSo while we are waiting - the waiter for the group of 8 women  seated directly behind  us  (from Chicago, based on their very loud conversation) was telling them a story about  God knows what.  He talked very loudly and kept saying  "those Black guys" in his monologue.  There happened to be a couple (black gentleman with his white companion) nearby who could not help but overhear this guy\'s  very racist dribble and appeared to become very uncomfortable.  The women sat silently and said nothing.  I was about to interrupt him  and tell him that his conversation was rude and to please stop when he ended his rant and left.\n\nThe wine list is from HELL- How can a purported fine dining establishment even entertain the thought of having Sutter Home White Zinfandel ($23/bottle)  and Little Penguin Cabernet - ($34/bottle) on the menu?  What a joke - not to mention rip-off\n \nAbout the food.......\nThe veal dishes we had were ok.  Although the veal (Satimboca and Marsala) were tender, both dishes were very salty.  However, the vegetables were fresh and tender and the potato slices tender.  The bread is hot  but nothing to rave over.  We stuck to one glass of red wine each from the Glass Only wine menu as the bottle menu was lacking and way overpriced. \n We ended  the meal  splitting  the Tiramisou which was very good and supposedly homemade on the premises.\n\nBy the time we left @  8:30 p.m. the place was busy with only 3 empty tables. My son and I could not figure out how this place stays in business considering the poor service and mediocre food/overpriced and  low end wine selection.    Bill for two came to $113 and with our $50 coupon ended up paying  $82 (including tip) .  Way overpriced.  \n\nTrust me -  we will NEVER return to this TWILIGHT ZONE again and if you are wise you won\'t even begin to venture into it....'

S"Yelpers! ~ another little place you've all missed out on ... read on & go have a try!\n\nAtmosphere: Just lovely ~ A family owed place about a decade or so into operation, Vago is a little hard to find on Greene Ave.  It is located right across the street from the Oink Oink toy store (great place too!) ... just look up to see it.  It's a mid to upscale type of restaurant, decked out almost totally in wood panelling.  Very cozy, homely, and extremely well kept.  You'll love going there on a special date or inviting family or business associates for a meal.  Vago also offers the opportunity to dine outside whenever the weather permits.\n\nService: Very impressed.  The ma\xc3\xaetre d' (they have a ma\xc3\xaetre d') is well informed about the foods and offers advice, help, as well as accommodations whenever required.  The staff is pleasant, well organized, and very polite.  Professionalism is tops here.\n\nFood: Top marks here as well.  A generous, yet not over-crowded menu, offers a variety of pasta and anti-pasta dishes, rissoto as well as grilled steaks, chicken, and sea-food offerings.  An extensive wine list complements the menu and is sure to include vintages for most requests.  I personally loved the fact that they also offer much of their pasta, risotto, and dessert dishes glutton free (call to confirm / reserve this option first).\n\nClassy, classy place - loved it the first and second time there .. and many more to come.\n\nIt's great to be back :O)"

S"Ahh I would walk over hot coals to eat here! They have a new item everyday. Also some mainstay items like the veggie burger that's to die for. There's even a little garden that you can walk through to see some of the produce that they use. So inexpensive as well. You can take advantage of the frequent buyer card. 6 punches and your meal is free! I've sampled a lot of items here like the bleu cheese pizza, fresh baked brownies, couscous and an Asian salad that I have tried to replicate but cannot for the life of me get the spices right. I ride a bike so it's a little out of the way for me but I have been known to take hour lunches just to take advantage of their savory meals. Everyone there is so friendly too and I have never had a bad experience. And right next to this cafe is a yummy coffee bar where they serve Italian soda. I don't know how a place like this exists but I am so glad I have had a chance to experience it. Thanks to Bonnie G. for pushing me in the right direction!\n\nP.S.

S'Great little place. Basically a hong kong style ch\xc3\xa1 c\xc4\x81nt\xc4\xabng (\xe8\x8c\xb6\xe9\xa4\x90\xe5\xbb\xb3), with Chinese bakery items, milk tea, and a variety of breakfast/lunch/dinner items.\n\nBoba milk tea was really good (HK bubble tea in this part of the world). Good tea flavor, not overly sweet at all, good boba consistency.\n\nSzechwan pork noodles were also tasty. Came with free small soup which was good as well. Large portion, definitely works best for family style (like most Chinese food).\n\nBaos are really large, might have preferred 4 smaller ones instead of two large ones. These were at least twice the normal peking duck bao\'s size which means the bao to meat ratio seems a little off. The Bao itself was very tasty, the was duck a little dry though. Could have used some of the sauce you use for peaking duck maybe but I might be showing my ignorance of Cantonese cuisine here, not sure if this dish is a "fusion" version of a peking duck bao or an authentic example of some Catonese variant that\'s larger and doesn\'t use the same sauce. Dipping the extra bao in the sauce from the Szechwan noodles though was delicious. \n\n\nSuper friendly service! Though there weren\'t a ton of other people in the restaurant while I was there. The owner/manager/hostess(?) might have a harder time if it was busy.\n\nI will definitely return!'

Having lived in FL and eaten in Miami many times I'm biased to that region but this is by no way a dig against this restaurant.\n\nI've been here 3x so far and this is how each meal went;\n\n1) ropa vieja w/ arroz congri (shredded beef and rice mixed with beans)\n- the ropa was fantastic, good portion, moist and very flavorful. The arroz congri was a little dry but not too bad, especially when mixed w/ the ropa. Next time I order this it will be w/ white rice and beans (see #3)\n\n2) media noche w/a side of tostones\n- great great great sandwich! Pressed perfectly, great portions of fillings, a good sized sandwich overall. A must eat. Tostones... any Hispanic restaurant worth it's adobo should be able to make them and theirs are just fine. :)\n\n3) masitas de puerco fritas (fried pork pieces) w/ white rice and black beans \n- w..t...f... Happened, this meal is supposed to be super delicious and easy to make. The pork was dry, overcooked (its almost like they just dumped the chunks of pork in a deep fryer and killed em). The chunks of pork were also very fatty :( highly disappointed. Then... The rice and beans.. delicious black beans in sauce!! Perfect when mixed with the white rice. From now on any dinner I order :: white rice and black beans, STAT!!\n\nI will def go back even though the 3rd visit was mostly a bust... now that I've tried a few things I know what's on point and what to stay away from.  Things happen, you can't expect perfection -every- time from a little spot like this. :)\n\nBuen provecho!"

The owner came out and talked to my husband personally and to top it off the pizza was AMAZING! My husband said to the owner, "this tastes just like the pizza in Europe."  The owner casually replied,  "oh yes we import our flour,"  and at that moment I realized, of course! the bread tastes amazing on this pizza. \n\nMy mother had the Talapia which was so good! It\'s done in a garlic lemon reduction that is beyond perfection. Drinks and the old timey feel is great for dinner. Plus the prices were great! With free garlic knots and the rest of our meal and drinks only adding up to about $55 for all of us, this was a deal. \n\nGreat Italian joint for the neighborhood.

A friend hosted 20 people at this restaurant and I was impressed by the fact that they managed to bring all our orders at the same time- it did take quite awhile but bearing in mind that we are talking about 19 completely different orders I thought that was impressive. Their poppadoms were scrumptious as well and the staff very friendly. \n\nTheir menu is extensive- perhaps too extensive, with house specialities, family specialities, regional specialities and a lot of choice (even a small section for British food should you happen to decide upon entering this Indian food establishment that you don't want Indian food but would rather opt for fish and chips). Portions are OK- the best value would most certainly be the Half tandoori chicken, but I was impressed by all the dishes I sampled- names I have promptly forgot after my third glass of vino. \n\nA great place to get your Indian food kick in the area."

S"Ah Taco Loco, how the mighty have fallen. This restaurant has bounced around from location to location more over the past few years than, well, a mexican jumping bean(?). As of Jan 08, they moved to a much more conspicuous place on East Carson St. They somehow became co-joined so to speak with some dumpy little bar called the Mill Tavern. I suspect it was so they could split the cost of a liquor license.\n\nSo for those of you keeping score at home, there are 2 strikes:\n\n1. They are no longer BYOB.\n2. The best thing about their previous location on Jane St was the huge, awesome outdoor courtyard. Now that they're on Carson, that's gone.\n\nAnd unfortunately this loser of a restaurant struck out looking. The 3rd and final strike:\n\n3. The food blows. I think the other reviewers are right, cheap, not-so-fresh ingredients = bad food.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you want truly awesome, authentic Mexican, head downtown to Mexico City on Smithfield St (and a new location on Wood St). They know what's up when it comes to good food."

It was about $9 for their buffet take out and they gave you a container and basically you filled it up until you couldn't stuff it anymore, which I graciously did. I found a place on the East side that reminds me of them and the food is just as good. Plus I always had enough for leftovers for the next day.

S'We order from this Domino\'s quite a bit.  Our ultimate lazy meal.  Not only can I find a coupon and place my order on Dominos.com, but the coolest part is the Order Tracker that pops up after I complete my order.  It let\'s me know the status of my order in real time so I am constantly aware of where it\'s at in the process.  From order placed, to prep, to bake, to quality check, and finally out for delivery.  In the age of wanting real-time information, the Tracker is genius!\n\nI love the American Legends pizzas.  My favorites are the Pacific Veggie (roasted red peppers, spinach, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and black olives with feta and provolone cheeses on a parmesan thin cracker crust) and the Firey Hawaiian (sliced ham, bacon, pineapple, roasted red peppers, jalape\xc3\xb1os, hot sauce, and provolone cheese on a parmesan crust) on thin or Brooklyn style.\n\nThe only drawback to ordering pizza is that the dog won\'t leave us alone when we have it, she wants some too and will stare us down.  Funny thing, she only does this with pizza.  I guess it\'s true that dogs often pick up the personalities of the owners and my Bailey loves pizza just like me!\n\nGotta wrap this up now . . . my pizza is "out for delivery."\n\nWhether it is a scorching weekday evening (today: 115+) when it is way too hot to even think about going outside or a late night craving on the weekends when it is just not safe for either of us to be driving, we pick up the computer and order a quick, easy, delicious meal.  Maybe even some Chocolate Lava Crunch Cakes if we want to splurge on dessert.'

I was super hungry when we got our food so i was very disappointed that it didn't taste good. C'mon! What doesn't taste good when you're famished? I really think Krista was just dumb as a doorknob or something because after we told her our concerns she had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert. Trick please! Then, when my fiance asked for a box for his leftover food the simpleton came back empty-handed. When we asked her about his box she said she hadn't heard him! GTFOH you didn't hear our appetizer order either. I will say that the managers seemed to genuinely want to fix the problem. We didn't want anything remade or anything like that but they already had another chicken sandwich being put together and they also gave us a slice of chocolate cake for free. It really makes me feel bad that I ended up hating this place but I was just too through with them. I didn't even want the food they ended up giving us but my fiance said it'd be rude not to accept it when they were trying to make us happy. I GUESS. I wouldn't be surprised if they spit in it or something. Oh and the kicker, my fiance threw up that night. I can't even make this shit up.

They also need to have more serving utensils on the sushi bar.

Surprising they had fresh lobster in the live tank. Was good sized and reasonable for off season at 27$.  Was very fresh as it came off the shell very easily (that\'s why they have a tank of live lobster).\n\nWe also ordered my fav, Cantonese Chow Mien.  Could had used a few more shrimp,  but great taste overall. Good amount of chicken, veggies and noodles.\n\nThe waiters also speak English well enough, but just make sure if you want a BIG portion of something (like shrimp that comes 6 an order for example).  Ask them how many shrimps it comes with, then just say "2 orders" instead of just saying "big order", which just confuses them.'

First off let me say, I loooove seafood! esp. crab and lobster. I guess the Rosewood Grille was formally the Lobster House and that is why I pick it.(because of tha name duh) Anyway, so we went there for dinner. It was only a few ppl there (our reservations were at 7pm) The wait staff was very nice and attentive and the food was WONDERFUL!!! We receive hot bread when we arrived and fast service. My mom and I had the whole lobster which came with a twice baked potato and house salad and my aunt had a pound of crab legs,salad and a potato as well (it was bout 6 big ass crab legs, which were also good..I had a lil taste) \n\nOMG! It was a feast! My mom is very picky when it comes to other ppls cooking, BUT Rosewood grille was on hit!!!(her words) Meaning it has to be good. I was so full I had to take home my claws and didn't even eat it until Sunday evening about 6pm...(I was full all night and the following day. I was so full, I couldn't even have a drink or two at the club that night cuz my stomach was hurting like crazy with all that yummyness I had jus consumed). Overall, our bill was like 268 which included the meals listed above,a long island ice tea for my auntie and sprite for me and my mom. Its expensive BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! I would def. recommend this joint. Its wonderful! I'm goin back when I go to Las Vegas!!!!\n\nP.S. For my birthday, they gave all of us roses and let me take a pic with a 11lb lobster! and YES it was alive!!!"

Maybe there were other things on the menu we would have liked better, but we couldn't communicate with the server well enough to find out.\n\nThe glass of wine was so stingy, a modest-sized glass only maybe a third of the way full, that I sent it back and got a bottled beer instead."

S"It was more luck than judgement that I ended up eating at the Imperial Palace yesterday evening. \n\nHaving not yet seen the latest Bond, Skyfall, I discovered that the only cinema still showing it (just) less than 45 mins drive was the Odeon in Wester Hailes (a first visit for me). \n\nArriving early for the showing, we had an hour to grab a bite to eat. Taking advice from a Juniper Green local, we arrived here. \n\nIf you've ever been to one of the excellent Chinese restaurants you often find above a large Chinese cash n' carry supermarket, the look and feel of this establishment is very similar. \n\nThere were a good few patrons in considering it was only 18:30 on a Wednesday evening and what with most people returning to work after the Christmas break the very next day. \n\nAs we were seated, I loved the fact that there were as many families of Oriental descendancy enjoying eating here as there were Caucasian as I've found that often to be a good indicator of quality when trying a new restaurant. \n\nWith time sadly limited, we ordered food to share. I had to keep the spice factor less than I normally go for as I was with my Mum, who prefers the mild end of the scale. \n\nWith that in mind, we ordered, Chicken Noodle Soup, Spare Ribs in BBQ sauce, Shredded Crispy Beef in Ginger & Spring Onion and some Soft Noodles (vermicelli style) along with a couple of Tsingtao Beers. \n\nMy Mum errs toward starters and the soup was for her with everything else shared. \n\nThe sauce for the ribs was gorgeous with a subtle sticky sweetness. The shredded beef was crispy (when so many places serve soggy). I felt there could be a little more emphasis on the ginger, although it was still lovely. The noodles were some of the best I've had. Not limp, nor too greasy & with the light taste of soy. \n\nThe amount of food presented was easily enough to satisfy two people. \n\nHaving decimated these good sized portions in record time, we found we had a brief moment to relax with a pot of Chinese Tea. \n\nService was exemplary, despite the hurried nature of our visit and the whole bill came to a very reasonable \xc2\xa328. \n\nI suspect I will return under more relaxing circumstances & perhaps have some fun with the dim sum menu."

S'I\'ve been eating at this joint for 20+ years.  There are better Chinese restaurants in town but  they do a lot of things good enough to stay on my list of regular places to visit.  CF is your typical small Chinese Buffet hole in the wall.  This food is above average and worth a visit for a quick lunch if you are in the neighborhood or passing through the area. Several things that I think the do GREAT are the Kung Pao Chicken, Wings and Smoked Fish (Fridays only).  Their Kung Pao is the best I\'ve ever had hands down bar none !  The flavor in their recipe is just perfect.  Also they have great wings.  They are not the typical "hot wings\' just breaded and fried chicken wings.  Their coating on the wings is so good you could open and chicken joint just on that recipe alone.  Think KFC crunchy but with the flavor of original KFC and you\'ll come close to what their wings taste like.  And last but not least...smoked fish on Fridays.  I have to admit at first 20 years ago it was not something I cared for but for the last 10 years it has grown on me and now I get a craving for their fish at least once a month and have to visit them on Fridays.'

S"First of all, I am not much of a Taco Bell person. The only things they have that I like are their Doritos Taco and the Mexican Pizza. That's the only reason I would give them two stars.\n\nWhat I came here for was to try the Cantina Bowl. I decided on steak and anticipating it to be good. NOT! It is basically a knockoff of Chipotle's steak burrito bowl! The steak itself was flavorless and it had the pre cooked taste to it, meaning all they had to do was heat it up. There was rice, beans, lettuce, and some kind of chipotle sauce (kind of ironic since it was a ghetto imitation). Immediately after this review I am going to contact Taco Bell to tell them to either make it better or quit making it and just stick to making the Doritos Taco. If they take the Doritos Taco away, then that will just erase another star on this review.\n\nService was ok and the cleanliness of the place was decent as well. \n\nSo if you are reading this and are thinking about getting the Cantina Bowl, DO NOT GET IT unless you want to ruin your apetite!

They serve coffee, tea, beer, wine, sandwiches, lovely small desserts and a small but tasty menu (that I'm assuming changes up depending on the season given their 'organic' focus from what I read on their website).\n\nBoth our coffees/cappuccinos were tasty and the small strawberry dessert I ordered hit the spot with just the right amount of custard to go with. My girlfriend ordered a croissant that was heated up in the kitchen. Rather than simply serve my dessert and then bring the croissant after it was heated, she waited and brought both at the same time. Excellent service in that regard.\n\n I'd be happy to venture back and spend an afternoon there working given their free wi-fi and also because its likely the best cafe option in the area."

S'I was really skeptical of this place when I walked in and I was the ONLY person in the whole restaurant. I waited for 2 mins before someone came to greet me. I contemplated leaving while I was standing alone at the entrance of the restaurant, but I\'m glad I stayed and dined here because it turned out to be pretty good!\n\nFood: \n1) Hunan beef: stif fried beef with broccoli, bell peppers, onions, carrots, and snow peas with a thicker soy sauce like sauce with a hint of spiciness. I thought the beef was very tender and the veggies were very tasty. The sauce was calibrated just right and the whole dish came together very nicely. \n\n2) Seafood and bean curd hotpot: I was disappointed with this dish because it came out very dry and bland. All the ingredients didn\'t really feel like they came from the same dish, and it tasted almost like they were just thrown together last minuet. There was real squid, shrimp and mussels in the dish but the crab meat was imitation, which made the dish less appealing. If it were up to me, I would leave out the imitation crab meat because it only tainted the dish and made it seem cheap. \n\n3) Pong nong? chicken: Gosh, I forgot the name but it was one of the specials that the waitress recommended. BEST dish of the night! The chicken was very well marinated and so tender! The veggies tasted perfect. The SAUCE was what highlighted this dish! A little on the salty side but very well calibrated with just the right amount of spicy kick to it! Almost like a mix between soy sauce, hoi sin sauce and oyster sauce (but I\'m probably way off). It was just delicious! I really recommend it! (Too bad I don\'t remember the exact name of it)\n\n4) Stir fried choy sum: Loved it! Very fresh and simple, just the way Chinese vegetables should be stir fried. \n\nService:\nBy far one of the BEST waitresses I\'ve ever had at a Chinese restaurant. I don\'t have very high expectations for waiters at Chinese places but because food and not service is what Chinese restaurants emphasize, but I\'ve got to say, she was so friendly, nice and helpful. I asked so many annoying questions about the menu and she was very eager to answer them and she knew the menu like the back of her hand. She checked on me several times during the meal and never left me with an empty water cup, she was fantastic! \n\nAmbiance: \nThey can sure improve the ambiance in this place. Dim lighting combined with a run down look makes this place very unappealing. The booths were uncomfortable and the large fish tank at the front of the restaurant looks very dirty. I question if those gold fishes are happy in that tank. It\'s a very shabby, hole in the wall type feel. \n\nPrice: \nVery reasonable for the food you are getting! With everything that I ordered, it only came out to $40 (that\'s tax and tip included!). The meal probably could have fed 3-4 people, which would only come out to be like $10 each person? I ate by myself, so it was kinda a pricey meal for just myself, but still very reasonable for all the food I got to take home! Yay for left overs! \n\nOverall: \nI would totally come back if I weren\'t so far away. You should definitely try this place. There are a lot of mixed reviews for this place, so I guess take my review for a grain of salt, but if you pay close attention, all the bad reviews are from people that ordered "Americanized" Chinese food. Try the more authentic dishes and ask the waitress for recommendations. It makes a difference!'

I had the herb roasted half chicken with wild rice and baby corn and more baby carrots. it was ok but not great. my friend had the 8oz filet with mashed potatoes baby corn and more baby carrots. the steak was not at all worth 25 dollars it was 2 pieces of meat they were tender but looked like pot roast.

S'Not at all impressed with the food at this dive. Was needing some baby back ribs and this joint was close enough to give it a try. It\'s a large menu for a small place with fried chicken, BBQ stuff, hot dogs and fish fry. On the saturday afternoon, I sauntered inside, the owner\'s mom was the only customer and she was enjoying something deep fried. I did order the 1/2 rack of ribs for $12, plus a side and drink for $3 more. When the nice owner opened my takeout box for a preview, the ribs clearly did not look like Baby backs, but instead were short and stubby and clearly looked like St. Louis style. After a brief 5 minute discussion, this lady started laying out the "nice" lies saying things like well, these are short ribs and are still baby backs, but are from this place on the cow. Now, it\'s not my first time eating ribs, but I did cut her a break since she was the expert and I needed to get back for kickoff. Bottom line: she lied. The ribs are too thick to be baby back, the sauce was way too sweet, the sweet tea wasn\'t sweet at all and $15 bucks went out the window pretty fast. The ribs (see photo) were fatty and the meat did not fall off the short bone either. \nThe only redeeming quality for me on this visit was my choice of side dish. The candied yams were outstanding and a good size side dish. Plenty of fresh yams and brown sugar and this was the true highlight of the meal, but too bad it was the only edible thing on this day.'

S'Absolutely stunning. The meal I had at La Faim du Monde was one of the best I have ever had in my life. My boyfriend agreed with my sentiments, and we spent the majority of the night raving about the culinary masterpiece that was our dinner. Had I eaten here the first night of my stay instead of my last, I certainly would have been a repeat customer. The next time I\'m in Montreal, this is going to be my first stop for a meal.\n\nThis is an amazing, impressive little operation. And I do mean little. The space is rather small, though not too cramped for me, even at full capacity; there is one waiter who services the entire dining room with impressive grace and kindness; the chef who cooks with serious fire and without pause from the open kitchen; and a someone cleaning up in the back, blasting some of the best music ever (from John Lennon to Godspeed! You Black Emperor). It\'s not a fast paced environment--that would be impossible, I think--but leisurely and enjoyable. Truly delightful, memorable experience.\n\nFor my meal, I had the Thali Du Jour, which was worth more than five stars. Served on an enormous platter (the portions are tremendous), I was treated to two portions of the chef\'s choice of curry (one a slightly hot zucchini, the other a milder, creamy spinach), lentil puree (you can choose chickpeas) flavored with scallions and cilantro, organic brown rice, and freshly baked chapati. I was continually impressed and delighted with every bite. My boyfriend had the Mexican Burger and fried potatoes, and couldn\'t stop raving; it was stuffed with brown rice, black beans, fresh veggies, pumpkin seeds, tahini, and chipotle peppers, and was served on a beautiful sourdough bun. And as if that\'s not enough, each meal is served with an outstanding, refreshing cabbage salad, which was unlike anything I\'ve ever tasted. To quote my partner, "I don\'t even like red cabbage, and I loved that!" The food at La Faim du Monde is prepared with thought and care, right down to the smallest detail. Even the water is treated with respect; it\'s flavored with lemon and anise. \n\nI really can\'t say enough good things about my experience here. It was just fantastic. The slogan of the restaurant is absolutely true: a bite is worth a thousand words.'

S"Seriously fantastic!!!  I wasn't expecting much given they are in the lobby of the hotel, Radisson by Phoenix Airport.  The hotel had given me a coupon good for free appetizer, drink or dessert with purchase of an entree.  At most, I was expecting mediocre hotel food.\n\nThe decor is nice, and the place had been busy  in the evenings on my previous two nights of stay here.  On my third night, I decided to go downstairs and give it a try because I was too tired to drive out.  I opted for the Chicken Wings as an appetizer (for my coupon), and then did the Cheeseburger (comes on a Pretzel bun) with salad instead of fries.\n\nThe chicken wings came out and they were huge, maybe 10 or so, totally excellent.  Not too spicy, but spicy enough.  They were crispy but not burnt crispy and the sauce was excellent.  I was going to ask for a to go box when I first saw them since I thought I wouldn't be able to eat them all plus my entree, but I devoured them all!\n\nThe burger and salad came out next.  The salad was nicely presented in a bowl and looked like it had radishes and some cheese and tomatoes, but I knew I couldn't finish the burger let alone the salad, so I asked for it to be boxed up which Erica the server quickly did.   The burger was absolutely fantastic, cooked perfectly at medium well and tasty.  The pretzel bun was amazing, not like some pretzel buns you get when they are way to hard and chewy.  Tomatoes and lettuce were fresh and tasty too.\n\nThe service was great.  It was a slow night in the restaurant, but I was there at 6 pm and the hotel seemed to be pretty empty.  If I lived here, I would totally make the trip over just to eat here.   It was fantastic, especialy since you pay $11 for crap burgers at places like Red Robin and this was only $12 for the burger.  The free appetizer promotion was great, but I totally would have paid full price for the wings cause the were great.\n\nAnd btw... I have never came home and went right to the computer and raved about something, but I am a big fan of the underdog and I think for those as myself who snub their nose at hotel food should definitely check this place out."

I have also gone when it was horrible and made the entire family sick except those who didn't eat a particular item. As the other reviewer has mentioned the place does need some remodeling. The ceiling looks like it will collapse. All in all its not the best dairy queen and its not the worst. The dessert items are good but i would recommend staying away from the meat *wink* *wink*"

S'Again, a great meal in Montreal!  Our last breakfast in Montreal was at Pacini\'s.  We\'d gone there just to check it out - didn\'t know anything beforehand.  We weren\'t sure breakfast was served there, but then noticed it opened at 7am.  Wow.\n\nWe were told to sit anywhere we\'d like, so we chose a nice little table near the front window.  The menu was nice and we both found several things that we could see ourselves eating.  I ordered something that was a cross between an omelette and crepes, but had "lasagna" in the title, and looked kinda\' like manicotti.... I dunno but it was AMAZING!  I also ordered an orange juice (came in a wine glass) and my breakfast was served with a shot of a delicious health drink of some sort.\n\nMy girlfriend had the same shot served with her meal, and ordered a nice fruit breakfast with an over-easy egg on top of toast (yum!) and some "goat cheese apple crumble" - mmmmm.  Everything we ate tasted great and I couldn\'t finish mine though because it was so huge!  Our bill in all came to under $25.  This included a "bread bar" where you can select any number of bread slices from a nice variety (try the raisin ones!) and then butter, jam etc... to go on top.\n\nThe server was nice and the food came fast.  The restaurant looked very nice and clean as well.  I\'d love to try this place for lunch or dinner... or just come back for another delicious breakfast!  It\'s right on Saint-Denis too, so very convenient!'

About 5 minutes into it, we started looking for escape routes.  Just as I was about to back up a bit and sneak around, another car boxed us in.  Its not like they had a huge line either.  That 15 minutes was spent second in line.  They didn't get anyone through.  I cannot speak to the quality of their particular chocolate desserts since we just peaced out.

I had to carry the food and about 25 library books up the hill and got to feel sorry for myself for that, but that certainly isn't Ocean's fault.\n\nThe reason that I gave the place 3 stars is that, while the sushi was good, there were a few things that could have been better.  Ordering at the counter was a weird experience because it's raised and fenced in, so if someone else is up there, things get a little cozy and strange.  There was a guy on the staff who was friendly and quite solicitous, but the guy who took my order was cranky.  Oh, and there was a toilet just chillin in the middle of the floor.  It looked like they were renovating the bathroom, but I'm not overly keen on eating at a restaurant with a rogue toilet in the dining room..."

The broth is very flavorful, whether you get a lighter soup vs. hearty soup, and the noodles taste fresh and are perfectly cooked.  Their other entree dishes, however, are less than spectacular.  Service, while very friendly, was slow.  On the upside, their prices are very reasonable and when we went they had a Thursday night deal where all the food was 1/2 price.'

But, nevertheless it was close by where we were and we decided to grab a quick lunch.\n\nThis was the 2nd time we've had the cheeseburger pizza here. It's quiet tasty if you like pizza and cheeseburgers.  I could do without the shredded lettuce on the pizza, but other than that it's very yummy.  A medium is the perfect size for 2 people.  We also ordered a Caesar salad which was not very good. The dressing was way to tangy.  \n\nFor dessert we shared one of those cookie in a skillet things that you seem to be able to find at every freakin' restaurant in the Phoenix metroplex.  Don't get me wrong....I love the whole warm cookie with ice cream action.  But, geez how about a little originality on the menu folks! \n\nBottom line, if you're in that shopping area stop by for dinner or lunch.

If the price was about half of what it is, I would give it 3 stars. But whatever the price, it's just average. You can get equally good food at your typical carry-out place. We had mu-shu pork, a wonton soup, and a dish with peas, mushrooms and tofu. All were average. Unless you just want to eat Chinese, and have lots of money to throw away, skip this place. Average dish price is right around $20. Unlike many Chinese restaurants, rice is not included with dishes; it's $2.50 extra. Fortune cookies are not included either."

S'I\'ll be honest, I completely forgot Yelp existed.  Lots of my friends are Elite Yelpers, and since there haven\'t been many events over the past few months, their conversation topics have switched from "Oh my god the next OYE sounds fuckin awesome!" to "I haven\'t gotten any free food/drinks and Yelp branded schwag in forever waaahhhhhh!!!!"  So when I went to the UYE at The Vig Uptown last night with Georgie S, stuffed my face with cheap grub and Bud Lights, stuffed my pockets with lets just call it "a couple" Yelp coozies and packs of Orange-heads, I remembered this little website and figured I\'d fill you in on what I\'ve been eating since the last OYE.  God damn that was a long sentence.\n\nKFC Double Down muthafuckas!!!!!!!\n\nYes, that\'s right, I\'ve literally eaten KFC Double Downs for every meal for..... when did they come out?...... I don\'t know whenever they came out.  If you don\'t know what a Double Down is, then you obviously don\'t watch enough ESPN and other channels that target fat lazy dudes.  The KFC Double Down is the brainchild of what must be the fattest genius on Earth, designed specifically to trigger the glutton-reflex in the human brain.\n\nPicture this:\nTake a delicious chicken sandwich from your favorite joint.\n\nPut bacon and a sweet tangy sauce on it.  Hungry aren\'t ya?\n\nBut something is missing right?\n\n\nNOW TAKE THOSE TWO PANSY ASS PIECES OF BREAD, THROW THAT SHIT BACK INTO THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW, AND SAY "GIMME ANOTHER PIECE OF CHICKEN BITCH!\n\nYou don\'t need bread!  Just put the freakin bacon and sauce IN BETWEEN the chicken filets!  You like grilled chicken?  Get grilled chicken.  You like fried chicken?  Get fried chicken.  \n\nOr you can follow in my Chicken Jesus-like footsteps and get one of each.  QUADRUPLE DOWN!!!\n\nSeriously, I know most of you are all "GROSS!!" and thinking that I must be a raging alcoholic or constantly high to like this thing, but trust me, IT. IS. INCREDIBLE.  Eat a bunch of salads all week and tell yourself that you\'re healthy, go get a KFCDD, a 40 of OE, and sit on your ASS and enjoy the wonders of a true poultry masterpiece.  \n\nPlus you need protein homie, you\'re lookin a little flaco.

S'An elderly Las Vegas restaurant that serves primarily Swiss, German, and French dishes in an atmosphere matched in antiquity only by your grandmother\'s rotten old living room. Swiss Cafe has been a Vegas institution since 1972. I remember eating duck with juniper berries here for Thanksgiving when I was in elementary school. They have yet to update a single furnishing or decoration in the intervening decade since. The alfresco dining area has seen better days- the marble tabletops are stained and chipped, the white fencing is rusted, and the "garden" greenery has been laid to rest for sometime. In defiance of its stale, VERY Swiss interior, the food here is good. I don\'t like Swiss or German or Austrian food - in fact, the entire time I was in Germany and Austria I avoided eating anything traditional (save for pig knuckle and beer). However, the schnitzel here is something I will eat for the sake of tradition and not completely hate it- it\'s lightly breaded, almost like a tempura rather than a big thick coating of greasy breading like you find at Vegas\' Hofbrauhaus (which, by the way, is an insult to the original). Entrees come with fried spaetzle, which I found too crunchy, and sweet purple cabbage is served in place of sauerkraut, which was very good. The escargot was decent enough, although they serve them in "their" shell making eating one of these suckers an exercise in dexterity. The soups are okay- the shrimp bisque was creamy and subtle, the French onion was unspectacular. Not too many fun German wine options - the only Riesling on the menu was $60. Service is very good because this place is always so dead (only two other tickets over the course of our three hour dinner). Overall, Swiss is a casual, relatively inexpensive continental restaurant that is worth going to for the excellent Schnitzel and the vintage vibe.'

The homemade potato salad is full of flavor along with the Chicken Kebap, served with salad and butter rice. The ownership is wonderful and I always feel very comfortable eating here.

It came totally wrong. I asked for a vegan salad, not specifically, but that\'s how I ordered it, and it came with chicken and cheese. This just shows a complete inability to read the order. People make adjustments all the time. I have worked at a restaurant. I have fucked up. I should have been lashed 40 times! Read what people order! \n\nSo when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be, I ordered a veggie sandwich instead, which, to their credit, they delivered and took off the bill. \n\nThe best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich. It was a monumental fucking embarrassment. I cannot believe they let that thing out the door. I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it, ingredient by ingredient, with the preparer... Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes, mouth, stomach, etc.\n\nI just hated it. A lot. \n\nSorry, I\'m sure you\'re nice people with good intentions.'

Sushi can be hard to come by downtown, so any one passing through, hanging out , or working downtown please go into oxford center and try sushi and rolls. Take the escalator down to the food court.  \n\nThis is a favorite lunch date spot for myself and my boyfriend.  He actually encouraged me to write this review.  I normally stick to one of the bento dishes\nThe Bento I get  it's normally 8 pieces of sushi spicey tuna, or california roll, gyoza dumpling and chicken terriyaki. I have also had the nigiri shushi so yummy.  Sushi and Rolls Edo sushi is worth trying to.  The flavor of the edo terikaya  sauce is heavenly and sweet. I can tell in the flavor that who ever has made the sushi rolls has had a lot of practice.\n\nCast away any prejudice you may have about food court sushi.  There are premade benton boxes that you can choose from, but the owner has no issue making your order fresh. \nSushi and rolls is always fresh and fast they make the sushi while you wait,  if  what you want isn't already on display."

S'You would think it would be hard to screw up a concept as simple as Subway but this one has managed to underwhelm me on two separate occasions.  The first time I figured it was just a fluke, but going again today and getting the same service confirms that this is just how this place operates.\n\nI walk in today and there\'s a couple people sitting at tables but no one in line so I walk right up to the counter.  There\'s a girl behind the counter standing in the doorway to their back room and she kind of looks at me but doesn\'t say anything or walk over right away.  After a little bit she finally makes her way over to me, still doesn\'t say anything and starts putting plastic gloves on.  Then I think she might have mumbled something but I didn\'t hear her, she finally made eye contact with me though so I went ahead and told her what I wanted.  She seemed to be doing okay with actually making the sandwich until it came to the veggies (maybe she\'s got something against them?) because she practically pinched the lettuce and spinach to put on my sandwich.  No handful sized servings here apparently.\n\nWhen it came time to pay a guy was at the register to take my order and he asked the typical questions about whether I wanted it to go or not, did I want to make it a meal, etc. and then he gets to my total and says it\'s $6 something.  It took me a second but I thought about it and I only got a 6-inch sandwich with nothing else, so I asked him "How much did you say you\'re gonna charge me?"  To which he laughs and says, "Oh, you caught it!  Haha, April Fools!"  Ummmm.....I\'m sorry but I\'m not laughing.'

This place is a greasy spoon, and an average one at that.\n\nFirstly, its shabby - this place needs a lick of paint so badly it is depressing. Just somebody to make it more light and airy, and less like some kind of caffeine serving dive bar.\n\nThe food is not good - its presented poorly, and you just know deep down that you may have ordered something with a salad, but at some point that salad has been on the floor, and then deep fried to cover the taste. Yummy. On saying that though, while the food was a bit on the poor side, it was cheap and oddly enough I did enjoy it, but in a 'it satisfied my hunger' way rather than the way i would enjoy a gastronomic feast from a michilin star restaurant."

There is an older man who literally takes ten minutes to make a salad or sandwich because he doesn\'t understand English very well.  Then there\'s another young guy who doesn\'t listen and puts the wrong things on the sandwich (even if you repeat the same word over and over... if I say "pickles... pickles... PICKLES!", I probably want pickles).\n\nStill, this is down the street from my apartment.  It\'s clean enough.  The service is lacking, but not enough for me to avoid the place.  Whatever.

S"This place is located right in the omni uptown Charlotte lobby.  I came here one night because I was staying at omni and didn't want to walk far for food.  I came here not expecting much because usually hotel bars/restaurants are overpriced and average at best.  Surprisingly this place is within reasonable price $15 bucks for a filling meal. I got their standard burger on the menu and it was well prepared and cooked (I like mine medium), the bun on the burger was very soft, and the fries complemented the burger to perfection :) OH YES they also serve you complimentary wasabi peas/Japanese snacks as you wait for your main entree.\n\nSince I stay at the omni for work I will probably drop by here from time to time.  enjoy!"

S"Not very vegetarian friendly, but friendly nonetheless. \n\nWe tried the only veggie entree we saw on the menu and it was pretty good - with lots of yummy beans and fresh vegetables including some delicious variety of squash and corn on the cob. We thought it looked overly expensive on the menu ($14 entree in a sorta hole in the wall type of place), but the portion size ended up being big enough to feed a family of four. It came with rice and peas, sauteed cabbage and plantains. I was a little afraid of the sauce because I could not identify its contents, but I have picky dietary quirks. I would have liked some sort of scotch bonnet hot sauce to add to the dish, but they only had Red Hot - Wing style version, which is gross. \n\nI think meat eaters might love this place if they knew it existed. I have lived around the corner for years and only recently discovered it - it's hidden! They carry a good selection of sodas, made with real sugar, such as Ting. The couple who now own the place are extremely nice and their daughter is a wonderful dancer. Meeting them and their children was seriously heartwarming. \n\nFYI: Cash only. BYOB."

The second pizza was even free courtesy of the manager because of it. and both times I was told that it would take 45-60mns and took close to 2hrs. I was accommodated for my dissatisfaction, so the reason for me writing this is not to come down on the staff, but there needs to be a change.

I saw a groupon deal for a brunch, and was definitely interested.\n\nI just didnt want to be disappointed- and my prayers were answered! \n\nThis place was SO chic and sweet/savory on your palate--- my husband got french toast three different ways, and it was amazing! (each on of them was divine) and very filling... I ordered a veggie omelet, with amazing side potatoes, a housemade ketchup sauce and was given fruit on the side.\n\nWe also had a side of crepe, and I simply could not comprehend how it could be that good, without ANY topping (great batter). \n\nThey also give a great side of french bread, toasted in their brick oven (if I could remember correctly)--- I also ordered a side of jams that they had, which also was wonderful tasting and complemented the bread very well.  \n\nIf we didn't have our Groupon, I'd go anyway.. it wasn't about the money after visiting this place-- and I should comment that it was VERY reasonably priced (without the coupon).\n\nI will ABSOLUTELY be back on my next visits to Montreal--- this one is a winner/keeper and I hope people definitely check it out!"

I had something called scungili salad. Scungili is conch, which people from the East Coast might recognize. I had never had it and it was absolutely delicious. I get the impression you need to know what to order here though, because the pizza was nothing to write home about and most of the Italian dishes looked like Italian American gut bomb food.

S'Salvatore\'s is HERE IN MADISON! Woohoo, the Yelp favorite pizza is here!! Let\'s cheer! No more driving to Sun Prairie for Salvatores!\n\nI was surprised by the size of Salvatore\'s, maybe 8 tables or so, and the bar area is small. So, I was really thankful to visit on a weekday, when I didn\'t need to wait for seats, and food didn\'t take too long to arrive. If you\'re lost, it\'s right next to Johnson Public House, and have pizza board with skulls saying Wisco on them (So hipster :p)!\n\nThe menu has great selections - lots of appetizers, make your own pizza, specialty pizza and tacos!!! Pretty excited about all these things. Also, there\'s a good selection of beer and non-alcoholic drinks. \n\nI loved the carbonara pizza - eggs, bacon, cheese. my FAVORITE THINGS. AND, how is it possible that ALL 3 eggs were RUNNY. Such an amazing creamy, rich flavor with runny yolks! The crust of the pizza is thin crust, though not italian thin, but has great chew to it. (P.S. the ~8"/$14 pizza was so big, we had some leftovers; the leftovers were AMAZING. just heat them up in the oven. oooohhhhh good)\n\nWe also tried the bacon and cheese bread (even though it was similar to our pizza..), the sriracha sauce added some much flavor and depth! LOVE IT. \n\nDefinitely gonna be visiting very soon again! How about some delivery very soon??? Please? :D'

S"If you happen to be spending your day across the street in the courthouse - or in the vicinity for any other reason - and have the chance to make a break (past those obnoxious metal detectors), then Esposito's is a decent choice.  They even have daily specials.  I don't know if they vary, not having been in the area often enough to tell, but when I have been there they are something like two slices and a drink for a few bucks.\n\nThe slices are a pretty fair rendition of a New York-style pizza, and if you can get there early enough (meaning in front of the rest of the mob trying to get their food and get back to the courthouse), then it comes out fairly quickly.  If you get stuck in the middle - or worse, at the end - then it may be a bit slower, but even worse, you have to wait in a line that doesn't move very fast at all.\n\nAs a nice bonus, they also have a decent cannoli - possibly even better than some of the bakeries in the area.  Though I don't think the shells are freshly made in-house (I could be wrong), it tasted better somehow.  They would have been nicer with something other than chocolate chips from a bag, but hey - you can't be too picky, right?\n\nThere are also other items on the menu, but since I've only been there once, I can't really speak to them.  They do take cards, which is nice since you don't have to have cash on you."

S"I finally, finally tracked down the Umami cart at the farmers market!! My friend and I split 3 buns plus a side (edamame or wonton chips) for $10; pretty pricey for a food cart, but not so bad when you are splitting with another person. \n\nWe got the pork belly bun, the bulgogi bun, and the spicy tofu bun. Of the three, I was only very impressed with the pork belly and bulgogi buns. The meats are marinated well and cooked even better. I thought the additional condiments (hoisin sauce, cucumbers, etc.) were a nice touch that helped add a different flavor dimension (and crunchiness!) to the buns. \n\nI, however, did not like the spicy tofu bun. I'll give them credit for offering a vegetarian option, but the slices of tofu are way too thick and way too bland for the spicy sauce (which is really just mayo + sriracha) to counteract. Nice try, but I'll pass. I was also not very impressed by the buns themselves - they were way over steamed, which made them difficult to chew.  \n\nMy biggest gripe was with the slow, slow service. I understand that they make each bun to order, which is great, but if that is the case, there really needs to be more than one person in the cart. One person taking orders and one person putting the buns together would make the process go much more smoothly and quickly! \n\nFive stars for the bulgogi and pork belly buns and three stars for the service averages to a nice, even four stars for Umami Buns."

S'Realistically, the only thing keeping the rating at 2 stars instead of just 1 was the closing of the experience.  The service was incredibly slow for being the lunch rush, especially since there were not more than 4 customers in the store. \n\nAs far as the menu goes, the choices are immense!  The coupons offered in this weeks paper were abundant and very well worth using.  The counter person was nice, used suggestive selling and had a smile.\n\nThe down side was the kitchen.  There were not that many people in the place and even if the Drive Through was packed, they can still only take one order at a time.  It seemed to be an unnecessarily long wait for a couple of burgers. \n\nAgain, save the day by the counter girl who apologized for the delay and then gave me a chocolate chip cookie as a consolation for waiting so long. \n\nAs far as the food goes, the burgers were both tasty.  The menu was so expansive it will take several visits to get through the bulk of it.  Not only your typical burger fare but salads and the connection of another fast food joint called the Green Burrito, they had a wide array of Mexican dishes as well. \n\nA short review for me, I know.  Bottom line is this.  The kitchen service was terrible, the counter service was nice.  The burgers were OK, good enough to go back a 2nd time as maybe the experience was not the normal.  When it comes time to return, I will amend this review.  Until then, Enjoy!'

S'I\'ve eaten at Pizza Huts all over Phoenix and all across the United States.  While this chain doesn\'t produce a pizza that would compete with one served to the gods on Mount Olympus,  you can usually be assured of a decent pizza at a reasonable price.  At this particular Hut in Anthem I have "dined-in" and "ordered-out".  The dining room is small and pleasant but best of all, the service was superb.  We have also picked up pizza here and taken it home to eat.  Most of the time the pizza has been OK.  Unfortunately the last time we ordered out, we ordered a "thick crust super supreme"... which turned out to be far from super.  It was primarily a piece of flat bread with what appeared to be an artists rendering of what a pizza should look like from directly over head.  There was very little in the way of any real toppings on it.  It was just a tomato red color with some faint impressions of pepperoni, onion, peppers and some of the other normal condiments.  I am hoping this was just a one time slip and not an attempt on the part of Pizza Hut to cut costs by eliminating the volume of most of the toppings.  This was one of the "specials" that Pizza Hut runs periodically where you can get any size pizza for ten dollars.  I would rather spend more money and get a real pizza rather than a facsimile of a pizza.  Pizza Hut is usually a solid Yelp three star dining establishment, but on this one particular visit, it sunk to 1 1/2 stars.  As I previously stated, I hope this one time was an aberration.  I will try one more time... but only one more time; if the product turns out as abysmal as this last one was, I will go elsewhere in the Anthem area for pizza.  We shall see.'

S"NOTE- 5 stars for a fast food place, not the Phoenician.\n\nThought this location deserved an updated review, in light of the current ones posted.  \n\nBeen twice to this location in the last week- once eat in with my kids and once drive through.\n\nBoth time, our orders were accurate.  Everything was very fresh and seemingly prepared moments earlier- taco shells crunchy, hot things hot, cold things cold.  Lettuce fresh and crisp, Mexican Pizza bubbling with heat.   \n\nThe staff on duty this Sunday afternoon were friendly and sharp.  while we ate our lunch, I noticed that on two separate occasions, someone came out to wipe tables and check trash.  No complaints here. \n\nI have a theory- with the Fry's Marketplace (sharing the same parking lot) recently remodeled, there is a huge draw of traffic to this location.  Perhaps the Taco Bell got their act together so as to not lose easy business.  No matter the  reason, they appear to have pulled it together nicely."

S"La Palapa used to be an unsuspecting stand in the Strip District, a hidden gem to stumble upon for the best authentic Mexican grub in the city.  Now, La Palapa has moved to the South Side (taking over Thai Me Up's old location)--and the food as only gotten better.\n\nIf you don't want to try a taco or quesadilla, which are excellent, I'm a huge fan of their mole chicken (mole poblano con pollo). A cup of their soup goes a long way, too, and they have a solid variety to choose from--tortilla, black bean, fish, and vegetarian.\n\nI haven't tried any of their desserts yet, but I can't wait to come back and try the flan. It's a small space, fairly unsuspecting, but it's hard to be let down with something this authentic."

S"Mariscos Chihuahua has always seemed to me like.a seafood Filiberto's. I always see them on the side of the road, generally in shadier areas, with that signature blue roof and a busy parking lot. Still, I'd never met anyone who had actually gone to Mariscos. \n\nIs there a Yelp Whitey Badge? If so, I just unlocked it.\n\nJenny and I were in the mood for fish tacos but had no patience for the kind to crap Rubios or these other Mexican places try to pass off as over-breaded, deep-fried, fish sticks in a tortilla. We wanted good good seafood and, damn it, if anyplace was going to be able to hit that mark, it was going to be a place named Mariscos.\n\nWe parked in the back and entered the small shop with a man at the counter and a couple eating in the corner. I think a man and woman were the only people working. She took our drink orders and discussed any questions we had on the menu.  We ended up with some shrimp tacos, fish tacos, and seafood cocktail dishes. All were excellent. I have to say, we are now Mariscos fans por siempre!"

S'We two families ate there last week. The sushi was unique and, for the most part, outstanding. The seasoned edamame was quite good with the exception of the southwest sauce (too sloppy), but the southwest dry seasoning was great. As for the sushi, we all loved tuna tartar appetizer.  It was like nachos for sushi lovers!  How cool. The good to great rolls included the big daddy, spicy tuna, and banzai (which included jalepeno). I felt that the tootsie roll was too heavy with eel sauce but it was still enjoyed by all. For that matter, I believe that their eel sauce is too thick whenever applied.  It made things oversweet.   The miso soup was good but also a tad heavy.  Finally, the service was flawless. \n\nWe will be back!  Yum.'

S"The New Dynasty is one street west of St-Laurent, in the heart of Montreal's Chinatown. It's a tiny side street which I enjoyed walking through. \n\nThe place has the typical Montreal chinatown look. Plastic table cloths, huge tables and waiters that speak some French and English. Ours was particularly funny and helpful, and particularly friendly.\n\nI ordered a spring roll, four steamed pork dumplings (pictured), and kung bao chicken (chicken with cashew). My sister ordered the crab. \n\nThe dumplings were excellent, but they were shrimp and not pork as I had asked for. The were well cooked, and of big size. The crab was delicious, and my sister couldn't stop raving about it. My chicken was a dissapointment. The colours were stricking, with a very very bright orange sauce (also pictured). Unfortunately, the sauce was blend and not spicy at all (it was supposed to be a spicy dish, and I requested it to be even spicier). I did end up biting into an uncooked jalapeno, so I guess I did get some spiciness. The chicken was good and the vegetables were ok, but it was nothing special.\n\nThe bill was moderate. For both of us, it ended up being about $37 with taxes and tip. The service was good, and the food was excellent for the crab and appetizers, but not the chicken. Overall, I'd certainly go back but I probably would first venture a little more into chinatown and try something else first."

S"I have a feeling others may have found this place awkward because it's new. We talked to the man working there, and he says they are just getting up and running, but had been having some trouble getting word out, and it was a slow start. There were 2 workers, they were both super friendly. \n\nThe food and style is like Chipotle. My husband LOVED the food - even better than Chipotle. I did not. There is nothing wrong with it, but I just don't like the flavors. The mild salsa is too sweet and reminds me more of a sauce, the medium was better but too hot for me. There is no brown rice. I don't care for the sauce, and I just don't like the taste as much. \n\nI went because of a Groupon - otherwise, I would have never known this place existed. The atmosphere I thought was nice - very clean, good space, the TV at the bar is on, and they did have other drinks. 2 of their fountain drinks were out, which was a bit of a bummer. You can tell they are still finding their footing as a business, and getting started though. I think if more people knew about them and gave them a shot, they might do well. I just don't care for the tastes and flavors myself, but it might be other peoples cup of tea (like my husband, again he loved it) \n\nThe burrito we got was as big if not larger than Chipotle, which seem to be skimping on their meat lately. I think Carnivores will improve as they get going - give them a shot."

S'"Not another pizza joint in Downtown Tempe?!"  I can hear it now, because I said it too the day I saw the coming soon signs.  But, hold the phone, this new pizza joint is a bit of an aberration.  Offering thin crust - made to order- pies, their mozzarella is whole milk, not shredded and smothered over the pizza like the standard slice, and their ingredients are fresh and they are made in lightning time.  We ordered our pizza and it was made in front of us and done by the time we sat down with our sodas.  Within 5 minutes easy-- making it an option for a fast lunch.  I\'d recommend the Spicy Butcher for something with a little kick, but their other pizzas are good too.  (Gluten free crusts available for those into that trend.) This is a very nice addition to the "College Avenue mini-food court."'

S'Judging by the 5-star reviews this place has I can come to only 1 conclusion.... the people reviewing this place have NO concept of good sushi.\n\nI\'ve been here a few times, most recently for the $18.95 All-You-Can-Eat sushi deal.  The AYCE deal is a rip off.  They only let you order 3 items at a time, have a very limited menu to choose from, take 20-25mins between orders, and they physically make the sushi different.... meaning when they fill an AYCE order they give you a huge lump of rice topped with a razor thin slice of fish.  When you order from the non AYCE menu they serve a proper nigiri.  Bullshit.\n\nNon-AYCE speaking their food is nothing to get excited about.... their rolls are sloppy and are boring.  The fish is not that good and frankly didn\'t taste of superior quality.  The atmosphere is loud, bright, and full of televisions.\n\nIf you have never left Gilbert and think Safeway has "bomb sushi", well you will be in heaven here.... otherwise you would be well advised to seek sushi somewhere else.'

S"Montreal's bistro scene is a bit overloaded - two years ago this place would have gotten 5 stars but the total overload of French restos in the Plateau is starting to fatigue everyone. They're all generally good but they're so similar, they're starting to blend into one another.\n\nCocagne, in particular, has a really open, light layout. There's lots of space but it's no cavernous and impersonal. The decor is simple and elegant - red accents throughout, dark wood, and some really colorful striking artwork adds the right ambience. \n\nThe service is great - the two waiters were extremely friendly and very verbose in their descriptions of everything offered. We went with some lamb ravioli, roasted piglet, roasted fowl, and chocolate/hazelnut cake. Everything was perfectly done, nicely presented, and delicious. The bill came to a predictable $160 for two, including wine, and that's sort of the theme here - predictable, good bistro fare.\n\nOverall, nothing too risque - Cocagne is just a good, simple, solid experience.

S'Great little friendly Vietnamese restaurant just on the perimeter of Marche Hawaii.  I come for the Spring rolls that make a great appetizer with ingredients I\'m buying at MH for my Asian dinner!  Usually I buy two pork and two chicken.  They come with a fantastic peanut sauce that you want to lick the container clean "like a starved raccoon"!  They have many other grat looking dishes like Pho, Banh Mi sandwiches and lots else.  I will try more one day!  I swear'

The meat is old, the veggies look horrible and the place just can't seem to get it rite. I've had it with this pale and will never buy a sandwich here again. Don't try and save money but yet and still charge the customer  the same price for old meat and veggies. Shame on this place!!!!"

S'Been a while since we had Burger King, now if it was my daughters choice. This place would have a five star rating! Burger king is her favorite place to eat. But she has no choice on this! You get exactly what you expect. Fast food chain, with medicore food! Service was actually five stars, kind of hard to believe huh! But I have never been impressed with their food. Since we have moved to Arizona, wife and I have made it a point of not eating at fast food chains. And after eating here, that just reassures us of why!'

S'One of the main reasons why I like the Saz, is because it is NEVER overwhelmingly busy. There is always a place for you and three or five other friends to sit.  When Mediterranean Cafe has customers out the door, and the generic State Street food court crap won\'t do... this is when the Saz is the place to go.  (Motto:  The Saz, always the bridesmaid never the bride.)\r\nTheir selection of salads is reasonably priced and usually quite good.  The staff can sometimes be impatient if you don\'t know what you want right away  I have thoroughly enjoyed both their "Greek" fare and their "Mexican" themed items. There is lots of vegetarian options, and they definitely have more than enough choices for the meat eaters.\r\nThe biggest problem I have with the Saz is they don\'t take credit cards. I understand the food is quite cheap, but sometimes I\'m a hungry girl with no cash and no ATM balance.'

S'Cash only\n\nYou\'d never find this place if you weren\'t looking for it - a tiny little diner near the hospital. Their hours are somewhat erratic, I believe they\'re closed Fridays and only open until 1 on Saturday. Upon entering you\'re greeted with a prominent view of the kitchen(One guy cooking on what appears to be a standard stove), a breakfast bar that seats about 15, and about 10 tables that could seat 2-4.  We sat ourselves at one of the few open tables, the people inside were a few senior couples, one lone older man at the counter, and a young couple. Just about everyone seemed to be a regular and know each other by name. \n\nTheir menu lists breakfast and lunch, with most of their \'a la carte\' breakfast items being a few bucks each, and their breakfast plates being about $5. I got an egg sandwich with homefries and coffee for $5, my girlfriend got 2 eggs with toast, homefries, and juice for $6. My girlfriend asked if instead of meat she could get cheese and the eggs scrambled. When the waitress took the order back the guy behind the counter started at the slip in a "what the hell?" kind of way but didn\'t complain.\n\nOur food arrived in less than 5 minutes, a large plate which had a sizable amount of food on it considering the price, and very few frills. Our coffee was kept full and our order was correct, no items having been forgotten. None of the food was notably good, but it was all tasty and had a "homecooked"("rustic"?) feel to it. Also, bonus points that the eggs and homefries we were served were not dripping in industrial butter-like oil.\n\nA point worth noting is that while our waitress was very nice to us, it appears they are happy to tell it to you like it is, telling and older man who seemed to be a regular after quite a bit of chit-chat that if he couldn\'t finish his meal by 1pm then he ought to not bother ordering.  \n\nFor $11 and a tip we got a  2 decently sized breakfasts, juice, coffee, and extremely quick service. $6 is about as expensive as anything in there is, so I\'m sure we\'ll be in here on many weekend mornings in the future.'

It was cooked to perfection, very tender and sweet with just the right amount of seasoning. It was so good that I came back at dinner. Unfortunately, no more cold lobster but they did have Lobster au gratin with mashed potatoes. Also very delicious and succulent. In the evening, I sat close to the patio but still indoor. The smoke was so unbearable that I asked to sit further back. It was better but the smoke was still strong. I suggest sitting inside to avoid all that. Overall, a must if you're looking for excellent French cuisine in Montreal."

The patrons all the way down to the bartenders are really cool and are like your friends from jump street which makes this place really easy to consider your second home after just your first visit.\n\nThey have live music, a jukebox and I am told they have karaoke Thursdays. Don't want to just chill at the bar and drink while shooting the shhhhh, they have two pool tables, a Ms. Pac Man/Galaga machine and this really cool punching bag game! Great way to let out some steam after a long day at work!! Beers are pretty darn cheap in here too, so that's an added plus! I believe they have PBR on tap during Happy Hour for just a buck!!\n\nMake sure you come down and check this place out. It's a pretty mid class place with dive bar prices.....and I love dive bars!!"

The lady who seated us polite and professional, explaining the staffing situation-got the feeling the res wouldn\'t have helped much.\n\nBaby lamb chops were terrific, balsamic reduction for dipping very tasty.  Grilled portobello on the side was excellent. Wifey liked her lobster ravioli. 29/21, respectively-would\'ve felt better about 25/18-19 but I\'m quibbling.

I dont know what it is, but I'm guessing it's all the fat that is in the tahini that does it for me.  Sometimes the hummus at Nellie's is ok, but I'm spreading the word that (at least this week), the hummus at Nellie's is hummazing.  I hate myself a little for that pun but I get carried away by good hummus.\n\nThe hummus is good.\n\nBecause I've been to Nellie's three days in a row, I am now friends w/ the elderly gentleman who seems to own the place.  In fact yesterday, I got a kiss and a hug when I ordered my hummus!  I make friends VERY easily, and the same thing happens when I buy cheese at the Shadyside Mkt Dist so I think this is something I just bring out in people.  I dunno...I know I don't know him but if he keeps making that hummus we are going to be best friends!\n\nHere is what I don't like about this restaurant:\n\n1.  They dont really have lunch specials so if you get hummus and grape leaves as I did yesterday, it's $14 and that's a lot for lunch.  At least for me.\n\n2.  there is no atmosphere.  This place has had the same wallpaper border since I started going there - ten years ago.  I think Nellie's has been in the same spot for at least 15 years.\n\n3.  the place is kind of dirty.  My coat fell on the windowsill (i think it's the heater) and there was a line of gray dirt on my coat when I picked it up.  I don't think it has ever been cleaned.  The tables seem clean, but that is pretty gross.  Not so gross I won't be back, but gross enough I'm not sitting next to it the next time I go there.\n\nThey have good food at alright prices, and they're in a great location.  Try this place if you love greek/middle eastern food and it's convenient.  I wouldn't drive or go out of my way to eat here, but it's not bad."

I didn't know that when I walked in which I thought was funny. I'm usually a stickler for details  and living in South Florida with one of the biggest LGBT populations in America I'm familiar with this lifestyle and have no problem with it. You think I could have know this was gay bar, but nothing lead me to believe it was. Maybe that was done on purpose as a social experiment to see how a straight person would react when walking in. Do you leave? Do you stay? Do you hope no one sees you? Crazy $hit like passes thru everyone's mind, I don't care who your are. I just have the guts to type it.\n\nThe Awaking \n\nSo I order a beer and ask if the jukebox is on. The Bartender who's name is also Dan says yes. I then look up by the TV and see the Rainbow Flag. I look to the left and see a bigger Rainbow flag on the wall. Well I'll be damn, I walked into a gay bar and didn't even know it. It felt like something out of comedy and I had to chuckle. Now I'm comfortable in my own skin and I don't panic and look for the quickest exit. I stay.\n\nAmbiance\n\nVery nice pub and Dan was really cool. I come clean and tell him that I didn't know what type of bar this was until I walked in. He says it happens to people all the time. So enough about that. I got my beer and shot the $hit with Dan. I played some songs on the jukebox. I noticed that this joint is very clean and more updated than the place next door, Paradise Lounge. I finish my beer and Dan asks if I want another one. Fuck it, why not LOL. I have another and then pay my bill. \n\nVerdict \n\nIf I was gay I would love coming here, You can tell that it would be lots of fun plus it's a sharp looking pub. I will honestly say I would not hang out here because it's not my gig but the place deserves 4 stars for sure. Stay Hungry!"

S'I ordered a pizza last night. While it was delicious and made me feel guilty about my diet, I was disappointed with the customer service.  I specifically asked them in the special instructions to draw a bear on my pizza box. Got the pizza and guess what? No bear! It plainly read in giant letters on the receipt, "DRAW A BEAR ON THE PIZZA BOX". What kind of bull shit is that?\n\nOh and the pasta tasted like it was made with rotten milk. The pizza was great.'

Coming into the lot there is garbage everywhere and the building itself looks pretty run down. The wait times for food in drive-thru and while parking are outrageous, I thought this was supposed to be fast food?! There are never enough workers here and they look exhausted trying to limp through the rush and on my last visit when I went inside to complain I noticed one of the cooks had what looked to be like sores all over his arms. The inside was a disaster and there was no organization or real leadership here I'm honestly surprised this place is still open."

As for the smokeshop, well again, its pretty similar to a chinatown sushi place. If what youre looking for is a fancy show and flashy chefs, then don't go here, ya dum-dum!"

S'I have eaten at lots of Mexican restaurant so I\'m a pretty tough critic and this place was not that great.  I really was not that impressed. It\'s located inside the Cannery Casino so I\'m sure it soaks up plenty of business from the people who are already there feeding slot machines their social security checks. I don\'t think I would go out of my way to walk through a smoky casino to eat here though. I find it funny that this place boasts "Las Vegas Review Journal The Best of Las Vegas 2008"... umm its 2011 that doesn\'t say much. I think the portions could have been better for the price. My girlfriend got fajitas and it was mostly vegetables. Overall our meal cost $29.17 before tip, I ate my whole meal and my girlfriend took home some vegetables.  I did like the chips and the two salsas and bean dip that came with it. If you\'re looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant go to VIVA ZAPATA\'S it\'s just down the street on Craig and I-15 its way better.'

So I got to kill two birds at the same time.\n\nI was hoping to eat here and was told by the hostess that there were no tables open before the concert.  I guess that's understandable since everyone and there brother was going to the concert.  Every restaurant was busy at Wesgate, but I managed to get a sandwich at another place and was back at Bice Bistro after my meal.  \n\nWhat drew me hear was the vibe inside the restaurant.  Wasn't ghetto or full of beer drinking fools.  It felt somewhat upscale, but with a Scottsdale sort of flair.  I ordered a glass of wine and sat at the nicely done wrap around bar.  \n\nNext time I come back I'll have to try the food to see if it lives up to my expectations I have set for the place."

She wasn't over the moon that we were still seated 30 minutes after closing but she didn't rush us out so props to her. 4 of us had the BBQ, 2 had soups and I had the appetizer sized Kampungi (essentially it's like general Tao but more delicious) rice and spring rolls. One of the soups was still boiling on the table ten minutes later. Fresh and delicious Kimchi, we never figured out what that potato salad was all about. Shrimp and chicken dumplings were also delightful. Only negative points are that the dishes on the table weren't cleared off timely at all, water glasses weren't filled once past the initial welcome.  Great location and balanced quality for a fair price, add in BYOB with no corking fee and you have a winner."

S"During our stay in Montreal it was hard not to miss home cooked Asian meals. A bowl of noodles in the order. One of the best things around Montreal was where we stayed, Hyatt Regency Montreal. It is dead center of downtown with accessible underground subways stations that lead from Complexe Deshardins, Place D' Armes and Palce des Arts metro stations. A brisk walk underground leads us to Saint-Urbain and De La Gaucheti\xc3\xa8re Street - the back roads of Montreal Chinatown (Le quartier chinois de Montr\xc3\xa9al). \n\nChinatown in Montreal really isn't too big and is much smaller than Vancouver's. In fact, there are more Vietnamese Pho eateries than there are of wonton noodles. I heard lots of good things about the authenticity of the Pho noodles at Pho Thanh Long and we were super excited to try it.\n\nThe soup is tasty and not very oily, but the real winner was their Mong dry vermicelli noodles. Lots of chicken slices with prawns. There was a lot of ingredients and they didn't skimp out. The spring rolls were tasty and wasn't too oily. Added with some fish sauce mixed with chili oil really made our day!\n\nThere isn't a lot of reviews on Urbanspoon nor Yelp.

S'I really despise this place. I only went because I was invited so at least I didn\'t have to pay, and I suppose, if I\'m to be completely honest, the food was good, if not spectacular, in a wannabe haute cuisine kind of way.  But this restaurant-cum-nightspot isn\'t really about the food.  In the midst of lower St. Laurent hell, it\'s a place "to be seen." I don\'t really get that but I guess it\'s a place to conspicuously display one\'s wealth and show off the fact that you have enough money to eat or drink or snort coke in the bathroom or whatever the hell else people do there. The ample fishbowl windows seems designed to allow the mixed Eurotrash crowd to gawk at their Ferraris parked on the street outside while middle-age balding business execs can show off the new implants they recently purchased for their young peroxide blonde trophy wives in miniskirts (if they don\'t, in fact, have to settle the tabs with them at the end of the evening). The overdesigned modernist retro kitsch recalls the set of a 1970s science fiction porno film (something out of 2069: A Sex Odyssey perhaps).'

The restaurant is notably smaller than Ye's Sushi/Buffet and Sushi 99.\n\nThe restaurant uses iPads as part of its menu and ordering system. It's great that there's now a picture and full description of each roll, but the selection is much more limited than it used to be at the old Ye's Sushi. The food is not as good as I remembered from the old Ye's Sushi and it took a lot longer to come out too!\n\nI would suggest skipping Itamae and heading north to Sushi 99 instead if you like everything quick and freshly-made, or Ye's Buffet if it is not busy and you like the convenient buffet-style format. Itamae has nothing really going for it other than a convenient location near Wilfrid Laurier University."

First of all the owners are a very nice Lebanese family, the husband and his wife are the ones always working, they are so nice and friendley!\n\nThe food is amazing, their beef shawerma is very different than anyone elses, they actually use FILET MIGNON for their shawerma, which is a nice change sometimes from regular beef shawerma.\n\nTheir Baba Ganoush is so good, you might eat your fingers after it *Egyptian saying, sorry, lol*'

S"Should you still  yelp about a place if you were incredibly intoxicated while receiving services there??? ....oh well.\n\nTo dull the pain of how lack-luster RPM was, I consumed quite a few drinks on an empty stomach. At 3AM, I was desperate for food and this appeared to be the only 24-hour place to eat.\n\nFOOD: Ordered simple, cheeseburger and onion rings. Not gonna lie, this was one of the better burgers I've eaten. Leaning more toward restaurant quality than McDonalds. The meat had the grilled/charred flavor and they even used real cheese. The bun was buttered and toasted and the size was comparable to an In n' Out burger with a much larger patty. The onion rings were freshly fried and absolutely addicting. My friend and I ate every last bit of food. No crumbs to be found!\n\nSERVICE: This late at night, I expect pretty bad service. Grave shifts mean you have to deal with a lot of drunkards causing problems. The employees were surprisingly friendly. They took our order, got it right, and even cleaned up after we were done.\n\nIf I ever come back to the Tropicana again and need a bite at 3AM, I certainly won't have any objections to stopping here. At the very least I won't have to drive."

We have not had it delivered, but that service is offered.  This is not a fancy restaurant, it's in a blue collar neighborhood, but definitely worth it for the food.  We particularly like the Mongolian beef, the vegetable chicken, moo goo gai pan, the house special chicken, sesame chicken and the beef with broccoli.  Of the side dishes, the fried rice is delicious and done to perfection, and the eggrolls are crispy, scrumptious and large.  You can't beat their prices, especially at lunchtime.  The family that runs this little place is so friendly and hard-working. The light-rail construction is making a mess of 19th avenue right now and thus, it's a bit tricky to enter the parking lot, but we sincerely hope that's not keeping customers away from this little gem of a place."

I have to be up front and say that this truck in particular gets a bad rep from my coworkers, but I happen to really like it. I generally get the pineapple tofu and rice, which runs 4.50 for small (which is actually a more-than-fair helping) - add a $.50 soda and you have an enjoyable and tasty $5 lunch. The one drawback that gets a lot of flak from friends is that the food is precooked and simply heated until you get there (unlike a couple other trucks located on either side). Maybe I'm not picky about lunch food, but guys, these are food trucks. It's fast. It's easy. It's cheap. And those are pretty important things to me during weekdays."

Usually, I pull up to the front of the store located next to Trader Joe\'s and the owners are outside sipping espresso and smoking cigarettes like some scene from "Eastern Promises" . For some reason, this relaxed mentality sets the mood for a great meal. I usually get hummus, but the Mutabel is the best in town by far!

Beer selection more than adequate and service very good. Nice addition to the West Island. Drawbacks: 1/  the bar area to stand is too small. Eight to ten people and it is packed. 2/ a couple of the higher tables  have a TV 3 inches from your face. The TV is positioned for people sitting at other tables but encroaches on the people sitting at the higher tables. TV's not positioned well. ( or do they even need this many ) Ceiling too low for TV's. \n3/ fireplace a nice touch but takes up some ciritical area of the pub.

S'Flow Rider is the New Truck in Town, they have a pretty solid menu offering burgers, hotdogs, and sandwiches.\n\nThe first thing you will notice about Flowrider is their Portions, let\'s just say they\'re BIG, and every order includes fries and a drink.\n\nThe menu is pretty expansive, I had D Porker, which can best be summed up as a deli that exploded and ended up on a bun, D Porker includes: Fried pork, beef, bacon, ham, sliced hot dog, beans, egg, muenster cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado, served on a grill french bread.\n\nIt was a huge sandwich (camera on my phone doesn\'t work so I was unable to snap a photo), but trust me it was impressive!\n\nThe fries were rather forgettable, but it\'s nice that they were included along with a drink, other trucks are a la carte and the price can add up quickly.\n\nMy friend had the 12" Loco Dog which includes: A 12" beef dog wrapped with bacon, grill onions, jalapeno relish, special sauce, and guacamole on grill bun\n\nHe said it was really good, a little messy, but good.\n\nI liked Flowrider, they still have a few kinks to work out, but given time they could become a contender for the vegas food truck crown.\n\nOk...here\'s my few complaints so they can work on improving and getting 4 or 5 stars on my next visit.\n\n1- The fries are weak, they were under seasoned, a little soggy, and were rather blah. I may have just gotten a bad batch, but they were pretty forgettable.\n\n2- The Toppings, there is a point when you reach overkill, when a sandwich has more than 10 items on it you might be going a little overboard, all of the ingredients in my Porker were great, but they got lost when they were mixed all together, I actually dissected my second half and ate it piece by piece, all of the meats were amazing, but it may be a little overkill.\n\n3- Location I know finding places is hard when you start you, and the place you were at had a ton of traffic (rainbow and russel), parking was ok (hospital lot across the street), but there were no tables, benches, grassy areas, or anywhere to sit, I don\'t mind eating in my car, but if a group of people want to eat it can be a little hard.\n\n4- Your Hours, I know you\'re new and you are still getting things worked out, but being open 3 hours a day 11a-2p is not enough time for people to get a chance to try your grub. I really think with your portions and prices, you would be a better late night truck than a lunch truck, you could corner the post bar greasy food market if you found the right location and got the word out!!!\n\nI will give flowrider truck a few more tries, and hopefully they earn a few more stars, the more quality trucks this town gets, the better!!!'

I'll come clean, I don't really like houmus, and I ate it twice this weekend. The second time was clearly a homemade houmous, and tasty to boot, but what was standout was the aubergine chutney - spicy and made a lovely contrast to the plainness of the houmus. Rounding off with some homemade cake (bakewell tarts, tray bakes and apple & black cherry crumble), the crumble itself reminded me of the jubilee pancakes that you used to get at a Little Chef (syrupy cherries... fab!).

Very nice. Always great service at Blueberry Hill.bThe corned beef hash omelet was terrific, and solved the issue of "hash browns or pancakes?" as the side. Their pancakes are wonderful (not a mix).

S"It is difficult to find really good, high quality Chinese food close by... so I have tried several of the little take-out places in the 28277 area. \n\nI recently tried the Wok for takeout and found it to be pretty solid.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and the chicken and sauce was good.  I wasn't thrilled about the mix of veggies they used, but it wasn't bad.  I got a meal that came with an egg roll and it was not the best egg roll, but I really prefer spring rolls anyway.  \n\nI went back for take out a second time and this time I got the garlic chicken with brown rice. It was not as good as the garlic chicken at Wan Fu, but I would order this again when I am looking for quick takeout close to home."

S"Fast, friendly service. Good value. As a NYC/NJ immigrant I'm all too familiar with the Blimpie brand and have been to the original Blimpie Base in Hoboken which is what brought me into this location today. On a sign in the window was advertised the new Hoboken Hero with salami, pepperoni, prosciuttini and provolone. I requested double meat and double cheese as I used to back east and the sandwich maker proceeded to quickly build my hero. I was pleased to see that Blimpie still slices most meats to order unlike many sandwich shops where it's unknown how long ago ingredients were prepped. (Have you ever seen a slicer at Subway? I sure haven't.) Parmesan bread was fresh and baked perfectly. One aspect of the older Blimpie stores back east is they tend to be shabby and unkempt however this shop is in ship shape; immaculately clean and bright with large almost floor to ceiling windows running the full length of the store. Customer service was on point and delivered with a smile. One bit of irony is I was helped by, and I kid you not, Jared! My sandwich was wrapped as requested, half to eat there and half to go, and we both had a good chuckle about the irony of his name."

S"Trente-Cinq was such a surprisingly great experience. We had the Croquettes de crevettes for an appetizer which was nicely done (and more importantly not overdone). The two croquettes were a creamy and exceptionally good and these were served with a very light mixed green salad - the perfect dish to get your taste buds looking for more. Then came the entrees...we ordered the Steamed Mussels and Lamb Shank. The Steamed Mussels were by far the best tasting mussels I've ever had and the Lamb Shank was falling off the bone. When they brought the Steamed Mussels, they did not skimp on the portion size. This is an excellent dish to share with a group. The Lamb Shank melted in your mouth as was nicely served along with a vegetable ragout and couscous. The meal was perfect and they have a nice wine selection to accompany the meals quite well. The chef used to work at Coup De Tart in Phoenix, and I can certainly see why he started his own restaurant. Please check this restaurant out while you're in Phoenix, as Mr. Lionel Geuskens deserves the visitors with his excellent cuisine!!! 5 Stars!!!!"

S"Thinking I'd have a nice Italian dinner from Villa Francesca, I was surprised to see the new @7th Restaurant. I decided to give it a try. I sat at the bar to have a glass of wine and take out. Since it was New Year's Eve, they offered a good-ol' traditional special of  pork belly, collard greens and black eyed peas. The pork belly was probably the best I've ever had. It had a sweet-salty crust and was rich and tender. Decadent! The collards had good flavor but I did detect a wee bit of grit. The black eyed peas were just slightly under cooked. I don't like mushy but would rather not have too crunchy.\nThe service at the bar was very good.\nBasically, I will definitely go back to @7th. They have a really nice decor, great location and a good thing going. They should be able to do well."

Sometimes though, I just want some good ol' fashion American comfort food and that's when I turn to the Allegheny Sandwich Shoppe.\n\nA breakfast and lunch spot located on Western Ave, the Allegheny Sandwich Shop makes delicious, straight forward breakfast classics, home made soups, a damn fine chili, and awesome sandwiches. I'll even go as far to say that they make the best rueben in the city. \n\nOne thing that I love about this place is that for the most part you can order anything on the menu at any time during the day. I've been know to wake up on a Saturday morning feeling less stellar. Knowing that I can come here and get a coffee, water, and a hot roast beef sandwich with fries and gravy at 9:30 in the morning makes the occasional hangover a hell of a lot easier to deal with. \n\nDo yourself a favor some beautiful weekend and come to the Northside, go for a walk through the park, and come to Allegheny Sandwich Shop to satisfy whatever craving you may have."

We pulled into the parking lot, and noticed the outdoor dining area.  I figured this place must be pretty cool since that's a rarity with Vietnamese places, at least as far as I know.  \n\nWhen we stepped inside and realized we were the only people (on a Sunday), I immediately thought, This place is going to suck.  Not to mention the bare look of the interior.  \n\nI was proven wrong however.  We ordered the appetizer sampler with the stuffed chicken wing (what?!), vegetarian crepe, and grilled tofu.  The tofu was fabulous, as was the stuffed chicken wing.  The crepe was a bit too oily, but it comes in two crepes per order....and logically, two of a not so good thing would be not so good, right?  Nah, the value overrode the oiliness in this case.  The rest of the appetizer platter was good but nothing memorable.  \n\nI'll most likely never be back here, but that's more of a geographical thing.  I'd recommend it for a cheap satisfying meal."

Not all of the pasta is homemade but there is homemade spaghetti, ravioli and, I think, the gnocchi.\n\nIn a small house with only two booths and one small table.  Ordered take out, so did a few others.  The house has a small porch, with a small sign that is easy to miss.  When you walk up to the porch, go to the double glass doors to enter.  The main door must be for an apartment upstairs; with a sign pointing to the double doors.\n\nThe food was very good.  Ordered the homemade spaghetti.  The noodles were tasty and al dente with the famous meat sauce that was very good. Dinner includes a salad or soup.  The salad is large with iceberg lettuce, red onions, some tomato, cucumber and green peppers.  Had the Italian dressing, which was OK.   The meal also came with some Cellone's Italian bread, several slices.  We also ordered the Penne Pasta with melted provolone cheese and meat sauce.   The two meals were enough for 4.  \n\nThe menu has chicken parmesan, fish, eggplant and more.\n\nThe young lady at the counter was very helpful and very friendly.  \n\nOpen M-F 11 to 7.

They offer a slimmed down version of their restaurant menu which includes beef, veggie or turkey burgers(your choice) and various sides. The burgers are $7 and the sides are typically $3. I got the steak burger very pink and it was delicious. It's not as good as the competition's steak house burger(Burgatory) but it still satisfied. The staff are friendly and very quick. I waited less than 5 minutes for my burger. It was as I ordered it, very pink and and presented well with a wooden holder to hold it together. They also offer shakes as well, just like the competition. I still say if you want just a plain cheeseburger that Tessaro's has the best tasting beef in Pittsburgh. But, if you work downtown and you want a delicious burger with multiple options, then this truck is for you. I will be going back again soon as it was pretty good for a food truck."

S'Prior to Subway in the Desert Foothills shopping center opening I had been going to the one on W. Charleston by Big O Tires. Never had a bad sandwich. Never had bad service. The new one is walking distance to my house so I switched. First visit - 6" tuna. Sandwich was all bread and toppings, tuna was so scarce I definitely was eating more bread than anything. Second visit ordered that summer barbecue sandwich. Again I found I was eating mostly bread, very little substance to the sandwich. Third and last time I ordered tuna and once again found myself feeling like I threw away money. Not willing to continue to get screwed just because it\'s closer to home. I would welcome the opportunity to speak personally to the person who trained the employees but whenever I ask for mgmt they look at me like I\'m nuts. If I wanted to just eat bread, they do sell decent crusty French bread at Albertsons.   Sorry guys, but your location does not impress me, especially since I can drive a little bit further and have a great sandwich.'

S"it was sunday night, it was late, it was cold, it had been snowing on and off all weekend, neither me or my boyfriend could face cooking dinner so we decided to finally try jashans which had opened up down the street from his flat a number of months ago.  we phoned our order in and headed over to pick it up.\n\ni was a bit shocked entering the restaurant itself, as it really rather quite posh looking.  all rich sumptious colours and dark wooden tables.  i was definitely impressed, perhaps less so when we had at least three different waiters come up to us to ask what our take away order was.  um we already ordered and we are just waiting for the food now... it also took about three attempts to pay.  about 10 minutes after our arrival though, we had paid and the food was brought to us and we hopped in the car to head home.\n\ni unpacked the items which included poppadums, onion salad, garlic chicken, green herb chicken, saag aloo, pilau rice, and a peshwari naan.  i did like that the food came in tupperwares which meant for less chance of an accidental spillage while carrying it from car to flat, but i found that the food was barely on the hot side, more warm moving to room temperature.\n\nto be fair the curries were perfectly nice and i really enjoyed the naan, it was lovely and coconuty and sweet but without that weird hideous orange dyed coconut colour that you usually get.  but i felt like this place fell short of the other amazing curry houses that edinburgh has to offer as i can really only describe my meal as nice and not overly memorable.  it was also a bit more expensive than i would have expected for a takeaway.  so sadly, it's only A-OK and i may encourage my boyfriend to order from a different establishment the next time we opt for an indian to take away."

S'We went here the other night and a new waitress went around to every table saying "i\'m going to go do this, then this, etc" and told everyone exactly what she was going to do down to little details. A couple tables hadn\'t gotten service or food for a while and she kept going back and talking to them and other tables. While waiting for quite a while to even order, we kept getting chips and salsa, but no refills on water. The new waitress asked another if she could please go around and give water refills (I\'m sure we\'re not the only ones who asked.) and the girl angrily crumpled placemat papers on the table as if it were the one asking to to the water and she said please and the angry waitress snapped "I\'m getting it! I\'m getting it!" and stomped away. \nMy fiance soon was snapped out of staring into space and told me to turn and look at this one waitress who who was wearing a shirt with slits cut all down the back and a tacky pink bra clip very visable from her whole back. For this establishment, it was a little offensive. We eventually got our order and food and while the food was great, a to-go order was done wrong and we didn\'t notice until home.\nWhen it was time to pay, the waitress took the card with her, went to go take other tables orders and do other stuff then my fiance went to go tell the manager she wasn\'t back yet, plus about all the other bickering and drama going on in the restaurant by staff and he found them at the bar with a friend and after he laid it all out to them they said "okay, thanks."Went back to their drinks at the bar.\n\nSooooo...he insisted on going back to correct the order they had messed up to take home and found the waitress, she admitted to her mistake in the ordering and gave money OUT OF POCKET to pay for the error. He gave her some tips since it was her first day and he works at restaurants and they promptly made a new correct order.\n\nWhile the Mexican food is great here, it seemed slow and we were easily caught hearing loud, unecessary arguements (as did other customers watching) and unprofessionalism.  And the manager didn\'t care at all. However the honesty and effort the new girl tried to put in to please everyone was more than what anyone in the place had tried to do, and fixed her errors, and paid!'

No thank you. Scott's, however, is quite a nice wee place on the border of Tollcross and Bruntsfield, although I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's the best deli in town, it does manage to live up to some of my gastro-expectations. It ticks all the boxes in terms of a good selection of cheese, meat, salad-y bits (olives, roast peppers, artichoke hearts etc) and they will gladly make you up a sandwich or salad for a reasonable price. There are a few seats too, if you fancy enjoying something to eat there like the pizza, Stromboli, tortillas and really good quiches (probably best not to sample them all at once...). They are one of the few places to still do hot chocolate with cream, marshmallows and maltesers (aka the holy trinity of hot chocolate toppings). Yum."

S"I had lunch here today, it's located at the waterfront and is easily the 4th restaurant that has occupied the space.  It's right across the street from Loews theater on the waterfront.  The place was relatively empty even though it was a Friday during the holiday season.  I was the only one seated at the bar.  The bar is nice enough with a couple plasmas and appropriate amount of black and gold on the walls.  However, the bar itself was a bit sticky.  I was greeted quickly by a nice enough chap who brought me a paper and asked me for my drink order.  I had there iced tea, which was ackwardly served in a small pitcher instead of a glass.  I guess I could see the appeal for some, but I don't drink out of straws and this made it very difficult to drink without spilling.  The iced tea was pretty sickingly sweet.  I only had a few sips.  I ordered a cup of the chicken dumpling soup, which I thought was a bit overpriced.  The soup arrived quickly and had a decent flavor although it was served kind of room temperature and underseasoned. Soup should be served steaming hot.  I also tried the pulled pork sandwich and collard greens.  The pork itself was okay, tender and all that.  However, it was also served relatively cold and underseasoned.  The collard greens looked good with big chunks of hamhocks, however not surprisingly they were served cold and also underseasoned.  The service overall was prompt and the hostess was very nice.  She asked how my food was and I didn't have the heart to tell her the truth.  I might give this place another shot.  I've been told the ribs were good, but I'll have to specify I prefer my meals served hot.  I'm guessing if I go again I should go quickly because I'm thinking this place may not be here much longer due to the lack of customers I saw today."

I cant think of higher praise than that...it's better than the stuff they serve in Italy. It literally comes straight out of the oven, many times I've burnt the roof of my mouth in my impatience to eat the delicious creamy goodness. \n\nThe place always seems to be busy which is really heartening for a restaurant so far out of the city centre.

S'When you want some pseudo fast-food chinese and want a step up from Panda, Pick up Stix is the way to go my friends. Whether it be one of their awesome lunch specials for under $10 or a few a-la-carte items for dinner, they never seem to disappoint. \n\nBelow are some of my favorites:\n\n-House Special Beef (a-la-carte or lunch special)\n-House special chicken\n-Cream cheese wontons\n\nPersonally this place is like the happy medium between a Panda Express and Pei-Wei (And what is so great about pei-wei anyway? Someone please tell me!)'

S'Just ate at Pho Viet based on the first review on Yelp and its 1-block distance from my lodgings. Great pho! Very rich broth with a unique, complex flavor, and the beef was incredibly tender, without the bit of gristle that is common in more hole-in-the-wall places. I missed the plate of spouts, chilis, basil, and cilantro that I have become accustomed to in the States, but this may be a regional thing. A huge bowl of Pho Ba and a homemade lemonade (beh, not the greatest but not bad) was only $10!'

S'It\'s pseudo-Mexican fast-food and all, but I really like Baja Fresh. Usually, that is. This particular location\'s odd, uninviting customer service has just about ruined it for me. They really don\'t seem to have a clue what they\'re doing or how to do it.\nNot long ago, after ordering a taco combo plate, I had to return it because it was smothered in sour cream (for the first time in many visits). No big deal. Stuff happens, right? Well, everyone behind the counter acted like I was somehow at fault. The menus (paper and board) plainly list all of the stuff that comes on each item. Sour cream is listed in neither place, but they acted like I was being difficult for only wanting what was advertised on my tacos. "No crema?" over and over again. No...because it doesn\'t come on it! Granted, it was in Spanish, but the entire staff seemed to spend the next 10 minutes loudly debating the situation, the cook rolling his eyes and the server repeatedly checking the paper menu for proof of my mistake. Even on the 5th time, it still didn\'t say anything about sour cream. I will say that the manager did quickly step-in and tell them to remake my food, but even he seemed not to believe that they had messed-up in any way, that it was my fault. Eh, it is what it is. Everyone is entitled to an off day, right? Then last night, when my wife and I went back in, I made it a point to just go ahead and avoid any possible confusion by ordering my food without sour cream (that it obviously isn\'t supposed to come with in the first place). "It doesn\'t come with it, sir."? Really? No shit? Well, maybe you should inform the rest of your staff because they clearly didn\'t get the memo. Anyway, when my wife tried to order a small plate of nachos, the cashier told her that they only had large plates left, so she had to order a large nacho instead. My wife asked why they couldn\'t just put the small portion on the larger plate for the appropriate price (It wasn\'t her fault their stock order was short), but the girl just smiled, said something that I think was mumbled Spanish and cheerfully said "No". That was that. Now, neither experience is some kind of massive, unbelievable offense, but they were both rather frustrating and, far beyond that, textbook examples of substandard, lazy, utterly unconcerned customer service. And with that being said, I don\'t really see us going back to this location any time soon.'

S"East of Montreal, in hochela-maisonneuve, is a poor neighborhood, and still, there is this masterpiece of Kitsch. Like 1 year ago, a young local journalist published a work about Top spot for Kitsch. What is Kitsch, it's Jardin Tiki! It, somehow, work very well as a business, but the concept is quite akward. Akward isn't really the word to describe Jardin Tiki. Ok let's just start with what is this place. It'a cheap chinese buffet, typical chinese-american food. But when you get there, there's  a cocktail menu with and a hawaian decor. The crowd of Jardin tiki is also quite interesting. Old retired people that live in the surrounding of the restaurant area, poor family coming there to enjoy a cheap but convenient meal, hipsters in love with kitsch and vintage restaurant. Waiters and Waitresses had their golden age a long time ago but still manage to have friendly service. The food is more than average, like, it suck! But the experience, the cocktail (goro drink is served in a fresh pineapple) are cheap like hell. They,re a huge fountain with a dragon and some tiki lamp and some turtle in the fountain + some background hawaian tiki music.  It's kind of weird but funny at the same time. They've have a huge parking and last year it hold the 4th of 5th annual rockabilly festival. Some vintage car. Go there at least once and have the intention of drinking some fancy (and cheap) cool cocktails!"

S'Amazing find for a mall food court. A little slow perhaps, but worth the wait. A little expensive perhaps, but it is a mall and it\'s a refreshing change from the mall norm. Stick to the specials and it\'s a pretty good value. \n\nWe enjoyed a chicken crepe and then shared a Nutella dessert crepe with strawberries with others in our party. The five year old with me was shocked. "What is she doing?!?!" was the reaction when our server poured batter and made our crepe on the spot. The most difficult part of the transaction was the spirited banana versus strawberry debate between the five year old and her four year old sister. The Moga Crepe employee intervened and resolved the disagreement with a game. Very nice! Very unexpected! \n\nIf I were to lodge an actual complaint it would be that the food, as delicious as it was, did not resemble the professional photographs posted on Yelp by Moga. It\'s a food court! I\'m not expecting to be served on China like the photographs, but it did create a little disappointment when the dessert crepe was presented to us (photograph posted). Then we tasted the crepe and all was forgotten. I\'d delete those photos and let Yelpers replace them with real meals over time if I were Moga. I\'d volunteer to take a few more photos if it meant having to eat more Moga crepes.'

The staff was very friendly and even made some great suggestions for flavors. Only $5 to try a different flavor after the initial price. Free wifi and its pretty clean.\n\nThe only down side would be the seating. The seats aren't really that comfortable when compared to other Hookah bars that I have been to. Also it was a little warm in the store. So that is my reason for 4 stars today."

He ended up getting an omelet with brie and sausage, some potatoes, fruit, and baguette (with more brie added on top). I got a crepe with apple and swiss, and some fruit. The crepes were tasty - full of fruit and cheese. We got to sit out on the patio, with such great weather it's the time to take advantage of it.

I neither liked nor disliked this, but I thought all the chippies in this town were supposed to be curious-brown-saucy-concoction-centric. Why are they so enthusiastic about vinegar here? Was it because they knew I was a tourist? (If that\'s the case, I\'m a little offended, although I can\'t say I\'m very surprised, to be truthful.)\nAnyway, this place is good.

S"I think about their meatballs from time to time fondly. So coming here for the first (ish) time, I wanted me a meatball! \n\nI had been here for a special event before and had a sampling of some of their items and the meatball stood out to me. You can have good meatballs and bad meatballs. Some are too meaty, some are too squishy, some have no taste at all! This review is starting to sound dirty... but I'm being serious about my meatballs! \n\nTheir meatballs are the equal amounts bread and meat. Seasoned perfectly and topped with their sauce, it's a winning team. So of course I had to order a meatball sub when I stopped in for lunch. Throw in a toasted Italian sub and some fresh mozzarella and you've won me over! For $8 at a sit down place, that's not bad. It had four large meatballs and I could only eat half, so they didn't scrimp on the balls! \n\nThe only thing I might have wanted was some sort of green side. Maybe for lunch they could do a sandwich and salad/soup combo? I think it would be nice for the business lunch crowd if they wanted something more than just the sandwich. I kinda assume all their sandwiches are not served with any sides as well, so just keep that in mind if you want more to your meal.  \n\nTheir happy hour specials seem legit and so does their main dishes, so I'd really like to come back for dinner or HH soon. And I know those meatballs will still be on my mind as well..."

S"I've eaten here twice, and this is good but not great.  I still have trouble with spending more than 10 bucks for lunch, but that is the deal here in my experience.\n\nFirst visit I had the signature meatball parmesan sandwich, the full size, and I would give that a 4 out of five.  Meatballs were very good - not dried out - and the marinara was very tasty.  Bread was also good if not spectacular (try Z's next door for amazing bread).  However, orders were being mishandled at the tables all around me, and for $10, I expect more than a sandwich and a drink.  No side of pasta or salad.\n\nSecond visit I went for the lunch special - half a sandwich and a salad.  Half a sandwich is SMALL!  I felt righteous on departure, but far from full.  Salad was OK, but nothing to write home about.  Seemed like orders were being handled more smoothly, so maybe the shake down cruise was over.\n\nFood is served on interesting square plates which are quite nice.  The dining area is very crowded and it is a squeeze to get to the drink station - it is pour your own here.  Again, for $10, I think I could eat elsewhere and have table service.\n\nMeh."

S"This place (Angelina's) Suck! My children wanted cheese fries one night and I remembered we had a flyer from one of there employees sticking it on my door so I decided to order from there... We ordered 3 cheese fries, they delivered in roughly 30 minutes... They were hot and loaded. Really good. So I thought ok I may have something good here Plus they have no minimum delivery. A few weeks later I got a craving for a burger and omg there Burgers are DRY, plain and boring with pathetic lettuce. So I said ok, no biggie I know not to order burgers from there. Another few weeks later my husband decided he wanted there all white pizza or whatever the greasy greasy thing is called, It's safe to say that thing is gross, if you don't roll it up to squeeze the 8 ounces of grease out you will be on your way to an heart attack... Once again I know not to ever order pizza from this place. So again, Weeks later I get a craving for some cheese fries with sour cream and jalapenos... I ordered it they delivered it... Omg... What the hell? No sour cream, cheese was cold and dry underneath the cold hard you know what fries! I was pissed... How dare they Jack up my craving? I will never ever ever ever ever order from this place again nor look at it when I drive by. It's crap."

S'We were attracted to le Chein Rose by the cute sign and cool looking interior design. The restaurant serves Tapas - multiple small portions that can be shared.\nMy wife started with a beet, arugula, goat cheese and pecan salad. It was the star of the evening - a wonderful blend of flavours and textures.\nI ordered the BBQ ribs. I know Montrealers are convinced that "fall off the bone" is a compliment when it comes to ribs but I\'m of the true BBQ school. Give me ribs with some texture and taste. Sadly these had neither. They were flavourless and overcooked - parboiled and then quickly grilled - not in any way BBQed. The smoky tomatoe sauce marginally redeemed them and the dipping sauce went well with the former but overall - not a dish I\'d order again.\nWe shared a dish of crab cakes. Again, disappointing. Far too much potato filling left the three cakes wet. Little to no seasoning left them bland. As with the ribs the best part of the dish was the sauce - Aioli with a touch of soya.\nOverall I\'d classify le Chien Rose as a slick concept that misses the mark - not by much, but by enough to prevent either of us from giving it a second shot. Service was professional and friendly but the kitchen needs to find its A game.\nOn a closing note - it was obvious from the full house on a Wednesday night that others didn\'t share our disappointment.'

S"Everything about Hotel Missoni is newly stylish, immaculately finished, and trimmed with an edge of slightly eccentric fun, including Cucina, the Italian restaurant that makes up part of the hotel.\n\nThis is definitely a classy Italian dining experience, where you're served by smooth Missoni clad waiters, who are the kind of waiters that seem to glide along quietly doing their thing, not interfering too much with your meal, but making sure that everything is attended to nonetheless.\n\nI had freshly made penne pasta with a pork ragu sauce, which was fantastic and full of flavour, followed by a good old glass vessel of Tiramisu, very much on the coffee tasting side of things, rather than the sweeter edge served up in some restaurants, and really, really good. This restaurant gets a no hesitation recommendation from me, although strangely for a Thursday night, normally a fairly busy evening in town, the restaurant seemed pretty quiet. Probably just a one off, because town didn't really seem that busy anyway on that particular evening, and sometimes it's better to have a bit of peace and quiet while you have some quality pasta and parmesan time."

S"I'm still trying to discover new places to get some decent grub in my neighborhood but Verdun is not so easy. The area is replete with 99\xc2\xa2 pizza joints and littered with hot-dog stops. Respectable feeding is hard to come by.\n\nBut they're around and slowly I'll tread the waters. The other day I tried the Garage Caf\xc3\xa9, a Pizza slash burger slash pasta restaurant. Reassuringly the place was packed and people were standing outside drinking. The place looks like the neighborhood food stop filled with regulars that simply walked to get there. \n\nThe d\xc3\xa9cor is a bit patchy but has flair of its own, service is friendly but a bit slow but they try with all the traffic. The menu is varied but offers nothing innovating yet isn't boring either. Fun comfort food to have with beer, wine or sangria.\n \nAs is often the case, I'm in no mood for alcohol after work (Unless I'm not working the next day) so I ordered a Coca-cola and this was the interesting part, they serve it in a Mason jar that has a handle on it. Loved the idea so much I want some of my own now.\n\nNot feeling the pasta menu because it's my fall-back plan when I don't know what to prepare for myself at home I hit the Burger Menu, something I never get bored of. I love a good burger so much I'd eat one for breakfast and I have in the past thanks to American Diners. So I went for the Four By Four. \n\nThe Four by Four is a healthy helping of Beef (of course) and Philly Cream Cheese, Bacon and fried Mushrooms and Onions. All ingredients I simply can't get enough. Sadly I didn't get enough. The patty was a whopper but seriously if you're gonna be a restaurant called the GARAGE CAF\xc3\x89, to me it seems like a grease monkey wouldn't eat a flimsy burger and with the price, gimme something to chew on.\n\nBurger 101: A burger must be meaty, juicy, greasy and yes a sloppy mess. But also it's gotta be heavy on the toppings and I'm not talking ketchup. \n\nIf you tell me you're gonna put some Philly Cream cheese, don't scrape it on; slather it on thick. The mushrooms? I want them flowing from the sides. And the bacon... the bacon. How many times have I said this? Life has no meaning without bacon. This was the big epic FAIL of this Burger that coulda-been. When I go to my local La Belle Province - often derided for being the bottom of the barrel of fast food restaurants in Montreal - and order a bacon-cheese burger, the cook takes out 3 or 4 slices of fresh uncooked bacon and drops them on the grill before taking out the fresh burger patties and then making me a super fresh and tasty messy sloppy burger. But at Garage Caf\xc3\xa9, I got one tiny slice of pre-cooked bacon. Come On! And the patty was to perfectly round and well shaped to be fresh prepared.\n\nThe fries were pretty damn tasty though and it was served with a side of very tangy and spicy mayonnaise that added some serious punch to the burger. The burger wasn't bad in the final analysis it just could have easily been an out of this world kick-ass burger with a few simple steps.\n\n3 buns outta 5"

S"Since moving to Wisconsin, I have been searching for good grilled cheese sandwiches.  And, Melted certainly fits the bill.\n\nI had the American Caprese sandwich, and it was a solid sandwich.  The pesto and tomatoes added a nice tang to the flavor.  I thought it was better than the grilled cheese at the Old Fashioned and Coopers Tavern, but not as good as Monty's.\n\nAll sandwiches come with a shot of tomato soup, which is not particularly remarkable.\n\nThe drawback was the price.  The basic sandwich is $6 and the specialty sandwiches are $8.  That was steep for a small, food-cart sandwich without a side.  In fact, I went over to Ian's right after for a slice of pizza to make a full lunch.\n\nAgain, the sandwich was quite good.  However, I would prefer to buy a slice of Ian's mac and cheese pizza and a slice of caprese pizza and a bag of puppy chow for the same price."

Another benefit is they are always willing to do separate checks.\n\nA spin off from the original G&D on Central Ave, the decor will never be as 'pub like' due to the nature of the building itself, but a fair effort has been made to capture the feeling of a UK pub."

I found the quality of the food here to vary greatly from one dish to another. There was a chicken-and-mushroom dish that was truly spectacular, and  there were two kinds of fish: one fried, the other poached, both good; and this for me is truly a plus, as not too many Chinese buffets serve fish. The french fries (I guess all Chinese buffets have them now) were very good - I wish all places that serve fries served them this way. Most of the meat dishes were OK, as were the main starches, i.e., the fried rice (it wasn't greasy ... hooray!) and the lo mein. Most of the other dishes were adequate, and the desserts were mediocre and of store-bought quality. The one total flub was the egg flower soup, which was totally tasteless. My actual rating for this place is three and a half stars, but seeing that Rand H gave it that rating and decided to round it down to 3, I'm using the balance to round my rating up to 4."

I've yet to actually FIND one, but the investigation has been delicious.\n\nSitara Spice takes the closet contender with its Saag Paneer. All the elements of a tradition palak paneer but this specific dish is made with a spicy red sauce. Either way, it lives up to its cousin dish in delicious. It's one of those handy little orders that makes you feel like you're being healthy (it's spinach based after all!), without actually HAVING to be (cheese. so much cheese.)\n\nI also took down the lamb Ceylon curry (cold indian food left overs are my weakness!). It's wickedly spicy - a plus for me, but perhaps a warning note for anyone else - and although the lemon/coconut elements were interesting, i'd likely pass on it next time around. I found it a little bit greasy, and a little bit heavy. Delicious? Yes. But as previously mentioned, I had ordered a paneer laden first dish, so I would have opted for something less in-your-face unhealthy.\n\nThe two dishes plus rice came out to a fair \xc2\xa315 and I had enough for late night snacks and the next day's lunch.

S"Ok, I'll admit, I was probably a wee bit judgmental of The Brig prior to even entering its Cramond-based doors. \n\nHaving passed it about 1,000 times on journeys to and from Fife, I just presumed it would be one of those standard places at the side of a super busy road, located on the way out of town, that's fairly average and only really good for a quick stop-off. That was judgmental of me. .The Brig is actually a pretty nice place to while away a few hours, so Cheryl - slap on the wrist for being narrow-minded.\n\nIt was an impulse decision one Sunday to head to The Brig, and the restaurant was full to the rafters with Sunday Roast enthusiasts. It had a really nice atmosphere - lots of families, happy children, all very homely. It looks good inside too - I think I was expecting something more like a slightly weathered pub, but it's bright and modern, having been refurbished fairly recently, with the stacked up logs beside the fireplace adding a cosy touch. The staff are good too, seeming friendly and laid-back.\n\nThe menu's pretty huge, so there'll almost certainly be something there that'll suit your palate. Nothing massively adventurous, but strong on variety. Wanting something light, I opted for the Caesar salad, a pretty frequent lunch choice of mine, which was tasty - although no anchovies, which I know aren't everyone's thing, but I quite like them. My mum, who'd come along with me, had the club sandwich, which was really good actually - I'd recommend. The substantial-looking fajitas sizzling away on another table nearby also looked pretty tempting.\n\nThe Brig has a beer garden, so I think I'll head back to try that out in warmer weather, or indeed head back to the bar for a few chilled out, night-time beverages. If you're planning on going down to Cramond Beach or you're ever around the area and simply needing nourishment, The Brig ain't half bad, and definitely worth considering for more than just a brief visit."

They're not cheap, but they're not outrageously expensive and at least you know your money is going to a good cause.

We ordered a couple of po boys to share between the 4 of us and they brought us out 4 well presented plates each with a half order of waffle fries, a half a po boy and OUR VERY OWN MONSTER PICKLE SPEAR.  I very nearly cried, and not just from the crisp dillness that swathed over me.\n\nThe fries were great, but the po boy was on the po side (I had 2 babies in mine) but otherwise well constructed.

S'I was soo excited to try this place!  My boyfriend lives in the North Side and we\'re always looking for good eats there.  I would up its rating to a 2-stars if only the food were marginally better.  The atmosphere is great.  It has a fine-dining quality to the decor and my boyfriend said there were some really neat "coffee bean" handles on the bathroom doors which was a nice addition.  The restaurant is made up of two rooms: one with probably around 20 tables and the other with about 10 tables and a bar.  They have a TV to watch sports in the room with the bar.  There was only one other group of diners in the 20-table room when we arrived and a few folks at the bar.  The group left within about fifteen minutes of being there and my boyfriend and I had the entire room to ourselves, which was both nice...and a little sad.  \n\nI ordered a vegetable slaw with poppyseed dressing for my appetizer and the mussels for my dinner.  My boyfriend ordered a trout spread with apples and bread for his appetizer and the crusted grouper for his entree.  The only semi-edible dish of the four described was the vegetable slaw, though it was even overly doused in the dressing and the flavors didn\'t really mesh.  My mussels tasted as if they were rotten...I could barely get the bad fish taste out of my mouth throughout the rest of the night.  My boyfriend\'s trout appetizer was really strange: the apples didn\'t really go with the spread and the spread itself was more of a pate than what was described.  I couldn\'t eat more than a bite of it.  His grouper was raw throughout most of it.  \n\nWe told our waiter our issues with the entrees and a few minutes later the owner came over to apologize.  She was very nice though kept saying their food was really good, that it was "her food" so it was definitely good (as if it was our fault that we happened to have the "bad seeds" and as if she had credibility in our minds despite us not knowing her at all).  She offered to get us new dishes.  I decided to go with the kale-olive dumplings (a weird combination but I love all three of those components) and my boyfriend got the shrimp linguini pasta.  As I should have expected, the dumplings just didn\'t make sense...my taste palate was very confused by the combination.  Even worse, there was an OLIVE PIT in one of them.  Thankfully I caught that before a potential disaster.  My boyfriend\'s dish was very mediocre and he was too scared to try the shrimp given the grouper experience.  I told the owner about the olive pit and she said they buy their olives pre-pitted so that didn\'t really make sense (again, making me feel like it was "my fault").  I think she would have been better off just apologizing and perhaps getting us a free drink.  At least we would have been tipsy and happy!\n\nAs you would expect, I have no intention of going back to Cassis.  It\'s unfortunate when you end up writing a bad review for a locally-owned place.  I always want these sorts of restaurants to succeed.  I think it is suffice to say that if something doesn\'t change in the kitchen, this place doesn\'t really have a chance.'

S'Luckily I don\'t mind Coke....  I have been here several times and it\'s been... "meh"... but the last time I came through the drive thru and ordered a simple Medium #1 with onion rings.  I thought it was strange that the order taker did not ask what I wanted to drink, but just drove around (figured he would ask me when I got there).... NOPE just handed me a coke.  I try to roll with the punches more-often-than-not, but this was not the end of the world for me.  When I opened the bag, I had fries... and mentioned it to him.  There was no apology and he just went and got the onion rings and handed me the bag back.\n\nI guess  the phrase, "you get what you pay for" applies here.  I will probably give this place another shot since it\'s right near my house when I need a BK fix, but this is very disappointing in my book.'

S"I've be coming here quite regularly for the past four or five years and I love it.\nWhen it's busy it has a really good buzz. The staff are friendly and normally quite efficient although I have had to ask for the bill more than once on a few occasions. It can be a bit awkward for lunch during the week when it's much quieter as the room is rather large but the food is consistently good, which I think is partly due to their abridged menu for these quieter times. \nI am particularly fond of their pizza. Having spent a lot of time in Italy and eating a lot of pizza there, I am quite fussy, however their base is not too soft and they use good quality mozzarella so it keeps me happy. I would perhaps even go as far as saying it is the best pizza I have had in Edinburgh.\nBetween me and my fiance we have sampled quite a few of their pasta dishes, his favourite being spaghetti with seafood. We do both have a small issue with them putting onion in their ammatriciana sauce though. I know it's a personal choice thing, with onion and without onion are both served in Rome, but it was too crunchy, not cooked enough.\nNormally when I go I eat so much for starter and main that I rarely have room for desert but once or twice I have ordered the tartufo (chocolate and vanilla ice-cream in a bombe with cocoa and nuts) which is especially nice if you ask them to pour an espresso over it for you!\nOverall, I really like this place. Good value for money, good quality food, clean toilets. Just don't be in a hurry to leave afterwards, or ask for the bill a bit before you're ready for it."

S"This place has changed our lives. Seriously! \nMy wife and I live in Observatory Hill and I adore this neighborhood. Right on Riverview Park, quiet, beautiful historic homes, and close to everything. The only thing this neighborhood is lacking, in my opinion, is more restaurants. Sure, there are acceptable dining options 5-10 minutes away in every direction. But some times you just want fast, delicious and convenient. And to not leave the house. Until recently there was only one pizza place that would deliver to our house. One. And it's downright nasty. Right next door to the high school so that's the crowd they cater too. I'm guessing you can set your standards pretty darn low when your only competition is the school cafeteria pizza. \nThen, one glorious day, a menu appeared on our doorstep. Riviera Pizza and Pasta. And they deliver to our home. Worth a try! They have all of the typical offerings, breadsticks, pizza, calzones, hoagies. You know what a pizza place has. What they have that I've never encountered before is a relationship with eat24, an app that allows me to order on my iPad and magically have pizza show up at my house. Whaaaaatt?!?! I can order pizza and never have to speak to another human, and the food will come to me while I'm in my pajamas?!? Finally!! All of my dreams are coming true! It's finally a civilized neighborhood thanks to Riviera!\nThe food is a solid 3.5 stars. The pizza is pretty good. It's tasty, cheesy, and just the right amount of greasy. The breadsticks are super yummy and we get them every time we order. We like the calzones a lot, the small one is enough for 3 servings at least. The delivery has always been faster than the quoted time and the drivers are kind and courteous. We've been desperate for a neighborhood pizza place that we actually like. Finally, the storm clouds have parted and Riviera Pizza has emerged. And we are certainly some grateful fans!"

S'Overall the food is alright but its normal to high prices. Expect $10-$15 per meal with a drink. Waitresses are a bit overbearing as they constantly ask if things are OK. It might just be the new restaurant ownership but they need to back up a bit.  Overall a decent place for normal american style food.'

S"Is a kiss just a kiss?  Is every Subway created equal?  I think not. Despite living in the area for seven years and being a big Subway fan, I had never been to this one.  Walked in at 12:30 PM in the heat of the lunch hour rush and there must have been a dozen people in front of me.  I wasn't in a hurry so I settled in for what I thought would be at least a little wait.  Not really, they had the place staffed with a great crew, everyone was extemely friendly, made a great sandwich and I found a clean table to eat at.  They offer fresh brewed ice tea and have a cooler full of other beverage options.\n\nSubway does a great job of being consistent on the food at their restaurants, but it's the attention to details at the franchisee level that makes the difference and this one is definitely a gem.  Looking forward to going back (and it'll be sooner than seven years)."

S'This place is a tad more expensive compared to your typical Mexican restaurant, but it is worth it. They do not shove you into a seat and out the door like most Mexican restaurants do. We had great service. They really took the time to make sure we had everything we needed. All of the staff members were extremely friendly. The food was AWESOME. They give you chips, salsa, and a green dip (cilantro salsa) when you first sit down which tasted great. I ordered the La Unica Burrito without the red sauce, with beef, and a side of rice and beans. It tasted great. Rice was probably the best rice I have had at a Mexican restaurant. My boyfriend ordered the pollo fundido. He always orders this at every Mexican restuarant. He said he was disappointed that the cheese on it was shredded/melted instead of the cheese dip, so you may want to request the cheese dip instead. Overall a great experience. We sat at the bar and they let us put the game on we wanted to watch and gave us the remote to turn up the volume. I will go back for sure. We stayed at the Best Western and walked right over. Super awesome. We did both order margaritas. There was too much sweet and sour mix for my taste. I am just not a big fan of places that pre-make their mix with the alcohol already in it. They were not super strong, but not super weak either. I think next time I will ask for an extra shot in it though. Try it out.'

S'I wanted to be all about this place, but, it fell a bit short for me.  I\'ve been to the Lucky Cheng\'s in New York, and I\'ve been to Lips in NYC also. (Lips is the same theme Drag Waiters.)  The drag dining event can be really charming and fun.  But there\'s a huge difference between drag in NY and drag in LV.  It seems that here in Vegas it\'s not so much drag as it is transvestism and pre-ops with boobs.  I guess real boobs on a "drag queen" is a little too real for me.  God I sound like a wuss, but it really seemed more like a bordello than a fun jaunty trip to a drag show.\n\nThe show was fun.  I don\'t remember her name, but this awesome queen with a huge Afro danced her way into my heart.  She looked like she jumped right out of an R. Crumb comic......bodacious to say the least.  She was dragtastic.\n\nAs for the food.  It was okay.  Nothing to run back for, but prepared well.  So, yeah, a bit underwhelmed by the whole experience.  Now, word on the street is that Lucky Cheng\'s is moving to the Krave Lounge, which might give it a whole new feel.  When it moves, I\'ll go again and see if my mind is shifted a little, but until then, i kinda  feel like drag is dead.'

This place is always packed and I can only assume it is because of the view because the food isn't actually that nice. More BHS cafe than John Lewis cafe in my opinion. They make omelette's in front of you which is all very gimmicky but if the omelet isn't actually that great then the gimmick is lost. \n\nBest plan of action is to send your friend to grab a seat while you queue for coffee and cake, bypass the food and enjoy the view."

Oh and they have GOOD ice cream and sherbet plus their beverages include good quality green iced tea. \n\nMy number one annoyance with this place is they only have one server it seems and she does all she can to avoid eye contact so you don't ask her for drink refills. My number two annoyance is their high chairs, they are very very old school (just plain old really) and I have yet to find one with straps that are secure.

The linguine scampi and shrimp was delicious.  The Mozzarella Marinara is good fresh mozzarella with a very tasty roma marinara.  The Penne Amaticiana is a very aggressive spicy dish!\n\nOnly issue is the the Brookline Pub is connected and you go in the side door at the smoking area outside the Pub and it  somehow gets into the restaurant and lingers in the restaurant.\n\nThe menu has chicken, a salad and soup and lots of pasta.  If you like good pasta, you will enjoy Piatto!\n\nPiatto gets its alcohol form the Pub.  Someone in the restaurant did BYOB and Lauren said it was $5 charge.  Next time will BYOB.'

The bar staff seem to genuinely want to be friendly but fall short on professionalism and bar/service knowledge. Don't expect quick service or attentiveness just because there are only 6 people at the bar.  I've had bar staff up and take a smoke break, leaving the bar unattended.  Liquors, ingredients and garnishes in limited supply.  Drinks are a little expensive for the area, too.  The food is decent, but it doesn't make up for the poor bar service.\n\nHaving said all of that, understand that I have had a few good experiences when the bar has been a little more lively.

Coffee was decent; big mugs.\n\nHere's the pinch- they actually sell a breakfast bagel here for nearly a tenner- all you need to know really. Yes- that's over TEN POUNDS for an average bagel and a coffee. To put that in deli-perspective, the best salt beef sandwich in the country costs \xc2\xa38.60 (Brass Rail salt beef bar, Selfridges).\n\nAs far as comfort goes our waitress showed us to a table that was essentially a window ledge.

If you want to have a good night forget going to this bar you\'ll get nothing but a horriable nightmare! It\'s not even a biker bar.....maybe if your 60 or older but under the age of 35 don\'t go! This is a warning! We went one about a month ago and the owner\'s wife drunk as hell and start\'s yelling at my wife check this out through the cracks of the bathroom stall telling her not to use all her toilet paper. So we decided we wouldn\'t go there again, then again we decide it\'s very dirt cheap so lets go back well last night we did what dumb mistake! We start there with an old crappy band, and then decide lets play pool put 75 cents in the machine, one ball is missing, can\'t play with one ball missing so we decide oh well lets just play take away the other color ball, we start playing and all the balls got stuck, and the pool sticks had no tips we had to share a stick. When we decided to complain that we couldn\'t play anymore because the table was broken 1st she decides to say it\'s not broken I just got this fixed.....well we didn\'t break it so idiot someone did. While she\'s away one of my friends decided to get the balls off the table and "punches the balls" she comes out yelling it costed her $600 to get it fixed and was making a big deal over the balls even though thats the whole point your supposed to hit the balls....with a crappy stick! She yells at my friends then comes to me and my wife even though were no where near her and starts yelling at my wife through me. She says everytime you guys come here theres a problem....and includes when you left last time you left trash...oh I\'m sorry forgot this was a prissy bar where the owner is LAZY doesn\'t want to do her job or pay for it.....but she can "FIX" a pool table. I said what? and she keeps going then decides to call me a drunk....when she\'s the worse person in the whole bar, and I was the D.D. how the hell was I drunk? Then she keeps going when I\'m clearly ignoring her so finally I asked why she was still talking to shut up and she said don\'t tell me to shut up. I told her it\'s okay you just lost $100+ a night from us so thats fine you\'ll never see us again so she decides because were leaving to say you guys are 86\'ed really? Because your drunk ass can\'t handle the sitiuation. She ruin\'s everyone\'s night even the person that is not saying anything.....She\'s an old lesbian even though she claimed she\'s been faithful for 4 years and then asked my wife if she\'s jealous that she\'s making out with other woman on the pool tables....that she\'s mad about I mind you....but she\'s "faithful" my ass! To finish and sum it up I\'d rather pay $6 a beer at the expensive bar\'s then go here ever again!!'

S'Growing up with a German great-grandmother who was straight off the boat, my childhood did not lack the presence of sausages like Knackwurst and Bratwurst. As a child I always tried them, but did not like them. So, in the name of adult research I am starting my Phoenix \'culinaria germany\' research at the Edelweiss Deli.\n\nI have driven by this deli for 3 years now. Walking in I was surprised to see a small selection of ingredients like mustard, vinegars, huge jars of sauerkraut, egg noodles, etc. along the back wall. Behind the counter there were sausages of all kinds, slabs of bacon and a few gelatinous deli meats I was scared to try. There was also a few different dessert breads and some beautiful Streusels on display.\n\nI stuck with the basics and decided on a simple lunch special of Knackwurst with German Potato Salad and Sauerkraut. As Sara K. mentions, it does says "Dieters Beware" on the door - so naturally the German potato salad and sauerkraut had smoked bacon in both. A little overwhelming for my dainty American palate so I had a few bites but that was enough. However, the Knackwurst was excellent had great flavor and went well with the Bavarian Style and Hot Mustard I purchased. Nicely priced at just under $7 the lunch specials came with the meat and sides and a roll.\n\nI didn\'t have the uncomfortable experience some of the others did, and in fact, the sweetly accented German-American woman was very nice but meant serious business behind the counter. I can appreciate a delicatessen that is run by the real deal.\n\nI will definitely be back to try more, purchase sausages and to further expand my knowledge and palate in addition to purchasing all mustard from european style delicatessens moving forward!'

The guy who typically works there is mostly friendly though he takes a little while to warm up to you. The ladies who work there usually can't take their eyes off of the tv long enough to actually look at you, but oh well.  Previous to going here, I hadn't had much exposure to Filipino food. Most of it is pretty good, though there are a few dishes that weren't quite what I expected. Overall, the dishes seem to be a little on the oily side...I'm not sure if this is typical of Filipino food or if its just this place. My favorite thing about this place is the lumpia, which at 4 for $1 are a pretty good deal. Surprisingly, their sweet and sour sauce is amazing. Also, on weekends they have this roast pork that is freaking amazing. \n\nAll in all, its worth trying it out at least. Make sure you bring cash though, because they dont take plastic."

S"i've made 2 visits to Kilroy's over the last few months.  Both times, i focused on the burgers ( gee, big surprise ) but it should be noted that they have a large menu but i'll be damned if i know what else they offer.\n\nThe burgers are 1/2 pounders.  1st time, tried the western bacon, 2nd time bacon chipotle with grilled onion.  both times asked for medium and i got medium ( some places just won't allow for any pink  ! ) \n\ni found  the meat to be tender, flavorful ( could've used a little more salt ) - also, i like a little more juice, but overall, i liked the burger.  If you order grilled onion, be careful !  i think they piled on an entire sliced/grilled onion - a little too much for me.\n\nfor a $1.50 more you can get a side of fries. opted for the salt pepper shoestrings. tasty !  i like that they also give you a side container of cole slaw.\n\nIs this the best burger place in vegas ?  not sure about that.  but if you are in the area and hankering for a burger - it's definitely worth a visit."

It was grilled chicken, french fries, a little cheese on chopped lettuce. Can you say B-O-R-I-N-G?\n\nToday I had a steak hoagie.  Enough places in Pittsburgh do these that comparing them is easy.  While the bread is fresh, and the hoagie buns are huge --- it\'s all downhill from here.  Enter three slices of steak-ums and the contents of the hoagie are just flat. The bread is 90% of the meal.

S'We had been here a few times before, as we like to gamble at Harrah\'s every once in a  while, but it had been a few years since our last visit to eat at the Range.  Decided to go on a Friday evening, play some blackjack, win some money and have a great steak dinner.  Well, none of that really happened since we lost at blackjack (which has nothing to do with this review...in case you\'re wondering if I\'m a bitter loser.  HA!)  and the steak dinner was definitely not great!  \n\nMade a resv online for the two of us from the Harrah\'s site using open table (very easy and good feature).  Had a booth in the back by the kitchen, which was a noisy spot but not too horrible.  Our server Jodi was friendly and very attentive throughout the meal.   We both ordered the 8 oz filet ($36 each - pricey!).  I chose mine with blue cheese crumbles on top and my husband ordered his without any topper.  Hubby got steak fries and mac and cheese as sides.  I chose mushrooms/onions and a loaded baked potato.  To start, I had a spinach salad that had walnuts and bacon in it with some sort of white cheese - delicious - and I think this was probably my favorite part of the meal.  Hubby had a house salad - meh.  The breads are fresh and quite good!\n\nMain entrees arrived and server asked us to cut into them right away to be sure they looked ok in terms of how we ordered them (medium and medium "warm").  They were fine.  What wasn\'t fine was the taste of the filets!  I\'m not sure how they cook them here (broiled?  Saucepan?), but they really had no flavor and were kind of blah.  We are used to great steaks that are grilled (Firebirds in Chandler has the best!).  I was glad I had ordered blue cheese crumbles on my steak or it would\'ve had NO flavor.  I probably only ate 1/2 of my steak.  Steak fries were not traditional looking and hubby said they were "ok".  I did try the mac and cheese and it was pretty good!  The loaded baked potato comes with small portions of sour cream, butter, cheese and chives all on the side on this little plate that had 4 divided sections.  The cheese was hard like it had been sitting out on the side plate for hours.  Am assuming they prep many of these side plates for baked potatoes earlier in the day.  My onions and mushrooms were soggy and I didn\'t care for them.  We did not order dessert (too full from breads and salad!).  Bill was $86 for the 2 of us.  Used my Total Rewards points to pay for it.  And THAT is the only winning moment of the entire evening!  :-)'

I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid\'s meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for "serving off their orders" when they didn\'t have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn\'t make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\nI\'ve eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I\'ve worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!'

Conveniently located within walking distance from our home at Shea/Tatum.\n\nWe heard about Bombay Spice changing to a Mexican Cafe BECAUSE the local market was not supporting the Indian concept.  From what I understand from Randy, manager they have been receiving great feedback of the concept and the food.  so lighten up william.\n\nWe have eaten at Los Sombreos and Frank and Lupes and we are quite happy that this is a closer journey for us.\n\nWe enjoyed a couple rounds of very tasty margaritas.  Made from fresh squeezed lime juice.  I am the "Princess and the Pea" when it comes to margarita mix and I thought they were delicious.  We each ordered tortilla soup.  Ben added the chicken.  Very flavorful and I especially enjoyed the dried chilies added as a garnish.  We also ordered the Customized Guacamole.  You recieve a little check list for all the ingredients you have to choose from.  We opted for the onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lime and pomegrante seeds.  Fresh, tasty, delicious! \n\nFor our entree we ordered the Chile Relleno with Chorizo.  I inquired about an a la carte Enchilada with Chicken because I was curious to taste their Mole Sauce.  We were pleasantly surprised when it came to the table with the relleno. Some places are not really keen on guests ordering a la carte.  But we were happily served.  Also, we added the Salsa Entree that came along with 3 different sauces.  The Habanero sauce was quite intimidating.  Randy warned us that "it will rip your face off". But I was up for the challenge.  I tasted little bits like I thought I was eating caviar.  Better safe than sorry.  \n\nOverall, we had a great dining experience and it is now added to our favorite places to go for Mexican food!  Thank you Randy and Seth for a great time.\n\nI am going to plan a UYE to come back to San Gabriel.  Stay tuned!'

The coke wannabe made from the fruit of the dogberry bush - yeah, the dogberry bush - didn't go over too well with my kid.  I thought it was OK.\n\nVery friendly folks, and your sandwiches are made to order as you wait with plenty of opportunity for input from you.  The house special sandwich, as mentioned in previous reviews, is the best thing on the menu.  The roll they make it on is exceptional.  The veggies they put on it, including thinly sliced bell peppers, are extremely fresh and crisp, which adds great textural dimension.\n\nIf you are looking for a fresh, delicious sandwich served up by pleasant people who actually look you in the eye and have a conversation, Z's is your place."

S"Central Grille has been slow to grow on me, but it's getting there. I have not had the pleasure of enjoying a full meal from Central Grille, but I have had many drinks and appetizers from there. \n\nThe staff is always friendly even laughing at some of the rowdy subject matter from conversations with friends. I feel that they're aiming for a Rat Pack lounge  type of vibe in the bar area, but they're just a bit off when it comes to the music. One evening there was a little old lady playing the piano, another time it was a guy strumming a guitar and singing very boring music. The bar area would be a cool spot to hang all night but the music kills it at times.\n\nI have tried a few of the appetizers which were a-ok, but one thing that was ordered that was AMAZING was the au gratin potatoes. YUM! I highly suggest you try them. Try them by themselves! You won't be sorry.\n\nI hope to visit Central Grille again soon to try their other menu offerings"

S"Whoa Nellie...really...a 1st to review!  Been forever since I seen one these for me!\n\nRoberto's Taco Shop was one of the very first places I tried Mexican food when I arrived at UNLV in 1996.  Prior to that, on Maui many of us locals thought Taco Bell was as authentic as we were ever gonna get.  Boy were my taste buds surprised!  And now, many years later I still keep Roberto's Taco Shop in mind when I want some cheap, hearty Mexican eats.\n\nI'm guessing this Roberto's is fairly new because it hasn't been reviewed yet!  And I can't really find this location on their website yet either.  It's located in the same shopping center on N. Decatur where Walmart is.  It's also very close to where the Goldilocks bakery used to reside, which is sadly now closed.  Bring back the pandesal!  Now I gotta drive my A$$ all the way over to Maryland Parkway for my Filipino pastry fix!\n\nIf you're a fan of Roberto's, you know the standard Mexican fare.  Yes, I realize many of you especially those of you who are really Mexican, think Roberto's is like the McDonald's of Mexican food.  And yes, I realize there is much better Mexican food out there.  But damn, it's so easy to find a Roberto's near me!  Almost no matter where I am in town I am able to easily find a Roberto's nearby.  When Chipotle is not an option, and Taco Bell and Del Taco constantly give me random cramping, and I still have the urge for some carne asada?  I will hit up Roberto's no doubt.\n\nThis Roberto's is particularly clean (I'm guessing because it's new) and bright in color.  Somehow the color of orange mixed with lime green always reminds me of papayas.  I guess it just works for them.  I also read somewhere that bright colors invite feelings of hunger.  Nice psychological marketing ploy for Roberto's!  The menu at this Roberto's is also no different than the other ones in town, which is welcoming for me because I am pretty familiar with their menu.  \n\nI know I shouldn't but I usually stick with the fattiest things I can find on their menu.  Those are the things I first fell in love with when I at Roberto's back in the day.  Beware, eating this stuff on a daily basis can raise cholesterol levels, and turn you into a Fatty McFat Fat!  So please handle with some restraint.  The family and I shared:\n\n-Carne Asada Nachos - covered in marinated steak, tons of fresh shredded cheese, sour cream, and guacamole\n-Carne Asada Quesadilla - burrito sized tortilla folded, loaded with marinated steak, and more of that shredded cheese\n\nMind you, this was supposed to be a snack!  These two items easily filled up the four of us.  As usual, the Carne Asada Nachos were on point, tasty!  It always makes me laugh that these nachos come with a small layer of nacho chips, and loaded with meat, cheese, and toppings.  You usually have to grab a fork to eat the rest of the delicious carne asada.  Or get an extra order of chips.  The quesadilla was good as well.  Oily for sure, but damn good.  Meat - Cheese - Tortilla - Repeat.  Fat = Flavor is the notion at Roberto's, and it sticks!\n\nI am also a fan of Roberto's rolled tacos, and their tortas.  Try their lengua in a burrito, some of the best damn tongue you've ever had!  Well, relatively speaking.  Yes, their tongue is very good indeed.\n\nWhat I also love about Roberto's is their complimentary salsa bar.  Load up on red and green sauces, but don't forget helpings of fresh cut cucumbers, radishes, green onion, and pickled carrots!  All to cleanse the palette and cool down the senses.  Or grab a cup of Horchata to go with your Mexican meal.  Refreshing!\n\nService here is friendly, and super fast.  Prices are very nice and cheap, definitely on par with other fast food joints you go to.  Ole!"

S"The weather turned cold and rainy my first evening in Montreal, but after being stuck on a plane for six hours, I was determined to take a walk and have a good meal.\n\nI found Cibo et Vino in one of the hotel guides, and as I love Italian food and the resto was within walking distance, I set our for a bit of adventure. Armed with an umbrella provided by the Fairmont, I arrived at the restaurant within 10 minutes, a bit wet and famished.\n\nAt the door I hesitated to enter, not because of the menu, but because I could see only one occupied table. Still, the promise of pasta overruled my trepidation. It was, after all, Monday--a typically slow night.\n\nThe decor was quaint Italian and the menu was fairly simple: soup of the day, a few salads, pizzas, and about a dozen pastas--mostly classics, with some twists. I ordered the cream of mushroom soup and, though the sauce would be similar, I decided on one of the signature dishes: pasta Cibo with a cream sauce, mushrooms, prosciutto, and green onions. When the waiter took my order, he asked what type of pasta I'd like, which was a pleasant surprise. I opted for fettucini.\n\nMy generous bowl of soup arrived a short while later, along with a delicious freshly baked/warmed roll. The soup reminded me of a cream of mushroom that I once made from scratch years ago. There was a good depth of flavor, and the soup had just a hint of cream. It was perfect for a rainy night, and I had to prevent myself from finishing the whole bowl.\n\nBy then the other diners had departed, so I had the entire restaurant to myself and settled in to decide on plans for my visit to Montreal. After a short wait, my pasta arrived. Even in the low light, I could see a nice yellowness to the pasta. When I asked the waiter later if the pasta had been made in house, he said yes. It had that silky texture but toothsomeness that only comes with homemade pasta. The fettucine, bathed lightly in a rich cream sauce, was studded with chunks of prosciutto, slices of mushrooms, and slivers of green onion. The waiter had offered me some fresh pepper, and it really enhanced the flavors of all the other ingredients. Unfortunately, I was too full to finish the entire pasta--though I gave it a good try--and I also skipped dessert. \n\nAs I surveyed the empty restaurant, I hoped that it was usually far busier. The food was much too good to not have a room full of happy customers enjoying it."

The list goes on. Personally, i always have the same - the spicy chilli prawn cocktail on the brown seeded baguette. Amazing.\n\nThe trouble is that a lot of other people know how amazing this place is too - if you dont get there quick, you will be at the back of a large queue and they wont have any of your favourate filling left.'

S'Area C is a great new cafe on Leith Walk, taking over the premises that previously housed the Deli Polonia cafe. They showcase really good Steampunk coffee, have quirky mis-matched furniture, including a little tipi, and their food is really impressive. Fans of the chickpea are particularly well-served, with freshly made falafel and hummus (served with things like pomegranate seeds and chilli oil) forming the backbone of their selection. Their soup, with two daily changing veggie options, is really good, too :-)\n\nOverall, we said: "Area C made an excellent first impression. Each element of their offering seems not only very good, but much more settled and assured than you\'d expect from a place in its first few weeks of trading. Service was friendly, helpful and informed at all times, too. My advice would be to go and try it for yourself, at your earliest opportunity."'

He's about as friendly a guy as you'd like to meet and takes his food seriously.  He said he cooks everything like he's cooking it for himself.  He showed me the huge package of meat he makes the fresh burgers from and a potato the size of a football.\n\nI got a cheeseburger with fries and even though the burger was huge I ate the whole thing. The burgers are steamed on the grill to keep the moisture in and let the fat out.  This makes it a burger that isn't as greasy and heavy as usual. Everything was as good as my mother would make.

S'The only reason I go here is because it\'s so very very close to my house & they have superfast wireless. The staff is sometimes super helpful and , well, sometimes not very helpful. The walls are bright and cheery, the owners seem to be very committed to the community and providing a space for events that probably have a hard time in other venues - weekly belly dancing, weekly political movie nights, speed dating for single vegetarians, etc. The seating is a lot of low tables and pillows, and yes, there are often a lot of hippies here. The space is bright and open, and provides a "community" space - I have seen spirited discussions start up among strangers across the room. \n\nYIV is open late like a bar, but there\'s no smoking or alcohol, which is a positive thing, honestly. Some of their special brewed iced teas are heavenly - a lot of other menu items are a little "eh." they can make turkish coffee, but they have no espresso machine. a lot of the beverages are not good when you order them with soy milk, so be careful, my vegans. the food is highly variable, but usually at least edible, and there are vegan options. \n\nit\'s good for all ages - ive seen lots of happy little kids here. and the older set too - BYOB with a small corking fee. the flavored sodas are pretty fucking delicious - i recommend lavendar vanilla. \n\nI definitely get the impression that this is a group of people who are pretty new to running a business, but they are working to make it happen, and I think that\'s a lot of what Butler Street needs.'

S"I don't know what's up with all the hate! :) \nI've been here several times (with groups ranging from 4 to around 15 people) and I like it! It's a BYOB, and the prices are quite reasonable (less than $15/person). The decor on the covered terrace is cutesy/kitsch, with little plastic flowers on the walls and ceiling, but the interior dining area is a little more formal, though still casual.   \nThe grilled meat (I tried chicken and beef) was flavourful and moist, with a nice combination of sweet and spice. Granted, there was some sneaky business with the battered shrimp (it was cut in half, with each side battered.. ah HAH! I'm on to you....) but it was good, regardless. The vegetables in the soup were crisp and fresh.  The salad is one of typical greens, tomato and onion, with julienned carrots and beet, but the sauce (also used with the imperial rolls) is tangy, sweet and delicious. I can't comment on the other options - I've only had the grilled meat combos. All in all, it's a nice little place."

S'I woke from a drunken stupor not knowing where I was & how I got here.  The last thing I remember seeing prior to the temporary shut down of my eyelids was Blue Martini and the next thing I know, I ended up in the Philippines!  \n\nThis place had all the makings of a typical Filipino disco lounge...the flowing San Miguel Beer, Filipino servers speaking Tagalog, and Karaoke!  We sat in the patio to get away from the interesting music selections by one of the restaurant patrons and because it was nice to be out there soaking up the mild summer heat.  The menu was a little blurry because the alcohol was starting to kick in a bit so all I could remember were the pretty steep prices & large selection of items.  I was a little disappointed that some of the entrees didn\'t come with rice because...well...Filipinos eat practically everything with rice!  Hearing "no sorry ma\'am it doesn\'t come with rice" immediately snapped me out of my lethargic state and I almost keeled over in my seat.  I ended up ordering the topsilog (tocino w/ 2 fried eggs served over garlic fried rice) because of this.  I don\'t know if it was the alcohol or if I just didn\'t have high expectations but it was the best Topsilog I\'ve ever had in my 26 years of existence!  The sizzling Sisig platter that the BF ordered was also just as good.  Who would\'ve thought that the one of best Filipino food restaurants could be found slightly off the strip?!!  \n\nThis will definitely be a a required stop the next time I\'m in town...especially since I have yet to try the drinks there & the assortment of Pancit & desserts!!'

Even though it may not be the cheapest (per person banquet cost) it turned out to be probably the best value. We had a huge amount of cold cuts and appetizers, little fondue things, humongous amount of main entree (I placed a special order this time) and then we had an excellent birthday cake.\n\nAs a bonus we enjoyed young woman playing accordion and then singer who was taking all of our special requests :) \n\nThanks to everyone at Eliseevsky for making it a special night!"

S'I work nearby so sometimes I pop in at The Spread to change up my menu options. I almost always get the chicken fingers, which are a great price. It\'s something like $6 or $7 for them and they\'re a decent size and very filling. They make it for you right on the spot so it\'s always hot and fresh.\n\nI also need to point out that their fries are freakin\' amazing. One time my friend ordered them and I couldn\'t stop having "just one more." They really taste like In N Out fries, but a little better seasoned. \n\nAlso, the staff is incredibly nice. I was worried since I came in the morning-time to order a lunch food that they might get annoyed, but nobody even thought twice about it. It\'s my favorite part of Downtown Grand.'

S'I would not go to Native New Yorker nearly as much if I didn\'t live in Anthem, but my choices are pretty limited. Here\'s what I like about it, Chris is my favorite server, and he\'s awesome and on top of his shit. There\'s lots of options besides pizza, which makes me happy. Lots of salads, burgers, sandwiches, baked potatoes, and pastas. Happy hour is pretty good, too. Prices are reasonable at non happy hour times and it\'s super kid friendly so I don\'t feel like an asshole bringing my 2 year old. Oh heads up, lots and lots of cheddar jack? cheese on the spinach dip, which is different, but I like. I also love love the honey hot sauce for the wings. I make my husband take the meat of the bones for me cause chicken on bones is gross. Yea, I said it. \nHere\'s what I don\'t like. Whenever Chris isn\'t working, the service isnt great. I waited for my check forever last time, pretty much pre bussed my own table (no problem, I had plenty of time) while watching our server watch the game on tv. Like I said, I have a 2 year old. After he\'s done eating, its a very short window of time before things gets real out of hand. Also, Im a baked potato fan and its a 50/50 shot of whether or not mine will be cooked. Hard "baked" potatoes are not delicious. How hard is to make sure a potato is done? \nOverall, it\'s bar food, but good bar food, with lots of variety.\nSo if youre in Anthem, first, ask yourself why? Then, if youre hungry, go to Native, but only if Chris is working and you can sit in his section. And dont get all fancy with your ordering, theyre better at basics. Except basic baked potatoes, that they suck at.'

S"I went here for dinner and will never go back again. \n\nI thought the combinations on the menu were kind of bizarre- having some pizza with pasta on the side- but maybe that's just me, too much carbs and starch on one plate is kind of off-putting. The menu had some choices that sounded good, but that's it. \n\nI ordered a 'make your own pasta', which had penne, mixed vegetables, and rose sauce. When my dinner arrived, it was not what I was expecting. Way too much pasta, and not enough vegetables- there were maybe 2 florets each of broccoli and cauliflower, and maybe 3 pieces each of red and green peppers. The vegetables didn't even seem cooked. The pasta was doused in sauce and was not very pleasant to eat.  There was so much pasta, it could have been split between 2-3 people. I noticed all the food going out looked like it could have fed that many people. Why make that much food for one person? i don't understand. Takeout the rest after maybe, but I certainly didn't want to.\n\nThe dessert was just as bad- I ordered a mousse, which was much too rich, and again there was too much of it.\n\nDespite the gross food, I think the service was good. The waitress was friendly to me, addressing me in English as I was the only anglophone at the table. I'd give the place 1.5 stars because of the service.\n\nThe food is memorable, but for all the wrong reasons."

It's a small space so their buffet is fairly limited, but everything on it is of very high quality - significantly better than any other Indian place in Oakland. Highlights include perfectly fluffy naan, moist and flavorful tandoori chicken, and a very bold chicken tikka masala. Owners/staff are very friendly. My one complaint is that they don't warm the food very well, and some of the items get cold during slow periods. Still, for $7 you can't find a better lanuch."

Similar feel to Dresslers (same ownership) but more casual and with even more moderate prices.\n\nThe food has ranged from pretty good to very good. The menu isn\'t large but there\'s a varied enough selection. There\'s nothing on the menu that screamed "order me!" to me but most everything was intriguing enough. I\'ve had the trout in several ways, the salmon, the tuna and the steal and and all were prepared with good ingredients and skill. I\'d lean to the fish more than the steak. The service is wonderful - professional, friendly, and with an attitude says they really care about pleasing their guests. \n\nLovely atmosphere - very comfortable, with a nice patio with fireplace that lets you enjoy dining outside in less than perfect weather. \n\nThe wine list isn\'t huge but has plenty nice choices.\n\nA very solid choice for business or casual regardless of the location, and considering its the only place to get a fine meal in the vicinity its a slam dunk.'

While we got stuck in to the free prawn crackers they brought us out a compliemntary starter of deep fried chicken with lemon grass (which they'd made gluten free especially for me!) and it was delicious - will definately look for it on the menu next time! \n\nThe restaurant was a bit quiet to start with but then it got really busy and was a good atmosphere, there's some good areas for bigger or more private parties at the back. If I were being slightly critical I'd say that the sudden increase in customers meant our starter plates lay for a bit too long but that just meant they were all very clean by the time they took them away! The crispy aromatic duck was fantastic as was the duck in orange n cointreau, everyone ate far too much as it was just to good to leave!

This was because you could only taste the alcohol if you focused.  Two brisket dinners went back because they were tough as leather.  All the prime rib was tasty but".........cold.  Ribs tasty but the glaze on the outside was tough and poked your lips.  Coleslaw, well out of our party of ten, one person ate it.  The waitress?  Who?  Never hardly saw her.  Tea refills?  That\'s not happening without a tackle.  We did not dare try any dessert.  Well, at tip time we really didn\'t want to but our upbringing demanded it but it definitely was not deserved.  The service was terrible?  You would think after a review like this that we would never return.  You are absolutely right.  Save yourself the frustration and save your money.'

S'The location of Crepe de Licious (inside the Illinois Student Union) will probably be enough to scare off any diner who is not affiliated with the university.  The basement of the union is set up as a mall-style food court, and Crepe de Licious is just another fast food option thrown into the mix.  However, unlike the other union restaurants, which are all recognizable chains (Sbarro, Chick-Fil-A, McAllister\'s), Crepe de Licious is privately owned and operated (in case you care about that kind of thing).  The rest of the food court area is decorated with cheap plastic furniture, but there is a seating area adjacent to Crepe de Licious that is slightly more private and cozy.\n\nAs the name suggests, the primary menu item here are crepes with various fillings, though there are also options for burgers and beef hot dogs.  Also unlike the other restaurants in the union, Crepe de Licious offers breakfast items--if you are traveler staying at the union hotel, you will notice a distinct lack of breakfast restaurants in the campustown area, so Crepe de Licious is one of your few options.  While the crepe varieties are not particularly exciting (just variations of grilled meat, vegetables, cheese, and sauce), I do appreciate that this place uses fresh vegetables in their fillings, including baby spinach and romaine lettuce.  By the way, I am pretty sure their "special sauce" (advertised as a topping on most crepes) is just ranch dressing.\n\nRecently, Crepe de Licious introduced "Bombay wraps" to their menu.  You can choose your bread (naan or crepe), flavoring (tikka masala, madras curry, etc.), and filling (grilled veggies or meat).  My veggie bombay wrap came with crisp lettuce, grilled mushrooms and peppers, and a chopped veggie burger.  This was a very simple lunch (fairly easy to duplicate at home), but it was still filling and well-seasoned.  I would probably order it regularly when I need a quick lunch on campus.\n\nMost items on the menu cost $5 or less, which is extremely reasonable considering the location and other options at the Student Union.  Crepes, wraps, and burgers are all in the $5 range, while sides (like fries) are only $1.\n\nIf you are looking for exotic, refined crepes, I would try Carmon\'s in downtown Champaign.  However, if you are stuck on campus looking for a cheap, healthy lunch option (and especially if you are a visitor staying at the union hotel), Crepe de Licious would be a sound choice.'

The table next to us raved about it to the waitress so I definitely need to give that a try. All in all not a bad experience and I look forward to trying some of the other dishes they have to offer."

Because the eggs will sit in the warming tray for hours, they bring them out a little soupy knowing that they'll firm up with the constant heat. Yuck.\n\nAnywho, my buddy and I were first for the breakfast buffet, runny eggs and all. Other than that, the food service was great. Bacon had a selection of crispy and not crispy, sausage was done evenly, potatoes were crisp, pancakes were warm and fluffy. In fact, everything but the eggs was great."

S"There are a lot of Domino's branches in Edinburgh, but this one is definitely my favourite! The staff are really friendly and if you ask for anything extra or special they will deliver. My ex boyfriend once was trying to make it up to me for being a total twat and so ordered a pizza to spell out 'i love you' in pepperoni. Developing on from this, I always like to have my friends names on their pizza's, just to see the reaction on their face when they open it up. I get the feeling that not every branch will allow this (following a less than enthusiastic conversation with the Morningside Branch) so it just goes to show what a great branch this is.\n\nPersonally, I LOVE their BBQ Texas and Ham and Pineapple is a nice version. My favourite thing about Domino's is their little pots of garlic sauce to dip the crust into - genius! They often give you an extra pot too, if you order 2 pizza's. They have a great deal on every week too - particularly Two for Tuesdays. Check out the websites for your nearest and their deals. Seriously worth looking into!"

The drive-thru is run by a bunch of rapping-gangsta teenagers who curse freely when they "mistakenly" leave their microphone on, come-on to you sexually when you drive up to pay, and serve you food that has been sitting under the heat lamp for too long. I\'ve been served a salad with barely any toppings that are supposed to come with the salad, a burger that was room-temperature at best, and I always feel like I need a shower after conversing with the "slick-talkin\' " drive-thru boy.'

What I got was a chicken fajita on a hot plate with onions, bell peppers, carrots. Then a separate bowl of bland sauce-the same sauce that my companion got on her bland food. For $14, I would have at least expected a tortilla to go with it. The naan was really salty and buttery. I also ordered garlic naan and got what even the waiter called "garlic bread". The only good thing was the mango lassi. I wish I could be more positive, but I\'ve had better fast food Indian in strip malls.'

S"I was staying down in Fort Mill the weekend of St. Patrick's Day, and after we had dinner, we decided to go down to Baxter to have a couple of beverages.  When we arrived (probably around 9 or 9:30), the place was pretty packed inside and a lot of people were also hanging out on the patio.  \n\nThe bar was really crowded, so getting up there to place a drink order was going to be a challenge - then out of nowhere a friendly server appeared to take our drink orders, YAY!  \n\nSince they were celebrating St. Patty's day early, there were a couple of drink specials.  One of the specials was a martini with mint -chocolate - I think it was called the Skinny Mint.  OMG, this thing was heavenly - it tasted like mint chocolate chip ice cream! I think the normal price was $12, but on this night, it was only $8.  \n\nThe bar also had live music going, so it was a great spot to hang out & people watch.  The only negative thing about the place is the bathroom situation.  They have a single toilet for men and a single toilet for women.... needless to say, with all the drinking going on, lines for both got really long at times!! \n\nOne cool thing about Cloud 9 is that you can see all types of people hanging out in one spot... it is definitely a mixed crowd, which makes things interesting! You will see all ethnicities, as well as rednecks, LGBTs, young professionals,  married couples, divorcees, cougars, college kids, retirees, transplants from the northeast (Think My Cousin Vinny), hippies, blue collar folks, white collar folks, etc. all under the same roof!

I wasnt going to write this review because i hate seeing negative reviews but after i saw my credit card statement i am leaving it bc this is a dirty business. \nWent here for breakfast with my family, restaurant is completely disgusting and dirty, the service was awful and the food was worse. They ended up taking off one if our plates bc THE EGGS WERENT COOKED. Like, at all, and the man tried to argue they were "over easy" over easy means the yolks arent broken, not that the whites arent cooked. Ok so total comes out to $36 after the one is taken off, $7 tip. Credit card statement: total $49. They added the food they took off into the tip so they would get the money for it. \nCOMPLETELY DIRTY AND ILLEGAL. This business will not succeed because of the dirty business practices you do. You serve shit for food and like i said i wasnt going to write a Negative review bc the food did suck as well as the service but i did bc of the dirty business practice of this skeeze ball.

I had heard all kinds of great things about La Unica. Maybe I set the bar too high in my head. I've been here a handful of times now and nothing has been overly impressive. Nothing has been bad... it's just all okay. One thing I will not recommend is the ceviche. Probably should've known better than to order that in a place like this, but we really wanted to try it.\n\nI like that they bring you two different kinds of salsa. One hot, one mild. I like the cheese dip, too. They usually have drink specials of some sort. Nice spot to get down on some chips and cheap drinks. The lunch menu is reasonably priced. Tuesdays they have dollar tacos. \n\nNot terrible, not fantastic. A-OK. I just think there are much better Mexican spots near/around the Plaza Midwood area."

My amiga and I had this spot recommended because it's one of the few that serve Birria and I would definitely agree on the quality.  Birria is a kind of goat soup that is spiced heavily and served with tortillas.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is more or less a large room with tables and a cashier stand.  The menu is 90% Spanish, and there were definitely a few things I had never heard of before.  Every time I've gone there I believe I have been the only non-Spanish speaker there, but for the most part everyone is very friendly.\n\nAgain, this is not a date-spot or a place to impress anyone (unless they are snobs about traditional Mexican food!), but rather a good place to go to kick it with some Telemundo and delicious food.\n\nOne last piece of advice if you're headed there - bring cash!

This location has indeed found their groove:\n\n- Portions & proportions are both in check\n- Fresh fruits are the standard\n- Service is A1\n\nI'm thrilled to have a B&F closer to home (though Kirkland wasn't really a big schlep).\n\nBonus: West Island residents usually get a set of coupons for B&F in the mail on a monthly basis. It's in those cheque-sized booklets. Though the coupon is only valid M-F, more price-sensitive buyers can indulge in a smoothie or fancy coffee mid-week."

S'I had a craving for noodles today, along with a significant hangover, so I decided to try this Chinese restaurant as it had a good review on here previously. This was a mistake, we probably knew that as we walked in, but were lulled by the positive review on here, so continued through the tinted glass door and into the eerily quiet restaurant with an audience of staff sat watching us. \n\nCombo starter was deep fat fried prawn toast, spring rolls & ribs - did they ALL have to be deep fried?! - but at least it was REALLY fast I suppose. And what with the hangover & food cravings that was a bonus! Then the main courses were brought out: sweet & sour chicken Cantonese style, Singapore noodles, boiled rice. \n\nThe chicken in pink sauce was only relatively nice due to the fact that the noodles didn\'t taste of anything apart from a hint of cleaning fluid & a fair kick of spice. I only ate half the noodles, & only ate that much because of the aforementioned hankering; also i had to steal pink sauce from the chicken to make them palatable! \n\nMy partner ate all her chicken, but most of the rice was left, due to the fact that there wasn\'t enough pink sauce to flavour all her rice AND all of my noodles! There were 3 other tables in when we arrived, but eventually they left one by one, leaving us the only couple in there, the only people for them to wait on/ stare at! We spent quite a bit of time discussing all the positives of the restaurant (I liked the trap door in the floor, my partner liked the blinds, I liked the plastic flowers, she liked the hand dryer in the toilet, we both liked the water..!) as well as laughing at the sheer awkwardness of the situation (awkward turtle!) There was also discussion about how terribly British we both were in that we weren\'t able to complain and send the food back! As we asked for the bill I decided that since I was intending to write a review on here, I should at least let them know in person that the meal had been a little disappointing to give them the opportunity to do something about it. I was just politely asked to put my pin in the card machine, and told that I as I had eaten it "all" then I must have enjoyed it!! The staff were lovely, friendly, polite, however the food was non of this, and was on the pricey side in my opinion. I would not go back, and would def recommend going anywhere else but here for noodles. This kind of restaurant is the reason I usually don\'t like Chinese food, what a disappointment Pine Garden :-('

S'Situated right next door to the esteemed Castle Terrace, Il Castello offers the standard menu of Italian classics. My starter wasn\'t particularly great, but the main course of lamb cutlets was really good. It\'s very reasonably priced and the staff are friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable.\n\nOverall, we said: "I rather enjoyed Il Castello. Their take on melanzane wasn\'t for me, but that aside it strikes me as a very reliable, friendly little place. And what\'s more, their espresso was so good that I had a second one. Next time you\'re in the environs, pop in for a warm welcome and good Italian fare."'

S'I looked at the menu before I went and had high hopes, but was very disappointed. I got the groupon after looking at the menu and brought a couple friends with me- they didn\'t love it either. \n\nWe got bruschetta that didn\'t taste very fresh and was a bit brown in color. Two of us got the grilled apple, bacon and cheddar panini. The bread was  thick and greasy with butter, not grilled like a traditional panini. The break overpowered the sandwich. She got french fries and they were good, I got sweet potato fries and they were bland. The other friend got chili which she said was very meaty, but didn\'t have much else besides meat. The bowl was also very tiny- I guess they don\'t have more than one size.\n\nIt was also cold and the music was loud. Our server was very nice but didn\'t seem very experienced serving. When we told her we didn\'t love the bruschetta she just replied "oh, heh, not something you\'ll order again?" I was a bit embarrassed I brought my friends here.'

And what do you know, a Domino's commercial came on....and it was a wrap.\n\nNow, I've never really been a big fan of Domino's I didn't like the sauce, or crust and after a while I just kinda stopped trying and ordering. So, I won't lie initially I was not a happy camper. But when my friends suggested we skip the traditional red sauce and order white sauce I was a little more optimistic. \n\nWe ordered the special two medium two topping pizzas for $5.99 each. The first pie had ham and feta cheese with white sauce and the second was their Philly cheese steak and banana peppers with of course their white sauce. \n\nWelp, here's my moment of shame. I actually liked both pizzas. \n\nBetween the white sauce and the hint of garlic in their crust I found myself wanting to eat more and more. My favorite was the Philly cheese steak. It seemed like a weird combination at the time but it was actually really good...tasty flavors and those banana peppers just put it over the top. \n\nSo for now, they get an A-OK in my book. I'll give them another try and see if they can't officially win me over."

S"Gourmet Grub - wow what a contradiction! This place is definitely worth a visit. Situated in the pub central area of Edinburgh, Rose Street, Gourmet Grub is right in the centre and so it is a handy place to go for a great meal. Gourmet Grub serves very traditional pub style lunches, with a fairly standard menu including fish and chips, club sandwiches, omelette's and wraps. \n\nI have eaten here several times for lunch, and each time the food has been completely delicious. I love their burgers, as they are nice and chunky, always perfectly cooked and really juicy and full of flavour - yum! The portion sizes are really decent here and the prices are reasonable too with burgers, wraps and sandwiches costing about \xc2\xa37 so it is excellent value for money. \n\nGourmet Grub also offer a wide breakfast menu too so it is a great place to come for brunch, or for a cooked breakfast to cure a hangover. They also do takeaways which is convenient if you are in a rush.  A really great place to eat with delicious food - GO!!!"

After 10 mins of ordering, they call me and tell me they dont have chicken shish kabab available and I agree to switch the order. After that they took one hour to deliver and when the guy came, he forgot to bring one order and starts to argue with me that I paid for just one order. Then I had to call the manager and then again they took another half an hour. So basically I had to wait for just two plates of kababs for TWO HOURS!!

S"My friends had their wedding here which was great because my BF lives in the community so it took all of 3 minutes to drive here haha and it was actually a very BEAUTIFUL wedding!!! With the sun perfectly setting behind them on the golf course as they said their vows. After the ceremony we all went inside the club house where they completely transformed it! The purple lighting was nice as well as the little dance floor. My friends even rented a photo booth so we had fun with that. They also had set up all the pretty banquet tables and chairs on the balcony but it was pretty chilly that night. I wish they had more heating lamps! The bartender handled all the thirsty guests well so I give him props especially since it was open bar. \n\nI think the service was really weird and there was definitely a lack of communication. They had a little buffet line set up in the corner with some colossal shrimp cocktail and bruschetta. The shrimp were HUGE and delicious! They also had some items in heated serving trays. Some of the older people were hungry so they were served the actual dinner as well which was prime rib, potatoes and veggies. Pretty soon I saw lots of people enjoying the dinner portion and we were starving so we went to get some as well but then another server came out and yelled at the server who was carving the prime rib saying it wasn't dinner time yet. Anyways he had to turn away everyone waiting in line and of course this upset most people. How unorganized! Then at the tables the server came around just once to fill our water glasses and gave us the tiniest bit of champagne. \n\nSo for weddings here the food and atmosphere are great!!! I think they just need to work on their communication and organization with the staff. \n\nALSO we came here once before to enjoy the happy hour which they had advertised on their website. I called ahead to confirm and they said yes they honor the Happy Hour. My friends got there before me and the server said NO they don't have HH. WTF. I told them to tell her I called ahead to confirm.. They ended up approving the HH for us.. but again WTF... lack of communication on their part."

I had a VERY similar situation to the review that is currently filtered. Rude service, I was hung up on by the so-called Asst. Manager after I called to express that my pizza was burnt. I was so appalled that I called back and spoke to yet another manager who told me that I would have to track down the owner and he only provided me with his first name "Scott." The only reason I upgraded to a 2 star, is because when my husband went in to return our burnt pizza, they actually made it to our specificiations. Rosati\'s is usually my pizza of choice, but the Maricopa location is sub-par.'

The service was horrible every single time I went. It didn't matter if they were busy or slow, although I don't think I ever saw more than 5 people in the restaurant at any one time. I went early into lunch time, late near the end of the lunch rush and later in the evening and every time I was practically ignored while the staff talked to each other complained about having to work a day after a holiday and other staff members. On a couple of occasions an employee would come out from the back, where they hide until a customer comes in, and they would walk to the register and stand there staring off into space. Never making eye contact. Apparently they are not trained in making sandwiches or using the slicer but a hello, someone will be right with you would have been greatly appreciated. Then the sandwich maker would make their way out, they'd chat with the register guy and take their time washing their hands (much appreciated) and putting on their gloves. Eventually they shuffle their way to their position and ask me what I would like. They have on almost every visit, stopped in the middle of making my sandwich to discuss whatever is on their mind with their co-workers. Standing their with half of the turkey for my sandwich in their hand. There is never anyone who remotely acts like a manager around. Maybe they are hiding in that special room in the back. This last (and final) visit there were two other people in line when I came in. the staff was chit chatting and ignoring every customer. Eventually they asked the first customer what he wanted. Then proceeded to ask each of us quickly what we wanted and started making sandwiches. Instead of taking care of each customer as they came in they lumped us all together and made me feel like we were bothering them. When I finally got to the register guy he took his sweet time, presents with me a receipt that has a spot for a tip (really??) and then made an exaggerated effort to read what was written on my shirt making me more than a little uncomfortable and then proceeded to argue with me whether Yoga was jut like going to a gym. I really wanted to throw my sandwich at him. So to sum it up, Jersey Mike's good sandwiches! Terrible service at this location and I will NEVER go back. Sadly this one location has turned me off of the brand."

Been twice adn the service ahs been exemplary.\n\nWent with my husband who has a gluten intoelrance adn they ahve a separate menu!!! \n\nThey took extra care to ensureanything we had was not contaminated and ensured we knew which dishes were gluten-free and which were not. Even offered tomake up a special dessert for my husband. \n\nThe food is always good. The coconut chicken and quesadillas stood out the most. But everything was good. \n\nHighly recommend, especially if you are gluten-free'

S'I had heard of this bakery from a competitor who holds shop in Chandler.  I have fond memories of delicious cakes from Red Ribbon from birthday parties of years past back home.   Filipinos LOVE to throw a party, and I swear cakes from Red Ribbon were always present.  You can imagine the nostalgia that swept over me, then, when I finally found this bakeshop situated near the food court in Arizona Mills.\n\nThe shop looked so pretty- all lit up and all these enticing baked goods wrapped in plastic/cellophane with candy-red printing.  (Hmm... an alarm went off in my head after seeing them all wrapped up.)  The shop looked very clean, with welcoming tables and chairs, and my, how lovely those cake rolls look in the case!  Imagine, then, my disappointment upon reading the nutrition info on these plastic-wrapped goods to find that most, if not all, items are made with margarine, not butter.  These baked goods failed the "farm vs. factory" test- ingredients listed sound more like they\'re mechanically-produced in a factory rather than being all-natural, such as "flour, eggs, butter, milk," etc.  Before sampling what I must admit was a delicious morsel of mocha crunch cake, I asked if the frosting contained powdered sugar.  The sales clerk looked at his coworker, whom I assumed is a manager, who looked at him, then looked at me, and then said "We think it\'s whipped cream."  Think??  How can you not know what ingredients are used in the products you sell?  I also inquired if any items are made on-site.  No, he said.  Everything is shipped/trucked in, and the only preparations done at the bakeshop are the frying- the FRYING- of the empanadas and the re-heating of the siopao and noodle dishes.  \n\nSorry Red Ribbon, but this Filipina only wants goods baked with butter, not margarine.  I said BAKED, not fried.  With the exception of the pie shell used in the egg pie, all of the pastries served at Manila Bakery are made on-site, so you won\'t find preservatives listed in the ingredients, as well.  \n\nMy fond memories of those cakes will have to be just that, memories.  All the better when it comes to those twice-daily weigh-ins...'

S'I visited here again today after over 6 months, shows you how much they impressed me last time I visited. Went inside, visited the bathroom and found the soap dispenser empty, makes me wonder how the employees wash up, then out to order. I wanted extra crispy but was told they didn\'t have it for about 45 minutes, but I could get original receipe in about ten minutes. OK, I can wait 10 minutes, got my cup, off to the soda machine, found the drink I wanted was out, told the manager about both the soda and soap and got the famous glassey eyed stare of, "What the hell do you want me to do about it" Looked over receipt and noticed a 39 cent surcharge on my bill for using a debit card, that is a first I have ever seen. Got my food and sat down to eat, when finished it had been about 40 minutes, the soda machine still wasn\'t refilled and the soap dispenser in the bathroom was still empty. Well I goy my sharpie ready and now,  another place crossed off my list of possibilities of having lunch.'

S"A mtl institution, \n\nThe very best pasta i've ever tasted, even compared to Babbo's in NYC... it shines in its simplicity.\n\nThe dishes are rustic, the restaurant is old school, we come here to eat, they serve you with care and charm. If you love food you will have a wonderful time.\n\nThe gnocchi, is absolutely a must have. it is tender and soft, slightly chewy like the texture of a fresh mozzarella ball. AND it remains soft and tender chewy even when cold!!! the texture remains the same, it's the only place that cold gnocchi remains soft... it is served in tomato pesto with basil. That's it!!! pinch of pepper parmesan and splash of olive oil, and voila. In my opinion this is best best gnocchi I've had...\n\nThe ravioli, again the best i've ever had. it's not there every night, the menu changes every night, all it had was pumpkin in it and served with sage and olive oil. The texture was tough upon manipulation, it looked a bit too al dente, but when you bit into it, it was soft and gave quite easily, but the outside was just smooth looking. These ravioli were made with love, each unique in its uneven cuts...\n\nThe risotto was also excellent, the rice grains were cooked through but not soggy, and yet just soft enough to absorb the sauce... again very simple white wine with some mushrooms but you smelled the mushroom throughout the dish, maybe they use mushroom broth...\n\nAll the dishes are pretty straightforward, no overpowering ingredients, everything blends to perfection. There is something to be said for serving pastas almost bare, because it is so good it needs little else...\n\nupdate: now closed :("

S"Poor. Museum cafes are always going to be a bit of a fleecing but to be a fleecing with such rotten service is very special indeed. The food was so-so. \xc2\xa39 for a sandwich and chips with these presented in a silly, pretend frying basket. (Hate that). The main issue was how glacially slow this entire proceeding was. Our kid's ice cream never arrived and the excuse was an overwhelmed kitchen staff. In a half empty restaurant? It was more likely to be a poorly managed kitchen and poorly trained staff. We asked to pay without having received our child's dessert. We were not charged for the dessert.  I asked the manager what the deal was and she said they had let in too many people who did not have reservations. Smells like bull to me. Don't bother. The Botanics is always a nice treat but step out of the place for a snack. Really."

The take away options are much fresher and at \xc2\xa34-5 for main dish I really like this option too, the sizes are decent as well.\n\nThe first 2-3 times I went in I found the staff to be a bit grumpy, and the decor a bit old, but the good food kept me coming back, especially for take away. The last time I went in though all the staff were really friendly which was nice, hopefully the customer care is on the up."

S'I\'ve been watching this place for months and months with a opening soon sign. It\'s close to work so I was looking forward to it opening, operative word "was". Well it finally opened and I went to try it.\n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito. It was asada, beans, cheese and I beleive sour cream according to the description. I liked the ratio, mostly meat with a few beans, could have used more cheese.\n\nI took a bite and it was like getting a gulp of ocean water it was so salty. If you\'re on a low sodium diet, stay away. It took the hotter sauces to mask the salt, which also masked the flavor of the ingredients, which was insignificant, since the only flavor was salt.  The texture was fine, no grizzly pieces of meat to chew through, but the overwhelming salt taste ruined it. Except for the calorie intake, I could have gotten as much taste enjoyment out of eating a salt packet.\n\nThey have other rmeats available, they might be fine, I don\'t know nor will I know. I won\'t be back, If I might suggest, directly across the street is Cardenas market, they have a cocina in the store with excellent food, I would recommend going there.'

S"Went here for a birthday party. Had the downstairs banquet room. Atmosphere was decent. Arrived around 6:45pm.\n\nAfter being seated and other guests were arriving, and the birthday guest of honour arrived and socialized, we were served some calamari and fruit/meat. We thought it was a great way to start a meal. \n\nAbout an hour later, we received a simple garden salad with vinaigrette. \n\nAbout an hour after that, the waiter came around to take our order. We'd yet to see a menu. Seems they had limited menu, understandable for the amount of people, but only a couple of sheet printed out for a room of 20 or so people. We informed the waiter we had not seen the menu and he proceeded to inform us of the choices, in a very low, very bored voice. He said there was rib steak, or salmon, for $35, and porcetta or sausage pizza for $30. Served with vegetables. No specifics. He left the table, still not having shown us the menu, and came back about 15 minutes later to take our order. Most of us at our section of the table ordered steak. \n\nSometime later, about 45 minutes or so, we received our meals, sans-steak-knives. And let me say... The steak was not nice enough to cut through with a butter knife. At least not comfortably. So we requested steak knives. The steak was just ok. A bit bland, I had to put quite a bit of salt to have it taste like something. \n\nSometime after the meal, there was birthday cake. Took some time to serve the cake. \n\nTook some time after that to receive the bill. When we got the bill, it was about 11:00pm. 4 hours after we arrived. \n\nOur tables had to request water constantly, as the jugs were never re-filled without the request. \n\nThe biggest problem was that there were 2 waiters for 2 separate banquet rooms, both nearly full. So no one got good service, and we were so confused by the waiters not really caring. Not even enough to show us a menu. \n\nAfter a quiet discussion, we agreed that we would not be leaving a good tip. I'm of the mind that a tip is not automatic. If the service is acceptable, I'll happily leave the standard 15% and if it's exceptional, I've left up to 25% before. This service was not acceptable. But after reviewing the bill, a 15% gratuity was already calculated in the bill. No wonder the waiters didn't care! They knew they would be getting they tip regardless!! \n\nI will also add that the guest of honour's wife was a bit annoyed that they did not even serve us bread, as they were supposed to. \n\nThe last nail in the coffin for this place was when it took forever to be able to pay the bill, because there was one machine for the entire lower level of the restaurant, and two rooms to serve. And wouldn't you know it... They didn't get reception in our room so we had to line up in the other room to pay. \n\nI will not be returning here. I could have let a lot go, had the waiters been pleasant and helpful and apologetic. They didn't care at all. And with a bill of nearly $50, without any drinks, since it's BYOB, and a meal that is not making me shout from the rooftops about, this place is a no-go in my opinion."

S"I've been here a few times and I enjoy the cheesesteak with onions and both sweet and hot peppers quite a bit. It's better than other sandwich shops downtown. Aside from having a sandwich that I like, this place really needs to get things together.\n\nIt's never easy to park. I always have to drive around the block in circles trying to find a street spot to park.\n\nOn one visit I got to counter in the evening as the only customer and watched two employees sitting in the back on their cell phones for over a minute before being greeted and served.\n\nI stopped in at 9:30 on Friday night, a half hour before close, and as I walked in I was told that they had no sandwich bread. I suppose it's worth it to Capriotti's corporate to pay their employees and the utility company to keep the lights on just to turn away paying customers. The more likely scenario is that they don't pay a manager to maintain the business properly.\n\nAny business that runs out of the single ingredient required for their signature menu items and doesn't give customers a voucher at the door to come back for a discounted or free sandwich on the next visit needs to re-evaluate why they are even in business to begin with."

S"On 2/2/10, My party of three came to Champion Gourmet for the hot-pot.  We found it disappointing.\n\nThe atmosphere sucked.  The place was cluttered and run-down, with a television blaring Chinese language soap operas at full volume for the entire meal.  We had to get our own water from a water cooler with dinky Styrofoam cups.  We experienced a severe language barrier with the wait staff, which in of itself is not a deal-breaker, but in conjunction with everything else, made the bitter icing on an already crappy cake. \n\nOur hot pot took a long time to come to the table.  We ordered the spicy broth, with lamb as our main protein.  A plate of enoki mushrooms, squash, corn on the cob, cabbage, zucchini, tofu, and noodles was included with the lamb, gratis.  We also ordered some shrimp dumplings, clams, and squid balls.  The lamb was great - no complaints there.  The veggies were fine, too, and the squash was surprisingly delicious.  \n\nHowever, the shrimp dumplings were truly disgusting.  They tasted - and smelled - like low tide.  Oh my word, were they fishy and briny!  They stank up all our soup!  They tasted so amazingly bad, I couldn't determine if that was their intended flavor, or if they'd simply gone rancid.  And the clams were no better.  I couldn't believe how rank they were.  The squid balls kept me from losing all faith in this place's seafood.  They were chewy and mild, with a slightly sweet flavor.\n\nEven though the wait staff was sitting in the same room as our party, they were too busy watching the TV to attend to us whatsoever.  I had to walk up to one of them and physically tap her on the shoulder to get her to take our second order (more lamb, and more noodles).\n\nI was afraid that we might get food poisoning from the seafood, but my friends and I seemed fine all evening.  \n\nI've had better hot-pot at a Chinese buffet in Saint Louis, Missouri.  I won't be back."

The place was clean and they keep things were well stocked. \n\nI like the salad bar. The main thing for a good salad bar is having lots of fresh ingredients. Keeping it fresh requires lots of traffic, and this place has that. Salads are easy to make, but having a dozen or more fresh ingredients at home would take a lot of effort.\n\nLike most buffets of this type it's crowded and noisy at peak times, and the food is tasty, but without much spice. If you want stately silence and dedicated personal service, you should be somewhere else.\n\nGolden Corral is a good deal, and this outlet is well run.

I had just received an advertisement via email from Domino's, so we decided to just go with that.\n\nThe orders of cheesy bread and specialty chicken were not worth $6 each. They were small for the price, and Domino's never fails to include a hunk of fat in the chicken I order. Everything was super salty. Nothing was outstanding.\n\nHowever...online ordering was nice and easy. The food was ready on time for carryout. The pizza was sliced cleanly, so it was easy to lift one slice of pizza out of the box at a time. I ordered my kids a pizza with double pepperoni. The extra amount of pepperoni was obvious and made me happy that we weren't slighted. My kids loved their pizza and gobbled the whole thing up.\n\nI would not go out of my way to get Domino's again, but it would suffice as a last resort."

The menu sounded promising: the results a little more than disappointing. The cod starter was fine, the venison main was basically a stew that had hardly any venison in it, and tasted like it had been made with Bisto. It would have worked out at about \xc2\xa318 for the main and \xc2\xa36 for the starter -\xc2\xa0which was completely over priced, both for the quantity and quality of food.\n\nThe staff were patchy -- some were lovely, others seem harrassed and annoyed any time you stopped them to ask for anything.\n\nThe table was also too wide to allow natural conversation to flow across the table. I had lovely company for the evening, but it did mean only talking to the two people on either side of you for the duration of the night, rather than mingle a bit more. Narrow table would have been good to allow cross-table conversation too. A few smiles and waves were given!\n\nIt was a nice venue, good view of the castle, but the food wasn't just forgettable - it was disappointing and felt like a waste of my money. I wouldn't book it myself for a private event."

S"My first experience of Holi Spice was an odd one - I had made an order for take-away and when I went to collect it their card machine wasn't working..so they gave it to me for free! With free popadoms. I felt quite bad though, and after eating the meal (which was delicious) I went back with cash.\n\nThe food is delicious. Really yummy and full of flavour, everything is made fresh to order. My favourite is the chicken korma, which is as good as any i've ever had.\n\nAs the Indian is also a restaurant, however, I always feel really uncomfortable walking in. I've only ever seen one table eating when I've been in, all the other times it has been empty. As a result, the staff are extremely attentive and were pouring over themselves to serve me, giving me freebies left, right and centre. I always choose to collect the food myself as I only live 5 minutes away and I like to think I'm burning the calories I;m about to consume (!), but they also have free delivery.\n\nI really hope Holi Spice survives, it's a really good Indian and the staff are lovely."

Now, should you happen into this place, take my advice. Request specifically to avoid Robert"s section. Giving the benefit of the doubt, let\'s just say he was "swamped". It still took forever to get the mimosas we ordered. They arrived only after he saw me approach the bar myself. Then, when he placed down the mimosas on our table, he tried with his sweetest voice to explain that he had them made extra large to apologize for our wait. Eh hem...same size as ones on table next to us. The coux de gras is he added an 18% gratuity on our check for 2 of us. Of course, the manager was more than apologetic on his behalf. So, we decided to eat here again...NOT in Robert\'s section. Omelet again was superb. WaitRESS was great. Manager still nice and again apologetic. Robert approached and blamed the whole thing on a "computer error" and personally apologized. Again, I can recommend this place.  Just be selective in your wait staff.  To be clear, this is regarding the South Beach Cafe restaurant at the Trop, not the deli.'

Then you get to choose how many options you want ... So you make your picks .... And then ... The worst ... THEY MICROWAVE IT .... Wtf ??? It\'s all cold ... Being there since good knows when .... And you know how does microwaved  food tastes ... So basically you are paying 13 cad for a dish  of microwaved "Thai " food ...do yourself a favor, buy frozen food and go home , you won\'t see nothing exceptional here \n\nOh and btw .. First time they microwaved it .. It was only hot on the top .. So imagine general tao Chiken cold ... I asked to put it again on the microwave ...Oh my god !!!

Their lunch specials are anywhere from $5-$7. They include soup, egg roll, wonton and whichever entree you pick with fried rice. Definitely worth it. The dinner specials are about $2-$3 more than the lunch specials but they also come with some extras. No matter what you get, you will usually get more than what you pay for, especially if you stick with the lunch and dinner specials. The service is very consistent between the 3 restaurants I visit.'

S"Alright, I don't usually do reviews for these types of fast food restaurants because they usually speak for themselves.  Medium quality food with somewhat expensive prices. So this might be the only one I'll do.\n\nAnyways, I used to dislike Wendy's growing up.  Was probably one of my least favorite fast food places.  Probably 2 years ago I retried this location (before the remodeling) and I was impressed.  They seemed to overhaul the quality of the food so that it was actually enjoyable.  So I went here probably 4 more times before they changed the building around.\n\nSo now they decide to fancy up the building just like all the McDonalds all around town.  I walk in and the place looks great for a fast food restaurant.  Open, spacious, really clean and the staff were nicer than usual, and yes, they kept the Coca-Cola freestyle machine (every restaurant should have these things!).\n\nThe food (yes a little pricey, it is a fast food restaurant) was as great as I remember, or hell, maybe even a little better.  Wendy's is probably my favorite fast food chain now because places like Burger King and Arby's seem to want to go downhill. This location is the best one I've been too and it's gotten better.

S'So, a new restaurant just opened up in our neighborhood. It got a bit of hype, with the name Mark Greenaway attached to it, which made us all the more interested to check it out. It\'s a bit like Christmas when a promising new local eatery opens up; as much as we love good restaurants, we love good restaurants within a 10-minute walk of our flat exponentially more.  \n\nThe bistro itself is attractively done. High ceilings, plenty of room between tables, sleek but with a personality that works in the space. Service was generally OK but there was a bit of awkwardness to it. Plenty of staff were standing about and sometimes they didn\'t seem sure about what they were there to do. One of the waiters had a wee b.o. problem going on (it\'s never pleasant to catch a whiff of someone walking by your table). \n\nDrinks: The wines by the glass struck me as about average for restaurants around here, in both price and quality. There were some good beers, only by the bottle. The cocktail menu was short but had some interesting items on it (must give one a try when I go back). \n\nFood: The pumpkin soup with chestnuts was tasty but not quite warm. The tempura cod (ordered off the bar bites menu) was light and flavorful - probably my favorite dish of the evening. The sides of wilted greens with almonds and green beans with feta were both very well done (oh how I love a well-prepared veggie!). For dessert we split a bread and butter pudding which was not bad but also not as good as I had hoped (granted I had hoped for a lot). \n\nAt the end of the day, this review is a 3-star instead of a 4-star because the price/quality ratio just didn\'t hold up. In this price range I expect something a little special, something above and beyond your friendly neighborhood gastropub. It just wasn\'t there. Yet. Maybe next time. After all, they\'ve only been open two days. (There\'s a school of thought that says you should go easy on a restaurant that just opened. Nonsense. If I\'m expected to deliver my full end of the bargain as a paying customer, then I expect you to deliver a fully-formed dining experience. If you\'re not ready for prime time, offer discounted preview nights while you work out the kinks.)\n\nMy brain has a hard time resisting the urge to compare Bistro Moderne with Scran & Scallie. For the second time this year, a celebrity chef (and by this I mean "I know the names of exactly two chefs in the Edinburgh area, Tom Kitchin and Mark Greenaway, so clearly they must both count as celebrities") has opened a down-market concept restaurant in our little neighborhood. Both restaurants are in the same price range, and despite their differing basic forms (pub vs. bistro), their subtle dabs of burlap and tartan make them feel stylistically connected. There are some menu similarities as well. The hake is my go-to dish at S&S; BM\'s hake, while good, just didn\'t quite measure up. S&S\'s sides are probably as good as BM\'s and come in larger portion sizes for the same price. Every dessert I\'ve tried at S&S has made me stand up and take notice; BM\'s bread and butter pudding left my mouth only mildly amused. \n\nI do realize this comparison is unfair - S&S has had at least a dozen chances to dazzle me, whereas my entire impression of BM is based on one visit. We\'ll see what happens to my impressions over time. I hope for the day when I can write a new review of Bistro Moderne where a comparison with Scran & Scallie doesn\'t even come to mind, when Bistro Moderne comes into its own. I\'m a culinary optimist.'

The pork/veggie salad rolls were good, I was kind of surprised to see that some scrambled egg was included in it and found it a nice addition.  Instead of the usual peanut sauce, it came with a sweet and tangy sauce that I think had some fish sauce in it and was quite good.  My pho soup was the beef steak and meatball version and although I didn't order it, it included some tripe as well.  I don't eat tripe but that's okay, just picked it out.  Overall the soup was very tasty with a generous portion of noodles and meet.  I never would have noticed this place but my cousin lives right near State St. and has been here before, the atmosphere leaves a little to be desired but the food is great and very well priced.

I have been coming to RWB for a few years now but the last couple of times I have dined here I have noticed their service has really started to slip.  Their menu has changed slightly over the last couple of years and they took the crab cakes off the menu and they were my favorite thing to order.  However, their menu does offer something for everyone and the quality of their food is very good.  However, their service has gotten so slow and inattentive.  I think they have possibly had a turnover in their staff.  I would really hate to see this restaurant close due to their service issues.  They need to take time to have new servers shadow veteran servers before starting alone on the floor.  I would recommend giving RWB a try because you will get a tasty meal.

S'Im giving the 2 stars only because of the food. I do feel a bit sorry for the owner tonight though since it was only her in the restaurant taking care of customers. Service was bad, we didnt get water til almost 10 min after we sit down. I think only one person was doing the cooking so everybody had to wait for their order. Appetizer didn\'t come until after the main entree was served (happened the last time we went there too, PLS appetizer should go first). I went to the counter to pay and the owner suggested "the tips is normally 15%" and even done the math for me, trust me when I say I didn\'t ask for that (maybe she thought I looked hesitant?), and I think that\'s just rude.  She punched in the numbers on an adding machine and just stapled that to the ordering form. Oh one more thing, the "15% tip" she suggested was based on the total AFTER TAX, not the subtotal (which is what\'s supposed to be), the difference was just $1 and I paid what she suggested, because I didnt feel like arguing with her in front of all the people. It\'s a very bad move for your business, very cheap move. \n\nThe food is good, I don\'t deny that. Just the service needs BIG improvement.

S"Being that my husband is from Turkey and I have had lots of homemade Turkish food over the years Ibo's had a great appeal to me. The restaurant is divided into two parts - a bar on one side and a restaurant on the other. The divider is the restroom area. It really is like East meets West in there. The bar side during lunch has low lighting, rock and roll music playing, and the seats are around a dance floor area. On the restaurant side the seating is formal with a baby grand in the corner and Turkish music playing. There was outdoor patio seating as well. The whole design of the place is a little strange to me. \n\nThe bartender/waiter seated me in the bar area. He was very nice. I did not even realize there were two sides to this place initially. There were a few lunch options that were both priced just under $10. You could add dessert and a glass of wine for another $2+. I went with the shepherd salad, hummus, and chicken kabob. I had the choice between two salads, three appetizers and two main dishes. I would have liked to see a few more lunch options on the main dishes. The regular menu was expensive however I know the amount of time it takes to prepare Turkish dishes so that is to be expected. \n\nThe Sheppard salad was yummy. It had a nice blend of fresh tomato, cucumber and bell peppers. The lemon juice, olive oil and fresh parsley and just the right amount of salt was perfect. I was served a small basket of bread though was disappointed to see that it was a foccacia bread rather than a traditional pita. A plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar were on the side. The olive oil was pretty bland. \n\nThe hummus was spicy, rich tasting, and very yummy. Hummus can be a tough thing to get just right so I give them an A+ on this appetizer. \n\nThe main course was a type of chicken kebab made from ground chicken and pepper paste (a middle Eastern ingredient). My husband typically prepares this dish with ground beef and I prefer it that way. I didn't care for the chicken much. On the plus side, this dish also came with two small beef patties. They were grilled and tasted very good. A large portion of vegetables was on the plate. The veggies appeared to be fresh and were appealing to the eye however not to the palette. For some reason they tasted fishy. I couldn't figure that one out. There was a small serving of rice pilaf. The rice pilaf was very oily. \n\nThe portions are incredibly generous. I noted that everyone there asked for to-go boxes. The service was pretty good. I may go to this place one more time to try some different items. \n\nThere is a small cupcake place in the same strip mall area that is wonderful! Stop by there for dessert!"

S'Just like Christmas, you never know what you are going to get! I use to frequent this establishment at least once a week when they first opened. The service and the food went to hell so fast that I stayed away for about 5 months. Recently I tried going back and this finally capped my disgust with this place. The consistency (referring to preparation) of the sushi is much like the service, NONEXISTENT. I try to complain , but I think that it falls on deaf ears because nothing changes.  I was there about two weeks ago, end of June 09, and walked out because I could not get service while sitting at the bar. There was one person behind the bar while there was two managers and several wait staff standing by the hostess station, no one said one word when I left. I had family members in town that wanted to go there for dinner, reluctantly I took them. The food, once again came out prepared differently that it had been in the past and I always get the same excuse, "Well we do go through a lot of Chefs here." I had to get up and get the drinks off of the bar because our waitress disappeared. This place is a joke! I have no idea how they stay in business. The teppanayki tables are so loud that it really takes away from everything else. The people that work there really just seem to give a "crap less" whether or not you get service.  Save your money and go somewhere else.'

I can vouch for this Moe\'s as always clean with friendly people...greeting each customer with a loud, "Welcome to Moe\'s" when I enter. The food is also fresh...often made that day. You have a good variety of what I call a Tex-Mex foods...taco salads, burritos that are too large for me to eat in one sitting, and you can have it \'made to order\' your way. You get chips with your meal and their salsa are good, no matter which one you choose. Monday they have some kind of \'special\' and are packed so I usually don\'t go then as I am only feeding myself.

S"This place recently opened in January, I believe it was. It's where Huahachinango use to be. I live nearby and got a flyer promoting their restaurant and decided to try it out today. I went with a friend of mine for lunch and the place was empty. Now I'm chalking that up to the fact that we went for a late lunch; it was around 1 or so. \n\nI had a carne asada plate. The carne asade come on top of a macaroni salad and fries. The meat itself is topped with mustard, onions and a meat sauce, which I opted to have on the side. I'm glad I did, as I found the sauce a bit bland. I wanted a kick or something, but I didn't get it without adding any of their toppings or anything. The macaroni salad was all right. Rather than using an elbow pasta, they used conchiglie and the mayo wasn't that sweet mayo I abhor. The fries weren't bad either. They weren't the usual shoestring cut and they weren't overly salty or oily. The carne asada itself was all right. It got a little too salty for me at one point. It was moist enough without the sauce. I was expecting more since the pictures on the wall make it seem like they'd have more to their dishes. My friend had a devil blanco plate and had the grilled chicken. It came with the same thing mine came with. She unfortunately got everything on it and it kinda dampened the enjoyment of the dish. I'm willing to give this place another try to see if something else there will be better. \n\nA bit about the place: it says on the window that they're open on Friday and Saturday till 3am, but I'm not sure about that since as I've said, I live nearby and I haven't noticed them open. They're having a special, or at least did today when I went in - the plates were like 5.95 and it came with a drink. And according to the flyer we get, they're offering a two for one thing - buy a plate and you get one free. I don't know if that's still going on, but that's what the flyer we got said.\n\n***Edit to add a tip: add hot sauce to the food cause it makes the difference. A huge difference. It doesn't really change my rating, except to maybe a 2 1/2 stars. Still gonna try something else, so till then the rating is staying."

S'I have lived in this area forever and can recall when this little place opened.  It was exciting to have a restaurant in the area.  After all these years I can say I still feel that same enthusiasm.\n\nPros:  The food overall is tasty and the menu is much better from what it had been in the past in my opinion.  Prices are rather reasonable even off happy hour.  Service has always been good.  This is an area that can be tricky since it seems the bartender is also in charge of waiting on the tables in the restaurant.\n\nCons:  The only real con is that this is clearly a bar that has tables for customers who may want to eat,  Originally there was a separation between the bar and the restaurant.  I do not necessarily mind this, but I could see some turned off by it.  \n\nI definitely plan on hitting up this spot more often. especially when the NFL comes back.'

I had my daughter in my arms she\'s only 14 months, and the wind was crazy, I grabbed my phone and I called them, yes I am still standing in front of the door, the employees are staring at me as well as the owner and I tell them " hey I called earlier and I was told if I came before 9 you\'ll still serve me, I even already told the lady what we wanted" she said oh no we\'re already closed.

S'After my fiasco at the Denny\'s down the street (112th Avenue & Grand), we drove here. This Denny\'s was alright. The staff were friendly; the food was good; and the price is what you\'d expect. Again, this place was dusty on the inside. Moreover, my wife sat in a booth where there was a piece of cushion missing. The "stuff" inside there was disgusting. All in all, you get what you pay for. It\'s a lot better than the Denny\'s down the road (which I would avoid like the plague), but that really isn\'t saying much.'

S"McDonald's is getting a bad rap here, I can see.  Yeah, it's not the best one out there, but it's not the worst.   Ive only been here for breakfast, so that's what im basing my review on.  I use the drive-thru.. maybe that works too.  \n\nI get my usual vanilla iced coffee and oat meal in the mornings and have never been disappointed.  The girl at the pay window always seems friendly and has is smiling all the time.  The girl who gives me my food is the same way.  Only time I've had problems was this morning when the manager of all people, didnt give me my spoon!! serious!!!..  just kidding.  \n\nIt's McDonalds.. not a 5 star restaurant..  :)"

S'Shockingly unedible...was fried in some kind of old bacon grease tasting stuff...the clams were like old rubber bands and  beyond anything you would expect from a place that is supposed to be about seafood.  The popcorn shrimp was terrible, dry and shriveled with veins in it.  The coating was absolutely awful.  \n\nThe funny thing is we walked in and a woman was sitting there eating - just one person was there - and I asked her, "Is this place any good?" She stared at me with wide eyes and didn\'t say anything and now I know why.  If the high strung owner were to hear her she might have been bulldozed over by him.  He is wired so tight it\'s like he\'ll explode any moment if you ask a question or want to return the lukewarm, pasty, overly thick clam chowder that was just well...shockingly unedible.\n\nP.S.  As the woman was walking out she leaned over and whispered, "It wasn\'t very good."'

S"Loud, one has to SCREAM to converse, I can't understand the need for loud,pounding music. Perhaps it's because there's a very busy bar on the premises, that's why. There was a group of us that evening, and it was decided there'd be a bottle of wine for the 5 who wanted wine wirh their pizza. I ordered a vegetarian as did several others, meanwhile we were served complimentary tomato pat\xc3\xa9 & bread, which was gobbled down quickly by all; we were famished and it was getting late. My veggie pizza was good, piping hot, thin crust. Others who ordered the same liked theirs,as well as those who had whatever variety they'd ordered. Pizzas are only $10.00 per, for ANY variety from 10PM btw, overall my pizza & 1 glass of wine w/tip was $25.00, a bit  too steep, but next time I'll just forego the wine tyvm. Service was good and attentive, ambiance LOUD. If you want to watch your spending, wait till 10 PM and forget the wine."

S"I feel torn with this review and feel like I need a few star selections. \n\nFood-a solid 3 Stars-It was Good and hot and hit the spot. They bring you out a basket of chips and then a really tasty salsa and a spicy bean dip. Both were really good. We ran out of chips and our server never brought us or asked us if we wanted more :( I could have eaten those chips and salsa all night. I got the taco combo, it was decent. I really wanted a tamale, but all they had were chicken and I am a straight up cheese and green chili tamale girl, so that was a bummer. Hubs got the Fajitas, they came out sizzling and he ate it all, however the flour tortillas they supplied were really thin and stale, not fresh at all. \n\nAtmosphere 4 stars-So we pull in and think, woah this place is hoping and weren't sure how long we would ahve to wait to be seated as all the parking spots out front and down one whole side are filled up. As it turned out, people were parking there and going over to black angus next door. We walked in and it was a ghost town. there was only 1 other table seated. This was a Monday night at about 6:30-7ish. We were seated and our server was there right away. Its really pretty chill in there. It looks like an old Spanish home, lots of cool decor. The bar area was HUGE and if you are a sports fan they had a game projected on a huge wall. \n\nService 2 stars-Right off the bat I loved our server. He gave us a 2 thumbs up every time he came to our table or asked us a question. To funny. He was on top of everything up until we got our food, then we never saw him again. We finished eating and sat, and sat and sat. About 10 minutes goes by since we quit eating and the manager happens by, we flag him down and say we are ready for our bill, he takes our plates and poof gone. We sit, and sit and sit. 5 minutes later I look back and the manager is sitting at a table with some people, not sure if they worked there or were customers, just laughing it up, not cool. We STILL hadn't received our bill. WTF. Another 5 minutes goes by, at this point I am ready to get up and walk out. If they cant be bothered to bring me my bill to pay, then I'm out. Finally our server appears WITH OUT THE BILL!!!! I hand him my card and tell him we are ready to go. Oi. By this time there were 3 tables seated, so its not like they were slammed and there were at least 7 people working that I counted, they should have been all over us like flies on poop. \n\nSo anyway, had we not had to wait soooo long for our bill and maybe saw our waiter at least once during our meal to see if we needed anything else, then this would have been a better experience. \n\nI will give them another shot for sure, the chips and salsa really were the bomb and I like saying papa Chulo"

Amongst all the tire shops and barber shops that smatter that stretch of The Plaza and next to the Food Lion is the very unassuming China Bowl.\n\nDo not be intimidated by the neighborhood, the bright orange exterior, or the bars on the front windows, the China Bowl is a gem!\n\nThis is AMAZING Chinese takeout!  Opening for and offering lunch specials, the Bowl is open until 9pm weeknights and 9.30pm Friday and Saturday (closed Sunday).\n\nWith standard Chinese takeout fare, I was lured in for beef and broccoli and was pleasantly surprised with their wings.  Great flavor for fried chicken wings.  They also do Buffalo, Sesame and BBQ wings which I will be sure to try as well as their boneless spare ribs.\n\nCall ahead as there really isn't any seating and it may take a few minutes for your grub to be ready."

Just a word of advice you need to make sure every customer leaves with something if you expect this place to remain open.

Anybody knows business 101 the customer is always right.

GRILLED slices of white meat chicken on top of some rice w/a bland, gross 'teriyaki' sauce on top.  The meat had no flavor, the teriyaki tasted like nothing at all.. it was a bowl of different textured tasteless solids for $8.  Resembling Flame Broiler but nowhere near the taste of it.  \n\nThe decor in the restaurant was really nice and attractive, I give them an extra star for that.. but to be honest, if they had that much money to burn on decor, they could've used it to provide better quality food.."

S'Did you know that the Maison Des Cyclistes is not only a bicycle shop but a cafe too?! I bet you didn\'t! Well, it is! And I ate there, right next to all those shining bicycle racks!\n\nAnd I had one of the most delicious sandwiches my tongue has ever wrapped itself around, ever.\n\nAs I was busy getting lost in random parts of Montreal, I followed funky looking rollerbladers down their designated lanes and at the corner of the street, a beautiful marigold building caught my eye. It was like a flower grown from concrete. I was drawn to its red and green store canvas tarp and the large painting of a cyclist above the entrance beckoned me. I walked in and noticed the traditional glass cases where cafes/delis usually keep their sample sandwiches and other goodies. I took a good look at a grilled sandwich with salami, cheese and other vegetables. I remembered my friend Tyler (Montreal connoisseur) told me that cheese in Montreal is especially delicious because the pasteurizing laws were different in Canada compared to the US, so "cheese tastes better." Provolone is one of my favorite cheeses and I noticed that that sandwich that looked at me with big eyes had a big slice of it right on top. I ordered it and stood gazing around for a few minutes. The interior of the cafe was beautiful, a nice set up of tables big and small, many windows for the sunlight to come in and super computer / reader friendly. I could imagine myself bringing a book here and reading with a cup of tea. What I loved especially was their outdoor seating. It lined the building on the less-busy part of the street so you wouldn\'t get winded by those crazy funky skaters or cyclists. I took my sandwich outside and sat beside a few mothers with their babies in the strollers. I took the first bite. Warm. Juicy, Flavors felt like they were literally caressing my tongue with all their goodness. Sweets and sours and crispiness cascaded down upon my mouth and all I could do was smile at the baby sitting next to me. The best part about it was that I was perfectly content after that one sandwich--and it wasn\'t too overbearing. I told the lady at the counter afterward (who couldn\'t understand English very well) that the sandwich I had was so delicious. She just smiled at me. Oh well!\n\nI would say this cafe could be the Au Bon Pain or Panera of Montreal, but more delicious and harder to find. That makes it better, right?'

S"Porto Finos is just ok. The food is decent-if you're looking for your basic local pizza shop you won't be disappointed with the pie. Other menu offerings are good as well. I've not been to the shop, but gotten delivery. This is where the trouble comes in. \n\nThey seem to not have enough people working ever. The last couple of times I've called they have taken WAY too long to answer the phone, then they set the phone down and walk away for a few minutes after hastily asking you to hold, and then when they finally talk to you, they let you know that delivery will take over an hour. Hire a couple more employees for the evenings! \n\nAlso, when paying with credit card they require the security code off of the back of the card. Not all places require this and it makes me a bit nervous. This is how people can hack accounts and I just don't like providing it over the phone. The guy who answers the phone will also repeat my credit card information back to me over the phone-in the middle of a crowded pizza shop! Also makes me nervous...and I'm not even a paranoid person. I just think that some things make common sense. Repeating a credit card number in a crowd does NOT make sense. \n\nOverall, they have good food. They could use an improvement in customer service though. Step it up, guys!"

I love their roast beef sandwiches smothered in Arby Sauce and Horsey Sauce.  I definitely miss the days of 5 for $5 sandwiches.  The sandwiches have definitely gotten smaller than back in the days, but still taste the same.  Their potato cakes are so crunchy and perfectly cooked.  I\'d choose those over the curly fries.

S"I have a dilemma- what to do about a place that the locals seem to love but left me underwhelmed?!! \n\nWhen I read the reviews about Hogs Heaven, I had to give it a try when I was in the neighborhood the other night. My experience left me with the sense that if this is indeed the best place in town, the town needs more rib joints. Apologies to those who love this place, but I'm sorry, this is mediocre bbq. \n\nWhere does one barbeque in a strip mall? I am sure the property manager frowns upon large, smoke-belching bbq grills and piles of hardwood fuel logs behind the building. So that leaves par cooking in a pressure cooker (I will admit that it does make it fall-off-the-bone tender) and finishing on an indoor gas grill. When you have good barbeque, everyone knows because that smokey scent is everywhere, not just on the food. \n\nApart from the sauce (which is pretty good, btw) the ribs were tasteless. The pulled pork sandwich was a little better, but again more flavor from the sauce than the meat itself. For sides, we had mac & cheese, potato salad and skillet beans. I liked the sides more than the meats. The mac & cheese had a little bit of chili pepper or spicy seasoning, as did the beans. Both had good flavor. For dessert, we had the peach cobbler. It had a hidden ingredient or two- maybe a hint of apple and/or banana to add flavor. While it tasted good, the portion was tiny for a cobbler and as a result, a bit pricey.\n\nTo sum it up, Hogs Heaven may be good for the area, but it falls short of good barbeque."

S'I didn\'t believe the 5 star rating (based on 7 reviews) that Royal Coffee had on Yelp, but I was hoping it to be true and thus I started my venture to Royal during my lunch break while I was at ASU main. I passed two other coffee joints to get here and it was worth it!\n\nThe two staff members welcomed me with a friendly "hello" and smile while I took a quick glimpse at my surroundings. This is an intimate shop (a polite way to say small), but the d\xc3\xa9cor is modern hipster and the open patio is enticing especially now that the Fall weather is cooling down. Standing at the order counter, which is covered in individual health bars, loose tea containers, and two pastry stands, I asked the first of a bazillion questions (okay it was only three, I asked three questions). I wanted to know what kind of milk they offered, the drink sizes they offer, and the amount of shots in each latte size.  As you might have read in my tip, I am so giddy that they offer almond milk. I love almond milk, it makes everything taste better. In addition to that, they have the standard, whole and non fat cow\'s milk and soy milk. The drink sizes are in English, so you choose from a small, medium, or large and since I wanted a latte, the shots for each size are 1, 2, and 3 for a large.\n\nMy drink of choice today was a medium iced carmel latte with almond milk ($4.22 with tax). Now, I am both happy and sad I ordered this as my first drink from here. I\'m happy because I haven\'t had a flavored latte in forever and their carmel sauce (yes I say carmel, not caramel) is a honey, buttery goodness that is worth the extra 40 cent surcharge. I\'m sad because since I got a flavor, I can\'t really taste the espresso, but reading the prior reviews, it\'s apparently the bees knees, but to be clear, the flavor isn\'t overwhelming powerful that you lose the coffee taste. Either way, my drink was delicious and I will be back to try it again.\n\nSo as I said, their order counter is lined with various goodies and the pastry stands were screaming my name so loud it was annoying and even though I told them they were being rude and to stop, they gave me an ultimatum. I had to buy one or endure the screaming my entire time there. So since I was left with no choice, I tried their banana fritter/donut hole ($1.25) . Oh-em-to-the-gee, it was mouthwatering. The outer glaze melts in your mouth and then the banana hits your taste buds, ugh so good. You must try them!  All their pastries are made Nami -meaning they are all vegan, but don\'t let that fool you into thinking they won\'t have any flavor!\n\nI understand why this coffee joint has 5 stars. Great Drinks, Great Food, Amazing Service! And just to add to their awesomeness, they have a frequent flyer punch card (its electronic, you use your email) and every 10th drink you get $3 off!'

However any of the fruit smoothies (Hawaiian Dreamsickle) are also very tasty.  The atmoshpere is clean, inviting, and 'chill'.  So when you are at the SanTan Mall don't forget they are tucked in there, it is well worth the stop!"

S'If I could give this store no stars I would and its not because of the food or the employees its because of the franchisee and or the Manager.  This store is not located in the best part of town and I understand that but the people they allow to congregate on the outside patio and in the store sometimes is disgusting.  I work up the street and stop here one or twice a week.  Every time I\'m accosted by homeless people looking for handouts, I\'ve seen prostitutes and last night there were actual drug deals going down on the patio.  Its like this every time.  The employees tend to ignore it although I noticed their quick glances to each other almost acting like they have been warned not to get involved.  \n\nLast night the "Supervisor" I spoke to didn\'t know the Franchisee\'s name or the Managers.  He quickly dismissed me by saying he had to go wait on someone in the drive thru.  Again his canned response felt like he was saying something he was told to say.  I don\'t understand why these people are allowed to sit and stay when all they are doing is running off paying customers.  I also observed three different people with non Jack In the Box cups just walk in and get soda.  \n\nEither this location needs to hire some night time security to start running non paying customers off the property or just take out the tables and benches in the front and concentrate on your drive thru and eat in business.  Take the pressure off your employees who shouldn\'t be concerned with their own safety and the safety of their paying customers.  \n\nI for one will go a little further down the street from now on to the Wendys.  At least I\'ve seen the night Manager there take care of biz and deals with all his customers in an appropriate way.'

S"First thing's first...why aren't more lighthouses open for wandering-around-banter purposes? Rather than concentrating on the conversation of the person I was dining with at Loch Fyne I spent the entire Sunday lunch peering out of the window and wondering what it would be like to be a lighthouse keeper. It's all the restaurant's fault for having a cool ass location looking out to the sea in Newhaven.\n\nI am really, truly rubbish at making the effort to come down this way, which is pretty shameful. Edinburgh is small...there is no excuse for just staying in the city centre and never leaving. It's worth embarking on the short journey to Loch Fyne because it really is nice to be eating your seafood with a side of actual harbour in front of your eyes. Loch Fyne itself is housed within pretty awesome premises. It used to be the old fish market so has a definite maritime atmosphere to it, and it was a really chilled place to enjoy Sunday lunch, particularly with the sun shining into the bright and airy space.\n\nWe shared two starters - mussels, always a winner if the cream and white wine sauce is on point, which it was, and crab ravioli with lemon butter sauce and rocket salad. The ravioli filling was tasty, but if there's anything I'm fussy about it's pasta, and I personally felt it needed a couple of pinches more salt...but then I do like my pasta well-salted, other people might not be so concerned with that. The main was awesome, primarily because a) it was delicious and b) it was lobster. Lobster, if it's fresh and cooked just to perfection with the simple addition of garlic butter is just immense, and always worth the extra spend if you're out for a nice lunch anyway. We also sampled the scallops and black pudding main, and although I'm never really the first to opt for black pudding, I did enjoy this classic combination, with the scallops, like the lobster, being cooked splendidly.\n\nAll in all, a really lovely lunch. Our waiter was a cool dude too. I skipped off to peruse the lighthouse afterwards, and all was well."

As far as appearance goes, this place is a hole in the wall (literally in between a dry cleaner and a weave store in the strip mall with bars over the windows) that hasn't been updated in ages and is a little on the dimly-lit side, but I look right past that. Owned by an old Greek couple, this place really falls into the mom & pop category- you can get a salad, burgers, gyro, BLT, seafood, bologna sandwich, even pork chops and country fried steak. They also have breakfast- pancakes, omelettes, country ham, corned beef hash, etc until 11:00 (I think). The food is great, and the prices are even better- lunch is usually under $5. I recommend the pita burger, cheeseburger (juicy fried patties with a soft bun that sops up the perfect amount of grease), or Nicky's Salad (which is HUGE for $5.75)."

So we hop in the car and head to Lang Van only to be told, "no sandwiches" ahhh snap.  Dang.  So we have a beer and an app. and haul ass to the next destination which happened to be Thanh Huong Cafe.  We walk into a small space with maybe 3 tables, guys were sitting around smoking under the NO SMOKING sign and playing the Vietnamese equivalent of chess. \n\nWe walk up to the tiny counter and order 2 grilled pork sandwiches, the lady acted like we had three heads for being there.  She nonchalantly ate sunflower seeds as she helped us.  It was flippin\' hilarious.  We asked for two empty cups to share a coke and she handed me a styrofoam cup with coffee grounds in it.  We ordered our food and she acted like she tallied it up in her head, she circled the number 15 on her scratch paper and told us $15 for what should have been $12 or $13, but no biggie, because she was so funny to me.\n\nWe got our food and sat down in the cloud of smoke, it was good, fresh ingredients, the Vietnamese ice coffee was delish.

There is some shaded parking in the big lot, and several handicapped parking spaces right next to the sidewalk leading to the door, which faces north. \n\nI really liked it here. Clean, friendly servers, lots of varied choices, and nice fresh food. IMO they need more dessert choices, but really there's so much food that I couldn't even get to one of the islands (salad) because I was too stuffed after 2 passes at the other islands. \n\nI think there are 5 maybe 6 islands, all full of delicious-looking food. There should be something for everyone here, including kids. Nothing looked too exotic or icky. The condiments were good. The salad bar looked varied and quite adequate (couldn't get to it; too stuffed).\n\nThe only down side was that I just read a review below indicating there is a senior discount. I am a senior and so was my companion, but we paid full price ($10 for lunch). I will definitely be asking for the senior discount when we go back. I live fairly close to it so will probably go once or twice a month. Since the other Chinese buffets within 10 miles didn't get nearly as high a rating I'm glad it's close.\n\nOne a side note: \nThe restaurant was playing authentic Chinese music when we walked in, but it switched very soon to American muzak. I would have preferred to keep hearing the Chinese music. I appreciate when an ethnic restaurant plays the music of its own country. A nicer, more authentic touch.\n\nOne final note: \nOne reviewer here said this restaurant doesn't have clams. I saw some yesterday, had a couple, they were small and delicious."

It took a waitress 10 minutes to even come to our table. When she finally did, she greeted us with "do you know what you want to eat?", which I felt was very rude without even greeting us first. With just 3 people we then waited for 50 minutes without getting our food. The waitress infomed us that she was "doing the best she could because there was a party in the banquet hall in the back" and "there was nothing she could do about it and it wasn\'t her fault". I didn\'t appreciate the continued attitude from the waitress when we expressed our frustration for waiting almost an hour for our food. I can\'t comment on the food because after that we left.

As the Japanese place across the road was oddly closing at 9pm, however, Frizzante got our business at the start of December and that proved to be a good choice.\n\nThe crostini starter was attractively presented & a pleasing size. The two different risottos ordered (funghi misti & al martin) were also great in terms of taste & portion size whilst the tirmisu was doorstep size & the panacotta enjoyably firmer than anticipated.\n\nAs mentioned by an earlier reviewer the restaurant was very clean and the service was friendly and attentive throughout.

S'This review is my opinion only, in case that wasn\'t clear.\n\nFirst things first: the pizza. Decent. Nice crust (though our table\'s 4 pizzas were cooked inconsistently), lots of cheese (more than other italian-style thin crusts - good or bad is up to you). I thought they skimped a little on the meat, but it\'s a minor quable for an overal good product. It\'s a pricey for what it is however; Bottega isn\'t much higher price-wise, but the dinning experience there is far superior.\n\nMy side-salad (italian) was large, fresh and crisp.\n\nThe hazlenut/chocolate sauce poured over cinamon/sugar dough balls for desert was simple and delicious. It also would suit 3 people for just $7. We (half) jokingly said we\'d return just for these.\n\nThe din is, well, din-like; unpleasant. It\'s loud and the place is a bit obnoxious with the sports-bar style TV in your face in the dining area. This isn\'t to my liking, but again a personal feeling.\n\nThe service was, unfortuantely quite poor. Friendly for sure, but slow when it mattered and fast when it was innapropriate. For example, I called it quits after two of my four slices. My pizza was boxed and returned to me while two members of our party were still eating theirs. Another minor quable, but a quable nontheless. Also, being asked if we wanted desert and then slightly annoyed we said yes was an unfortunate slip for our server. Maybe we\'re reading too much into it. \n\nThe bathrooms are form over function. Enjoy the confusion. Paper towel is above the mirror and out-of-reach for below-average height humans and those who fail to "look up."\n\nWould we return; not unless invited there - but my partner was adament that she\'d order take-out pizza from Bocaro in a heartbeat over other options like F+F and I can\'t say that I\'d complain.\n\nThe one thing I would complain about is the ridiculous "respect the menu and don\'t change anything notice." This is not a michelin star sporting restaurant; get over yourselves - otherwise it\'s a cheap ploy to force you to "make your own pizza" with one different ingredient for a much higher price.\n\nI\'d give it a C overall. Pizza-only a B+.'

They were very clear and patient with her, their English was great. I got it, she seemed smart enough to get it. But she was clearly rich and entitled and very impatient.

S'Th Hub is for me a focal point especially when the Edinburgh Festival is in full flow either for aquiring tickets, making show enquiries, information on events or a quick lunch bite. It also doubles as an event venue, and has private meeting room upstairs, in this structure that dominates the city skyline...but for me I have yet to fully experience a show or some food here.\n\nFor me the its location is fairly central in an converted church, now a regional meeting place where its quiet enough to escape the hussle and bussle of outside, during busy tourist season!  Enjoy the shop, free maps and guides, chatting to Hub staff finding out if there are any tickets left for usual sold out events that Edinburgh is famous for, and the afternoon weekend teas are great as well as weddings and pre-tattoo suppers.\n\nThey have wifi, not sure if it is free but according to the ticket staff, you cant get access to www from the shop area but possibly need a password from the restaurant staff. \n\nFor full information visit the hub website www.thehub-edinburgh.com'

S"Little Caesars is by no means a 4 star pizza place - not even close. But I'm pretty sure everyone knows what to expect when they step inside this place. You're getting a $5 pizza, and if you get what you pay for, don't expect much. \n\nThat being said, I have a family of myself and 3 men. Well, one man and two boys. But those boys are already eating us out of house and home and they're not even out of diapers yet. About once a month we go for some really cheap pizza when things get tight between paychecks and mommy doesn't feel like slaving away in the kitchen. This is always our store of choice, partly from location and also from quality. \n\nI've dealt with other LCs before on many occasions and have been served pizzas that taste like cardboard with a smattering of marinara sauce. Sometimes the pizzas are clearly old and stale. Sometimes there's no cheese on some of the slices. Not this place. \n\nI have never once been served an inedible pizza from this LC. The pizzas are ALWAYS fresh - usually many times better than we expect. But since it's a $5 pizza, I say again - don't expect much. The management team must really have it nailed down here. I'm a fan."

S'I had such a long day today that by the time school ended, I was soooo hungry, I could eat a UNICORN! \n\nAfter what seemed like an hour\'s worth of bus rides (and sure enough, it took me that long to get to the Fashion Show Mall from CSN west charleston campus) my galpal and I opted to meet at the food court. There, I ordered a 6" tuna sandwich - with herbs and cheese bread, cheddar (toasted), tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, sweet onion sauce - for $5 + tax. I guess it\'s safe to say that the sandwich was gone in less than 10 minutes. The vegetables were fresh and I loved how subway\'s tuna isn\'t oozing with mayonnaise. \n\nWe then returned after our meal to get ourselves some cookies. For 75cents, you could get 1 but for $2, you could get yourself 3. Being the sweet-tooth that we are, we ordered 2 Chocolate Chip cookies and 1 White Chocolate and Macademia cookie. When we ordered our desserts, it was already about 6:20pm so sadly, there weren\'t anymore Raspberry Cheesecake Cookies - my ultimate favourite! So if you ever head to Subway, you can now keep in mind that they\'re not merely limited to just sandwiches. \n\nThere\'s no doubt subway\'ll always be my preferred go-to over McDonalds - healthier and more stuffing between the bread...and they\'ve got a \'sweet\'er side to them too!'

S"Real good basic Mexican food. Been to this location twice and the flagship in El Paso once. Always go with the same thing with satisfying results......the carne asada platter. The carne comes on a hot plate sizzling with temptation. Also has beans, rice and tortillas.  First off, my girlfriend and I told the cashier to hold the guacamole-we're both mildly allergic (a travesty, I know) and he offered to double our tortillas from five to ten. Hell yeah, we're off to a great start!  \n     Next we were off to the salsa bar to load up on the extras-and there are plenty of em. About ten different varieties, along with marinated onions, jalapenos, guacamole, limes, cilantro, etc. Many great choices, along with a helpful explanation of each salsa, its heat level, and what meat it pairs best with. And before we could finish loading up our cornucopia of condiments the order was sizzling at the pickup counter.\n     After about two more minutes of salsa selection, we're headed back to the table to a still crackling platter surrounded by two individual servings each of beans and rice. The carne asada was a perfect mix of crispy edges paired with tender chunks, atop a layer of marinated onions. The beans were whole, brown, and included the best mix-in of all-bacon! The rice was soft and fluffy, with a perfect smoky seasoning. Tortillas were good quality (we opted for flour), thin and flexible, but with the heft to hold all our stuffings in. All these ingredients made for a great make-your-own taco to be specified to one's own liking.  \n    No real complaints about the food except for the serve yourself tortilla chips that were mostly broken and coldish.  Not much atmosphere, but the food is the star here. A game room with about ten video games is tucked away in the southeastern portion of the building to provide some entertainment for the kids if time is needed to settle that stomach. lol. Overall, a great value as the platter ($19.07 after tax) can feed two-three, and there are larger choices. We strive to come back and explore the rest of the menu, but memories of the sizzle have made it hard so far."

S"Eh.  I wanted to eat some pizza and I figured I would try some place other than the chains on campus.  I stumbled across a 50% off on Thursday deal on EatCu and decided it was worth giving a shot.  I ordered a large deep dish Firestation Supreme. \n\n I eagerly awaited my food and an hour passed with nothing.  I figured they would be busy seeing that pizzas are 50% off on Thursdays and decided I would wait another 30 minutes.  An hour and a half passes by and I give them a call.  The man on the phone tells me that it'll be delivered soon.  So I wait again.  Two hours pass, and as I'm calling them again, the delivery guy shows up at my door.  \n\nFirst thing I noticed was that the pizza was lukewarm by this point.  Then I noticed it wasn't the type of deep dish I was expecting.  I was expecting a Chicago-Style deep dish, but instead it was just pizza with a thicker crust.  My fault there for assuming it would Chicago-Style.  That being said, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  Maybe it was just the long wait that marred the experience, but I was left wanting something more.  I'll be willing to give them another shot in the future.  Worth it if you get the 50% off deal, otherwise I would stick to other places."

S'In a city full of amazing Greek food, there\'s really no excuse to go here, even if you\'re a tourist. This was probably the worst "Greek" food I\'ve ever had the displeasure of eating in Montreal. The bread was stale and tasteless. The only good thing about the appetizer platter was the feta, and that\'s because there\'s no such thing as bad feta unless it\'s turned black. They even screwed up the tzatziki, which I didn\'t think was possible--it was sour and had no flavour but garlic. The salad had nothing greek about it--soggy iceberg lettuce and cabbage covered in some kind of sour vinaigrette. The main dish was two rubbery, tasteless roasted potatoes, some rice, some soggy steamed veggies straight out of a prison cafeteria (steamed carrots and green beans with a Greek meal?), and a steak. The steak was the one decent part of the meal, although my gf got the chicken entree and it tasted like charcoal and had the consistency of half-hardened cement. Finally, a cheesecake slice was the dessert (again, Greek?). It was tasty, but mostly because it was solid sugar and fat.\n\nDon\'t go here. Really. Eat at one of the 10,000 other Greek restos in this city. I guarantee you almost all of them will be better.'

S"After a few visits that were far from exciting, I decided to give them another chance.  It was on the fly, had a group of teen girls that needed fed.  I ordered the 20 pc meal, 2 mash, 2 slaw, and 1 mac.  The sides were fine, yet hard to screw up pre-made side items.  The biscuits were hot, yet oddly enough....Half of them were only the top half.  The chicken, the meat of the meal and matter, was 11 thighs, 2 breasts, 3 legs, and 1 wing.....An odd bird, considering it should have been a straight 5 pieces each.  My family doesn't really care for the thighs, daughter likes legs and wings, wife and I are breast people (yes, I know how that sounds).  We figured the dogs would like the thighs, so you can imagine our thought when the one piece we were tolerating dominated the bunch.\n\nI walked back in the store, and everyone that has ever worked behind a restaurant counter KNOWS, that when a strange person walks into the store with restaurant bags....It isn't a good sign.  So when she asked what I wanted, I politely asked for the MOD.  She didn't understand, I asked again but for the Manager on Duty.  She still did not or choose not to understand me.  I then asked 6 more times, it was a really bad game of whose on first.  To the point that the other customers were laughing.  The General manager came out, and I explained the situation.  He politely said he would fix the situation.  Packed up 5 breasts and sent me on my way.  I wasn't thrilled, but didn't want to waste my day on this.\n\nUpon arriving home, finally getting the chance to eat myself, I put one on the plate with some mashed.  The exterior of the chicken looked fine, but the minute I took a bit and started to chew, the rancid flavor and odor hit me.  After excusing myself for thirty minutes to the bathroom, I returned to examine the chicken.  The exterior and 1/2 inch into the chicken looked normal.  The remaining interior of the chicken was a complete mushy mess....That chicken was so far from it's sell by date that I can't believe I didn't catch it on first examination.  I will say though, it has been hours, and I still have not been able to get that taste out of my mouth or get my stomach settled.....And I was in the Army, and have a pretty tough stomach, but rotten chicken....\n\nNow to add insult to injury, I was exceedingly polite to both the drive thru teller for the extreme wait, and the store manager because I explained to them that I once was a KFC GM and DM.  So I knew what it was like to be in their shoes.  So if anything I hope this review has a bit more weight, I know what the standards are at KFC and know that this location falls far short of them, to the point of it being a safety issue.\n\nWhat is sad, this cost forty bucks, 2 hours of my time and who knows how long to recover.  It was a far cry from Hot, Fresh, and Fast.  Just glad I got to the rancid chicken before my family did."

S'Despite the negative reviews, I decided to give this place a try.  I\'m working nearby so I stopped for lunch.  I\'ve never had Indonesian food before, so I didn\'t know what to expect.  There was nobody there when I arrived (except what may have been the owner).  I ordered "Telor Petis"  (Telor petis     $6.99\nBoil egg, garlic, shallot, finger-root, turmeric, lemongrass, carrot, corn, garlic, shallot, shrimp paste, soy sauce, red chili)   \n\nWhat I got was a boiled egg that had been deep-fried, smothered in a spicy chili sauce, sitting atop a multitude of sauteed fresh green beans and broccoli.  Underneath all that was steamed rice.  There was a brown soy-sauce based sauce on the side which I poured over the whole thing.  Oh, there was also a deep-fried cracker-like thing.  \n\nAnyway, you can see that this doesn\'t fit the description on the menu at all, so picky eaters would be advised to ask the cook to tell them about the _______.   So, why 4 stars?  Because it was really freaking delicious.  Spicy, fresh, healthy, and exactly what my stomach needed to have in it to turn around and bang out another afternoon.   \n\nI thought it was great.  Maybe next time I\'ll try the fried chicken.'

S"One hungover Sunday morning (read early evening) I leapt (read fell) out of bed and brightly made my way to the kitchen to make myself a gourmet dinner using a Heston Blumenthal recipe (read shouted at my flatmate where the hell are the takeaway menus). As a rule I have been mightily unimpressed with the Chinses takeaways in Edinburgh, they are overpriced and I always think I've accidentally received an extra soup before realising it's my poor little beef chow mein trying desperately to keep from drowning in grease. \n\nHowever, fear not my trusty beef noodles, with Hong's you will be safe from a slow greasy death. I have finally found a Chinese takeaway where I don't genuinely fear a coronary attack after a binge. The dishes are well cooked, flavoursome and there is a huge variety. However the best part is the price; 'chow mein (or to be fancy udon) for \xc2\xa34.50, that grease must have gone to your head boyo' I hear you say, but nay my friends, I speak the truth. \n\nThere are also meal deals for 3 or 4 people and a family meal, and cards are accepted. To cap it all off they've dabbled, successfully I might add, in the Thai market. Although a more limited menu and slightly more expensive than the Chinese, the food is excellent, and considerably cheaper than other Thai takeaways."

S'Wurstle was the worst. Got a groupon ($5 for $10) as it indicated "gourmet" sausages. They stick a hotdog type sausage (with little flavor) in a hollowed out baguette shaped roll (and stick some coleslaw yellow mustard and ketchup in it). The fries were baked in a toaster oven and the pickle was so soft and salty it was inedible. If I actually paid the full price of $10.71 I would have returned it.  Service was painfully slow.'

S'My boyfriend used to know this girl who thought that the Jam House was the least cool place in town.  I think that she\'s just not cool enough to realise just how cool this place is.  It\'s cool like the 80s.\n\nIt actually IS cool like the 80s.  It has that kind of dorky but majorly fun vibe that is the joy of an 80s party.  I almost said "... that reminds me of the 80s" but that\'s a lie; I\'m way too young to remember the 80s.  \n\nA previous reviewer said that it\'s like going to a family wedding because of the all ages crowd.  That is completely true and is one of the JEMs (what disguises itself as a typo is really my brain reminding me that I do remember some of the 80s...) of this place.      \n\nThe majority of people who go to the Jam House aren\'t out for a pretentious night out, they just want to listen to some good music and dance without caring who\'s watching.  Yeah, you will probably end up dancing with a dad and make his night, or with a mom who is wearing heels for the first time in years and can hardly stand up.  That is all part of the charm of the Jam House.\n\nIn exchange, you will find that the door charge is one of if not the cheapest in New Town and and the bar considerably easier to get to than anywhere else on a weekend.  \n\nI\'ve never eaten here so can\'t comment on that aspect but the quality of the night out is, well, cool.  Like the 80s.'

S"Wanting to try the new place, we went around noon on a Sunday, place was less than half full, so no waiting.  We ordered and our burgers came surprisingly quickly.  You would think they would be piping hot.  But, no, they were just warm.  Had they been pre-cooked?  It was curious.  We ordered the Cajun tots and an order of fries.  The burgers were pretty tasteless, not juicy, which only added to our thoughts that they may have been pre-cooked.  Fries were nothing special and the tots on top had a sprinkling of spices, not enough to earn the Cajun label and very little spice flavor other than the ones on top.  Personally, I think that if you are at the Galleria and want a burger, the burgers at Houlihans are better.  Also, and this may seem petty, but I hate being served on plastic plates with the paper on the plate.  We won't bother going back, we felt the same way about the BRGR in East Liberty.  Too bad, I was hoping for a success at that location, it has been through a few iterations of restaurants."

S"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It was getting sort of late for dinner and we were looking for a place close by and since we were already at Ballys, we decided to give this place a shot.\nI had read a few bad reviews for it on Yelp, but decided to try it anyway.\nIt turned out to be pretty good.  It is not the greatest food ever, but it was good enough.  \nI tried the 3 course meal for $19.99.\nStarted with a Minestrone soup.  It was more like a navy bean soup, but it was very good.\nSecond course was lasagna.  Not the best I've had, but far from the worst.  I enjoyed it and the portion was enough to get full and just enough to keep from getting stuffed.\nThird course was the Tiramisu.  Warning!!!: As others have mentioned, it is not your typical Tiramisu.  It is served in a cup and it is like a mousse.  It was pretty good.  I didn't care for it too much.  Waiter didn't even give us the option for gelatto, just brought the Tiramisu.\nOverall, the service was very good also.  The hostess was very nice and seated us right away.  Our drink orders were taken immediately and water was brought to us without asking.  Meal came out hot, in a timely manner. Dark atmosphere, but very fitting.\nThe price was just right.\nI'll go back whenever I need a quick, cheap Italian fix."

Upon arriving, it seemed the staff were surprised to see us! And it was empty besides a couple having food. We didn't let this put us off and indulged in some lattes!\n\nDespite being almost empty, a few of the tables were yet to be cleaned and that the staff still stood idly by. The cakes looked lovely but the cabinet wasn't the cleanest either which made us reluctant to come back and try them. \n\nThe toilet consisted of one large room which was dirty and lacking in toilet roll.

S"Brambles Cafe is a relatively new addition to the cafe scene in the Newington area of Edinburgh and it is my new place to go to for food when I am hungover. \n\nThe name 'Brambles' gives the impression that it is a quaint little tea room but it is anything but. They serve the usual lunch meals such as panini's, baguette's and baked potato's but these are all distinctly average. They also serve breakfasts which include a full English, but by far the best aspect of the Brambles menu is their fried foods section which appears to fry virtually everything - very Scottish!  I really adore their chips an fish, although they are extremely unhealthy. \n\nThey have a few tables and chairs inside but it is quite small so it can get very cramped when its busy during the lunch time rush so I tend to get my food to takeaway."

I called in before I left work and they were ready for pick up when I got over there. i got a specialty stuffed one for my boo and got myself a veggie thin crust and even got some free cookie dough!! The gentleman that helped me on the phone and when i went it was very helpful and make my first experience just delightful. It was a nice change just to get home and throw something in the oven and have dinner be done. The pizzas came out better than I expected and my boyfriend even said the next morning that his pizza was really good and would def order from Papa M's again. That comment coming from him says a lot, since he is a bigger pizza snob then I am!\n\nSuper convenient, super tasty, super affordable.\n\nSCORE X3 !"

S"Carnitas Guanajuato is a very authentic Mexican restaurant. I decided to try them after driving by them so many times. We ordered the barbacoa, cheese enchiladas, and pork skin taco's. The food did take a long time to arrive even though it was not busy. It was actually comforting because it meant the food was made to order and not pre made and microwaved like most Mexican restaurants. The barbocoa was made with lamb and was super amazing. The flavors were truly divine. My wife had the cheese enchilada, not really my type of Mexican food but it definitely was loaded with cheese and she loved it. The pork skin tacos were good but not what I expected. I was thinking the pork skin would have some crisp to it but it was soft. It was definitely lacking in texture and appearance but not in taste. I probably would not order it again, but definitely something I am glad I tried. I would rate the food at four stars but the service was between a one and a two. The servers were not friendly and welcoming. They were also extremely slow even though it was not busy while we were there. Everyone has bad days though and I am excited to go there a second time."

S'You would think that a place that has been open, in this location as long as they have might have a few things figured out.  Hey Management, here\'s a few pointers for you:\n\nWhen there are events downtown, people WILL show up.  Stop looking so shocked.  We are actually there because the wait everywhere else is too long, and we were forced to look to you by default.  Restaurant staffing is variable, meaning you are allowed to schedule adequate staff for an event night.\n\nWe rolled in, took a look around, checked out the menu and rolled out.  Then we found out the wait at Cooperstown, which was wall to wall with people, was an hour.  So we rolled back to Jacksons.  The wait for food, when the place was at only 1/3 of their capacity was an hour.  For food.  For bar food.  They have 8 items on the menu, most of which are fried.  Has it ever occurred to their staff to, umm, I unno, PREPARE?  We found an outside seat, and I meandered up to the outside bar.  15 minutes later, I finally got served.  I kept my mouth shut, because I watched one of the bartenders berate a woman for complaining about the wait.  Granted, she was a bitch, but a bitch with a  valid point.  They were only serving the people at the ends of the bar, completely ignoring the 30 or so SITTING in the middle.  \n\n$12 for 2 vodka Red Bulls, a fair price.  After learning about the wait, we decided to forgo food, but there was another 15 minute wait when I went back to the cash only outside bar.  So much for them remembering decent tippers.  \n\nThe seating arrangement outside seems weird, awkward and unbalanced, and it only gets worse when you head inside.  I hear they have "servers" but since I only saw one looking harried inside, that could be more of an urban legend than fact.  They could easily add more tables inside and rearrange the outside to seat more people comfortably, but given that they can\'t handle a preconcert crowd, they shouldn\'t unless they hire some experienced, friendly staff.\n\nI won\'t be going back anytime soon.'

Salt and pepper are desperately needed.  The onions were totally under done and the meat seemed precooked so it was overcooked when served.  The fries were not completely cooked.  They should strive to be like Charlies in the Atlanta airport and less like an greedy food vendor who doesn't care about quality."

I really enjoy the food burrito Bandito creates and I\'m craving one right now! \nThis happened a while back but the experience was so hilarious I must tell what ensued. \nI go in to order 2 breakfast burritos, one with chorizo and egg, the other with bean, egg and cheese. \n\nIt\'s only 10am and they tell me that they haven\'t made any chorizo, the cook got a late start. OK I can work with you... make the chorizo burrito with bacon instead. OK. \n\nI wait and wait. The burritos finally come out. They are in the bag and the girl asks me if I want salsa... I say yes but she just ignores me and hands me the bag. I tell her again that I want salsa and she then gives me 2 cups. \n\nI drive all the way to work where my coworker is meeting me in the parking lot. I open a burrito since it isn\'t marked and see that there is ham in it. For some reason neither I nor my coworker enjoy ham though we love our bacon. I was aggravated. They didn\'t have chorizo at 10 am when they open at 6 am, and they mess up a simple order. \n\nI get the girl on the phone. \n\nME: "Hi. I was just in there, remember? I wanted the chorizo breakfast burrito, but the cook hadn\'t made it so I ordered one with bacon instead? Well, I understand people come in late, have a bad day, so I was willing and happy with changing my order to bacon, but it STILL got messed up. And that I am not happy with." \n\nSocially Retarded Girl: "Well I wasn\'t in the kitchen, I didn\'t make it." \n\nME: (aghast but still trying to be polite) "Yes. I know. But the fact remains that the order was still messed up." (Now I expect her to apologize, get a manager... comp me SOMETHING!) \n\nSocially Retarded Girl: (She honestly says to me...) "SO? What do you want me to do about it?" \n\nME: (This is where I effing LOSE it because I can\'t believe that she couldn\'t put herself in the place of an unhappy customer and just be nice, I was.) "WELL? WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO WHEN YOU MESS UP SOMEONES ORDER?" \n\nSocially Retarded Girl: "I have no idea." \n\nMe: "Well then how \'bout you give the phone to someone who does!" \n\nI am completely stunned at the way she talked to me. I mean, this was a simple "I\'m sorry, let me get my manager, let me comp you one." \n\nGuy/Manager "I\'m so sorry about this. The mess up and the way she talked to you.

S'If you eat at Subway you may have found highly differing experiences and levels of satisfaction.\nI first had their sandwiches in Bridgeport Ct in\n1973?  In my many years of going to Subway I find none compare with this location. I was impressed to the point that I picked up a business card from their counter and emailed the owner. I also complimented him when he was at the store at a later date. I drive by numerous other Subway restaurants to go to this one.\nThey are open very late and the personnel is highly professional for a sandwhich shop. The people are also warm and natural. It appears this place does a high volume which I think I understand why and they earn it.'

S"I think it's fair to say that Spanish cuisine hasn't caught on in the UK in the way that, say, French or Italian has. We're all au fait with authentic coq au vin and insist on our pasta being al dente, but, despite tv chefs throwing chorizo into every second dish, how many of us really know what Spanish food is all about? Tapas and sangria might be holiday staples but when looking for somewhere for dinner Spanish doesn't seem to be the first thing that springs to mind. \n\nEl Quijote has changed all that, and in doing so has leaped right to the top of my list of favourite places.\n\nIt's small and cosy, with a sort of rustic d\xc3\xa9cor that doesn't overdo it but still manages to feel welcoming and snug. I'm glad we booked ahead as it was full and they were turning people away. The staff are friendly but not overbearing, and the menu is just extensive enough to require some tough decisions but not to leave you languishing in the slough of menu despond. \n\nAnd the food, of course. Man. That was some of the best grilled meat I've had in ages. We started with some simple tapas: the obligatory chorizo and manchego, and some piquant grilled peppers, to go with the complimentary bread and olive oil. Then onto the main courses. My grilled Iberian pork was incredible (see photo). Tender and pink on the inside, with that nice grilled outside, little bits of crisp and crunch, just heavenly. And the simple accompaniment of potatoes and salad was all that was needed. \n\nI didn't particularly like the wine I chose, so I made up for it by finishing the meal with some unctuously rich sherry from their short sherry menu. Much better than having pudding. The next day I was dreaming of that grilled pork and we'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu."

S'Came here for a yelp girly lunch following Jenny\'s weekly newsletter on the best Spanish food in Edinburgh. My taste buds were a tingling. And tingled they were!! \n\nThe tabla quijote platter of meat and cheese allowed us to taste every variety on offer. Some were nicer than others (I\'m not a fan of blue cheese!) but it was a great sharing plate for anyone who loves cured meat and chorizo. I also ordered a tapas sized of small peppers with white asparagus and topped with an Andalusian sauce. Phallic looking as they were (haha!) I rather liked them. The dish was chilled, asparagus was soft (not crunchy how I normally like asparagus) but tasty nevertheless. The sauce was nice too and I\'d order them again. \n\nFor my main I ordered the Pork Cheeks stew which was recommended by jenny. I went for the medium side but boy it was big! watch out on the sizes if you\'re having starter tapas too! The stew was basically a big bowl of soup like stew. Not what I was expecting but extremely tasty. I\'ve never had pork cheeks before but the meat was slow cooked and fell away from the fork. Yum! The only thing was the lack of "chunky homemade chips" as described in the menu. There were bits of potato in the stew but chips? Nope. \n\nWould I go back? Definitely. The food was authentic and tasty and its really near my work so v handy! It\'s small but cute with terracotta pots and plants dotted around inside. Quite quaint. If it wasn\'t for the garlic in the food it would be an ideal date venue! :)'

But the food was AH-mazing.  Some of the best chicken I've ever had.  \n\nHad the chicken burrito combo, and although the rice and beans were just OK, I thought I might cry right into my platter because the chicken burrito was so delicious.  The chicken was so tender and juicy... ohmygawd I am drooling just thinking about it, and I am still overwhelmingly full from the meal.  The burrito also had onions (both white and green) and cilantro (YES PLEASE!) which I'm sure added to the overall deliciousness.  \n\nSadly the service was less than stellar and SUPER slow (and I was the ONLY one in the restaurant so no excuses), but their food (and cheap prices!) will certainly get me coming back.

These were not meats they should have been serving.   \n\nAs I said initially, the service was excellent.  It's definitely a family run joint, and they were so kind that we didn't have the heart to tell them the food was rank.  We politely pretended we were stuffed and asked them to box the rest of our food to-go.   And promptly ditched it in the trash can once we were out the door.\n\nI would have loved to recommend this place, as Las Vegas is definitely in need of some genuine, authentic middle eastern cuisine -- but do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs."

S'My favorite Chinese food is General Tso\'s and so I use that as my measuring stick for Chinese restaurants. General\'s is called something else at Lotus, but is noted in parentheses. Lotus has HUGE, and i mean huge, servings. I was able to eat 4 meals out of 1 order (of course there were crab rangoons too). The rangoons were light and not as crispy as I would have liked. They also were a bit sweeter than other rangoons I have had. The General\'s was also not as crispy as I would have liked. While eating there were numerous call-in orders placed for General\'s and all were "extra crispy," so keep that in mind when placing your order. The food looked amazing when first opened: there were 6-7 red pepper pods and I was super excited that it would be extra spicy, but it wasn\'t. The rice is very colorful and has many veggies including peas and onions, but overall the flavor is somewhat bland. \n\nOverall: you cannot beat the price/serving size, but it\'s not the best General Tso\'s I\'ve ever had. I\'d be willing to go back and get extra crispy/extra spicy and see how that goes.'

S"Nice small mom and pop restaurant feel to Cedar, when you first walk in your hit by the delicious smell of fresh cooked food.  Persian TV is playing to help with the authentic feel. Owner is working the front counter and is friendly and knowledgeable about the food.  Its a really comfortable restaurant setting that doesn't feel cheesy or overdone.\n\nI started with the hummus, baba ghannouj and grape leaves.  The hummus was fresh but the baba stole the show.  I haven't had baba before but it was flavorful and went geat with the pita bread.  The grape leaves were well made and had a great flavor.  For lunch I went with the falafel and it was huge.  Everything came together well, the pickled radishes was a nice touch.  Presentation was straight forward and no frills, they let the food speak for itself so.  Drinks are cans and bottles, my one complaint because I drink like a fish so I can go through two or three sodas.\n\nI recommend this place for good food with a homemade feel at a great price .  You can go to chains and get gyros and falafels but they fail to have much flavor due to mass production. As a added treat ask for the Manusha, very unique and a must try!"

But there are other factors at work now such as wait time, dining area cleanliness, price, and order accuracy. For these reasons I down rated from 5 stars to 3 stars for my most recent trips.\n\nThe dining area is kept pretty clean but they have a serious problem with flies. They really need to invest in those little fan blower thingys above the doors because the flies were just everywhere and if there's one thing I can't stand while I'm eating, it's having flies fight me for my food.\n\nAlso after a 20 minute wait for 2 sandwiches, I expect my order to be exact. Unfortunately this isn't always the case. I think they are just having a difficult time keeping up with their popularity, but even during slow times the wait is quite substantial for just a couple of sandwiches.\n\nBut at the end of the day it's the tastiest sandwich in town, and I'm really freaking hungry."

S"Meh. \n\nThe Lowdown Cafe is indeed lowdown...if you want something that looks like your grandma's kitchen where she doles out crotchety commentary while her overworked daughter tries to keep up with her demands and you may or may not actually eat what you ordered, then head on down.\n\nTo be fair, I think I arrived at the tail end of preparations for a large take-out order, which bogged things down. Even so, I ordered a Garden Pesto Pita, and the younger woman asked me to repeat my order when she finally got around to making it, and then I think she made the Grilled Vegetable Pita regardless. It was mighty tasty (if a bit oily) but there was nary a pesto to be found. \n\nLowdown Cafe takes relaxed to a new level. I'm not such a fan of watching my food being prepared right in front of me if it means I watch Mama Lowdown chop and dice with no gloves and take occasional munches of what's going into my lunch. Ick. Also, one of the customers at the counter (apparently a regular) felt so relaxed that he periodically wandered behind the counter to wash his hands and throw out his trash. Pretty sure that's against code.\n\nThe Ginger Chai Latte (iced) is very tasty, very gingery. \n\nI don't think I'll be back, because there are so many other places I want to try. But if you're in the neighborhood, aren't in a hurry, and aren't picky about what you get to eat, give the place a try."

S"It's certainly not the best food, but it is close to our house, usually prompt, and pretty cheap with the 2 for $20 and kids eat free. So, it was an OK choice on occasional nights when we didn't feel like cooking or just wanted a change of scenery.\n\nThat is, until last night. After first waiting for 15 minutes for any wait staff to appear, then waiting an additional several minutes for our waters to arrive (not to mention the additional 10 minutes for the single beer to brought out), then waiting for quite some time for our meals to arrive, we discovered that somehow 1 order wasn't placed. At this point it was a full hour from when we were seated. I waited an additional 10-15 minutes for my salad to arrive. The manager stopped by to offer chips and salsa, but we'd already had an app with the 2 for $20, so we declined.\n\nAt this point, the kids were tired and restless, and ready to head home. I packed my salad in a to go box and asked for the check. They offered a 10% discount, which amounted to less than $3 on the total bill. Unfortunately, at this point we discovered that the restaurant had stopped the kids eat free plan as well. \n\nSo, all told, the meal took twice as long as we planned, with a lot more hassle than necessary, and we spent more than the quality of food warranted, and certainly more than the overall experience warranted.\n\nSince the primary reasons we chose Applebee's on nights like last night were the convenience and relative cheap cost, we won't bother going back in the future."

Everything was pretty good, especially the appetizers--the special, seared Ahi Tuna that day, seemed a little over-priced at $24. My friend had the coq au vin and it got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. Oh, and the server was good but he had other people bring out the and this one lady just shouted out what it was and you had to raise your hand. Kind of tacky for a nice restaurant. With good food though, definite room for improvement and I hope they work on their service and bar selection."

S'Decent tasting. Not bad for $5 but tonight when I went,  I ordered breadsticks , similar to crazy bread, but they forgot to include sauce and the bread sticks were undercooked and doughy. My pizza had way too much cheese and was barely cut. The pizza looked like it had just been thrown into the box, getting cheese and sauce all over the inside of the pizza box.'

S'We returned to PJs and had noticed that a lot of changes had been made since PJs first opened.  Back then, we stopped by for dessert and coffee after dinner.   Now the place is very unfocused on dessert and coffee, and much more focused on alcohol and hookahs.  Which, of course, wasn\'t a bad thing, because we wanted an adult beverage.  The seating is pretty limited, but we got a great seat for the three of us in a leather sectional sofa.   It was so comfortable.  We opted for "regular" drinks this time instead of their specialty $12 martinis to try to save some money.  So for about half the price, I got my vodka and cranberry juice served in regular glass instead of a martini one.  \n\nSaturday night, there was a DJ there who was nothing short of AWESOME.  I could have sat there relaxing and drinking, listening to him spinning records (literally) for hours.  The music was very upbeat and danceable, and it made for a fantastic visit.  We didn\'t try the flavored hookahs at $20 a pop, but I\'m a little hookah-curious.  I\'d like to learn a little more about them, though, before I go puffing away and stir up my allergies.'

S"I nominate this place for an OYE.  How awesomely Korean can you get?  Korean music videos playing on the projection screen, Korean karaoke going on in the back, and some friendly service to go along with great food.\n\nWe were starving late at night on a Saturday and didn't want greasy spoon or Scottsdale food.  I saw that this place was open and it was 1030 so we figured we'd give it a shot.  We walked in and the little hostess girl promptly sat us and gave us menus.  She was back quickly to take our drink order and ask if we had any questions.  \n\nThe menu is pretty big.  They seem to do Korean, Chinese, and Japanese food here (including sushi) but I was just looking for a noodle bowl.  Sure enough, Yakisoba bowl with chicken was sitting there on the back so I went ahead and ordered it.  \n\nFirst we were given the customary bowl of soup with the little tofu cubes.  It was good.  Not any different than what you've had before, but it was good.  Then we got these four plates of different salads.  They were strange.  Kim chee and some cucumber one.  There was some other really spicy one and something else.  I don't really know what they were but they weren't bad.\n\nWhen our entrees came out, I was quite pleased.  Heaping bowl of noodles with piles of veggies and chicken.  Just what you'd expect and just what I wanted.  SO GOOD though.  Way better than I expected for some random hole in the wall in the middle of the ghetto.  \n\nI will totally be back here.  I'd love for a bunch of yelpers to invade for Karaoke on the weekends and sing Korean music.  They were having a ton of fun!"

S"It's hard to find a good mariscos spot on the west side of the valley, so when the 'Grand Opening' sign went up, I knew it would be a matter of time before I would be there.  I've been there twice in the past week, ordering something different each time, and twice have been pleased with very delicious meals, as well as the people I've been with.  \n\nThe service was friendly, and given the meals ordered, there was a slight wait, but along with awesome food, there is also the presentation of the food, which adds to the flair of the meal.  While waiting, you do get a bowl of warm chips and freshly made salsa to chomp on and there is an assortment of hot sauces on the table to test as well.  The owners would mingle and talk to the customers instead of just watching people spend their money there. The prices were a little slightly higher than the average mariscos place, but the food is just a little better than your average place.\n\nThe menu proves this isn't just a Mexican restaurant with fish and shrimp added to fit the name, the menu is real deal mariscos! The decoration and design of the place is very fitting with the mariscos theme and really adds to the comfort level, there was some actual thought and effort put into it.  There is also a small bar with a wide variety of assorted liquors to mix up type of flavorful concoction, from a michelada to a margarita, to a bucket of coronas and almost anything in between as well. \n\nIt's an overall very good restaurant and to me a very high 4 stars! Will most definitely keep coming back!"

On that note, all the smoke is a legitimate concern and not for everybody, but having been to Serbia many times and not being a smoker myself I guess you could say I'm used to it...still, this place is WAY more ventilated than Derbi, even if it's smaller, so if you're worried about smoke while you're eating (and rightfully so) this is the better option.\n\nI love me some Prince...I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas!

S'Sweet "O" is more like Sweet "NO". \n\nWas intruiged by their website and good reviews, went on a wednesday afternoon around 430. We were the ONLY table. We ordered a two drinks, two sandwiches, and one dessert to share. The drinks were good, and the food had a lot of potential (although one sandwich was better than the other...) until I found a pretty gross hair embedded in the middle of my sandwich, mid-bite. Now, anyone who\'s worked food service can respect the occasional mistake. Sure, you cant control when your hair falls out. But what is getting the bad review from me is how BADLY the staff handled it. \n\nUpon notifying the waitress, she unapologetically stated "Well I have no idea how that could have possibly gotten in there"... Almost as if I placed it there. It was short, black, and still had skin connected to it. I don\'t have short black hair. So she took it away. She then asked if I would like something else, to which I asked if it were possible to make another half sandwich. She came out with a completely different sandwich than I ordered (which of course was the one I didn\'t care for). So I gave up on trying to get any more dinner and we focused on dessert. It was decent, but nothing I couldn\'tve gotten at applebee\'s on happy hour. \n\nThen came the bill. Not a single thing had been comped, and it reached $60 dollars. When my friend complained, the waitress hastily said "I\'ll get the manager". Manager comes bustling out, sets a new bill on the table, and walks off. \n\nI understand mistakes in food. I truely do. But the way this staff handled a mistake that was completely their own was ridiculous. Never ONCE in the evening did we get an "I\'m sorry" from any staff member.\n\nI won\'t be going back there again. And by the attitues they exhibited, It didn\'t appear as if they cared that I told anyone else not to go there either.\n\n2/19/08 EDIT: The owner has contacted me, apologized, and shared that there is new management. Might be worth another try.'

The food was fine, large portions, but nothing you can\'t get at any other sports bar. The Manager did come by to ask how our food was, so that is nice - I did ask how they came up with the name - she did say that it is named after "THE OFFICE\' in CABO San Lucas, Mexico - Now, I have been and still do frequent The Office in CABO, and this place is nothing like it, other than the name. \nNow - for the one good part, they do have large booths with Plug ins for Laptops and free Wi-Fi. I can look past the other items to get free wi-fi and a cool drink. Now if they only had the Sand / Beach / 18yr College coeds\' half naked drinking beers and it could be like Cabo San Lucas.'

S'This place looks like a whole lot of nothing from the outside.  You might be expecting a Filberto\'s level experience.  Instead, I got a little bit of a wow.  (Note: wow was not capitalized or followed by exclamation point. This is the wow of, "wow, this place isn\'t too bad".  Not the wow of "WOW! I get the whole lobster dinner for $1!")\n\nYou\'re going to have your basic tacos and burritos for sure, but this place also had seafood.  I already have a mini-list of stuff to try for next time.  Oysters(6 for 6.99), ceviche tostadas(2.79), 7 Mares soup (7 kinds of fish/seafood) (10.99), Empanizados (10.99) and even a whole fish (11.99).  Someone got this massive plate of shrimp and beef fajitas that looked at least 2 times bigger than anything I\'d seen come out of a standard sit down restaurant - and it smelled awesome.  They even do breakfast - with Huevos Rancheros w/ Rice and Beans coming in at a cool $3.99.    \n\nThey tell you on the menu that food is prepared fresh every day, and one bite of a tortilla will tell you that for sure.  WOW.  (Yes, it\'s that kind of wow good.) This is so good you KNOW it\'s bad for you.  And by the way, they have 18 different kind of burritos, none of them over $4.29 - including Chile Relleno, Al Pastor, Lengua and Fish - and any of them can be done "Wet" or Chimi style.  \n\nAs for a setting, walk up counter - where you also pick up your food.  Cloth covered tables (covered in glass for easy cleaning) on saltillo tile with carved and brightly painted wooden chairs.  They have a juke box and a mini salsa bar that includes lemons, jalapenos and de-skinned cucumber slices.\n\nMy last 2 thoughts on the place?  Mexican coke in the bottle.  Full bar.  \n\nWow.'

Our large  pizza took over 35 minutes, and when I commented on the wait  to our server, she replied "...and we\'re not even busy"\n\nThe games all the same style for the most part. However, my nephew walked away with more then 1600 tickets, and he was thrilled.  The pizza is average but we will return simply because $20 buys a filling meal and an additional $20 buys my nephew an hour of fun.\n\n There are a lot better pizza places (like Grimaldi\'s ) but I really don\'t go to Peter Piper for great pizza. We go to Peter Piper Pizza for games and fun. When I want a great pizza I head over to Grimaldi\'s.'

Then we had to wait 14 minutes just for two four piece chicken nuggets we ordered since they only rang up one. So we pulled off and  they didn\'t give us any sauces, so we went back and got them. When we opened it up and they had given us the habanero ranch. Strange the woman in jeans and a black shirt "no uniform?" missed it.

S'I really wish 3.5 was an option.  Red Owl doesn\'t quite deserve the esteem of 4 stars, yet it is definitely not as mediocre as 3 stars.\n\nThe first time I went here I definitely enjoyed the crowd and the vibe. Punk rockers, head bangers, and the like all hanging out and having a great time together.\n\nWhen I bragged to a friend of mine about how awesome this place was, she replied that she would never go there because of the lobster claw machine.  I had no idea what she was talking about, but the second time I went to the Red Owl, I saw it.  And all the horror stories that she told me (that I brushed off) came rushing back... "dead lobsters"...  "floating"...  "dirty water"... \n\nUgh.\n\nThis contraption is like the game where you use a joystick or buttons to move a claw around with the purpose of winning a stuffed animal.  Only this machine\'s purpose is to win a live (hopefully) lobster in a huge tank of murky water.  It\'s disgusting and cruel and they really should get rid of it.\n\nHowever, I am a fan of the bar, the music and the clientele.  I stopped by for a quick visit during Metalfest and it brought back all of my childhood memories of hanging out at the SkyRoom in South Buffalo.  Death Metal, Hardcore... I felt so at home it reminds me of one of my favorite quotes.\n\n"As if that blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself -- so like a brother, really -- I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again." Albert Camus'

S"Attempt #1 to visit Roasting Oven: Mission Unaccomplished.  We tried tracking the address and map on Yelp and it took us to Plaza Fiesta where we wandered into the middle courtyard where the giant kid play contraption (aka germ magnet) exists and much to our disappointment, it was closed. However we did not go hungry and found a kick ass Mexican place.\n\nAttempt #2 to visit Roasting Oven: Mission Accomplished!! We did more research and found they moved to Gold Hill Road just off I-77. It actually is a much better place for anyone in Fort Mill or Tega Cay to run in and grab dinner to go when they're too lazy to cook.  In fact, even if they aren't too lazy, The Roasting Oven's rotisserie chicken probably is the best in town.  Great flavor and moistness. The sides (especially the frozen corn) were generally unimpressive and beans were average. The sides at Genaro's in Pineville are better. But the The fried plantains are the exception- they are very well done.  We got a family pack and a couple sides that fed 3 of us for $25.\n\nThey have a bar, but skip the grape juice infused sangria. \n\nThe casual environment has plenty of indoor seating and outdoor seating as well under a covered pergola.  We would return for the chicken and sounds like they have some other good dishes. The daughter of the family that owns it was incredibly professional and friendly."

When I called their phone went unanswered (typical of their help, I'm sure) and I finally got a recording!  Called back and same thing (yes, checked the phone number, etc.  This is the THIRD time we have had problems at this KFC. Sadly, it seems as if this store is poorly managed and the help they hire isn't worth the minimum wage they are probably being paid. They are surly, rude, and dumb as sticks on top of it all. Avoid this KFC like the plague if you want my advice. There are newer and far cleaner stores in Mesa and Tempe and Gilbert that actually have well trained and polite and helpful staff. Too bad this isn't one of them! Who ever owns/manages this mess of a store ought to be ashamed of the lousy service, rude help and fairly dirty store! Do not go here even if you're starving!"

Many things about this place have elements of Tempe so I recommend it if you are in to Chinese Buffet of this caliber. \n\nThis is not health food people. I have slipped in to many "China Panda Comas" in the past. It is up there with the Thanksgiving feeling of laying out on the couch and nodding off like a character form an Irvine Welsh book.

Sometimes (when you have NOTHING else to do with your day) its absolutely glorious. \n\nThis is also not the greatest Chinese food you are going to find, but the loyal Tempe crowd will find a little piece of culinary history in this very different Mesa location.

Gyro meat, lettuce, onions, 1 tomato slice and sauce. Unfortunately for us, apparently it was hard to do.  Because they seem to do little business, the lettuce was turning brown on some pieces. And the gyros meat had been on the spit a little too long. Pieces of it were crisp and hard to chew.  The meat really had no taste to it either. I won't be back.

It\'s moist, hot, corn bread is really really tasty, service is good.\n\nDownside, some of the servers seem to be rather "green" & kind of dopey.  Drinks need improvement.\n\nWe\'ve been here three times & have yet to be disappointed.  Its about time we got a decent BBQ place in the area!  No over-priced, hoity-toity Houston\'s, no hangin\' out with old fogies at Don & Charlies, no dried out, wanna be BBQ like other places.\n\nNot as casual as Honey Bear\'s, but REALLY good food.  \n\nI am NOT a fan of beef, but tolerate pork.  Their pulled pork sandwich is tender, juicy & perfectly seasoned.  I do add more of their sauce at the table though.\n\nI even tried the brisket sandwich one time & was pleasantly surprised at how TENDER & tasty it was...and I\'m NOT a beef person!!  Most brisket is chewy & dried out...not this stuff.  You could cut it with very little effort with a FORK.'

S"Possibly had my most enjoyable Sunday of the year in here yesterday.\n\nSo was to meet a friend for lunch yesterday and she suggested rather than fight the crowd's in town lets go to Portobello - I was fairly dubious I must be honest!!\n\nSo off on the 26 bus we went and a short time later found ourselves at the beach. We wandered around for a good hour and thoughts came to lunch. I was aware of the Espy but my chum had a very low opinion of it so I took out my ever helpful ipohne and checked my Yelp app!\n\nDalriada came up as a four star establishment and so off we went! They call their menu light bites as really it is just a selection of things more than anything else. I went for the cullen skink and my friend the soup. Being Xmas time we decided a mulled wine was also in order.\n\nSo we sat down in the bay window gazed out at the sea and awaited lunch. It was served with a basket of really nice granary bread. The cullen skink was lovely, nice potato's cooked but still with a bite and importantly lots of big chunks of haddock.\n\nThat in itself for me would have given it a four stars as a wee day out. As we finished our second glass of mulled wine some musicians arrived and setup. Before we knew it there was 8 or so of them with various instruments playing together or doing solos.\n\nThe knowledgeable locals and regulars by this point were flooding in! It was packed, a brilliant elderly couple joined us at our table and before you knew it they were our best friends! 6/7 mulled wines followed 0  the brilliant 3 hr music set came and went and Ronnie and Sheena regaled us with stories of their lives spent living in Zimbabwe -- BRILLIANT!!\n\nJust the best Sunday in a logn time!!! Great people, food, locals - I encourage you all to check it out!! I will be abck next Sunday for more of the same!!"

The meal comes with corn bread as well.  \nTotal with tax came to 23.28.    \n\nChicken was tender and tasted very fresh.  In fact it all tasted really good.

I am a sucker for a sandwich with lots of abstract foods on them.  I have tried The Student and The Professor on multiple occasions.  Every time I just wish they had a different sauce on them and more of it.  The sandwiches are dry and lacking in flavor.  If you ask them to put more sauce on (which I did after the first time), they charge you extra.  I dig the creativity but it is lacking in everything else.  \n\nThe wait is also ridiculous.  It takes almost 20 mins each time I've been there for them to make the sandwich even if there's no one else there.  Not to mention the people who work there are rude."

You would think they would invest in the esthetics of their store and the quality of their food rather than the expensive surveillance system they have. The sitting area was dirty you can tell no effort is out in their cleaning and it doesn't feel like they give one crap about the way their restaurant looks.

S"This place has gotten a new name, a paint job and some giant cards on the wall in the last year. Welcome to Aces! Yeah I know what an original name for a giant food court at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Can you feel my sarcasm?\n\nI've been eating at this place since the South Hall has opened up but I will review the new location. Not much has changed! There is still a giant salad bar in the middle at lunch time and fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal at breakfast time. Fruit costs $1.50 per piece. I know but remember were at a convention center. Salads come in large and small and you only pay for what you cram in there. A good bonus for those who know how to pack really well! The only thing the new management added is a giant rope around the whole thing which makes it even more confusing. I really hate it. There is no room to pass, so I have to wait behind indecisive people with there large bags full of literature (they will never read) on there shoulders. I really love that! Again more sarcasm!!!\n\nThe food is okay...runny eggs in the morning and overcooked burgers in the afternoon. The sandwich shop is good. There is also an Asian option and a pizza option too. The pizza slices are pretty large and greasy. I've noticed that there seems to be a new refrigerated case with some grab and go items. I think that is a great idea because the lines at lunch time are out of control.\n\nOnce you get into Aces, there is a line for every food station, so be prepared to wait. Oh yeah more ropes too. In fact they set up a switchback that was so tight I could hardly make it down. In fact, I gave up and went around and entered from the front. The people in line were laughing so hard because I made some funny comment about it. They all said that I made the right choice by going that way and they wished they had chosen my route prior to my arrival.\n\nThe food here is not great. I really try to stick to the fresh salads and fruit, at least I know I wont be bloating on 10,000+ milligrams of sodium. FYI there are not many options around. I've gone over to the hotel and the quality is a little better. Sometimes I just hop on the monorail and head towards the strip and get off at the first stop to find a better option. This place is here as a convience and you would never eat here by choice.\n\nMy rating is for the quality and choice of food. I do like the employees they always seem really good. They just keep working away trying to get you in and out but they are fighting a losing battle. So my review rating is not for them, in fact I would give the workers here 5 stars.\n\nAlso the room is really big, so you you can always find a place. I usually always end up sharing a table with others. I call European rules here...so sit with new people, share a table and make friends!!!"

S"Things kept getting worse ...\n\nMy daughter had a desire for some IHOP breakfast, so we stopped there after running several errands on a Saturday morning. With the opening Illinois football game in town, rain, and a holiday weekend, we did not know what to expect.\n\nThe restaurant was crowded but we were seated quickly. Thr waiter was pleasant. Our orders seemed simple: Belgian Waffle Combo and Ham and Egg Melt Combo. So we waited ... and waited ... and waited ... As people who ordered after us got their food it became clear that something had gone wrong. Our waiter had a pained look on his face when he saw what was going on. He came to the table and apologized for the wait. He took the Belgian Waffle Combo off our bill and gave us the bill early. Good attempt at fixing the situation, I thought. Then we waited ... and waited ... and waited ... Finally our food came. I had to ask for silverware since there had been only one set at the table. My sandwich looked lopsided -- one side much more full than the other. I attempted to rectify the situation myself only to find that my Ham and Egg Melt had no ham!\n\nI flagged down the waiter to let him know what happened. He was going to have the sandwich redone, but I said no since we had already been in there so long and the order was still not right. I asked about speaking to the manager. Our waiter went away and told us that the manager said ... get this ... that I would be charged for the price of a kid's grilled cheese sandwich! I told the waiter that I found that insulting and told him that I was not going to pay for the sandwich. He then told me (don't remember if he went back and spoke to the manager again) that he was a crew chief and he would take care of things and that I would not be charged. We finished our meal and left.\n\nThe food was unremarkable but okay. Kudos to the waiter for trying to fix things. The management response about paying for the wrong meal was laughable.\n\nWith other superior breakfast options in town, it will be a long time before I come back to this particular IHOP."

S"If you don't mind bringing it home to cook, this is the place. Freshly made when you order -- their sauce is terrific and the ingredients super fresh. It doesn't take long to prepare if you didn't call ahead. They now have a foil pan for the large and a modified recipe for preparing your pizza on the BBQ. Perfect for Vegas summers. They've also added an even thinner, thin crust pizza called the Delight. This is the first Papa Murphy's I've seen with a drive-thru. I'm a fan."

Our waitress was very friendly, but the clerk at the fish counter was impatient and not friendly. The grilled octopus is amazing, my group liked all the seafood we ordered, but the brown rice was over spiced with cumin and too salty.'

S"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh."

But this is the first time I\'ve received horrible service. \n\nI called to put in a to-go order and at first the girl who answered was nice. But she put me on hold 3 times while I was trying to place my order so I had to keep repeating it. Then she hung up on me. I called again and this time a guy answered, I told him what happened, and he apologized for it and took my order. I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Melt with no red onions. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I didn\'t, so now I know in the future to do that. When I get home my sandwich has no avocado, no tomato, but it has red onions. I get that people make mistakes but this is a pretty big mess up. I called to complain and the girl who answered said "Oh, I\'m sorry. Can I put you on hold?" No, you can\'t. \n\nDefinitely won\'t be going back to this location.'

S"having been to three christmas dinners in december already, i had my fingers crossed that my fourth and final christmas dinner would be good.  i'd had fairly good luck in terms of restaurants with only one being a bit of a let down and i'd heard good things about the Magnum so went in with moderate expectations.\n\nit was a fairly warmish day for december and on entering the restaurant me and my dinner date immediately and desperately wanted to take our coats off.  thankfully i was still in my work dress so could also take off my blazer and sit in short sleeves while my date was stuck in her xmas jumper.  i do like a place to be well heated as i suffer from being cold so the warm day and warm restaurant were just a bit unfortunate to happen at the same time.  but the place is cosy, with a proper bar area in the front and a small but well set up dining area in the back.\n\nwe were shown to our table and offered both the christmas set menu and the bar menu to choose from.  we knew we wanted the christmas menu and after much deliberation over starters (sending the waitress away twice with drink orders) we ordered.  i went with the goats cheesecake for my starter followed by the turkey with all the trimmings for my main.\n\nunlike other restaurants i'd been to (namely the one for my work xmas dinner) service was well time, with starters and mains arrived spaced out enough that we didn't feel like we were being rushed.  my goats cheesecake was simply delicious (maybe not for the non cheese lovers though) and i really enjoyed the compote (or chutney) that was dotted round the plate.  i tried a bit of the pigeon breast too which was well cooked and tasty.  we both had turkey for our mains which i have to say was one of the best turkey dinners i have had in a long time.  the turkey was tender and filled with well seasoned stuffing.  with the turkey we had a good portion of roasted brussel sprouts, chorizo, and chesnuts with a few roast tatties as well.  the portion was just the right size and i had no shame in finishing off my whole place.  the whole plate was well seasoned and delicious, the sort of food you want to eat at the festive time with providing the all necessary home comforts.  for dessert we both had the chocolate truffle cake which was nice but very rich and i left a fair bit of mine over.  the accompanying cinnamon ice cream was really nice though.\n\nfor the three course meal and a large glass of house red we each paid \xc2\xa335 which is incredibly reasonable for this time of year.  all of my other dinners have cost \xc2\xa340 upwards so i was very happy with the price for such a delicious meal :)  i will definitely be back to the Magnum for more dinners in the future!"

S'This PM franchise is owned by a nice couple from Oregon, and they clearly care about their customers.  When the wife is working, this place is the friendliest joint in town.  I have zero complaints about the service here when she\'s working.  (And the pizza is pretty darn good, too.)\n\nHer team of young ladies, however, can sometimes be a little more detached.  It\'s great that they\'re helpful, but they are inconsistent with the "Take \'N\' Bake Club" stamps (their rewards program for repeat purchases), and I have been shorted my proper stamps several times.  Mentioning this to the owner yielded no empathy, so points off for that.  I deserve my recognition for coming back and buying more pizza, thank you.\n\nTheir freshness is the key here, and what makes this chain of pizza purveyors different seems to be the quality of the ingredients.  Love the rich, robust sauce, the cheese (which is NOT greasy - yay!), and the fresh mushrooms.  Food for thought: Canned mushrooms are a punishment for those people willing to settle for crap pizza.  And we enjoy the "de-lite" selections of thin-crust pizzas when we need to dial back the carb intake.\n\nAs a side note, the other poster, Katherine, obviously didn\'t know about the Thunderbird or Union Hills locations (run by different owners), but Papa Murphy\'s\' has been around for awhile now.  \n\nBottom line: The pizza is very good, but come during the day when the owners are there.  It\'s a better experience.'

But overall, the food is absolute delicious - and if you\'re not a pretentious portuguese little twat like some people who have written terrible reviews of this restaurant for no reason, you\'ll enjoy yourself. Get the beer on tap and anything with the "home made piri piri sauce" - both are insanely delicious.\n\nOrdered the lobster rolls and the crispy calamari to start - both delicious, both moderately priced. The calamari had an interesting batter to it, not one you would usually expect but we enjoyed it much more because of that!. There were 3 lobster rolls! which is a good portion for 14$ that\'s a pretty sweet deal.... ok, the lobster wasn\'t the freshest but it was really good anyways..suggestion! should any of the owners bother to read this review: can you indicate, for the love of piri piri, the AMOUNT you are getting for every menu item please. i though it was 1 lobster roll and my boyfriend had to ask the waiter about the rib and chicken plate for servings, also we made a mistake and over-ordered on desert - annoying -\n\nMains: chicken club with fries and salad and the bf took the chicken and ribs combo. Ribs were melt-in-yo-mouth but the sauce wasn\'t great. The chicken was delicious all-around. He had 2 drumsticks and the chicken in my club was a breast - all delicious and cooked to perfect tenderness. The piri piri sauce though - WOW. Good job on that, whoever makes it, I wanted to take some home, it was SO good.\n\nAs for the desert, we got Natas. My only problem was with the waiter: we made a mistake and ordered two orders of natas, we asked him to take one order out literally 30 seconds later and he said he couldnt do it because he already punched it in. The heat from his fingertips touching the touch screen cash hadn\'t even worn off when he told us this. desert cost us 16$ and we couldn\'t finish because it was too much food. This made me particularly mad because I\'ve worked both in restaurants and retail and I know my way around a cash..you can delete an item soooo easily a caveman can do it and as for the chefs in the back...we literally asked as soon as he finished punching it in so really, there shouldn\'t have been a problem. If he was looking to add an extra menu item - he succeeded, if he was looking for tip - fat chance - that was a complete dick move but then again, I don,t expect much from Laval service staff - tips and ass on a stick for the waitresses and meat-for-brains waiters.\n\nOther than that, great time and great food!'

So we went on one of said friend's birthdays.\n\nNow I love making curry myself. Properly, not from a jar (I get my spices from Kamco on South Clerk St., you should go - the samosas there are amazing), and I like to think I'm a bit of a dab-hand at curry. So I'm rarely impressed when I go out for one. \n\nThis place just seemed to get everything wrong. First of all, we had to take out a mortgage to pay for it. Overpriced?! That's not the word.

Can't agree with this, every dish on our table was a foodie experience: bone marrow with snails, tongue, piglet tails, beef heart, la ribollita, horse steak, la raie (most probably stingray, but couldn't confirm what was exactly the yummy fish in English) were delicious and cooked with imagination. The abundant use of fresh garlic in some of the dishes was perfect to enhance the taste. Note some of the dishes in the menu change depending on the available ingredients. The dessert list is a must try, at least share something with your dining companions.\nT&C has small list of good wines with prices for every pocket. More impressive is the list of cocktails, fantastic mixes of alcohols and flavors. Some of my beloved sake concoctions arrived in tea cups.

S'La Binerie Mont Royal is a classic down home Quebec diner. Open since 1938, it gives a very quaint, old fashioned Quebec impression.  On the walls under the title "Notre pass\xc3\xa9 - Notre histoire" are snaps of Quebec through the ages.\n\nThe house specialty is beans (f\xc3\xa8ves au lard) that accompany any of the fried breakfast combos.

S'Sigh... duped again! I\'d been hankering for a good ol\' Chicago dog using Vienna beef. I was excited to try this place especially since LivingSocial had a $7 for $15 deal. We really wanted to like this place, but alas it was not to be. We sat at a table and ordered the 2 Chicago dog and fries combo ($6) and the 6" Italian beef and sausage sub ($8.95). It seemed to take forever to get our food (more than 30 minutes) even though the place was not busy. In fact, my wife pointed out that this guy, who came in and ordered AFTER us, got his take-out order at least 15 minutes BEFORE us. Finally our food arrived, but it was well below par. Both dogs, although cooked, were barely above room temperature and the buns were soggy. As for the Italian beef and sausage sub, the beef was decent but there wasn\'t very much of it. There was a good amount of sausage, but it was still pink in the center and didn\'t seem cooked through. The bun was, as my wife would say, wasted carbs. The fries were okay and nothing special. Actually, the waitress mistakenly brought us a second side order of fries. When we pointed this out, she said she realized it after the fact, but wasn\'t going to take it back. Although we generally love fries, we didn\'t feel the second bag was worth eating. When the bill came, we didn\'t appreciate being charged an extra $1.50 for sweet peppers, cheese, and giardiniera when the waitress made it sound like they were included options at no additional charge. I don\'t mind paying a little more for certain extras, but at least make it CLEAR that there is an additional charge instead of subtly slipping it onto the bill. We didn\'t have high expectations for ambiance, but walking though a smoky bar in the next room over to access the unkempt restroom was off-putting to say the least. Even if we had enjoyed the food, the prices are somewhat expensive for what you get, but it was a very poor value overall given the disappointingly sub-par quality. Hot Dog Haus and even Sonic are MUCH better alternatives. For the best value, you can\'t beat the hot dog cart at the Suncoast at 75 cents for a hot dog made with Vienna beef.'

S"Obviously you don't go to the Waffle House for healthy food, but it serves a purpose. Having lived in that long ago, Waffle House was a cash only trucker's stop filled with smoke and country music on the old juke box. Now, there is no smoking and the clientele is more diverse. \n\nThe interesting thing about Waffle House, and this location is no different, the parking lot has nearly twice as many parking spots as possible room inside. There were only about 10 tables plus the seats at the bar - and a wall of chairs serving as a waiting area. The waiting area is always full and people standing in front, in the lobby and outside. The booths not only are few in quantity, but they are small in size. In the crazy scheme to make money, you would think they would build larger restaurants - especially here in Arizona where there are only a few locations.\n\nI rarely get a waffle. WH is best known for the hash browns - scattered, smothered & covered, please. I get the Toddle Special - the ham & cheese omelet, hash browns, toast & bacon (or sausage). The chocolate milk is typically Hershey's finest and not completely stirred. Today I went with the coffee and it was fine. \n\nThere are some good things about Waffle House - the service (once seated) is fast and typically friendly. While waiting in the long line for a booth to open, the restaurant provides free coffee, which is something you don't see many places offering.  The people watching is always very exciting at a Waffle House. Last time I saw two big guys playing the role of the butt crack twins. Today it was some people looking like they just rolled out of the hotel next door.  The food is good for what it is - the omelets are fluffy and the hash browns excellent. Now it is not cash only - they do take credit cards. \n\nYou won't find a wait staff that would make a bestselling Women of Waffle House calendar, but they are efficient and friendly. One of the hardest jobs around would have to be that of a Waffle House cook. The waitresses take the order down and call it out to the cooks in their own lingo. They do not write anything down, but listen and repeat it back. Multiple waitress calling out orders to the same cook - yet the orders are always correct, at least in my experience. Give it up to the Waffle House cooks.\n\nI"

I got burgers and a raspberry tea witch sounded good honestly. The burgers where average bacon was burnt like deep fryer bacon. That wasn't the fries where cold. And the topper I started drinking the drink on the way home witch is like 5 mins even less depending on traffic stop lights sigh -- I will leave those for another story. The drink tasted good however I started noticing hard chunks of something I think maybe mix or something however you can tell there pods with a string attached normally needing to be blended longer so not to leave these is a cup. Espic a white cup that shows up. I dont have food poisoning or any of those signs. However when you see this me being from Phoenix I tend to freak out espic not knowing what I ingested, so I hope management can see this.

S"The franchise have done well to refurbish this KFC on Nicholson Street, making it look more reputable. But it doesn't take away from the fact that it's still a takeaway franchise, and one in an area that has its rougher parts.\n\nIt's a small size and does everything it says on the tin. Anytime I've been in or walked by it the queues have been moderate but dealt with quickly, so credit to the good staff.\n\nUnfortunately, the people who populate this area at night have also tainted my opinion on this KFC. It's nothing to do with the restaurant - if it has the Zinger meal I'm there and front of the line - but I am put off eating in here by the morons who vandalise it. I feel terrible saying that because it's not the restaurant's fault in the slightest, but the massive window that has been smashed and panned in has been that way for at least a week, and it makes me wonder at what intimidating customers hang out around here. The clientele have thoughtlessly cheapened the restaurant for me, and even though I will stress once again that it's nothing to do with KFC, it would still cause me to avoid eating in here. Yes, crime happens everywhere and I'm not a snob in any way, I just don't fancy my chances against intimidating groups of people who have nothing better to do than abuse others.\n\nGood for a takeout and kept as clean as they can, but sadly they are going to have to get bouncers on the door to get rid of the drongo's. Damaging someone's property is not big nor is it clever, but as much as I would try and see beyond the window it's very obvious that it's a sign of social deprivation, and not modern art."

S'We were at Gene Autry baseball fields for a morning game that lasted until 1pm and then we just had to get something to eat before heading back to Scottsdale. \n\nOne of the guys had mentioned seeing this place, and it seemed like a perfect spot for a bunch of smelly ball players after a hot winning game. There were about 13 of us and we ventured on in. The restaurant was clean and the perfect sport bar/restaurant. Tons of tvs and very friendly staff. They pulled together four tables for us and got us started on drinks a computer game for playing trivia. \n\nOur waitress, meigken (not sure on the spelling, but the pronunciation was MIKEN) was very friendly and outgoing. She had enough spunk and quick retorts for even our best smart a*& in the bunch. It was great! We all got our drink orders and proceeded to place our food orders. They had some specials with pulled pork slammers, some good looking appetizers, wings, ribs, wraps, lots of choices. \n\nSeveral of the guys ordered the slammers, and I ordered a naked tenders wrap with honey mustard. Our first attempt at the trivia was pittiful until a bunch of the guys began noticing what was going on. More brains are better, I have decided. Our meals showed up and we all started eating. The pulled pork slammers were delicious. The sauce on the pulled pork was great, just what I like. My naked tender wrap was light, but tasty. I did put some medium wing sauce on there to spice it up a bit. I like spicy and the medium was right up my alley. \n\nEveryone seemed to enjoy their food. No real complaints to speak of. The service was excellent. All 13 orders showed up as ordered and the boys were content with their lunch. Who knows if it would have been different with a loss on the field, but I think the place got good remarks all around. All bellies content and it was back to all of our respective resorts/condos for a nap.'

Everything is fried in the LJS batter including the onion rings, which made them a little too salty for my taste. Service is fast here and my order was ready before I could finish filling up my drink. Only real downside was that a hobo walked in while I was there, asked for a drink cup and sat down mumbling to himself and sleeping at a booth...not sure why this was tolerated by the staff or allowed."

S"Especially now that Kipp's Soul Food has closed, Doug's Soul Food really is *the* place for soul food in Madison.  But you don't just need to come here because it is the only place for down home Southern cooking in Madison--you can come here knowing that it really is a great dining experience (I would argue better than Kipp's)!\n\nWhile not all of the side dishes that Doug's offers are spectacular, many of them are quite good (the hush puppies, for sure, and also the collard greens), and the fried chicken is truly to die for.  It is some of the most well seasoned, perfectly cooked fried chicken I've ever had.  For my birthday this year, I ordered a big batch of it to go.  Not only was it delicious, but Doug and Jamie (the owners) were incredibly nice and helpful, and even gave me a discount for my large order!  Along with the delicious food, they make Doug's Soul Food a worthwhile experience.\n\nAs for the ambiance of the restaurant, well, it's true that the decor is rather spartan.  But to me, that's part of the place's charm.  It reminds me of other small, family-owned businesses that I love that might not have a huge decorating budget or design aesthetic, but know how to treat you right and feed you well.  But if you don't want to eat there, by all means, get it to go!  I'd advise calling in your order about 20 minutes in advance, as the chicken and ribs are made to order.  \n\nKeep Doug's in business!  Eat there soon!  (And let me know what you think of the ribs--I haven't tried them yet.)"

S'Unfortunately, I will be sticking with my own policy of "Good Reviews require two visits, NOT so good Reviews require only one."\n\nI wish I could say something wonderful about this new concept restaurant, other than the fact that it was cute, clean and the staff (two people) were very friendly, but the good comments stop there.\n\nI opted for the Grilled Cheese with tomatoes and bacon (at the Proprietors suggestion) on Sour Dough Bread. Now I love Grilled Cheese, almost with anything on it, so this concept was right up my alley. Price on the menu was a little high for what it was ($7.65 with tax), but if it was fabulous - NO PROBLEM, I would be a loyal Customer!\n\nThe Grilled Cheese was plain and only okay. The magic ingredient to me in most Great Grilled Cheese Sandwiches is - BUTTER. Some recipes and friends put it inside the sandwich as well as on the outside to grill it. I guess "With Butter It Is Better" is true. I have had low quality cheese on Wonder Bread that was made to taste fabulous with a hot griddle and BUTTER. My youngest daughter started making them when she was little and hers\' were and are to this day, quite wonderful!\n\nOh for that to be the case here. I believe the ingredients were/are top quality with Tilamahook Cheeses and Boar\'s Head Brand meats and cheeses being advertised and served. The finished Grilled Cheese was dry and in spite of the bacon, almost tasteless. Nice quantity of well melted cheese, but the bread added nothing and the tomato was equally tasteless. All in all, NOT even a good, never mind great grilled cheese sandwich. A major disappointment! Served with some nice crisp potato chips, I probably wouldn\'t have finished the sandwich if I had breakfast this day, it was that unappetizing. \n\nI had hoped to be blown away and forced to make the 14 mile trip (one way) from my home often, but I won\'t be going back.'

S"Shezan's browser logo is the first letter of their name which in their customized font and hue resembles a coiling mountain of excrement towering like Babel crowned with a thin streak which could be mistaken for the gaseous side-effect of such a discharge.       \nNow that's out of the way, Shezan is one amazing restaurant.  \nThat's Shezan, not Shazan, which I originally thought, or Shazam, which I so desperately wanted.  \nWe (including girlfriend) had tickets to the evening show of Gravity at the theater up the street (immediately dating this review).  Gravity is awesome, see it or buy it, 'nuf said...going off topic.  We both felt incredibly lucky to find Shezan--well, my girlfriend already knew about it; I just let myself by guided, which is...OK.  \nShezan claims to be an Indian restaurant but it may be too trendy to be one.  It's a colossal bistro with intentionally mismatched white and black chairs divided among polished wooden tables spaced generously but seemingly chaotically about the floor.  Huge photos plastered on the walls offer the impression that I should be trying on a pair of designer Armani slacks.  There's actually glitter on the walls, that's how flashy this place is.  It didn't look cheap.  I didn't see a buffet anywhere; in fact, I couldn't see a single hallmark of Indo-Canadian cuisine.  The menu confirmed those suspicions, offering numerous items seldom seen in Western restaurants.  The biggest surprises were the prices.  They weren't expensive.  Even taking conversion into account, I'd say Shezan was downright reasonable.  They even offered a three course pre-theater menu for 17.50, or about $30 Canadian, and with that you get a lot of food.  \nI know I'm losing your interest.  I should be nitpicking or exasperating a minor quibble into a huge crisis.  I'll soon mention the food, which will convince most people in the area to try out Shezan if they haven't already.  I could carp on their portion sizes being perhaps a tad TOO generous, but what kind of criticism is that?  \nWe opened our meal with a poppadom and pickle tray and followed that with butter chicken and chicken biryani, the latter a virtual unknown dish in Canada.  We also ordered a peshwari nan which is a naan bread made with coconut milk.  I thought I had good naan, but peshwari makes previous naan feel like that slightly depressing opening act before the Blue Man Group takes the stage.  (I'm sorry, that's the only band I've ever seen in person on stage.)  \nHowever, the portions were so large we were both unable to completely finish our plates, precluding the opportunity to take in a dessert, which we both badly wanted to try.  Not for any unique Indian dish mind you, but rather for a couple scoops of moevenpick ice cream.  It was winter and I didn't care; I wanted ice cream.  My girlfriend and I made guesses about what the other would order.  I would have tried the white chocolate and caramelita, though the pistachio and maple walnut looked pretty good to.  Unfortunately we didn't order any of them, an issue worthy of mention again.  I appreciate the desire to make us satisfied but it looks like more and more restaurants are perhaps making us TOO satisfied, preventing us from making it three courses instead of two.  I'm just saying I would have paid for ice cream if the meal portions were a tad smaller.  \nI know, I'm waiting to be tarred and feathered by a mob of overweight Americans who would then promptly try to devour me for looking like oversized chicken in a black polyester longcoat.  And I do acknowledge my reaction upon discovering the 12-inch poppadom, a stretch of starch eclipsed by the naan which followed.  I was overjoyed by such generosity.  The final bill came to a few pence over 30 pounds, making it cheaper for two people than an average under-posh meal in my home town.  \nA final word, once again I paid with a card and once again there was no tip option.  Since I had no cash on hand, I couldn't drop down a few bills for the exceptional service provided.  I felt like crap afterwards.  They totally deserved gratuity.  At least I could repay them this way, by recommending Shezan whole heartedly.  Just try to ignore what the first letter of their name resembles and you'd do fine.  I should run a list of restaurant which I would frequent IF I lived in Edinburgh.  Shezan would be near the top of a very short list.\n\nDECOR:  8\nPLATING: 8\nSERVICE:  8\nFOOD:  9\nVALUE:  10\n\nOVERALL:  8.6 out of 10"

S'I really wanted to be impressed by this place.  I wanted the food to be as advertised and reminiscent of food at seafood places and crabshacks in places like Charleston and Wrightsville Beach.  It did not come close to meeting that mark.\n\nFirst, the atmosphere is definitely as beachy as it can be a in a neighborhood like Dilworth.  The roof is a nice place to sit on a comfortable fall day.  The service was also very good from the almost completely female staff.\n\nWe started out with she crab soup, a rarity inland.  It was more of a bisque with too much crabmeat and also a piece of a shell.  It was okay, but definitely not what I have gotten from any place at the beach - and I also have never had a shell in my she crab soup.\n\nThe menu is also a little limited, although they have "chalkboard specials" such as flounder.  The seafood platters are severely lacking, and the menu seems to offer more of a southwest twist on seafood than anything else.  Homemade guacamole is not a staple of the beach.  The blackened mahi mahi tacos were ok, but the fish lacked seasoning and there was not enough of the fish.  The Mexican coleslaw was probably the highlight.  The beans and rice were okay but the beans tasted like they were from a can.  The coconut shrimp (an appetizer) were okay, but slightly over-fried.\n\nI  would patronize this place again if they made their menu look a little more like this:\n\nhttp://www.hymanseafood.com/files/file/Hymans_Seafood_Menu.pdf\n\nI know Hyman\'s is not the best seafood in Chucktown, but I am using the menu as an example.  A place just cannot advertise itself as seafood and a beach restaurant but highlight tacos and guac more than anything else and expect to survive - especially not in this revolving restaurant.'

Steamed hot-dogs with yummy coleslaw, tasty hot fries & basic mouth watering poutine is all they offer which all they really need to offer. You can stand by the window to eat there or do take-out. 2-3 picnic tables are by the diner in their parking lot or preferably in the summer months order take out & walk west on Fleury one or two blocks to the nearby park & dine on a nice sunny day.'

S"I went here for dinner a few nights ago with my wife and a friend.  It was a Wednesday night at about 8pm.  The place was dead.  All 15 or so tables were empty.  WTF.  We were there for over an hour and only like 3 people wandered in during our meal to pickup food and that was it.  I have no idea how this place stays in business.  Especially since it has been there for forever.\n\nAnyway, our waiter was very good/quick/friendly but I could tell he really didn't understand why we were there.  I'm guessing that the place is primarily a lunch place and a takeout place.  He got our orders right and my diet cokes were quickly refilled.\n\nTo start we ordered a bottle of wine.  We could tell from the waiter's reaction that this does not happen often.  All the bottles were like 20ish dollars so what the heck.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\n* House Salad = very good\n* Chicken Parm = good, big\n* Pizza = unexpectedly very good.  We ordered the white pizza with ricotta cheese..  I asked and our waiter said it was made fresh which was surprising.\n* Greek Salad = I didn't try this but it looked pretty good.  Not sure why but the waiter asked what kind of dressing they wanted on it.  I thought all Greek salads came with basically the same dressing.  Oh well....Italian dressing it is.\n\nI really don't want to knock a little local establishment.  The place is just ok.  Our waiter was good, the food was good, and the price was good.  It is one of the last places within walking distance of my house that I hadn't tried yet and I can now cross if off my list.  It wasn't horrible so of course I would go back but I certainly won't rush back."

S'First time here for a friend\'s birthday and I have to say this was a fun, delicious Italian experience. We were in the side room, which worked out perfect for 20ish people in the group and food was served buffet style. \n\nThe first impression was with the bread and oil which seemed to be borderline salad dressing with the amount of herbs in it, but nonetheless it was delicious. \n\nThe antipasto salad came in a huge plate which was devoured almost immediately and for the main course the lasagna was a simple recipe, "straight up" pasta, sauce and cheese. No frills here and worth it. \n\nThe did seem to be a bit slow with the service on water/drinks but nothing to be too concerned about, probably standard for larger groups.'

Then, at 10.30pm, just as we were finishing our drinks, they turned the music off and turned on the lights - it was a strange way to basically kick us out, even though we had paid and were about to leave! 45 mins-an hour for dinner is not overly lengthy - if they didn't want to stay open, they could have simply said when we walked in the door."

I love breakfast foods and usually Vegas is the only place that I actually eat brunch or breakfast dishes.  Having woken up late and just about missing the lunch hour as well, I was hoping to still be able to order breakfast.  Since I always crave for omelettes I was sad to see that I was late for their breakfast dishes.  However, luckily, I asked the server and they were still serving omelettes.  There were maybe about 3 breakfast entrees on their breakfast list that they still served.  If you wanted the smoked salmon, you were outta luck.  \n\nMy omelette was light and delicious, served with hash browns and toast.  Pretty standard  but nothing too special.  Service was really kind and helpful.  The coffee wasn't too good, but it was okay.  That was another downfall, but other than that, it's a pretty decent place to eat.  Hey, anything tastes good when you're hungover or starving."

The smell of the fresh dough perfumes the place as you blast back to that era where your feet doesn't touch the floor and the heat from the pizza oven warm your cold bones on a winter after noon ..  \n\nAfter a session with my  Love &  Cheech and Chong we found ourselves drooling over the menu realizing that a few hours had passed and 13 glasses of water... we were finally ready to order \n\nNow I hate to brag, but i am self proclaimed an aficionado of burgers and i will say that Miss Jean Talon makes the best Hands Down Burger All of Quebec ...

Amazing.\n\nTheir other standout is the Biryani, a thing of beauty to behold and to taste.\nI have taken 2 friends that used to eat the same dish cheaper at Saana across the street and they never went back to Saana.\nThe fish Pakora is incredible, the fish moist and fresh and the seasoning just rightly delicate.\n\nI have been eating here since they opened about 12-13 years ago and have had EVERY single item on their menu, the only things i don\'t like is their curry ( too much tamarind) "chicken and cheese curry" (pieces are small) and spinach dishes ( not my style ). \n\nThere is better Naan bread out there too, it\'s just a 3.5 out of 5 so not a huge deal\n\nThey recently moved to a larger restaurant about a block away, butt their prices are still decent, it would be nice if they renovated a bit. \n\nI take it to go 9 times out of 10, but the atmosphere and decor will leave some cold.\n\nMalhi Sweet and Dera on Jarry have really stepped it up in that aspect, and the places on Jean-Talon have done some major renovations as well.\n\nI still give it 5 stars,as those issues are very minor to me and it is an improvement over the old place.'

I walked up to the counter and tried to decide what I wanted. After long decision, I ordered the chicken roll ups and a burrito for 6.65. I ate the roll ups and they were beyond dry. I could of dipped them in water and could of been still thirsty. They had a little sauce station which I grabbed some sauces but that didn't help. The burrito was at least juicy but it was over packed with chicken. Apparently it had bell peppers and onions but all it was dryish chicken. The plus was it was authentic food. The walls were all painted different colors and none had an outlet so that was a negative. With it being 24/7, it would probably be better if I was drunk."

S'I debated on whether to give this a one star or a two star. I\'m going with a two because I didn\'t get up and leave in the middle of my meal (but, I kinda wanted to!). \n\nI was pretty excited to see a coupon for this new restaurant show up in my mailbox, even though they weren\'t open yet. I\'m all for a mom & pop authentic NY Italian restaurant opening up within reasonable distance of where I live. The fact that there isn\'t a decent one already is mind blowing. It\'s disappointing that there still ISN"T a decent one! \n\nMy first experience was take-out. I ordered fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken and broccoli. I asked if it came with bread, and they said yes (I\'m a big fan of crusty Italian bread). I got home and can almost without a doubt confirm what a previous reviewer\'s suspicions were: they buy their sauce. If they don\'t, they need a new recipe, or a new cook, or better quality control. It was pasty and flavorless. My chicken was definitely not grilled, and the broccoli might have been steamed for all of 30 seconds. The bread it came with was a .5 inch slice of whatever they use for their hero\'s & sub\'s. Not heated, just wrapped in foil and kinda mushed up. \n\nThis first experience was just a few days after their opening, so I\'m inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. I figured the REALLY lame wall decor (suggesting they use a sauce purveyor) was a temporary thing. I mean, the whole family was in there late at night, dad behind the counter, all the kids folding boxes, you can tell it\'s a family affair, and one that means a great deal to the owners. So I gave it another shot. \n\nThis visit came well over a month into their existence. I visited during lunch hour, and it was dead, which isn\'t a great sign. Same cheesy decor. A young woman (girl, actually), was working behind the register, and the music piped into the restaurant was definitely her selection. I had to sit through the entire lunch listening to really really crappy teenage girl music. Not ok. \n\nWe ordered sausage parmigiana subs and fries and sat down. It took a LOOONG time for the food to come out. Over 20 minutes. The only other customer had a slice of pizza, so it\'s not like they were slammed, plus they had 2 guys working the back. Our subs show up and after the first bite I knew it was all wrong. The sausage used was the shipped-frozen, pellet sized balls thrown on pizza. I really, honestly, couldn\'t believe it. What kind of restaurant can call itself an "authentic New York Italian Restaurant" and send out a sausage parmesan sub with little meat pellets? I could have gotten better at Subway, and I absolutely despise Subway. The flavor was relatively non-existent, the bread was blah, the consistency sucked. There\'s really nothing good I have to say. \n\nI will not be giving Mamma Theresa\'s the "3 strikes" courtesy. 2 strikes is really all they deserve. It\'s a shame too. I can\'t see them lasting until the fall at this rate!'

After going to 2 different restaurants that served menudo on the weekends and both of them being out, I found El Taco de Chandler!\n\nEven though I was convinced that I actually did cross the border somehow and winded up in Mexico, I actually kind of wanted it that way! BRIGHT building on the outside with people riding their bikes/lurking around the parking lot, but hey!, why not?\n\nThey serve good old mexican cuisine! Even that grilled whole fish (not sure what it's called, but it's creepy looking and delicious) and of course, my beloved menudo! The seafood selection is pretty big and the girls who work there are really sweet. It's obviously one of those neighborhood hangouts, as they seemed to know everyone who walked in the door by name. \n\nThe tortillas were clearly homemade and the menudo was fantastic! The best part is that they serve it all week long, not just Saturdays and Sundays. It might look shady from the outside... and inside actually... but trust me, it's good! It's either go to a modern-looking restaurant to get americanized mexican food or go here and get the real thing, your choice.\n\nI'd like to go back and try their other entrees, too. They all looked good and what I saw other people ordering smelled/looked delicious. If they could get menudo SO right, I have a feeling that everything else is just as good.\n\nOh, and they serve beer. :)"

As a business traveller I eat alone a lot and this lends itself to eaves droping. I don't make a point of it, but in a place as small as this it was impossible not to. One of the conversations was a late forty guy with a grey shag explaining a situation where Jackie Chan couldn't remember his lines and what a bad actor he was to an Asian woman that just ate and looked beyond him.  Another table was three rather loud late 20 early 30 something women talking about back in the day. Now I am 57 and I don't say things like that cause my parents are in there 90s an I figure I am just now living those back in the day times. So unless you like listening to others conversations and a limited variety you should pass."

S'I have really enjoyed coming here int he past, however I doubt I will be returning after my last experience. \n\nWhen it came to paying for our meals, their machine was shutting down, and when I went to pass my card twice, it said it wasn\'t approved. I asked the lady the reason as to what was wrong, and she said she had no idea but that I had to pay, and that I should just use another card. Uncaring as to why the machine was not working, and a little curt, but nonetheless I complied and paid in cash.\n\nOnce I asked for the change back (I tip the amount with the change leftover, and always ask for it back, even though I do plan on leaving a tip), she asked if I wanted the full amount. I have to admit I was already in a tempered mood due to our previous encounter, but I still believe this to be rude. I asked for the full amount, and she said ok. They she took a look at the bill and stated that if she gave back more than $4.00 it would be less than 15%. I nodded and agreed and stated that is till wanted the full change back. She once again asked if I wanted the full change, and I felt it mandatory to tell he that I did plan on leaving a tip, but I wanted all the change back. \n\nOnce she returned, and after a rather long wait (I find it is always the case with Kanda in regards to returning your change), I had only $4.00 change, meaning they would get their 15%. I told her I would like all fo the change back, and questioned me once again. We cleared it up, and five minutes later I finally had my change. \n\nTo say the least, I left with all the money int he end, because I was shocked at the nerve she had for questioning me on the amount of tip I was leaving, even before I had the money back. \n\nI have investigated over "all you can eat" sushi restaurants, and have found that Sushi St-Jean is on their way, though there are still some bumps in the road.'

S'Go there... Go there now...\n\nOn Queen Mary Rd. just east of the Snowdon metro station is perhaps the best sushi place EVER. Okay, there may be better SOMEWHERE, but i have been trying really hard to find it (using guidebooks in other cities and friends\' recommendations) to no avail.\n\nThe 7 Dragon specialty roll is perhaps my favourite - crispy yellow rice paper outside, crunchy tempura inside - and the BEST sauce. Did i mention that each specialty roll comes with its own unique sauce?\n\nI never get the salad at a sushi place - all too often it is a little bit of iceberg lettuce covered in some sugary, thick salad dressing - it makes my skin crawl. The waitress - on what is now my sixth visit to Queen Sushi - convinced me to try their seaweed-cucumber salad. YUMMY!\n\nI can also recommend the Oh My God roll - a hint of strawberry at the very end of each bite. Scrumptious. For sushi - it isn\'t cheap, BUT well worth it as two people and two rolls makes for the need for a long walk.\n\nBut be warned, as my gentleman companion complained last night: "You\'ve ruined the cheap avocado rolls i buy for lunch at the Sushi shop. I\'ll never enjoy them again." That\'s me - raising people\'s foods standards one person at a time.'

Patty was quite obviously just smashed beans. Didn't really stick together well. Reminded me of the quintessential lunch lady and her ominous spoonful of mystery sludge. What a mess.\n\nI guess it goes without saying, and I feel kind of foolish for having to clarify... but do not come here for lunch. Period.\n\nSaving grace is their fries.

Gives me some hope that their bar/night scene isn't a complete trainwreck."

S"For a few years they've been really good on their delivery, but I'm getting tired of their lack of customer consideration.\n\nNobody ever answers the phone like they want, or care about, your business.  They sound bored and uninterested.  But the food is usually good and delivery is usually pretty quick.  However, they never tell you on the phone when to expect your food or even how much it's going to be.  All the other places we call for delivery are considerate enough to let you know when to expect your food and how much to expect to pay.\n\nRecently we ordered some delivery --- I asked when I should expect the food and I was told 45 minutes.  An hour later I called to get an update --- it had been raining all day and the guy who took my order seemed really unsure about how to spell my street name, even though they've been here several times before.  I was told they were busy and the delivery should be here in fifteen minutes.\n\nTwenty minutes after that call, I called back to see what's going on.  If they're lost, they're lost, you know?  Maybe I can help get the guy here.  I'm told that they're busy and it's been raining, so..... you know?  No, I don't know.  I know it was raining when I placed the order, so if you're that busy, then tell me it's going to be an hour and not 45 minutes.  If your guy is lost, then tell me, or call me and let me know he's lost.  My family is waiting an hour and 20 minutes at this point.\n\nAt this point it doesn't make sense for them to even show up.  It's embarrassing for them to even walk up to my door with, what I presume, is going to be cold food.  If they made my food an hour ago, then it's been in this guy's car since then and I don't want it.  Or did they make it an hour ago?  Did they lose my order and not tell me?  Has the delivery guy been out delivering this whole time and he's just hopelessly behind on deliveries?  I decided to wait to see when --- IF --- he would show up.\n\nWe made a pizza.\n\nTwo hours and ten minutes after the initial order there is a ring at the door.  And then the guy just starts leaning on the door bell.  I barely have time to get up from the table and walk down the hall and he's rung the bell five or six times.  Yeah, that's annoying --- you're the guy who's over an hour late and now you're being just being a jerk. \n\nI opened the door with a slice of pizza in my hand.  He tried to hand me my food while telling me how much it's going to be.... wait, where have you been?  We made pizza!  Is the food even warm?  Yes, it's fresh and warm ... so when did you make it?  An hour ago?  Two hours ago?  Twenty minutes ago?  He doesn't know.  Did you get lost?  No? Well we're only five miles from the restaurant --- where have you been?  I didn't get any good answers --- not even an apology.  But I did get a steep, steep discount on my (somewhat) warm food.\n\nIf you had to wait two hours for your food to come out in the restaurant, what would you do?  Wait ... what do you mean you wouldn't wait two hours for your food to come out in a restaurant?  You'd want an apology or some kind of feasible explanation, wouldn't you?  I got neither of those things.  \n\nWhat almost certainly happened is the order was lost or sent to someone else ----- so it had to be made again.  That's fine with me because I want fresh food, but don't try to BS me in some lame fashion about the weather or something else.  Be straight with me so I can make dinner plans ---- start playing games with me and I'll start looking at other options and then I'll come on Yelp and tell everyone what a lame business you run."

Then, as I bit into the pepperoncini that was included, I found (to my horror) what looked like a dead caterpillar or maggot inside! (and yes, I took a lot of pictures for anyone who would like to identify what type of bug it truly is) I quickly called them to tell them to get rid of the whole batch so other customers wouldn't experience the same problem.  They apologized and offered me a free pizza, but I highly doubt I would ever return to even consider their offer."

S'Brought to you by the contractors that run the dining hall and Starbucks on the ASU downtown campus, Aramark.  Apparently they are also open until 1am 6 days a week too....hummm.....\n\nStopping in on my way home from work hoping to find some veggies.  On first glance through the place I was excited, thinking, "cool my own salad bar near home." Then as I  took a closer look...the quality of said veggies, well that was another story.\n\nThe employees probably never eat salad or veggies by the look of the dry wilted zucchini, cucumbers, celery, carrots, bok choy...\nTo their credit the main piles of spinach, romaine and mixed greens were fresh.  The side salads looked like they had been sitting out all day as did the dressings.  \nEither cover the items, take the time to stir the salads/dressings, or put out less and replenish frequently.  All of this could be resolved with a swift kick to the ass of some obviously lazy employees. \n\nI wanted to take my salad to go and they charge by weight but I was not given a to go container.   I was told to use a plate, put it all together and then I had to dump it in to a container after it was weighed.  HUH?!  \n\nThese plates are huge and plastic, and I doubt that they tare out the weight of the plate.  I didn\'t get a whole lot of salad considering the quality of the toppings and it came to $9.  WTF?! I can get the whole kit and caboodle at Souper Salad or even Sweet Tomato for that price (or less).  I rarely even pay that price at Whole Foods when carrying out a salad there.  \n\nNo wonder this place was empty....\n\nI wish this place was better....'

Soft, mild tofu and tender, chewy intestine were smothered in a bright red sauce of (I think) chili, sichuan pepper, garlic, and chili oil and topped with bright fresh cilantro and bits of peanut.

S'I\'ve often said that if I was forced to eat food only from one part of the world for the rest of my life, there wouldn\'t be any hesitation: Mexican is how I\'d roll. My favorite food, Beer and Shot are all Mexican, so whatever genie or cult leader was inexplicably forcing me into this strange dietary restriction wouldn\'t hear any complaining from this guy. So when a group of us were in search of food walking through downtown Montreal, and nobody expressed a clear preference, my mind went into Robocop vision, silently but vigilantly scanning every storefront for signs of tasty Mexican eateries.\n\nSoon we came across the colorfully painted "Taqueria Mex". The food was Mexican, the menu was Bilingual and the logo sported some colorful birdies. I was off to the races, pleading a case for this as our lunch spot.\n\nOne odd thing was, there were tables and we were given menus, but no waiters or waitresses. We think this fact may have been explained to us, but as none of us in the group speak french, there were several minutes of waiting for a waitress that never came, before approaching the counter to order and take our food back to our table.\n\nAt that point, I was pretty hungry, so I actually opted for 2 entrees, each coming with a side that I shared with the rest of my table, as to not be a complete fatass. I went with the Chicken Burrito Grande, and a steak taco (nachos and rice for the sides). The Chicken Burrito Grande was tasty, but the way it was assembled lended to more of a knife-and-fork style than a standard eat-with-your-hands style I\'m accustomed to. \n\nThe Steak Taco wasn\'t as good. As someone who grew up loving Taco Bell\'s 99 cent tacos, at a hefty $4+ dollars for a single Taqueria Mex Taco, that taco better come correct. I should savor every bite, I should be taken aback by the magnificent flavors, that taco should be giving my taste buds handjobs for over $4 per. Sadly, it was just another blandish Taco, topped with Tomato (ack!) and Avocado. One thing it had going for it though, was an interesting innovation in cheese technology. Instead of sprinkling shredded cheese atop the taco as a topping, the cheese was introduced by being melted between 2 tortillas like a small grilled cheese sandwich. Pretty sweet, actually. However it wasn\'t enough to save me from feeling ripped off.\n\nTopped off with a couple of Coronas and a trip to their Salsa Bar (featuring 5 different salsas, as well as other toppings and spices) made it quite a nice meal, albeit a little pricey.'

Today I saw it outside as I went to work and it made my day!  It is right in front of St. Paul's on Library Mall.\n\nI've tried both the curry tofu and the oseng tahu (candlenut tofu) and both were fantastic!  They were both served with a vegetable mix and then spooned with extra sauce over a bed of fluffy, perfectly cooked rice.  I would say probably a 3:1 or 3:2 tofu to vegetable ratio.\n-The curry tofu was coconut-based and very mild, sweet, and mellow.  A large pinch of toasted coconut added some texture and heightened the complexity just a touch more. \n-Of the two tofus, though, I prefer the oseng tahu.  It is a dish that has a bit more bite - not spicy, but that I think it strikes a less sweet note and more of an earthy one.\n\nI've never personally tried any of the other dishes, but I've heard great things about the Ayam bakar, which is barbequed chicken breast in a peanut sauce.\n\nNOTE: Be sure to take advantage of the condiments next to the forks!  The hot sauce is great if you enjoy your food spicier and the sweet soy-based one is also delicious and would likely be a great accompaniment to the dishes with a thicker-looking peanut sauce to thin it out.\n\nAll the entrees come with acar, which is a lightly picked vegetable salad, and krupuk, which are crunchy tapioca puffs.  Both are very tasty and add a refreshing crunch.  Personally, I like to pile my extra rice and sauce on the the krupuk when I am done with my tofu.  \n\nThe owner is super friendly,  clearly there are several vegan options, everything seems to be gluten-free.  I am *racking* my brain and I cannot think of a single reason to not send ALL of you here.  Seriously, just go.  You won't regret it!"

S'Ah Bishoku, the jewel of Montreal when it comes to Sushi. It is tough place to find but I swear to you once you have eaten there once, you are hooked. The fish is fresh and cut oh so perfectly. The rolls are expertly done and reminds of the the sushi I had in Japan. If you love sushi do yourself a favor, eat at Bishoku.'

S"Last weekend, Digestif. This weekend, Lyte. Scottsdale establishments seem to be having a hard time lately deciding exactly what they are.\n\nThe location of Lyte is good, as it way from the main Scottsdale scene.  Plus it is next to Crown Room, so you can go to two places in one night.  Lyte is a good place for socializing as there are some large tables with couches, a large open floor, and a smaller area with tables and chairs seperated from the rest of the place by a curtain.  Other than that, I have no idea what Lyte is actually going for. There was a jazz band that was playing for most of the time we were there and then it switched to house music. The couches were black and white and gave me the impression that Lyte was trying to go for an upscale mod vibe, but then they had a TV with a Wii that you could play. There was an artist painting in the corner where there were graffiti covered walls and there were paintings of Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn for sale.  To top it all off, there were belly dancers with swords and fire.  I'm not sure if Lyte is trying to be a lounge, an art gallery, or a performance space. \n\nOne of the passed appetizers was delicious...it was the one with chicken on a tortilla chip with hummus perhaps. The other appetizer I tried was either chicken or turkey on a stick with a rosemary and sage rub, which was good but not excellent.  The staff at Lyte was good, starting with the friendly bouncer at the door and continuing with the nice waitresses who came around with the appetizers, albeit I don't think at times they knew 100% what they were serving.\n\nI will give Lyte another chance another night, but it's not on the top of my places to hit up the next time I am in Scottsdale."

S'This was only the second time I\'ve been here. Both times were during the lunch hour. \n\nTinoco\'s is a tiny little restaurant. I love the intimacy of it. The piping and ventilation that jut out of the walls give it character, as my friend would say. That and the tables shaped like giant paint palettes and the menus with the paint brush and clear acrylic medium varnish all go with the whole shabby chic art thing they got going on. But I don\'t really like the cramped quarters. \n\nTinoco\'s in one of those places where I can ponder over the menu for a long time and not know what to get because it all looks good. \n\nOur waiter was really helpful. At first when we asked him what items he liked best, he said, "Its all good." Not helping. But then he started listing off all of the items he liked. Which was like, half the menu. He also told us the specials. Convinced me to get the special of the day: orange roughy and halibut in a lobster sauce over spinach and mashed potatoes ($21). Mm mm. So good, make me wanna slap yo\' mama. \n\nSome of the other things he recommended were the Lobster Ravioli ($14), Nicoise salad, Capelinni Checca ($10), and the Cilantro Jalapeno shrimp ($14). They all sounded good. And I totally could\'ve justified ordering more than one entree. They serve a lot of fish dishes. Salmon, orange roughy, mahi mahi, and more salmon. All of their pastas look really good. I almost got the Al Vodka ($14) because al vodka is always good. \n\nMy friend got the "Lighty Cajun" Salmon salmon salad ($13; sic on the quotes, I\'m not a grammartard) which she really liked. \n\nWe both loved the bread, too. Sometimes the bread can be the deal breaker. In this case, the bread was a great way to kick off the meal and leave our mouths watering for more. It wasn\'t hard bread. My friend even asked for extra bread to take home after the meal. The waiter gave her SIX hunks of delicious bread. \n\nI totally could\'ve taken leftovers home, but I horked it all down. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino'

S"I know exactly zilch about African cuisine.\n\nI don't mean North African, like Moroccan and Tunisian  of which we have plenty in Montreal.\nI mean equatorial Africa. Cuisines of countries like Congo, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Senegal or Ivory Coast. I admit my ignorance completely on the foods of that part of the world.\n\nBut now, I don't have an excuse anymore. Gracia Afrika sits on a stretch of Notre-Dame street which is rapidly undergoing gentrification. Within walking distance of both Lionel-Groulx and St.Henri metro stations, it's a great place to stop off for dinner right after work. With simmered stew and curry-like dishes, if you like Indian food, it's not a hard stretch to appreciate Gracia Afrika either.\n\nWith dishes like Mwambe, a simmered chicken in peanut sauce dish or dishes  like spicy catfish cooked in banana leaves, the food is spicy, but not hot, extremely flavorful and satisfying in a home-cooked meal kind of way. It's also BYOB. Ingredients like coconut milk, plantains, rice, beans, goat and lamb all are featured prominently.\n\nWe came in last night and were instantly welcomed warmly by owner and cook Bibi Ntumna. Articles which have featured the restaurant are all on display on the wall. Bibi has also cooked for the likes of former Governor General Michaelle Jean, introducing African food to the folks in government.\n\nSo if you want to get to know what African food is like, make a stop here. I'll be going back."

I decided to give it a shot and parked in the parking garage.  As I walked in I was REALLY taken with the amazing landscaping/fountains/hidden conversation spots all around the outside of the building.  I wanted to get a job in the building so I could eat my lunch outside there every day.  So I walked into the building and... nothing.  No signs of Dagwood's.  Then I realized that right in front of me was an area w/ small tables, a sofa and some nice sitting chairs facing a tv.  I had to ask someone when they walked out if that was Dagwood's.  It was.  So I walked in and went to the side to find that the entrance for Dagwood's is officially at the back of the building - but even there I couldn't find a sign.  \n\nA really amazing selection of sandwiches.  They had SO many options.  And they do breakfast - gotta love that.  The sandwich was good and all, but my favorite part was walking outside to eat (I love Phoenix! - My first time here was November and I've eaten outside in December and January too!) where I found some round shaded tables where I could eat lunch while looking out at their fake-lake with ducks swimming back and forth.

S'The first time I ate at a Fazoli\'s, I was blown away. They had great sandwiches, good pasta, and a solid business model.  One of my favorite things to do when I was young and poor was to go to Fazoli\'s to do homework.  I would have lunch, then sit there all afternoon refilling my drink cup and saying "HIt me again" to the girl who came around with the basket of breadsticks every  fifteen minutes.  By the time I was done with my studying, I would be so full of breadsticks that I didn\'t need dinner.  Fazoli\'s helped me through college and grad school.  \n\nSince those days (many years ago, sadly), they\'ve gone downhill faster than a Red Zephyr wagon with two fat kids in it.  They tinker needlessly with the menu.  Their food has gotten tasteless. And for a time, you had to go ask for the breadsticks instead of having them brought to you.  \n\nI used to love their food.  Now, it\'s just okay. Mediocre, really.  I no longer look forward to going to Fazoli\'s.  What once used to be a weekly thing when I was younger has become a once, maybe twice yearly thing.

S'It\'s been awhile since I was able to gorge myself on sushi, and lucky me, I was able to this weekend.  After visiting two other sushi restaurants only to discover they were only doing a la carte, the BF and I decided to try out Sushi Hana.  \n\nWith its tinted front doors, you have no idea what you\'re getting yourself into until you open up.  Inside can appear daunting with his mint ice cream color paint and minimal decorations.  Upon entering, the sushi bar is laid out in front of you and to the left, while tables and chairs make up the right of the restaurant.  \n\nDinner buffet is $25.50/pp, while lunch is $19.95/pp.  Standard rules apply with no sharing among non-buffet eaters, no leftover rice, etc.  They limit you on your orders of Amaebi, Uni, and Toro, which most sushi buffets restaurants tend to do.  (It\'s a smart choice actually because we can easily eat a few hundred dollars worth of amaebi, uni, and toro.)  \n\nThe toro nigiri was so succulent!  It wasn\'t a grand piece in terms of size, but it was definitely good!  What a fabulous way to start our meal.  We were even surprised with our uni order, noting there was a bit more uni than we usually see at other restaurants.  The amaebi is standard, but I do love that sweet shrimp.  Don\'t forget to ask for the heads deep-fried too!  (Who doesn\'t love a little head?!)\n\nAmong the appetizer menu, we ordered some Agedashi Tofu, Soft-Shell Crab, and Seafood Poke.  The tofu came with four pieces and was lightly deep fried and how I like it.  The BF noted a strong ginger taste though, which I didn\'t seem to notice.  The crab came out in three pieces and was good too.  The BF was pleased that this restaurant offered it as an appetizer as other sushi buffets only offer it as a Spider Roll.  The poke was more like a seafood poke salad with the lettuce greens thrown in.  I could have passed on the salad greens, but I guess it kinda helps fill you up to.\n\nWe noticed on the "Specials" board a Kobe nigiri, which was also limited to one order per buffet diner.  Of course we had to get it.  It\'s a tender cut of beef that\'s rare.  The BF ate his all up and part of mine!  We also had Ikura, Hamachi nigiri, Hirame nigiri, and Negitoro.  The ikura and hamachi were standard, as well as the hirame.  (Hirame is just extraordinary in Peru for some odd reason, I can\'t quite find the same quality here!)  The negitoro came as a suggestion from the sushi chef, and it was a yummy piece.  We decided to pass on the rolls today, except for the lone Salmon Skin Roll the BF had to order.  It was generous roll with plenty of skin in it.  They also offered tempura, teriyaki, and other hot dishes.\n\nService was good, we didn\'t have to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  They actually came with a new glass of soda before the BF could finish his first, and he definitely appreciates this.  My water glass was filled too!  Dishes were cleared at a steady pace, often without me noticing.  \n\nIt was also nice to note that our sushi chef was Japanese as well as some of the waitresses.  Believe it or not, hearing dialogue in Japanese does give some creditability to the restaurant still.  \n\nAs our bellies got rounder, we decided to call for our check.  The waitress asked if we wanted any dessert, and we asked if it was included in the buffet and it was!  Yay!  (We had sadly noticed no dessert listed, so assumed there wasn\'t any.)  They had green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream, lychee sorbet, and plum sorbet.\n\nOverall, we were pleased with our experience there.  Sure, they don\'t have a ridiculously huge menu with a million rolls, but we were happy with the quality of sushi we got, and that\'s what mattered.\n\nThey are open late - until 2 am! \n\nThey also offer a frequent eater card - with ten visits, get one free!'

S"Wow I love it when I find a place really not expecting much but discover it offers much more than you might expect (if that makes sense?!).  We absolutely needed somewhere with a garden or play area to accommodate 5 very active kids and someone suggested Cafe Cassis on Salisbury Road. Most of us mistook it for the big place opposite the Commie Pool but it's at the other end past the Synagogue. \n\nAnyway, it does have an excellent garden for kids and very welcoming service. Nice layout, small bistro style with a decent Sunday brunch menu (with kids options). Something really good and French going on in the kitchens which makes it a cut above some competitors. Nice Sunday Roast for \xc2\xa39.95, various good lamb, chicken dishes. One issue is very short on veggie options.  I had a really good quality rib eye steak, well cooked and presented, at a decent enough price.  Also good bread and butter pudding (fellow diners enjoyed the cassis sorbet).\n\nDidn't know about this place, bit out of the way but worth a visit, and the garden makes it a real asset in the nice weather (if or when that returns)."

Compared to other Chinatown places ive been this dim sum was really really expensive!  The cheapest item was 7$.  The dim sum was okay, I will say they came around with that cart every couple minutes.  I ordered a bunch of the dumplings, all of which were just okay.  I had a thai tea that was really the star of the meal.  I left feeling full but also a little ticked off that 3 small dim sum dishes costs me 35$!'

Ate half of it hoping it was just a few bad pieces, nope it just got worse.  Next day I had the bad food stomach botulism hangover.  My girls orange chicken looked like it fresh enough.

S"ate here tonight for dinner, ive eaten here several times. Im not sure what kind of food this restaurant serves can anyone help me with that question. I thought it was Mexican but after looking at the menu I noticed many items that are not typically Mexican. then their are some items on the menu that are Mexican. next time I stop by im going to ask so I will know once and for all. \n\nok I usually order the empandas. which are hand made. They are very tastey and just the fact that they are hand made is a big positive. And they don't use any butter or oil in the empanadas. hand made thick corn tortillas stuffed with what ever you want I always get beans without cheese. Tonite I also got one shrimp empanada. that's a first. and I didn't care for the mozzarella cheese in my shrimp. so if I was to get that again I would request without cheese. They have salsa. and if your a die hard salsa fan like myself and you know and like Mexican salsa. Cardinal pizza's salsa is not my favorite it does not have that flavor and kick that I like. I ordered chillis torreados and they were not hot at all.. So I didnt  get that hot burning lips and mouth sensation that I love. For the hand made empanadas and the jamica juice. I will come back. I can always pack some chilli pepers  to bring with me to provide my own heat. LOL. \n\nThe staff is lovely usually one older gentleman and two middle aged ladies and they are very friendly and accommodating. Usually see mexcans eating here.  and they seem to like it. My two friends like this place a lot and theirs never a fuss when one of us suggests eating here .Give  Cardinal Pizza a try I think you'll like it. and if you find out what type of restaurant it is let me know.. \n\nFYI .... they only take cash for payment."

At least it's a fast food place where you can eat something that won't kill you.\n\nAnyways, there is this guy named Scott, who is probably about 40 that works at this Subway.  Scott is the most enthusiastic fast food employee I have ever come across in my life.  Not only is he friendly, he knows everything about Subway without coming off as a know it all.  He just apparently REALLY likes working at Subway, and I think that there's something beautiful about that in an odd way.  Most of the other employees are pretty good as well, which is a rarity in fast food.   Many a friend of mine claim that the key to a quality Subway experience is the sandwich artists, and they do it by the book here.  \n\nBy the way, Benjamin W. sounds like a total douchebag.  I'm all for making fun of ugly, unpleasant people, but he sounds like he belongs in Old Town Scottsdale, failing to impress women that wouldn't give him the time of day."

However, the DQ employee took us for idiots. We just didn\'t want to yell. "Sir, we can\'t hear you" the guy says to us! So this frustrated us. They didn\'t say sorry even when we got to the window and tried to explain, she looked at us dumbfounded. I never ever expect 5 star (yelp 5 star) service from these franchises that employ high school students for minimum wage. So as I write this, I know I will be back one day, but I would hope I can give you guys a better rating because the employees will be more cheerful and understanding. One could hope, but I do love my strawberry chocolate dip blizzard!! So slap a smile on your face for $$$ you are earning, cause the happy customers will come back and you\'ll get good reviews.

But this is my favorite. \n\nThe ladies are nice, pretty, and cheerful (considering all the guys that must come in trying to run lame game). I always sit at the bar to the right coming in. When I come with the wife we sit at the bar, booths, or tables. When not sitting at the bar I find at times they are a little tardy at taking your order. \n\nAs for the food, I've never had any complaints. LEMON PEPPER is my favorite. Naked = Not breaded. I've had their oysters, salads, wings,  fries (curly, which are my favorite), shrimp. Never trusted them with burgers. But some reviews swear by them.  \n\nThey have a lot of specials, and a updated lunch menu. They run buy 10,get 10 sometimes. All the PPV fights, MMA etc., are at no cover. Can't beat that. \n\nGo Enjoy,\nTTFN"

Perhaps this is because it is overshadowed by the ever popular music venue Henry's Cellar Bar below it.\n\nI've been to Rainbow Arch several times now and each time it seems to get better and better. It's a dim sum specialist so while there... try some dim sum! You'll find some more creative and unusual varities. The alternative menu is decent too.\n\nThe general aesthetic of place isn't incredible but not terrible either. It had a sort of old-school Chinese restaurant feel. Sometimes the tablecloth and menus don't seem that new either.\n\nI've heard that the staff are not always the most friendly but every time I've been in I've always found them to be helpful and perfectly amiable.\n\nAlso keep in mind that Raindbow Arch closes late, around 3am, making it one of the few decent late night restaraunts in Edinburgh.\n\nA really great dim sum restaurant in the heart of Edinburgh,"

I called them and told them it was way to dry and they are sending another in about 1 hour. Whenever I go to subway I always ask them to go light on the sauce because it can be pretty sloppy.

No crazy fish tacos (please guys, get over it, we don't need that many options for fish tacos!), no hyper-local ingredients, no overarching theme (turkey truck, cheese truck, italian truck, etc...)    The food is simpler -  philly cheesesteaks, empanadas, gyros etc...  Most of it fried.\n\n  However,  the heavier-set guy who works there (runs it?) is a good guy and happy to talk with you about the food.  Plus, I really love his inventive empanadas.

I almost pitied her, having to deal with narrow alleys between rows of tables and no space what-so-ever to do her job in a huge reception room. Even if there was many waiters that helped each others to do the food service, the restaurant had just overbooked the place with so many groups in the same room.\n\nOtherwise, the food was very average (I took the seafood casserole), my veggies were saturated with olive oil and overcooked/burned. The chocolate cheesecake was stiff and not creamy at all. My husband took the langoustine (scampi) plate, and was very disappointed with the size of it for the price he had to pay.\n\nSince it was really crowded that night, it was very difficult to talk to our neighbors at our tables. Also, if you have toddlers: this is NOT a family restaurant. Your kids will get bored, and there's no room for them to play. You can't let them roam around the tables, because they'd get in the way of the waiters.\n\nOverall, a bad experience."

They have more fillings than you'd think it possible to fit in one chill counter - a good selection of both veggie and non-veggie - so you can create your perfect bespoke sandwich exactly to your taste.

Somehow they are able to get the toppings on the pizza so you get every topping with each bite, however they don't overload it so the pizza is weighted down with toppings.  The crust is thin and pretty good-I like mine crispy and crunchy and theirs could be a bit more crunchy for my taste.  I ordered a sausage and cheese pizza and their version of Hawaiian, both of which are excellent.  The Hawaiian has roasted pineapple, sliced red jalape\xc3\xb1o(not too spicy), and their delicious crispy pancetta .  Their sausage is super tasty- they use some excellent quality sausage with fantastic flavor,  they crumble it perfectly so every bite has sausage but not too much.  Great pizza.\nI also ordered a pizza that has marinated cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts,  and basil.  Scrumptious and delicious.  \nThese guys have a great formula.  Definitely a winner.

I actually have been eating at Boston Market for many years, We would go to the valleys original location in Tempe, and back then it was a great place. Over the years I saw the quality fade and the flavors go south. I chalked that up to growth and just chose other dining options.\n\nOn last nights visit I was greeted by a friendly young lady who had that great "we are happy you are here" smile. I was happy that she helped guide me through side selections so I could get a side salad and fresh steamed veggies with The Half Chicken Special.\n\nAfter ordering I noticed that the drink and condiment station was well stocked and clean, as was the dining room. I found a table and within seconds my meal was brought to me by the same friendly cashier. \n\nThe meal was Hot and smelled delicious, The steamed veggies were cooked perfect and on the same quality level as most high end restaurants in this town. The side Caesar salad was fresh and yummy and at no extra cost! WOW! The Star of the night though was the perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken. I was so impressed with the plates and utensils because the were real. No plastic and paper, that was a nice touch.\n\nPlaces like this have teams of executives that work hard to make sure there unit teams perform and execute meals and guest satisfaction like I had last night. Well somebody\'s doing there job and THAT\'S FRESH!!!!\n\nI recommend Boston Market if you have never been or haven\'t been in a while. It has to be the best meal in town under 10 bucks!'

Yes Gaston is there.\n\nAlways good service and have been frequenting this joint for a while, staff is very friendly and know most of their customers.  It's breakfast done well and price is reasonable. It gets crazy after 10.30 AM on Sundays, thats when the families with kiddies come in."

S'Although Cosi is close to my home I had not yet visited as I heard many not so fantastic things about this place.  To sum it up, "It isn\'t that bad."  My muffeleta sandwich included a gigantic handful of cold olives in the middle of my otherwise warm lunch, but my friend\'s salad seemed quite tasty. My bread was craggy and hard.  My side of carrots instead of chips were scary looking. (they looked like baby carrots that have been sitting in your fridge for 3 weeks) I may return, but not upon my own volition. Panera is better, way better. (2.5 stars)'

The meat ball and burrata thing on the shared platter was super good. The calamari and wings were average but good enough. \n\nThe guys ordered the Jpm (the mixed whiskey drink) and they both loved it and one girl got a sangria and it was beautifully presented and tasted good! \n\nSome also for the fancy coffees at the end and it\'s also intense but good.\n\nThe server was very pleasant and knew the food well and also knew about the architect of the restaurant (inspired by the design or another architect for the Perimeter Institute). And when we asked about the "ADA" drink (was it named after the programmer or program) she even went to find the answer for us.\n\nDefinitely coming back and recommend!'

S"Imagine that it's been almost two and a half years since I wrote my original review here.  Man I'm getting old.  Luckily not much has changed.  The prices have gone up a bit, so if you get two adults and two kids (even if the kids have to sneak in to get the kids price, which is now for under-10 only), you'll pay upwards of $30.  That's if you get soft drinks.  If you get water, it'll be closer to $20.  Talk about pricey drinks.\n\nThe pizzas haven't changed much, except they go for some variety now - rather than standard pepperoni and sausage, you get barbecue, buffalo chicken and even taco pizzas.  But there is still pasta (usually in a pretty decrepit state), salad and the ever-present dessert pizza.\n\nThough our kids are getting to the point where they like to experiment with their pizza, and get something other than cheese and pepperoni, they like CiCi's because they can get lots of different kinds.  It is what it is.  Don't pretend that you're getting real pizza, but for the family, it's fine.  They also have pretty decent (read: really syrupy, sweet goodness) sweet tea."

S"i do NOT like walking into a place that wreaks of fish! that is not a good sign of a sushi place! **GAG** as we stood there waiting to be seated and i was gagging from the fish smell, i had to warm my girl that if it smelled like fish at our table, we couldn't stay. \n\ni must admit i don't really eat fish to begin with. so this review of a sushi place is coming from a non-sushi eater. the only reason i went to sushi avenue was because i was craving edamame and my girl was craving sushi; so those naturally go together. this is a place my friend has been to many times and says she LOVES their sushi.\n\nwe were seated and to my delight, i couldn't smell any fishiness. :) almost immediately the waitress came over and got us drinks. my friend and i started into conversation but after about fifteen minutes realized we had been forgotten about. we sat there for another five or so minutes before my friend got up and asked someone to come take our order. i ordered the teriyaki chicken with rice and edamame, and my friend ordered the lasagna rolls and edamame. then we sat. sat some more. then sat there service less some more. i had to keep waiving down anyone i could in order to get more water. :-/ this MIGHT HAVE been forgivable had the place been busy but i think there was more staff in the restaurant than people dining. maybe people walk out when they smell fish?! i would have too but i wasn't eating fish. ;) \n\nfinally our food arrived and the chicken was kind of cold. the rice... well it's rice you can't mess that up. oh and the edamame was good, which is awesome because that's what i really wanted. then i look up at my friend who was putting one of the lasagna rolls in her mouth and almost instantly she gags and spits the sushi back out in her napkin. booo! i had to call over the waitress to get her something else. she ordered the mexican roll, which came out pretty quickly and she said was really good. \n\noverall, i was not impressed, and from the start it wasn't right. the service was sooo bad that i couldn't even bring myself to tip. that says a lot because i'm all about taking care of the server. these girls could have given a shit that we were even there. i'm thinking that had my friend not gotten up to ask to get our order taken we could have easily sat there all night ignored. i mean there wasn't a single moment when the waitress came to the table to ask if we needed anything. i had to waive her down every time; me no likie dat! then my food was cold... ummm it's not hard to make chicken and rice. meh. my friend may go back to this place, but she couldn't drag me back again."

This last time, I tried to use our local Memorial HS football coupon card when going through the "drive thru" where you can get 10% off your purchase.  The worker said,  "We don\'t accept those cards at this location. " Of course,  I was surprised considering this is the closest Arby\'s to the HS (only 1/2mi down the road). She continued saying,  "this restaurant is owned separately and we dont accept many coupons."

On 3 occasions now they have not started the order until I show up and ask for it. The 2nd time this happened I questioned them and they told me it is better to call in the order and avoid using the online system. It doesn't seem like good business to not be able to manage the online ordering system. Tonight it happened again, they did not start the order until I arrived and indicated I had an internet order. This prompted them to check their printer and grab the order. If they could somehow implement a system to manage online orders I would be happy to change to 4 stars."

S'This is a medium sized all you can eat sushi and Asian food buffet.  We went during "Happy Hour" where the price is only $11.95 per adult.  Possibly there are regular menu items that we missed by coming in an off peak time, but I doubt we will go back to find out.\n\nAlthough we like these kinds of restaurants, especially O Nami in San Diego, this is a poor representation.  The sushi is somewhat fresh, but the fish pieces are too large to eat in one bite and the rice quite small, it was an awkward eating experience.  I particularly dislike combo sushis without any labeling and there was none here.  There are also some hot dishes, such as soups, stir fries, fried noodles, and tempura shrimp and vegetables.  These were not bad, but not worth recommending.  The one thing that probably keeps people coming back is the chocolate fountain, which we are not particularly fond of.  The rest of the desserts are forgettable.\n\nBut the one thing that will definitely keep me away was the MSG headache I got less than hour after eating there.  It\'s been years since I had to worry about this food additive.  Although my headache was not bad, I don\'t need this experience again.  Go only if MSG doesn\'t bother you.'

Staff are great and the food also compares just as favourably. Dishes are brilliantly inventive, cooked with great technique and made up of fresh and tasty ingredients without any of the cliche a lot of other places suffer from.\n\nI ordered the grilled squid. The squid was very, very good. It had a lovely charred tasted, remained juicy and tender and a combination of chilli, ruby grapefruit and a little coriander through the salad was awesome! I also had some of the veggie mezze. A mix of falafel, herby yoghurt balls (I forget their proper name) crispy halloumi, a medium boiled egg, pickled carrots, roast peppers, smoked olives, hummus, tzatziki and piccalilli. All clearly homemade and again, full of flavour. I've never even heard of smoked olives before but now want some within arms reach at all times.\n\nOverall another 5 stars for the folks that seem to have the secret formula for running a spectacular restaurant."

If you do want advice, they can often be really helpful...it's worth trying to get someone who's into the activity you're enquiring about.\nReturns are no bother, you sometimes get advised to buy something cheaper, and the sale rail reveals occasional bargains. Sometimes can be good sales, and discount card works on sale items too! Cafe is quite nice, and ample free parking.\n\nAll the above only works if you can resist buying stuff you don't need. If not, maybe you should stay away. I'm quite good at going in and NOT buying stuff, probably not an ideal customer.

S'This is my absolute favourite place to get food in the food court at the West Towne Mall. The food is perfect and amazing. You will not regret choosing Sarku. You might see someone giving out samples, make sure you give it a try, you will love it. Their is commonly a long line, which sucks but what are you going to do about it. And im not going to lie, its sometimes hard to understand the employees, but they do a good job. But when i have only a few bucks on me i cant grab sarku, since it will run you around $7-9 for a meal.'

S'McDonald\'s is McDonald\'s. Same fast food experience as it\'s always been. Usually I only go for their McRibs (stop laughing) but every once in a blue moon the mood strikes me for some easy fast food. I love their double-cheeseburgers, there\'s something about their diced onions and it\'s the only sandwich they put these on. Fries are spotty but they probably have the best "fast food" fries, as long as they\'re piping hot and well salted. I don\'t mind those things they call Chicken McNuggets either. I guess I feel thankful deep down that I\'m not eating a real chicken.\n\nThe rating for this review is based on this location. Correct me if I\'m wrong but wasn\'t the old location on South Blvd a larger restaurant? I guess the local residents petitioned to have a smaller eyesore built in it\'s place, since this is probably considered the @$$-end of SouthEnd. This location feels mighty cramped inside and some of my fellow customers are kinda suspect. The employees, not much better. I\'d love to check the police reports to see how many pedestrians have been struck by cars in this particular parking lot.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter'

S'The whiting (they ran out of catfish) was all kinds of bland except for a really strong fishy flavor (whiting is the least supposed to taste like fish), especially for "cajun fried", or was that what the bucket of hot sauce was supposed to represent? The jerk chicken tacos tasted nothing of jerk, the only noticable flavor was from the sweet thai chili sauce added on the side. The mac and cheese side was a congealed mass of fake cheese with some tasteless noodles to bind it together, and the rice and red beans were essentially that, a layer of rice with canned red beans poured over top. \n\nThe only saving grace was my partner\'s cajun grilled tilapia, the highlight of the meal.'

It\'s one of those places that help make downtown feel more like a much cooler city that has an abundance of stuff like this. \n\nYou blink and you might miss it, but once you find the door and descend the stairway you\'ll find yourself inside a dark and cozy spot lined with old woods and bookended by a wrap-around bar and a stage where they sometimes have musicians play. The atmosphere is pretty inviting, but it helps if you bring a buddy so you don\'t feel like an outcast. \n\nThere are tables and chairs to sit at and the place is capable of accomidating groups. They serve food as well of course and the food is good. I\'ve had pizza there and I thought it was quite tasty. Nothing to write home about, but I\'ll yelp about it. \n\nIt\'s the sort of place that sets the scene for "anything can happen" night... sorta like Chez Nous did, but in a different way.

S"Here's the deal...I really adore food trucks and Red's sports a super suped up food truck chock full of barbecued goods. Chicken, ribs and, of course, pulled pork. I stopped by Red's for a quick lunch Uptown and here's how it went down...\n\nThe order taker were so kind and welcoming to anyone who meanders up to their spot. I ordered a barbecue sandwich and upon recommendation from the order taker I got half sweet and half mild sauce on the sammie and a lemonade. Minutes later and $6.20 something less in my pocket I grabbed a bench and dug in. \n\nThe theme of Red's must be sweet all over - sweet staff, sweet barbecue and sweet lemonade. While the effort is there, the meal just didn't thrill me overall. The pork was nice and tender but the sauce was so sweet it almost gave me a toothache. Next time I'll go with the vinegar base or the hot version. And the lemonade - diabetics please be aware. I like straight up sweet yet tart lemonade, but I could hardly drink this concoction. Water next time. \n\nI definitely suggest giving Red's a try, just be aware that sweetness oozes out of just about everything!"

S"While I can't give this place four stars yet, I think it might be on its way with a little tweaking.  They were pretty dead on a Saturday morning which was surprising.  The cook was sitting at the bar reading the paper and chatting with the waitress when we walked in.  Everyone was super friendly though and the waitress was happy to make suggestions.  She suggested the corned beef hash which is something I've never had.  I figured I would give it a try and sure enough, it was pretty damn good.  The beef had a couple scrambled eggs on it, a side of hashedbrowns, and the option of pancakes or toast.  I'm glad I ordered the toast because my meal was huge.  The hashedbrowns were okay and the toast was excellent!  \n\nI can see how this place would be a letdown if it were busy.  But it is nice, clean, open, and friendly which is really all I want from a breakfast place.  It is sort of like a mini Jerry's to me.  I'm going to go back and try something else next time.  If they scaled their portions down a bit, used some better ingredients all around, and maybe added a saturday special ... they could really turn this place into a hot spot."

S"Popeye's really is the best fast food restaurant in Madison. They are surely better than 3 stars but I don't give those out very easily. \n\nTheir chicken is typically served hot. While there have been times I've gotten take out from them and was given dry pieces of chicken, I have always been able to call of the GM (who's been here since they first opened years ago), tell him my problem with my meal and would be ask to return to get a fresh batch without charge. They would even throw in extra biscuits for our troubles, however, I do not want to say that is the norm. This has only been a problem 2-3 times in my years of experiences dining with them. \n\nRecently, they redecorated the interior. It looks fantastic. Very modern day feel that is inviting. Plenty of seating area, very clean including the bathrooms, and good young staff ( from what I can tell). Because I am a very picky eater, I only order their chicken strips. I don't like chicken with the skin and bone still attached. My strips are 100% white meat ( bonus, don't eat dark meat) and are extremely crispy. When you bite into them, you can hear the crunch! Whatever batter they use is excellent! Unlike their competitor who's chicken is often very greasy and fatty, you can tell Popeye's uses quality chicken and batter. \n\nYou're offered a variety of side dishes such as their signature red beans and rice ( be warned, it contains pork), mash potatoes and gravy ( also has pork in the gravy), mac n cheese, cole slaw and seasoned fries. You also served a fresh warm biscuit. My goodness, their biscuits are so addicting! I have to contain myself whenever I dine at Popeyes because I could at a good 2-3 biscuits. There is not questions that they use a  buttermilk dough. It makes the biscuits soft. They add butter on top of the biscuits once taken out of the oven. Perfection.\n\n\nThey stay busy which means, you're going to get freshly made food since they must keep up with demand. I love this place. Also, Tuesday's is half price chicken! Dark meat only ( bummer)."

S"In a word, DELICIOUS.\n\nWe enjoyed a Saturday day-trip to Scottsdale, and Tutto was the highlight of our visit.\n\nThe food was carefully prepared using fresh ingredients...the pasta is made in the kitchen, including the tortellini, and the sauces we had were full of fresh cream and cheese.  The service was impeccable, and the d\xc3\xa9cor very comfortable.\n\nLunch began with just-baked hot rolls, with a dipping sauce.  We opted for butter and they happily obliged.\n\nThe appetizers were solid.  The bruschetta was made with toasted fresh bread, topped with fresh ripe tomatoes, and a small salad drizzled with aged balsamic was a bonus on the side.  \nThe small artichoke hearts stuffed with cheese were coated with a lite batter and quickly deep fried to a crisp, not greasy, perfection.  Yum.\n\nThe 3-cheese tortellini was wonderful, ordered with a creamy alfredo sauce.  I'd recommend the baked stuffed pasta shells with chicken to the most dedicated lover of Italian cuisine.  The portions are generous.\n\nCome on Scottsdale, get out of the mall!"

S"My boyfriend and I came here after we were unable to get a table at nearby Jamie's Italian (which I'm still dying to try!) and had a lovely time! It was a really busy Friday night but after waiting for only a few minutes, we were seated.  The service was attentive, our waiter asked us if we'd like to have our mains right away after our (rather large) starters or if we'd like a little break, which I thought was a nice touch.  \n\nWe went for the full three courses.  For starter we shared an antipasto and the rosemary foccacia - the antipasto was good but I've had better in other restaurants (and at home, my parents are Italian and in the restaurant trade!).  There was salami, mortadella, proscuitto, pickled veg, smoked cheese, salad, olives and 2 big slabs of polenta dressed with balsamic vinegar.  I would have liked it if the salad had been dressed, and I thought the smoked cheese, whilst nice, didn't really go with the rest of it.  I didn't particularly enjoy the polenta but that's just my taste, I'm just not keen on it. The foccacia was delicious though.\n\nFor main, I had sirloin steak with peppercorn sauce and my boyfriend had the chicken with asparagus and mushroom.  Both came with sides of veg and potatoes but as I always like chips with steak, I asked if I could swap my potatoes for chips, and this was no problem.  The chips were nice enough and although I didn't taste them, I was assured the potatoes were really good.  The veg was a bit bland, just green beans and carrots, boiled or steamed.  The steak and sauce were delicious, and the sauce on the chicken was also really good.\n\nAlthough we were pretty stuffed, we went for desserts anyway! I had the meringue with strawberry ice cream and strawberries which was pretty nice, but could have been better - if the strawberries had been fresh instead of in a sauce type thing (like on a strawberry tart if that makes sense?) and the ice cream of better quality. My boyfriend had chocolate cake which was rich and delicious but proved too much for him in the end!\n\nAll of this plus a bottle of wine and two glasses of prosecco for \xc2\xa373 which I thought was pretty decent.  I'd go back, definitely."

I had the "Godfather" which is grilled chicken breast, portobello mushroom, red roasted peppers, reduced fat mozzarella, gluten free fat free balsamic and broccoli. I thought the dish was awesome. The chicken was cooked right and everything tasted great. I am giving it 4 stars because I did not physically eat there so I cannot speak on that. What I can tell you is the food was great and prepared in a way I would have prepared it at home, the healthy way! The people involved in this restaurant live healthy lifestyles and it clearly shows, why would they lie about the way the food was prepared? I would love to go back and physically eat in the restaurant. I will be sure to update my review when I do.'

Great spot for work dinners or events. But the food was just not good, especially at the prices they are charging. For $20, small portion of flavorless halibut, no side included and halibut was like cardboard. Really boring beef carpacchio and bland herb risotto. I never complain about service, but they did not bus surrounding tables for over 30 mins and for a dinner/drinks bill of $100+ it would be nice to not stare at unfinished food for the entire meal.\n\nIt is very possible we caught this place on an off night, but I doubt it.

I ordered an Italian sub that was phenomenal and left his restaurant feeling like I had just found a gem.\n\nI wish the review ended there, but it doesn't. In just a year and a half Geno's has really fallen to the wayside. He doesn't seem to get any business which then affects his product, spiraling his restaurant in that culinary catch-22 of lack of business/lack of quality that is basically the death throes of any eatery.\n\nOn my last visit, I was more than a little disappointed. The server was almost nonexistent and many of their menu items were unavailable. I ordered the Italian sub again and she walked away before I could order a size. What I ended up with was half a sub for dinner. I'm a big guy and a 1-foot sub consumer.\n\nMy girlfriend's meal was also sub par and expensive. Geno's is now erratically open and I can't imagine ordering a meal there, their hours are so random I find it hard to believe that they serve anything fresh."

S'Newly opened on the Mound, just next to the Christian bookshop, Cafe Musa is a very stylish, airy cafe, nestled in the heart of Edinburgh\'s historic Old Town. \n\nOverall, we said: "Caf\xc3\xa9 Musa is well worth a visit. Its smart interior, blending wood with the abundant light that bathed the room, today, is a real winner. It has the feel of a really smart brunch venue. Once people know it\'s there, the signage problems I ran into won\'t be an issue. What is likely to be a continuing concern is the competition provided by its near neighbours. Our visit to Porto & Fi\'s Newhaven branch confirmed it to be a really top-quality place. Likewise, I think the soup is the Whiski Rooms is just about the best in town. Competition often drives up quality, though, and with abundant tourist custom, there\'s reason to be optimistic that these places will all prosper. I hope so, as I think all three offer really good quality."'

The mushrooms were different from last time, besides the fact they were served scorching hot on the outside and ice cold in the middle! The once big onion rings are now small and barely any trace of onion and the portion size in general is now much smaller. When we questioned the server he says they are having to make "cut backs" so I guess quality is the first thing to go. It was just very disappointing since it was our 4th time going and it was consistently good until now. I will probably give it one more chance to see if anything has changed back... very disappointing!'

S'Panera Bread ah yes, a wonderful modern day fast food caf\xc3\xa9. Well I do happen to enjoy Panera Bread although it is an ironic modern depiction of what a Caf\xc3\xa9 is. They have some pretty tasty almost-homemade soups and sandwiches and some fantastic coffee. A nice bakery to keep your sweet tooth satisfied and your belly full. More specifically though. I despise this location.\n\nI have been to this location a bunch of times (over 20 at least) and every time I go it seems the same kind of disappointing experience. A couple examples:\n\n First of all the first time I went here in my life I was still in high school and was here just doing some homework. Not one single table was clean so I cleaned it myself. I went to the front and ordered some soup, a coffee, and a water and got to work on some un-important  English paper that I would never remember. The second I opened my laptop to start working, an employee comes over and very rudely says "how old are you? you can\'t sit here all night  doing homework." Keep in mind I had only a few sips from my soup and coffee when she arrived in front of me. \n\nI look up and say excuse me? So she repeats herself. I said well I am a paying customer and you have free wifi, so if people are welcome to use free wifi and you have coffee and a bakery, what kind of place is this? She proceeded to say that they were a Fast-food Restaurant and that she didn\'t want to get stuck there after her shift to clean my table. I told her not one of these tables were cleaned when I sat down. She grunted and said "yeah right" and trotted away. So, having felt extremely disrespected; packed up my laptop and homework, left my full cup of coffee along with the water and full bowl of soup and walked to the front cash register where her, and her manager were standing. As I walk up I even hear her bitching to her manager about me sitting and doing homework. \n\nShe notices me out of the corner of her eye and immediately stops talking and walks into the back. So I say, "too late". I tell the manager I want my money back for what she had just said to me while I was sitting down. I said I did not feel welcome and would like to take my money elsewhere. The manager agreed but only because I had walked up on them talking about me. I got my money back and said I left my entire meal at my table and left. I couldn\'t believe it.\n\nQuickly 2 others, one for some reason one of the booths was just missing an entire bench. so their replacement was a random chair which I will try to put in the pictures section of this location. Also I just went here today and ordered and just got a very "hurry up so I can do nothing" response. No thank you just here is your change and move on.\n\nAgain I love Panera but this location is just awful, over crowded, rude employees, and just a lack of convenience to customers (i.e. fixing a booth, cleaning tables, etc.)'

My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).  \n\nThe decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received."

Cant do much about the butter in the grits...it just makes them good...if it is not too much of it.  OK...fast forward....8 years...and the breakfast plate is still the same....exactly the same!  I remember taking my daughter there before she went to work.....and she would eat two...yes...2 breakfast plates!  I still wonder how she did it!  they were good.  I now drop by...maybe once a week if parking is good on 5th St.  Drop in also for a good fast and nice casual lunch with a friend.

Both were very delicious.  The food is great.  I tried the Cajun chicken sandwich, steak salad, and my favorite the Charles special.  The Charles special is named after the new owner.  Its a mixed green salad serviced with candied pecans, berries, and raspberry vinaigrette.  Aside from the delicious food, they have drink specials.  My favorite night is Saturday.  On Saturday's they have a party hosted by Money B of Digital Underground.  The DJ plays old school Hip Hop music and current hits.  I will definitely be back."

S'Sub Station II is a great place to grab a quick bite if you\'re handling your business in the Dilworth area. It\'s a huge upgrade from chain sandwich shops like Quizno\'s and is far healthier "fast" option than the Bojangles and Chick-Fil-A you\'ll find everywhere else around town. As Nick points out, you get a considerably larger portion of meat, cheese, and toppings on your sandwiches here, which means a lot. And indeed, the meat is sliced right in front of you, which makes for a fresher and tastier sandwich. They have lots of their selections, but you\'re welcome to design your own perfect sandwich, which of course is what I did. \n\nTry yours with Turkey and Swiss on a roll; add lettuce, tomato, onion, oil and vinegar for the perfect, light lunch or snack. So much better than the crap you\'ll find elsewhere, trust me.'

S'One thing I must emphasize is this restaurant\'s goi cuon (shrimp, pork and lettuce with rice noodles wrapped in rice paper).  They make the best ones I\'ve had to date:  they\'re larger than most places and, most importantly, they use the more expensive, thinner rice paper.  Why is that important?  The thicker rice paper used in most of the other restaurants are not only cheaper, but much easier to roll.  The thinner cut is much harder to roll, because if you\'re not fast, the paper sticks to itself.  From a visual outlook, the thinner ones are much clearer and you cannot only see the contents more clearly, it gives a "fresher" appearance to the rolls.  But most important is the taste:  much less "crunchy" than with thicker skins and you taste much more of the contents than in other rolls, where the thick skin steals some of the taste by "overpowering" the shrimp, pork, etc.  The real test comes with what I call the "refrigerator test".  As I live quite a ways from this restaurant, I usually order an extra 5 of these rolls to take home and have for breakfast during the week.  Now, refrigerators are not a friend of these rolls, no matter who makes it.  However, other restaurants\' rolls get crunchy and stale by the very next morning.  In contrast, the rolls from Dong A tend to take a much longer time to "deteriorate" (the skin doesn\'t get tough, but the shrimp starts to "go" and there\'s a slimy feeling to the roll).  Since we\'re talking about a sitting time of five days or so, it is naturally very desirable to have something that won\'t taste like you\'re eating shrimp in an old newspaper.'

The manager Donna was very rude and said no.  I then ask for a BBQ turkey salad with no BBQ sauce. She then got involved with the register. I ask for 2oz extra turkey grilled onions and mushrooms. She was very upset. The sandwich was ham and cheese. She wanted to charge me over $26.00. I ask her what did she ring up she said what I ordered. We went through it and she added 2 salads. After she changed it the bill was over $21.00 very high price lunch for two. I just bought a house in Henderson in February and I use to go there almost every day.

Joel, our waiter for the evening showed us to our table and gave us the menu.. few minutes later, he came back and asked for our order... the place was crowded, we thought we were going to wait forever to get our food.. but fortunately, it did not take long... the order was fast, we even had an extra basket of fries for free.\nThe Salad was not very tasty, the vegetables did not seem fresh, but the rolls were fruity and light, the onion rings were delicious, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\nThe place was so welcoming that we were not at all in a hurry to leave.  Mike's is well known for its fondant which we highly recommend.\nMikes menu includes a range of pizzas, pasta, sandwiches along with other exclusive italian specialties such as the famous Gondolas, haven't tried but we sure will the next time we go there. \nThe christmas songs put us in that joyful mood before christmas. The music was just loud enough that we could still manage to have a conversation with our friends without getting annoyed."

Nope its just shitty now. We ordered super nachos and tacos. well they were out of Chicken and elpasdor (spelling?) . So we went with Carne Asada. It took them about 15 minutes to make our food ( which I dont mind if im waiting for fresh good food ). And when we got home we realized that our nachos were fries! Wah wah wah. And they were gross, not fried all the way through and the Carna Asada tasted like it was from a horse rather than a cow. Im sad that this place sucks now. But they seem to not care about the customers anymore and for that I say " Shame on you Rigos Tacos ". I will drive a little further for Tacos El Gordo next time.'

So much, in fact, I left my number with our server because I'm interested in working there a few nights a week come summer.\n\nCafe la Bella is next to a market and (I think) a car place) on 7th Street.  I had something else in mind entirely before we went in:  you know, the family-style Italian place with green or red-and-white checkered tablecloths, spaghetti and meatballs, and huge portions.\n\nCafe la Bella is nothing like this.  The inside, with its ten tables and warm-colored walls, is homey and elegant at the same time.  Our server was very friendly and relaxed.  \n\nI know it was a BYOB place, but I didn't know it was ONLY BYOB.  You can't buy wine there.  So, bring your own!  What a fun idea.  It only adds to the homey quality.  We didn't bring our own, but my husband ducked out to the convenience store right next door and came back with some wine.  \n\nThe bread was a little weird - it was toasted with some kind of olive oil/roasted garlic combination on top.  I'm more of a dip my baguette in olive oil kind of girl.  Anyway, the meal itself was fantastic.  My husband had the clam linguini, which he couldn't stop raving about (especially how it was exactly the right size).  I had the Really Big five-cheese ravioli, which was, indeed, really big.  Not to mention really good.  \n\nCan't wait to go back.\n\n*Not five stars because it was a teeny bit overpriced.  Then again, why not have a nice date night once in awhile?  4.5 stars."

I am not lying when I say that 7 out of 10 visits whether it be drive-thru or walk-in, something is wrong with my order. \nI can remember my order for extra onions on McRib sandwiches or hamburgers have been produced with extra pickles and no onions. A recent visit took 25 minutes to produce a 10 piece chicken mcnuggets and a soda. I've worked at a McDonald's before, and if I had a valid food card, and ambassadorial privileges, I could have changed the oil, re-heat the fryer, located a box in their freezer, and fry my own food, and still get to school on time. The shift manager gave me a large fries and 2 cups for drinks, not being sensitive to the fact that I had diabetes, and I had ordered nuggets for speedy service and avoidance of excess carbs.\nThe service today was not as bad, but why do they go through the trouble of asking what kind of sauce do I want with my nuggets if they aren't going to give it to me? The guy at the window actually tried to shove me out of drive-thru with only a partial order. This particular instance has happened several times.\nUnfortunately, I am a fan of their products, and when I get a hankering and wish not to get out of my vehicle, this is the closest location.\nI have managed 3 food service installations, and I guarantee that I could run that place better than the current crew, given minimal training.\nI would say the 80's had lousy fashion, 90's had lousy music, and so far, aside from drivers of today, customer service is at its worst, especially for food service and more especially for McDonald's on Sunset and Stephanie."

S"Being just around the corner from my girlfriend's apartment, it was just too easy to slip into this cozy bistro located on Duluth's cobblestones. \n\nThe soups and sandwiches always rotate and are consistently incredible. Get the combo so you can try one of each. The freshly baked breads and espresso are also exceptional.\n\nThe one thing you cannot miss when you go here though is their Pouding Ch\xc3\xb4meur, probably my favorite dessert of all time. This maple syrup masterpiece, by itself, earns Soupesoup my maximum approval."

S"My husband and I completely lucked into discovering Amber; we spent more time than we'd planned to at Edinburgh Castle, and were starving when we left.  We immediately walked by Amber, thought the menu sounded interesting, and went in for a late lunch.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a restaurant in the Scotch Whisky Experience to be impressive, but this certainly is.  The room itself is beautiful and has a nice view out the windows.  Service is friendly and helpful.  My husband  had the lamb stovies and loved it.  I ordered the herb crusted coley, and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  The mussels and leeks were done perfectly, the dumplings were outstanding, and the sauce was to die for.\n\nWe liked the restaurant so much we came back the next day for the Platinum Tour (another future review) and the Taste of Scotland.  Again, this showed how amazing Scottish food really is-- who knew?  The tapas included a scallop, smoked salmon, and black pudding (two for three here, but that's a matter of personal taste) and for entrees we got duck, lamb, and the coley.  The duck was delicious and not at all greasy.  The lamb was so tender you could cut it with a fork, and came with surprisingly good haggis potatoes.  For dessert we had a toffee cake paired with a whisky, and it was absolutely amazing.  The servers can give helpful reccomendations about whisky (as well as other drinks), and there's even a whisky sommelier should you need truly expert advice.\n\nPrices are really fairly reasonable, and the Platinum Tour/Taste of Scotland is really a steal considering how much comes with the tour.  Definitely somewhere you should go if you find yourself in Edinburgh."

Out of ideas and with little patience to cook for myself I've opted for The Curry Leaf's classic lamb rogan josh on many occasion, followed by their light and fluffy naan breads.\n\nThe classic dishes are inexpensive and with a home delivery service I see no reason to claim that The Curry Leaf offers everything you could possibly want from a Indian take-away service. \n\nTop stuff."

S'So this is part review, part story. Mostly story, but eventually review. You get the idea. Quit your whining and just read it okay....\n\nMy accomplice and I had just spent a lovely long weekend in Montreal, spending copious amounts of money on sex, drugs, alcohol, late night chinese food and bad pizza. On the last day of our trip, we decided to hit the Casino de Montreal, and win all our money back - a perfectly reasonable request....\n\nAn hour after our arrival, my accomplice finds me crying, naked, in the bathroom stall, mumbling something like, "Willy Wonka bad touch bad touch," although I don\'t really remember, and the blood on my hands was very distracting.\n\nAlso, I\'ve lost a lot of money.\n\n10 minutes later I have my clothes on again and realize that bankruptcy makes me hungry, so we decide to explore food options. Our first stop was the Italian place in the basement. 1 hour wait? Pass. Our second was Nuances, listed merely as \'fine dining\', tucked away in a corner on one of the higher floors. To our tremendous dismay, upon asking how long the wait was, we were informed that there is no \'wait\' (pfft, the notion!) and that all tables had been reserved. The only other option was a buffet, which was another hour wait. We gave in, and put in for the buffet, and decided to fill the time with more drinking. Where? Why, how about Nuances? Go team!\n\nThe bartender Andre, was brilliant. Since we were the only two people at the bar, service was obviously top-notch, but I could tell that it\'d be just as good even if the place was packed. He asked us if we just there waiting for a table, we said we didn\'t have a reservation, and he told us he\'d see what he could do. Long story slightly less long, we were soon escorted to our table :) WINNERS!\n\nHere comes the review part - I have nothing but good things to say about this place. The atmosphere was perfect - lit just right, clean warm cream colors, tables not too close together, but not too far apart. The booth we had was cozy, spacious, and comfortable. The service was phenomenal from start to finish - we had two or three waiters who checked in on us, topping off our water and champagne glasses. Granted, since we ordered a 5-course meal, the waiters had no choice but to swing by with our courses. The highlight of the service was when, due to unavoidable circumstances, we were delayed in starting in on the 3rd course - after a couple walk-bys and concerned looks, the waiters asked us if we would like to have the course re-warmed, though we were adamant in being content with it as is (not as warm, still delicious, but I\'m getting to that). The polite, friendly attentiveness of all the staff made for an absolutely wonderful experience.\n\nAnd now onto the food...OMG NUM YUMMY NOM NOM NOM.\n\nWhoops, excuse me...what I meant to say was, the food was exquisite. Deciding on the 5-course sampler was a great choice, as we got to try some delicious courses we wouldn\'t normally order. Our clear favorite was the duck foie gras, which was a perfect blend of taste and texture. Other items included a sweet rabbit foie gras, sliced duck breast, smoked salmon, and roasted deer. C\'est magnifique!\n\nMy experiences with French cuisine is limited, but I believe that Nuance does it exactly how it should be done. And sure, we probably doubled our travel expenses that night (the complete opposite of what we were actually trying to achieve), but I wouldn\'t have had it any other way. \n\nP.S. if you do end up making the trip out, for goodness sake, do not walk, as it becomes very quickly apparent that there is no sidewalk.\n\nP.P.S. Bring your own cigarettes, as it also becomes very quickly apparent that they don\'t sell cigarettes in Canadia. Also, gas. And milk.'

The waitress was a little slow but she apologized for being slow and brought me a lot of coffee which I appreciated because I was up before 7am that day.\n\nThe reason I'm not a fan is because of the food.  I realize this is IHOP and the food isn't supposed to be fantastic but it's supposed to be represented corrected by the pictures on the menu and warm right? I ended up getting the fit and free breakfast meal. Which consisted of two scrambled substitute eggs, dry toast, a cup of fruit and two pieces of turkey bacon. Sounds good right? I thought it would be too! \n\nWhen the food came out I was super dissappointed. I ended up getting half an egg, a bowl of spoiled fruit that I couldn't eat, turkey bacon and toast. The toast was good but can you really mess up toast? The turkey bacon was chewy and my eggs were cold. I really wish they would have told me there was not going to be as much food as advertised or I would have gotten something different."

S"Da Giovani is really a two in one deal.  One side is a dedicated Italian restaurant with waiters and a reasonably close facsimile of classic Italian dishes.  On the other much smaller side they operate a pizza by the slice joint, which is my focus today.\n\nSurprisingly there isn't much in the way of Pizza near Berri-UQAM.  There's a popular place inside the station, but for several blocks in any direction Da Giovani is the only option.  That's OK though because their pizza is actually better than average. Prices may be on the high side, but again so is the quality.  \n\nThe place is small and old and dare I say well-worn.  Even though they are open late, they don't have much of a selection after about 7pm, so go early.  It's a pizza by the slice place, and a decent one at that, but it is just pizza so don't set your expectations too high."

S'\xc3\x94 DIOS MIO!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo, about a month ago I was thinking to myself: "Man, those tortas at Tachido are amazing, it\'d be great to have a tamale somewhere in Montr\xc3\xa9al as well!  Maybe I should learn how to make them myself?  I wish that I had a grandmother from Mexico to show me how..." and suddenly, whilst heading back from buying something or other at the Delphi, I noticed a cute little pink sign poking out of the place that used to be that librairie/caf\xc3\xa9/n\'importquoi that did incredibly well while Arts was shut for renovatios.  I decided to investigate.\n\nFirst impression: the windows were filled with catholicious candles and further in there were some repurposed wine boxes and cute little knick-knacks from el pais viejo adorabling (=adorning+aborable) the walls.  My interest was MUY piqued.\n\nAfter strolling up to the bar, I checked to see if there were any TAMALES available and unfortunately they weren\'t going to be ready for an hour...no probs, I assume that they were devoured by the teeming masses.  I returned after a few hours and asked the delightful chef/owner about what the tamale offerings were: spicy chili and cheese, chicken and salsa verde, and by the time I had dug into those I had completely lost my mind and forgotten what the third one was.  It was delicious, I can say that for certain.  Most insane thing: 6 tamales = 15$, canadian.  For perspective on this for those who are uninitiated to tamales, I used to pay $3 in 2006 in California and think that that was cheap.  I\'ll be surprised if they don\'t bump up a little in price, but in any case they are certainly worth an extra buck or so.  In addition to the tamales, I did notice that they offer some other delicious treats (pozole, tortas, etc) for what looks like a fair price.\n\nI returned today as I am a glutton and was feeling peckish on the way home from the Y, so I picked up 4 more and as well as a concha and I was again shocked at how good her food is.  It was sort of slow we had a little minute to chat and it turns out that she\'s got a great deal of experience in her madre\'s restaurant in Mexico and she went to culinary school in Mexico as well!  I used to snarf down conchas in Watsonville any time I passed a Panaderia and this one was the absolute freshest and lightest one that I\'ve had to date.\n\nI haven\'t tried it yet, but, horchata too?!?!  I am hooked.\n\nViva la tamalera!'

S"With three rounds of Lulu's On the Move under my belt, it's time to for a review!\n\nOur first encounter was at a food truck meet up going on over at Plant World Nursery.  All we wanted was a Cuban Sandwich ($5) and a Iced Cuban Coffee ($1).  What the Husband liked about their sandwich was that they had two variations of pork in there - slow roasted pork leg and rosemary ham.\n\nThey also gave us a complimentary order of their Dirty Chips ($4) which was so awesomely good that it had us wanting more!  There's barbecued pulled pork, Mexican cheese, jalapeno hollandaise sauce and cilantro sitting on a bed of potato chips.  \n\nOf course, we couldn't say no to an order of their Key Lime Beignets ($4).  It's dusted with coconut sugar alongside a Tres Leches Caramel sauce and it's yum yum good!  And plenty enough to share!\n\nAs a result, we're always looking for where their truck is and the Husband got another chance to savor their Dirty Chips once again.\n\nMost recently, we found them last week and although Dirty Chips wasn't on their blackboard, it's on their printed menu (so be sure to ask)!  The Husband wanted his own order, so we got two.  I also got an order of their Roasted Chicken Mac N Cheese ($6).  It's definitely more chicken and cheese than mac, that's for sure!  The chicken was so super moist and juicy and it had to be a crime to be considered chicken!  That dark meat sure taste good!  It's dripping with cheese sauce, and there's also some mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in there too.\n\nSadly, I haven't been able to order their beignets due to a restricted diet, but they had them with strawberries last week.  Also unique was their Homemade Corned Beef Hash Sandwich that I saw a few people chowing on.  \n\nOverall, the Husband won't bother with a food truck meet up if Lulu's and SnoW Ono aren't there.  Good thing I agree with him!\n\nNote: Double check the prices - they are listed differently on the blackboard menu and the printed sheet one.  So confirm your final purchase cost!"

Was at least 15 - 20 minutes between successive courses. \n\n$14 for a Manhattan cocktail makes you wonder if you are in Manhattan.\n\nUnder poured wine is a disgrace, especially when the glasses are marked for pour levels.\n\nWaitstaff made no attempts at explaining the delays, until we brought to their attention that we saw the party of 30 people leave the building.\n\nFor $100 per person, the evening was a total failure in our book.'

S"Waltz & Weiser Saloon is a great place to become inebriated while at the Westin Kierland Resort in Scottsdale. \n\nI walked in here with about 150 other people and considering the mass demand for cocktails, the bartenders really kept up and provided excellent service throughout my visit. They have IPA on draft, which was awesome, and they pour relatively strong mixers considering this is a resort bar. A drunk golfer dropped and subsequently broke a tall glass full of Long Island Iced Tea and the staff cleaned it up in record time and even remade thew man's drink without batting an eye. Spot on service, really.\n\nThey also have a man that appears at sunset each night with a set of bagpipes and he plays a song or two to serenade the evenings arrival. This is either really cool or really annoying depending on your take on bagpipe music."

S"Easy-going Portuguese place with a patio on the Duluth cobblestones. I'd been here a bunch years ago when the Doxas brothers used to jam and you could see some of the city's best young jazz in front of a tiny crowd. After a bit of an accidental hiatus, I had an impromptu dinner party here recently. One warm and breezy evening on the terrasse we ordered a hearty mix of tapas and mixed grill and really enjoyed everything that came rolling out hot as soon as it was ready: the sardines, chicken, chorizo, grilled veggies, pork, grilled calamari, and oh yes also the pitchers of beer all seemed perfect in that moment (admittedly a little extra glossed from street festing.) Nothing fancy, but fresh nice food, served by older, yet still swarthy and handsome Portuguese gentlemen with sunny senses of humour and good karmic food timing."

S"Sandwich Culture is a straight up great place to grab a sandwich on the go.\n\nWith cheap but appeasing teas, coffees and hot chocolates, it's a hot spot for people snacking on their lunch break.\n\nThey have soup of the day, toasties, full breakfasts, ridiculously well priced baked potatoes and a number of sandwich fillings to see you through a day at work. If you're stopping by for leisure purposes, there are a few fold away tall chairs laid out so you can prop up the bar by the window. But this is a more functional sandwich bar rather than being somewhere you'd sit in. It's clean and cosy, but always crammed full of people waiting for their takeouts so if you're going to stay awhile I'd recommend coming first thing on a Monday morning.\n\nIt's not black tie dining or an ambient coffee shop, but it does the job if you've got a grumbling belly at lunchtime. Fills a gap and is tasty enough!"

Here, you will delight yourself in flavorful dishes, of Spanish and Amerindian influences; authentic in it's preparation, made by friendly people. The pupusas here, are delicious and taste great the next day. I enjoyed their  yuca con chicharron, pastelitos, and other dishes. They always have fresh fruit beverages, like tamarindo and guanabana, plus Salvadoran horchata, and most importantly, friendly staff.  Which in my opinion , are ingredients for a nice experience."

S"I was tramping around Montreal by foot when a big snow storm hit.  My husband and I kept looking for an open restaurant or pub so we could get out of the weather.  Because of the holidays, not much was open (or friendly, oddly enough) and our faces were frozen.  Without nearby options, I said, let's get on the metro and go to the Tavern.  I was not disappointed with our choice.\n\nThe staff was friendly and welcoming as usual.  As we sat at the bar, we watched the restaurant quickly fill up with neighborhood locals.  We started with the ginger shrimp.  My husband was amazed to see me devour the shrimp as I don't particularly like seafood.  I said, I don't like shrimp, but I eat them here.  They're that good.\n\nFor mains, we split the salmon tartare.  The crostini was perfectly toasted and the salmon was married perfectly with its bed of cool, creamy avocado.  We also split the mac and cheese and the meatball sliders.  The sliders were perfect.  Just the right amount of spice and sauce over juicy meatballs.  I have never ordered the mac and cheese here because I always refused to spend over twenty dollars on something that I can make well at home.  Big mistake.  This is not your grandmother's mac and cheese.  It is worth every penny and I would be tempted to move to Montreal in order to eat this on a regular basis.  Bite the bullet and find out what you're missing.\n\nI can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town!"

My latest visit left me quite displeased. I waited 15 mins for my order and when it finally was ready, my frys were  missing. After pointing out the issue, I had to wait an additional 5 minutes. I got over it, big deal. But then my daughter asks me for an icecream cone so I go to order. As I approach the register another patron enters and is behind me. When this happens the manager and employee completely overlook me standing there placing my order and service the patron after me. At this point I am shocked and appauled.

I've received my order 10 minutes earlier than quoted but I've also waited 30 minutes past the estimated delivery time. It's a crap shoot for delivery I guess.  When you have hungry people waiting, every minutes seems like an hour.\n\nThe pizza has also been on the same level.   Sometimes they are very chintzy on toppings and other pizzas are perfectly done.  I don't know how to feel about that.  I do know the pan pizzas are so filling and usually can only eat a few pieces before I'm stuffed.  \n\nI know how bad the breadsticks are for me, but I still love them!

Of course I no longer remember the names of the ones we tried, but they were tasty.\n\nI ordered the eggplant (I mean aubergine) dish. It was a strange hodgepodge of ingredients in a dish with mozzarella melted over it - more like something I would make at home when I'm trying to clean out the fridge rather than a combination of foods chosen to compliment each other. But it got the job done (the job being getting rid of my ravenous hunger). My dining companion was equally satisfied-but-not-impressed with his burger and chips.

S'If you are going to do fast food you could do far worse than Arby\'s. I enjoy the traditional roast beef sandwich(s) and I am in love with Horsey Sauce. This horseradish sauce is so good it should be reclassified as a "beverage".\nWhat would normally be a four-star rating drops to two-stars at this location because the service is so poor. I work near this Arby\'s so frequently someone in the office makes an "Arby\'s run". It is a rare day that the order is correct. Inevitably some items are missing, prepared wrong or there are overcharges on the bill. In addition to the inaccuracy of the service the employees are SLOW! It is hard to get in and out in under 15 minutes, even if you are only getting a soda. \nI had noticed that they have a pattern in their service. \n1) Take an order from the customer\n2) Wait till that order is complete and delivered to the customer\n3) Take the next order for the next customer\nYes, the counter person will actually ignore the people staring blankly in line and wait by the pass-through window for the sandwiches on order.\nPlease note, my dissatisfaction is only with this location. Other Arby\'s are run efficiently, yet for some reason this unit has a manager that is not detail oriented. This is evident from the advertising poster quoting " \'tis the season to give Arby\'s gift cards", a poster that should not have been hanging up in late June. Worse than the lack of attention given to the advertising art is the manager\'s lack of attention to the store\'s sanitation. It is -- at best -- grimy. Where floor meets wall there is a dark build-up of mop residue; what we in the industry call "mop slop". This staining tells me they mop the dining room floors with dirty water. Table bases and chairs have not been wiped down in moths (or years) and there is a staining on the walls from when smoking was permitted in restaurants. I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.\nIn conclusion I\'ll say I like Arby\'s, but this store lacks the service and management to match the standards of the chain. If you do go there check your order and your receipt before leaving.'

S'Typical Montreal greasy spoon. The service from the waitress was great and quick, to burger was the expected mediocre. The biggest problem was the poutine.  I love poutine, and never (I mean NEVER) should it be grated cheese instead of curds.  Get a clue, you are THE? greasy spoon in St. Henri, get some curds.'

S'What a little piece of heaven! Went with a colleague for lunch, and thoroughly enjoyed it. We started with a couple of cod cakes - the cod and potato mixture was smooth, and they were beautifully fried. I then had a chorizo sandwich, which was nicely spiced (the server asked how spicy I wanted it, and it was delivered at just the right mild heat). At first the sandwich appears to have a disproportionate amount of meat to bun, but you soon realize that the sausage is so flavourful that more would be just too much. The accompanying fries were delicious - seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic. Side salad was fresh and the vinaigrette helped cut the heavier dish. My colleague had the chicken breast and said it was delicious.\nWe finished off the meal with coffee (served with steamed milk on the side, a nice touch), and a nata. The nata is a custard filled tart,  sprinkled with cinnamon - so good that I picked up 6 to bring home.\nResto was clean, food fresh and service was great - I will be back!'

He acknowledged us, said he'd be with us in a moment.   Which it was fine, I had no idea what I wanted. I was surprised he was the only person up front at 4 pm besides the one person in the kitchen.\n\nHe didn't mind that I had a custom order,  he was more than accommodating.  You can tell when someone genuinely cares about their job. He's making the best of it,  he stays busy.  After he dropped off the food, he started sweeping up. Really nice guy. He could work his way up to a manager someday.  Great work ethic. \n\nGreat first time experience."

Period. I also assumed we would be asked to sit outside, rather we were given the choice -- which may have just been a matter of good manners on the hostess' part. Regardless, I decided that we ought to sit outside so our younger dessert guests wouldn't disturb other couples. It was well after the girls' bedtime already, and being out on the town with the grown-ups that night was really special -- literally all the other diners at Sucr\xc3\xa9 were obviously couples on intimate dates (appropriately, considering the hour).\n\nMy Sacher Torte was great, the girls each had Noir de Chocolat, which they LOVED pronouncing with a French accent (I feel sorry for their mother, these sprouts musta been bouncing off the walls for hours after ingesting that much chocolate!) My broher, a chef, split the Cr\xc3\xa8me Brul\xc3\xa8e Trio with his girlfriend, and they had the only complaint of the night -- apparently the texture was just (slightly) imperfect. But, like I said, he's a chef and therefore very critical of gourmet foods.\n\nI will definitely be coming back, Sucr\xc3\xa9 was nothing short of mind-blowing!

S'On a recent trip to Montreal, the wife and I thought we\'d hit up "Little Italy" aka "Petite Italie" to sample some French-Canadian-Italian cuisine.  We checked out Yelp and some other sources in advance and settled on a couple of places that served pizza as our primary targets. It happened to be a particularly cold evening and before we left the hotel, the kind manager at the front desk suggested a third spot, "just in case." Never having been to the area before, we felt our way, through the strange streets and the increasing chill in the air, to Rue Dante, where our first dinner choice turned out to be a bit upscale for Pizza. While the place seemed pretty busy there also appeared to be plenty of room for at least two more. Wrong we were. As it turns out, all those empty tables and chairs were \'booked\', we were told by a very snooty hostess and there was just no possible way we would be enjoying pizza in their very popular spot on this particular Friday night. No worries, because as it turned out, that back up eatery suggested to us on our way out of the hotel was just down the block. On the way, we passed another decent looking place and as we walked with purpose  through the frigid cold Canadian evening we agreed we\'d circle back if necessary.   Sure enough, chic hot spot number two - only half full with customers - was also "fully booked" and we were SOL once again. The owner was kind enough to send us down the street to yet another place he told us he "eats at himself" and of course when we got there, it was completely out of business. Guess it had been a while since he enjoyed their cuisine. At this point we were cold, hungry and starting to feel like we were trapped in a surreal film with food everywhere yet nothing we could eat.  So we doubled back to that place we passed between our first two rejections and sure enough, it too was completely booked. Strike three! How was this possible? It was 7:30 on a Friday night in Montreal and apparently impossible to eat in "Petite Italie."  We had just about given up, as we walked passed the most popular pizza place in town and saw two hours worth of crowd waiting outside in the cold. And it was at that moment we spotted Tratotoria Casa Mia. On the doorstep was a guy wearing an apron and stealing a smoke. Inside 6, maybe 8 folks enjoying their meals and plenty of other unpopulated empty tables. The feel was casual and comfortable, but was there room for us? The nice Italian woman reading her paper at an empty table got up to greet us and before we knew it, our Montreal dinner nightmare was over. Within  minutes, that same Italian woman would be in the kitchen cooking up our meal.\nOur waiter, busy as he was taking care of all the tables, was welcoming, took our order quickly, made sure we got our bread and beverages while we waited and in good time, brought our lasagna and pasta, too.  And much to our surprise, considering how empty this place looked and how no other restaurant in the area would even let us in, the pasta and lasagna were both really good.  In short, this was a terrific little restaurant that apparently is not part of the "scene" in "Petite Itlalie" which is too bad because the food was terrific, the service was good, the prices were more than fair and the people who run the place were flat out warm and welcoming.\nIf you find yourselves in "Petite Itlaie" at some point without reservations, skip the crowds, skip the "scene" and skip the most popular joints in the hood and slide into Tratorria Casa Mia for lunch or dinner, instead. It\'s worth it not to wait.'

S'Move over Branson, Missouri! The Barleen family has built quite the variety show mecca in Apache Junction. The Arizona Opry is a hoot! \n\nIt\'s like a 1980s Disney variety show (no characters) crossed with Hee Haw! One of the performers looks like John Denver and sings a few covers. (There\'s a John Denver Tribute Show planned for February) Another dresses up like Willie Nelson. The husband is an original member of the Tokens (The Lion Sleeps Tonight) and, of course, reprises the song as a part of the show. They play about 70 different instruments throughout the night. \n\nThe show takes place in a big hall off Old West Highway, filled with snowbirds and Red Hat Ladies. There\'s a gift shop with novelties like blinking rings and yodeling pickles and a "record store" with CDs from all of the performers. They\'ve created quite the library over the years!! \n\nFor the low, low price of $29 including tax and tip ($22 for kids age 3-12), you get all of this PLUS a cafeteria-inspired meal of roast beef or chicken (depending on the night) and chocolate cake. Lemonade and coffee are included and beer is available for $4.50/bottle. \n\nIt\'s family fun, although, somewhat cheesy -- you\'ve gotta give it to them - they\'ve got talent. \n\nSo, grab the kids or the old folks, and head out to the Opry. It\'s a kick!'

S'Last  night I ordered the #17 two Chili Rellenos and #19 Burrito and Enchilada.  First, the enchilada, refried beans and rice were cold on both plates.  The green chilis were tough and needed a steak knife to cut.  The burrito must have been made by an Asian.  The only thing in it other than tasteless meat, was sorry onion and green bell pepper (like your last Asian dish).  NEWS FLASH:  NEW ASIAN AND MEXICAN VEGETABLES - ONION AND BELL PEPPER.  NO THANKS... I WILL eat at other places.'

S"We needed a place for a quick and hot breakfast.  We got the hot breakfast, but it wasn't so quick. Coffee was good, but getting a refill was a bit of a challenge. If the restaurant had just ONE more waitress, it would be a huge improvement.  The hash brown potatoes are very good and you should order them on the side if they're not already included in your entree.  Also, the bathrooms are somewhat inconveniently located...you have to leave the restaurant and go to the back of the building to use these facilities.  If you want a pretty good breakfast, and have PLENTY of time to spare, then this isn't a bad choice. But if you're in a hurry, find someplace else."

It has a similar feel to a Wetherspoons pub, although as far as I am aware it isn't one. Big comfy chairs, cheapish drinks and cheap food. I haven't eaten here so can't comment on how the food tastes, but the menu is your typical pub food. Having seen food pass me by for other tables it does actually look quite good and good sized portions. It gets quite busy in here with people going for something to eat after work or before the cinema so I guess it must be quite good.\n\nAccording to my friend who drinks ales they do a good selection, but I don't even know what an ale is so I can't comment. Overall its a good reliable, spacious bar for a cheap drink and some cheap grub before heading off to the overpriced cinema."

S'This place opened a couple of days ago in the shopping center across from the LakePointe business park.  The food quality is about on par with Qdoba or Salsaritas, and has the same "assembly line" style of ordering.  The difference here being that the dishes are Chinese instead of Mexican.  \n\nI had the Rice Bowl with grilled chicken topped with the smoky chili sauce (their spiciest option).  I was pleasantly surprised with the taste.  The sauce had just the right amount of kick and the chicken and rice tasted very fresh.\n\nThe place is small and fills up quickly, but there is patio seating available out back.  The decor is vibrant and classy, with pictures of Chinese landmarks dotting the walls.  There are interesting factoids below each picture and also on the containers that hold your food -- a charming touch.\n\nI have two complaints, however: First, the drink selection is very limited (Coke, Diet Coke, Water).  Second, all food is served in styrofoam "take-out" boxes, even if you\'re dining in.  It would be nice to see something slightly less crude -- even if it\'s just black plastic plates.\n\nI\'d like to give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can\'t award half stars I\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt.  They\'re a brand new place and the owner seems receptive to comments, so I think they\'ll steadily improve over time. It wouldn\'t surprise me to see more locations popping up around town in the near future.'

S"03/06/10\n\nI rarely find myself in this part of Phoenix, so when I knew I was going to be in the area, I had two places in mind for a late lunch.  I was hoping to dine at Bobby Q, but I found the prices a bit too steep to dine alone, so I headed here.\n\nFound the menu uninteresting that day, perhaps bec. I was looking forward to good bbq fare, but I finally settled on the basics- hummus and falafel.  For those who care, the falafel were fried in soybean oil.  (Most places I've inquired at use corn, and sometimes peanut, oil.)  The platter looked very appetizing, but don't be fooled!  The hummus was very bland, and the falafel pieces weren't that great, either.  I had to ask for lemon to get some flavor out of the falafel, and the hummus' saving grace was that it lent the falafel some lubrication.  The pita bread was probably the best thing out of the whole meal, and that's not saying much.\n\nAfterwards, I checked out the bakery next door for some expensive baklava.  I chose three varieties, and I found them all too heavy on soggy phyllo and lacking in honey.  \n\n$13 for terrible baklava and $7 (or more) on less than mediocre hummus and falafel made for such a disappointing adventure that day.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Not even to anyone that didn't like me.  (But then again, I'd never do that, anyway.)"

The owner is so friendly & after a couple visits he remembers you, what you like, he even remembered my son\'s name! The food is so good, and inexpensive, we go to the mall just to pick up a healthier alternative for dinner - who would have guessed? \n\nOh & SO  inexpensive, you can request specialty rolls for  about $6 & if you are in a hurry, or get some grab and go boxes of tuna or rainbow roll, or pick up a "california roll" for only $2.50 for example! The prces really are incredible, and there are so many things to choose from it\'s fun to try new stuff, but I still get my faves, gresh Tuna Nigiri and a special order just for me. Someone said their noodles were bland, & not sure what they expected but I prefer rice anyway, & their fried rice is real nice!

S"We ate at the original Riverview around 2-3 times a month for over 30 years.  It was a big disappointment when they closed after 67 years at this location.  We were excited when we learned the Riverview had reopened, so we went to check it out. \nThey did a facelift on the interior and added a new bar.  They kept the casual and homey feel, which was nice.  They have removed most of the seating in the large back dining room and converted it into a game room and dance hall with a bandstand.  They mounted a bunch of TV's around the restaurant and they were tuned to college basketball.  We were there for dinner, so these additions were of little interest to us.\nWe were seated quickly, and our drinks were brought at once.  We ordered the blackened oysters appetizer.  It took 25 minutes before the appetizer and salads were brought out.  The salad was unremarkable and the spoonful of dressing was not enough.  The oysters were essentially raw and coated in spices.  Fortunately, we like raw oysters so we really didn't have a problem with that, other than the powdery taste of the spice.  If you are expecting to have your oysters cooked (as 'blackened' usually indicates) steer clear of this dish.\nA short time later the entrees were delivered.  But, they weren't OUR entrees.  The waitstaff apparently got their tables mixed up and they belonged elsewhere.  Our entrees finally arrived almost an hour after we ordered, and the food was NOT worth the wait. \nI ordered the Mediterranean Tuna cooked rare.  The fish had barely touched the skillet, was not seared properly, and was pretty much cold and raw throughout.  Again, I like sushi so the lack of cooking was not the problem, rather the black olive chutney they covered the fish with was bitter and unappetizing, totally ruining the meat.  The menu said it was served over rice, but I didn't get that.  Instead they substituted a bowl of bland grits.  I also tried the slaw, but it was totally bland also.  I was really hoping they had gotten the original Burns' Riverview sour slaw recipe, but clearly they did not.\nMy wife got the blackened salmon, which was cooked nicely, but her sides also included the grits and a mixed veg bowl that she did not care for.  A slice or two of lemon and some tartar would have gone a long way to improving the dish.\nAs we looked around (plenty of free time during the wait) we saw that we were not alone in receiving slow food service. We spoke to the manager, and he apologized for the long wait and cited 'equipment problems' in the kitchen.  He offered to comp the meal, but when the check arrived we were charged full price.  To be fair, the manager spoke to us as we were leaving and offered a refund, but at that point we just wanted to leave.\nIf we see feedback that they have improved their service and quality, we may give them another try sometime in the future, but, after this experience, it is not on the horizon."

S"The sheer amount of times I have passed this place on the bus and wondered how to correctly pronounce the name is the main reason one day I got off the bus and threw cautuon to the wind and headed into Qupi. \n\nThe cafe itself is a little bit on the shabby side, and very small. The food is an eclectic mix of greek and traditional cafe fare. I'm not sure that this combination works together, but judging by the sheer number of people who passed in and out of the doors as I sat eating goes to show that some people must really appreciate this place. \n\nThe staff were friendly and very efficiant, managing to get through customers like a machine gun through tissue paper. Rather impressive.\n\nAs for the pronunciation of the name, I'm still not sure."

S"5 stars and deservedly so!\n\nQuiet but friendly staff and Bindi herself is lovely, telling us about different dishes on offer.\n\nFood was superb! I like eating veggie anyway and don't mind missing meat so this place is vegetarian heaven. Lots of little bites, shared platter type dishes and a thali - choice of curries with rice and chapati's. Being gluten free I thought that I'd miss out on the chapati's but no, myself and Jenny got GF versions which were lovely. The pumpkin curry made specially for our gang celebrating Thanksgiving was so yummy. I did order too much food - the chilli fries were lovely, as were Jenny's casava chips. Lovely, freshly cooked onion bhajis and poppadoms - I was stuffed afterwards and felt guilty about leaving such yummy food.  The attention to detail in the spice and combination of flavours was immense and blew me away - I am hoping to go back soon. I was in work the following day and recommended it to a friend (vegetarian) who went that night, loved it and is already planning a return trip this week.\n\nDrinks reasonable - the sauvignon blanc was great value at \xc2\xa310 per bottle and went lovely with the food I'd ordered and a bottle at \xc2\xa310 is very good value as glasses are \xc2\xa34. I tried some of Cressi's passionfruit juice which was gorgeous too so if you are avoiding booze then try this. Great little place, amazing food and service and such great value. Being GF, don't let the menu fool you as some of it looks quite wheat based as it is based on street food - many dishes can be adapted to suit such is Bindi's knowledge of dietary requirements :-)"

We had a drink and given that this seemed to be our only option in that general area (at least fairly close to CTS) to get a drink then I think 3 stars is sufficient.\n\nYou can smoke here so that's a huge negative but the place is unpretentious and really casual - I'm talking dive bar casual.\n\nThe bartender was super friendly and the drinks were super cheap.  $4 wine people!  I'm not sure that I'll be back to Bobby's since it's not an area I frequent, however it definitely served it's purpose - a casual hang out spot for some girlfriends to grab a drink and chit chat before CTS."

On Friday night's John Burak is the musician and does a great job!  The only challenge we had was food allergies (I can't eat gluten or soy), the first time we went the waiter didn't know for sure and just assumed.  However the second time the waiter asked the chef and was very helpful.  I had a pretty good reaction the first time and none the second (I ordered the delicious fish tacos the second time).  So if you go with food allergies make sure they talk to the chef.  And its pretty busy in the winter time so if you go between 6 and 8 make sure you make reservations (or go later like we did)"

S'I\'ve come to this place a few times over the years and always enjoyed the laid back feel to it. The Princess Cinema, which is a long-standing indie movie theatre institution in Waterloo, expanded a few years back to create the Princess Twin, along with the Princess Cafe, which opens off of one side of the theatre.\n\nThere is a clean look to the decor, with elegantly matted artwork on the walls and a light, airy feel to the interior. It feels like a cosy, inviting place to hang out of an afternoon or evening. There are also little adorable button bouquets on all the tables, a mishmash of whitewashed chairs at the tables and water is served in vintage glasses with cool old images on them--all of which add up to a really appealing, groovy vibe (they were playing Medeski, Martin & Wood when we came in--another point in their favour and good addition to the feel).\n\nOn this occasion, we came by here because we had Groupons--but we will most definitely be back. The meal included paninis, a side and a coffee. My decaf was delicious, as was my California Veggie panini, along with a walnut side with balsamic dressing. My companion had an Italian panini with a pasta salad (pasta, olives, feta). He also passed on the coffee and instead purchased their dessert hot chocolate, which is thick and super rich--check out the photos of the spoon standing upright in it--more like warm, thick chocolate pudding in a cup than drinking chocolate, really.\n\nIn all, a really nice place to hang out--and of course, the movie theatre and magic store (complete with the sign "children left unattended will be sold to the circus") all add to the overall feel.\n\nBTW, sorry for the dim images--we came at night and our table was in one of the less brightly lit portions of the cafe. Hopefully you can make out the spoon standing in the hot chocolate, and the panini and salad (with cloth napkins and vintage glasses).'

S"5 stars for a kid's pizza place you say?  Yes, and I will tell you why.  This Peter Piper Pizza location is the best I have been to.  Clean, friendly staff, and great pizza (really!  try the Chicago Classic - yum!).  A good place for both adults and kids to hang out.  They have beer and wine; it's an inexpensive happy hour for the ol' folks!  The gameroom guy treated my children like gold, fixing a broken game promptly & even bumping up their ticket count a bit so my daughter could get a coveted 500 ticket prize.  Management ensured we had a reserved table for the last birthday party we held for 20+ people, and the staff promptly served the pizzas directly to our table (normally you get a buzzer to pick up your own).  You can tell that the staff at this location takes pride in their work and serving the customer.  My family and I are loyal fans!"

This, coupled with work related despair has resulted in us popping into The Orchard much more frequently.  I'm not saying we're going in every night, but about once a week/once a fortnight kind of frequent.  \n\nNo mater what time of day it is always comfortably busy, which to me is a sign of a very good local.  \n\nIt has been nice to see that the staff are obviously fed well, get on with eachother and have fun, while not appearing to take the piss.  One of the managers is also one of if not the best food service manager I've ever had the pleasure of observing.  He knows his customers, knows what they like to eat and drink, where they like to sit, and is a whiz at multitasking.

I brought the order back, went to the staff and informed them of the error, and they promptly corrected it.  Plus, they let me keep the "mistakes" and I gave it away to someone else.\n\nStaff is usually pretty nice and accommodating.  Food isn\'t that great but what do you expect from a fast food joint?

S"I won't beat around the bush here, NiuKee is a hole in the wall. Down a darkened side street with an abandoned lot on one side and something forgettable on the other side, the customer entrance looks more like a service entrance.  Proceed up the decrepit looking stairs and on the second floor amongst the yellowing Chinese kitsch used as decor is the dining area.  Crowded with assorted tables and chairs that saw better days a decade ago take a seat and grab a menu. Be sure to glance at the aging dumbwaiter which just seems so out of place to me, but undeniably useful.\n\nIf you've made it this far(into my review and the restaurant), it's fair to conclude the NiuKee isn't about the decor.  You're here for the food and NiuKee serves up some of the most authentic Mainland Chinese food you'll be able to find in Montreal.  The first thing to note is that they do serve cold beer, which is always welcome. I'd recommend eating with friends on a Friday or Saturday night before heading to a more serious watering hole.\n\nThe food is exactly as you would find if you were in a similar establishment in China.  The spicy chicken is actually spicy and has bones, they serve classics like julienned potatoes with peppers, spicy green beans with pork, and the always popular cucumbers and garlic appetizer.  Having soup with dinner is the norm in China and here at NiuKee we usually choose the fish with pickled vegetables since the broth makes a delicious soup.\n\nNot fine dining, but good food at decent prices and very authentically Chinese.  It's probably worth bringing a Chinese friend with you if you aren't familiar with real Chinese food. Though, if you are feeling adventurous, go without and play food roulette, because remember they have beer and everything is better with beer."

S'I stumbled on this spot while reading an article about the Las Vegas mob. This place used to be called Starboard Tack in the 70s and Al Bramlett the local culinary union leader hired 2 men to plant car bombs here in 1976. The bombs failed to detonate and Mr Bramlett didn\'t pay for the job. One thing leads to another and Mr Bramlett ends up dead in the desert. \nNow on to Gilligans, I really like the decor. The nautical theme is evident outside and inside, a true throw back to the old days where the outside looks like a dock, the inside is made to look like a ship (on restaurant side) etc. They have really cool stained glass art behind the booths. Now my problem is I read the website menu that included things like filet and shrimp for 13.99 and many other enticing items. The problem is when I got there the menu was totally different and about 15-20% more expensive than the website shows. Have to knock off stars for that.\nI ordered chicken marsala made by the waiter/chef , who looks just like Norm Macdonald and was an awesome guy. The chicken was great and the pasta and garlic bread were plentiful and adequate. The marinara was not great but its not like this is an Italian place. I paid about 20 for my meal and 2 bottles of domestic suds. I will come back for the Saturday prime rib special. Just a note, the location is very very odd. It seems to almost be in an apartment buildings parking lot off a side street in a worn out area of town. Don\'t let that fool you because this is the type of homey bar/restaurant (with some interesting "mob" history) you don\'t really find in this town anymore (like the Coachmen).'

They don't have the most culinary creative menu but it's pretty yummy food at a cheap price. \n\nIf you are looking for a fast, cheap lunch that's a step up from the regular fast food- this is a good place to get it. \nThe menu ranges from Philly cheese steaks to a soup and salad combo and they serve breakfast all day long (well until they close at 2 p.m.) \n\nThe owners are usually in the restaurant greeting guest and working the grill. They are very friendly and truly appreciate the business that they get."

S"Oh, Chickadee's. You had me at spicy burger challenge. You know just the way to call my name.\n\nWe went to Chickadee's for lunch after I heard about the Beast of the East (a habenero pepper encrusted patty with spicy chili, pepper jack cheese and hot sauce served on a kaiser roll) and just had to give it a whirl. Apparently if I ate it in under 5 minutes I could win a free t-shirt. The flavor was really solid; the chili had enough flavor to stand on it's own (or be wonderful atop the fries that come with) and the patty was steaming hot and was a really enjoyable meat. I got a new t-shirt.\n\nThe fries themselves were pretty standard but not unpleasant. They have a house-made chip that could stand a little more crunch but was miles ahead of any pre-made crisps. They were quick to refill your soft drink without having to ask.\n\nThe service was good and everyone was really nice, including the owner who came over to chat. You can get your order to go or park it at one of tables in the bright dine in area which has some pretty neat art to look at if the mammoth menu isn't enough to keep you busy. The two of us got out for under $20 before tip and I know I will certainly be going back to try some if their non-challenge foodstuffs."

No veggies, no pickle... just that. Come on - work on presentation and quantities and you can probably charge $10 for that otherwise it's a fail.\n\nAntichuchos - slices of meat on a stick with bland side of corn and undercooked potatoes.  Meat was OK. Sides weren't. \n\nAppetizer (I think it was called pappas a la huancaina) - 3 sad pieces of cold boiled  potato served on a styrofoam plate covered with cheesy sauce (cold as well) - $5 is way too much for it."

S"In need of blue corn tortillas for a enchilada dish I am planning on making for our extended family at an important celebration this weekend, I went to all of my favorite Mexican supermarkets only to be disappointed. On-line, however, I discovered positive reviews of Mama Lola's Tortillas. While they mostly provide fresh tortilla products for the best restaurants in the Phoenix-metro area, they also sell about 20% of their products as stores such at Sprouts. When I went over to their office, which is located conveniently off of the highway, I discovered an amateur cook's treasure. All varieties of tortillas (corn and flour), freshly made of high quality ingredients, plus supplies for tamales, tortillas chips of a variety of colors, and even an assortment of pan dulce. While I was there I was invited by the very friendly Plant Manager, Jasmin Garcia, into her office to see some of her new product offerings. They have an impressive line of offerings, including tostada shells of various colors. I left with a handful of tasty blue corn tortillas, healthy but very tasty whole wheat tortillas, and a batch of awesome tasting red child whole wheat flour burrito-sized tortillas that my coworkers devoured when we tried them at lunch in the office. Given that their products are affordable, made without preservatives, and high quality ingredients, I can't see buying my tortillas anywhere else. What a great experience."

In spite of having more staff than you could shake a stick at I still had to go inside to firstly get hold of a menu so that we could order. We were quite hungry so thought a couple of snack plates out in the sunshine would be nice. 10 minutes later we\'d still not had our drinks order taken. Along comes a waitress...one Passionfruit Margarita and a coke please. No problem. 10 minutes after that someone comes out to say that "I\'m sorry we have no passionfruit would you like a normal Margarita?" No worries, yes please. 10 minutes after that a lady comes outside with the one drink, the Margarita...erm excuse me we ordered a coke too please. "Oh sorry, I\'ll just go and get it for you..." 5 minutes later it arrived. She didn\'t even ask if we would like any food. My god not that we would now given the it\'s taken 35minutes to get a drink in an empty restaurant/bar...\n\nThe menu however does look nice. Perhaps we will give it a try during one of their 50% off days as if we receive the same level of service I won\'t feel so enraged with half off the meal.\n\nThe Jury is out but in the meantime I\'m giving this place a 2 and it\'s only really for the surroundings not the minging Margarita or the poor poor service.'

Topped with sour cream, CHEEZ WIZ, carne asada and cotija cheese. I was going back and forth between liking it and not liking it. I was against the use of Cheez Wiz on this one because that\'s just not how you do carne asada fries. But does it taste good? Absolutely! 4/5\n\nHorchata:\nI haven\'t had horchata I didn\'t like.

They offer two types of fries for those that want variety, plus hashbrown sticks.  \nThis place is by no means "healthy", and their adds flaunt that!

I expected the service to be slow, as they cook everything to order.  I did not expect to have to ask for silverware and napkins, wait forever to have our plates cleared or to be charged for tap water.  The portions were fine, but we went because we had a $15 coupon, and we STILL ended up paying over $30 for our meal.  I\'m sorry, but it is not a $45 Friday night dinner kind of place.  As someone else stated, they argued with us over the "misunderstanding" over their unclear pricing. There is one price for kabobs on their paper menu, a lower price for kabobs on their posted menu, and we were charged yet a third higher price on the bill, and he refused to relent.  Since we are just visiting AZ, we won\'t be back, but I wouldn\'t return anyway.  Not good.'

We sat on the patio for 12 minutes while four servers and a manager walked by and didn\'t say anything to us. I finally stopped one of the servers to get menus and she tossed them on the table as she walked by not stopping at all.  It\'s apparent that owners and management don\'t review sites like yelp or they would see that the majority of the reviews are about their horrific service.

The flavor is excellent, but again they were a little soggy from being left on their steam table for a while.  I also had soup on both visits since it is getting colder out now.

Generally when visiting a Mexican establishment for the first time, I order pastor tacos. If they can't get that right, what's the purpose of trying anything else? I was not disappointed. \n\nI ordered 3 tacos ($2 each) to go and they arrived in an appropriate amount of time. The first thing I noticed was that they had corn tortillas - I hate corn tortillas, but shrugged it off and squeezed the fresh lime over the pastor tacos topped with fresh onions and cilantro and dived in. It was delicious. \n\nI have come to the conclusion that its not that I don't like corn tortillas, I just have hated the ones that I have had in the past. I associated corn tortillas with mealy and overpowering flavors, but that would not describe these tortillas. The portion was huge and my large appetite would have been more than satisfied with just two tacos. I can't wait to give this place another try.\n\nIf I was a Monona Grove student, which has an open campus, I would be spending every lunch hour at this place."

The placed I called home for breakfast, while it still says Trails End on the outside, is now Omega Coney Island.  I don't get the name but considering that everyone in Indian Trail is from New York or New Jersey, maybe they know.  \n\nThe family style dinners are gone, replaced with a wide array of Gyros, salads, burgers, coney dogs, and now breakfast (although no waffles after noon) served all day.  Horay!!! I love breakfast for dinner.  \n\nThe staff has always been a strong point for Trails End and the great service continues. While lightly staffed tonight, the change to a diner-esque menu should bring more the dinner crowd.  \n\nI had a gyro with fries and a western omelet with hash browns.  The gyro was pretty good.  Quite frankly, their gyros were always good and the tradition continues.  The fries...not so much.  While the old ones were a pre-cut crinkle cut while were great.  The new guys have decided to try making their own from raw potatoes.  Great idea - poor execution.  Great fries are fried twice for crispiness.  These were so limp, they should have been given viagra to perk up.  \n\nThe bad potatoes continued with the hash browns.  Hash browns they were not, more like hash cake.  Again, the others were probably a frozen mess (tasted like it), these were make with fresh potatoes (good) but were very mushy like mashed potatoes (bad).  \n\nThe Western wasn't bad but they were trying too hard to make a Western more than what it really is.  I love a Western that has ripe, crisp peppers and onions, bacon, ham, etc.  Someone thought of sauteing the vegetables prior to putting them into the omelet, which made the inside unnecessarily buttery. \n\nStill, I like the idea of this place and will definitely return as they will no doubt improve.  The old trails end was a four star favorite of mine.  I hope the Omega Coney Island makes it all five stars.  \n\n...plus, how can you not like a place with fried mushrooms?"

S'Let\'s start by saying that I have been to New Orleans a few times, so my standards are higher than most.  I think our friend Babs needs to stop using Sysco brand food and start working with higher quality ingredients.  She also should concentrate on the dishes she is best at.    We had the red beans and rice, with sausage as one of our dishes.  The temperature of the dish was not hot enough.  The beans weren\'t spicy.  The other dishes just lacked that "umph" that you get in NOLA.  Even here in Wisconsin, we should be able to produce food that has a little pizazz!  The spicy shrimp I got weren\'t even browned.  They just had some sauce on them.  It wasn\'t good.  Period. Frankly, I would recommend driving to Milwaukee and hitting Crawdaddy\'s if you want a taste of New Orleans.'

S"Let me start by saying I'm a New York native and I'm generally not satisfied with the delivery pizza options in the Verona area. That said, Topper's is very good considering its competition here on the south side.\n\nI ordered the 2 medium pizza deal for $7.99 (3 toppings) which is a very good price compared to Glass Nickel and AJ's. I also ordered hot buffalo boneless wings.\n\nThe crust on the hand-tossed pizza is superb, compared to every other pizza joint in the area. It has that super chewy mouth feel with a foldable slice that I have been hard-pressed to find outside of New York.\n\nThe cheese is decent low moisture mozzarella, not bad but not spectacular either. It's the same cheese everyone else uses and it's head and shoulders above the plastic, sickly sweet stuff that Pizza Hut throws on their pies. The tomato sauce is pretty standard too - the dipping sauces, while not my preferred way to eat pizza, make up for otherwise slightly bland tomato sauce. I could not stop dipping once I tasted the parmesan garlic sauce though - it is absolutely fantastic.\n\nFresh toppings round out the four stars - no canned mushrooms here and the onions were obviously sliced recently, not sitting in cold storage for two days.\n\nAs far as delivery goes, Topper's will be my first choice for value, and for that amazing crust that makes me feel like I'm 16 again, walking to the park after school and buying a couple slices of pepperoni from that pervy old Italian guy that ran the corner pizzeria. Glass Nickel is a close second but far too expensive for my preference.\n\nThe boneless wings? I'll have to revisit them another time. They had a nice hotness to them without too much fire, and were cooked well, but the breading was soggy with buffalo sauce by the time they arrived at my door and I missed out on the crunch factor which is the only reason I really ever buy boneless wings.\n\nAll in all, Topper's is my new favorite in the Verona area, but they don't really have any decent competition."

S"I'd always really thought of Whighams of a place for after work drinks rather than a restaurant but having recently dinned here I was pleasantly surprised at how well both elements of the place work together. \n\nThe sunken alcoves, that I'm assuming previously held wine barrels when it actually was a wine cellar, have a lovely cosy feel to them which is great if you have one to yourself. Sharing one with complete strangers however can feel a little awkward depending on your company as the music and chatter of the bar is really subdued in the little alcoves, so they can hear everything you're talking about. (Thankfully I've usually been sitting with a loud, exuberant group who's rowdiness tended to scare off anyone foolish enough to try and sit with us.) As you would expect the place has a good wine list and also provides a very nice list of cocktails. If the weather is nice there is also a teeny tiny beer garden that you can sit it, though it is usually full of smokers.\n\n The restaurant area is separated off a little from the main bar so it's not quite in the thick of things, though I wouldn't really want to eat here in the evenings on a weekend given how busy the bar gets. On the Wednesday I came in here for food the place was quite quiet and my friend and I got tucked away in a nice wee corner away from the hubbub of the bar. Seafood seems to be a speciality here with lots of fresh and enticing options on the menu. I opted for mussels while my friend had some oysters followed up with langoustines and pasta for mains. The food is lovely and it was nice to find a decent seafood restaurant outside of Leith. I'll probably stick to drinking here as opposed to eating but it's a lovely place to spend some time if you're in the West End."

S"Our office recently placed an order from TLC Wings & Grill.  While they have a huge selection of wings and sauces,  I wasn't really in the mood for chicken wings.  Instead, I opted for the Chicken Parmesan sub ($5.29) with a side order of fries ($1.89).\n\nThe chicken parm sub wasn't the smartest  choice for a take-out -- by the time the food arrived, the sauce had sort of soaked into the bread and made it a bit squishy. \n\nHowever, the flavor was very good and the portion size was huge (thankfully it was already cut in 2 - definitely enough for 2 meals!)  The fries were good, and they were very generous with the portion size of that as well. \n\nI would definitely order this again, but probably not for take-out.   I would also recommend giving these guys a try if you are looking for good quality wings & fries at reasonable prices."

S"Like Steph, I too am confused at why this place is called Double Dutch. It's a cafe in Edinburgh selling food from the Med. Maybe their geography is out since there is nothing particularly Dutch about this place.\n\nBut that doesn't matter, since the food and atmosphere are both rather nice.\n\nI LOVE Mediterranean food. I can't get enough of it. So this place does me nicely. They do great snacks, an amazing hangover cure breakfast (which isn't Greek inspired, but for 2.50 it's better than buying paracetomol if you've got a raging headache), panini's, wraps packed with fillings and mains such as my all time fave mousakka. \n\nAdditionally, they have light bites such as salads, plus dishes such as a spinach and feta pastry which may add a bit of flavour to your diet. Certainly there are some small dishes in here I've never tried before, and since they are an affordable way to work your way through the Mediterranean menu it's not too shabby.\n\nI visited this cafe on a summer's evening, when at 7pm there were drunks staggering about from neighbouring areas. I don't know if it was that feeling of deprivation from neighbourhoods I had walked through to get to this place that made it stand out, or just the fact that it's nice. But since it's a spacious, clean cafe offering you that little bit extra in terms of menu options, it certainly stands apart from other cafe's in this neck of the woods."

There is an extremely long line of green mold growth on the ceiling in the dining room that has moisture drops hanging from it- I can't believe this place hasn't been shut down for this reason alone.\n\n2. Absolutely no pride has been taken in the maintenance of the dining room: the carpet is worn extremely thin and is rippling throughout the room and the booths have many tares.\n\n3. Perhaps most scary is the food: If the management takes so little care of the dining area, how clean and sanitary can the cooking facility possibly be??? Furthermore, the temperature of the majority of the food on the buffets is way too low (I'd say mostly room temperature)- well below the USDA recommended safe temperature for food."

S'My husband felt like some fish for dinner, but didn\'t feel like driving all the way to McCormick and Schmidt, so we tried this restaurant.  The menu is diverse, but as in many suburban restaurants, the reach may exceed their grasp.  He started with the smoked salmon collection -- smoked, peppered, and honey jalapeo.  The peppered and honey jalapeo were fine, but why mess around with a fine smoked fish?  The "plain" was very good.  None of them were dry.  I had the cup of lobster bisque.  It was excellent.  Maybe I should have gotten the bowl.  They also offered a chef\'s treat of salmon spread that was very good.  His Newcastle Ale on tap was excellent and my south Australian white wine was adequate.\n\nI have to agree with the previous reviewer.  The sand dabs with green peppercorn sauce, mashed potatoes, and broccolini was excellent.  Unfortunately it was my husband\'s meal.  I got the trout crusted with pecans, roasted baby potatoes and broccolini.  Fortunately the server put the heavy balsamic sauce on the side.  It was good, but way overpowering.  Unfortunately there were very few pecans on the trout and they were candied, an odd choice for a sweet fish.  Our meal was just over $100 without dessert.\n\nAnd the oddest thing happened when we were leaving.  We loved the smoked salmon so much that we wanted to buy some to take home.  Although they have a nice seafood selection in their attached market, there was no smoked salmon to be had.  The only thing they could offer us was an order of smoked salmon to go from their menu.  I really didn\'t want to pay $14 for tired red onion slivers and capers.  I just wanted to buy some smoked salmon.\n\nI wish this restaurant was a bit better, because the menu is intriguing.  But since their prices are comparable, next time we will take the time to drive all the way to McCormick and Schmidt\'s.'

My first year at the law school (2012-2013), the baristas were excellent, providing efficient and quality service. Obviously, Charlie\'s just lucked out with the two main baristas during that year. Its apparent that they have not even attempted to adequately train their workers or adequately staff this cafe with enough workers to handle the demand.

I'll do barcrawls in Campustown with friends during the summer, and this is always a nice place to stop for some grease to prevent hangovers."

That being said, there are pretty generous portions to the food here and they claim that the beef and potatoes are sourced from Canada. The food was good, though the size of the burger made it hard to eat without losing some sauce and toppings. The bun itself is sort of like an elongated hamburger bun in a pseudo hotdog/hamburger-size.\n\nI was not impressed at all with the 'mac and cheese'. It's made with penne and what I think is Alfredo sauce mixed in with 2 small handfuls of cheese. It tasted like .... cheesy Alfredo penne and I wasn't really impressed with this side dish.\n\nI'd come here again, but it's not on my list of top Waterloo places to eat out at."

An hour and a half later, it finally arrived. \nI opened the boxes and the food looked alright. I took my first bite to find it was very tough, almost like an overdone steak. The chicken was very dark brown, like they\'re using the chicken scraps that no other restaurant wants. I thought maybe that was just a bad bite, but as I ate a couple more bites, it just kept getting tougher. \nI then called them, telling them about my dissatisfaction. The host tells me "let me find the receipt. I\'ll call you back. I\'m busy right now" which kind of agitated me. However, I let it slide. I got no callback. When I called back the next day, as soon as I explained the situation they HUNG UP ON ME. \nNot only was the food terrible, but the customer service was even worse!

The eggrolls had gone bad! It tasted rotten and it was terrible. \n\nThe food isn\'t amazing! but for the price, it was worth going back to try again. Because they had 30% off for the first 2 months of grand opening, it was worth going even though the food wasn\'t great. But if I had to pay full price for this joint, let me just say that I won\'t go back.\n\nThe one thing I ordered that was actually pretty good was the rice. They use Jasmine rice for ther platters and you get a choice of pork, beef, or chicken, The egg that comes with the rice platter also known as "com" on the menu is really good! served with fish sauce. The drinks/dessert drinks there aren\'t great. Overall this place only scored 2 stars in my book. \n\nThe service is terrible, but it depends on which server you get. There is 1 server who is really good and super attentive, but for the most part, every other time I\'ve gone it\'s a different person and the service is terrible. Servers stand around and sitting down doing absolutely nothing, even when trying to get their attention.\n\nThe owner is a sweetheart, and bless her heart.

S'Wow -- this restaurant has been here forever, and I\'m the first one to review it? That means that no one likes it much, but it also has never been horrible. \n\nI hadn\'t been to a Souper!Salad! in years. We decided to try it when I found their extensive gluten-free menu, which lists six soups, seven "featured salads," ten "signature salads," their entire "hot bar" and all of their dressings. And of course, their regular menu lists even more items.\n\nThe gluten-free menu does say that "menu items" are subject to change. What is doesn\'t say is that Souper!Salad! (or maybe just this location) offers FAR fewer items than the printed menus. \n\nAt this location there were three or four soups, one of which was gluten-free, two of which were dairy-based (so of no use to my husband.) If half of your restaurant\'s name is "Soup!," you need to offer a WIDE VARIETY OF SOUPS. That\'s rather the point. \n\nWhat was really disappointing is that the soups mentioned on the gluten-free menu all sounded better than the ones offered in the restaurant. Black Bean, Red Beans, Rice & Sausage, Vegetarian Butter Bean and White Bean Chicken Chili all sounded good. Too bad not one was at the restaurant!\n\nI saw JUST TWO of the "Signature Salads" on the menu at the salad bar: the Mustard Potato Salad and the California Chicken Salad, which was truly disgusting. It had started to turn, but I think that even fresh it would have been gloppy and flavorless.\n\nThe Souper!Salad! website advertises "fresh fruit smoothies," but there was no sign of smoothies anywhere in the restaurant.\n\nAt the Hot Bar, the chili was blah and the taco meat tasted weird. Not spoiled, but very oddly flavorless, beyond unseasoned.\n\nGood points: All the individual salad ingredients were fresh. Nothing was wilted or sour. The fruit was in good shape, too. They still have gingerbread cake, and my husband said it was very good. They offer baked sweet potatoes as well as baked potatoes.'

We got 2 of them because we were going to challenge each other to see who won but after it came out, we ended up realizing we couldnt do it. It was the best sandwich I ever had. So much meat and delicious toppings and cheeses. I was sick of it after like 12 huge bights cause i was so full but now i constantly crave it. Good thing they are right around the corner. I ended up eating more than my boyfriend but our pictures are on the dungeon of shame. If you think u can eat, i dare you to try it. The pound and a half of loaded  fries doesn't help much to win. It was just soooo much food. The workers and managers were amazing. They all kept taking pics of us. It was so much fun. I had to take a cig brake in the middle of the race, thankfully the worker had a lighter :). Might be my last food contest since i couldnt keep what i ate down lol, thankfully i did till i got home, but not my last time ordering that sandwich there, just a much smaller version.

The device I'll use is a timeline.\n\nTuesday:  we research great places to eat for a special occasion dinner\nWednesday:  we make the reservation at Kitchen Galerie\nFriday:  we fly from San Francisco to Montreal\nSunday:  we show up for our reservation, excited to eat a great meal, and arrive to a closed restaurant.  No lights.  No people.  just a sign.  Closed for a couple of days,\n\nThat's right.  They took a reservation from out of towners and chose to shut down the restaurant less than 96 hours later, and not call us to let us know.\n\nTo make matters worse, it's not like this restaurant is in a hopping neighborhood.  We wasted maybe 90 minutes on the round trip and had to scramble to find a place to eat with zero notice.  \n\nI hope the people who made this possible may someday travel to San Francisco and find themselves in a strange, dead neighborhood in front of a closed restaurant with their wife and wonder how to recover the evening in a different language on a moment's notice."

S'Saturday morning would not be the same without a trip to Bojangles to get a biscuit. You know how McDonald\'s has been doing those commercials showing that they make fresh biscuits every morning? That\'s because BOJO\'s does! Bojangles has amazing air and fluff to their buttermilk biscuits. The biscuit actually sticks a little to the roof of your mouth as you\'re eating it. Then you take a swig of coffee and all is right with the world. The bo rounds... don\'t get me started on bo rounds they are in a separate hash brown category. They are a bit larger then chick-fil-a\'s and made with onions which gives them a different taste that I think we can all enjoy. \n\nWhen my husband and I have that dilemma like everyone else in the world...  "What\'s for dinner?" One of our many fall backs is Bojangles. I LOVE the 2 piece meal deal with a leg and thigh and seasoned fries. YUMMY! Now the only trick is that you have to try and get the chicken right out of the fryer for it to be perfect. Otherwise the chicken looses it\'s crispiness. We usually pick up from this location because it\'s just down the street from our house. If they are out of legs or wings they are always willing to substitute. I know this is kind of weird but if you get a long fry that is warm but limp it\'s almost like eating the perfect french fry. Also, BOJO\'s sweet tea is always good as long as it\'s not to watered down with ice.'

Adequate amount of pepperonis and cheese and the crust looked good too but had absolutely no flavor...none! Like a generic pizza..Possible imitation cheese, pepperonis, sauce and dough. I sprinkled copious amounts of garlic salt/powder and crushed red peppers all over it to give it some flavor. I guess if you don't mind doing that it's worth $3.99. Prob better to go across the street to Little Caesar's for $4.99! The star is for me and my seasoning additions! Haha Could give another star for convenience but parking is bad!"

The plan was for me to show him how great a breakfast one could have at The Farm at South Mountain\'s Morning Glory Cafe, but my car overheated and lost power at 32nd St. and Baseline, so I asked him if he would please find out if "Down Home Kitchen" is still open for business.  Thankfully,  he came back to report that "Fat Daddy\'s Down Home Kitchen" is still open, but that it was "totally dead in there."  Poor FD.  I told my friend that I wasn\'t surprised since a few of the people I know that have tried FD\'s found the prices to be too high for the quality of food offered.  However, we were hungry and circumstances forced us to try having breakfast here.\n\nPrice-wise, my friend couldn\'t complain.  He enjoyed his breakfast of scrambled eggs with sausage, bacon, and cheese, although he did accuse me of dragging him to an early grave :(  He wasn\'t complaining, he said, since he liked grease-spoons,  just sayin\' is all :)  Seems like he\'s better at choosing the better entree (see Joe\'s Farm Grill), since my biscuits and gravy with extra sausage links, gratis (many thanks to our server, who received a very nice tip!) were among the most undistinctive I\'ve ever tasted, especially after having, for two consecutive mornings, the best biscuit and gravy dish at Scottsdale\'s Daily Dose!\n\nPerhaps next time I\'ll just order the fail-safe candied yams and brown sugar baked beans...'

S'Looks like the other reviewers have never been to France per se. We went to this joint(!) expecting French style dining. It was basically your local steakhouse, albeit a good, with lots of folks hanging around acting serious. Lacking a week\'s bowel movements I could easily imitate these stuffy waiter wanna be\'s. A waiter in France is your pilot and guide, going where you tell the pilot to go, but always giving you a tour that fits your flight path. These folks were all faux accent and stupid stern faces. French waiters don\'t need stern faces, they are in command de facto and don\'t need to show it. \n \nThe first thing to tip us off that this was faux French was the lack of Badoit water on the \'menu d\'eau.\' Any Frenchman worth his fizzies knows that God himself springs forth from the bubbling cauldron of Badoit. Drink Badoit and all other clear liquids not alcoholic will pale like a gay pastel-adulterated tempera mixed with day-glo and tarted up under a black light.\n\nThe waiter, frustrated at being unable to car-jack us with bottled water, asked if we wanted "drinks.:"   How about asking us about an \'apertif\', "DUDE!".   Yes, we start with an apertif, preferably a nice Pernod. Nope, straight to \'what would you like for starters?\', Damn, I might have felt all loose and ordered the table a round of Kir Royales, but instead had to forego this,and head straight to.......the dinner wine!\n\nWhat, no white with our nice foie gras with quince(the foie gras arriving in a rather morgue like chill)?.  Look, no white with pate or foie gras and I am ready to kill the little idiot. He wants into my wallet, which is trolling for food like a Parisian whore carrying a French Bulldog in the Bois d\' Bologne trolls for trannys but NO! The guy with the pine cone kicked up his rear rushes us for the dinner bottle. Woe is me. And mind you, he didn\'t ask if I wanted my salad midway, just trotted it out with the rest of the starters. Shitheaded savage. \n\nThe mains arrived and the dish covers came off with a flourish and a shouted "Voila!" to get us going. Gee, thanks, I think. By this time I am washing my tonsils on a passable Margaux our friends decided on. The main courses were good, but only steakhouse good. The lamb was rare as asked for which was nice. I was getting a glow on as the sleazy guys in silk shirts with pneumatic girlfriends started to roll in. That was the AHA! moment! They are catering to guys who have a wallet and want to show it so everyone can see. They don\'t want French, they want a tarted up steakhouse to impress the silicone leaden floozy they plan groping soon after! Mais Oui! Now I get it! \n\nThe dessert souffle was indeed well done, but it must be said that if you told a French chef that the last course had made the meal, or god forbid the cheese course, he would be gravely insulted. Why? Its a left handed compliment against the main course. Get it?\n\nHilariously enough we trotted back to our hotel on very light feet after the helium intense effect on our wallets and tried to order a whisky cask aged ale. And guess what no merde? The waiter was a young Frenchman! He apologized profusely that the taps were bust on this keg. We asked his choice instead and he confidently stated that while France was not a huge beer country, we might like to try the Kronenburg beer. We knew the beer and agreed. When he brought them out we asked his home of origin and he noted that his city was famous for pastis, Henri Bardouin, if I remember correctly. We spoke a bit about our favorites, from the Henri to the basic Rickard or Pernod. He was so happy that we had heard of this that he comped a couple of Pernods! We told him that while its odd to drink with beer, the kindness was appreciated. And it truly was. \n\nSo avoid this place unless you just hit the big one and have the bimbo of your dreams at hand. If you want real French, come visit Rover\'s in Seattle, or even Campangne. You won\'t get the stuffy BS, and you will get good food without the attitude. Bon Chance!'

S'Sigh . . . another "could have been" lunch spot for downtown.\n\nSince downtown\'s main "industry" appears to be law and the herds of lawyers running around in suits all day, designing a lunch restaurant around the law was a clever idea.  So I walked into this place ready to be its cheerleader, ready to be excited that we finally have a solid lunch spot for downtown.\n\nBut . . . the service was awful and I feel bad saying it, because it looks like they\'re trying, but they are slow.  Frighteningly slow.  You should just know that you\'re gonna wait for a long time if you go there for lunch.  And that\'s just unacceptable for a downtown lunch spot.  A good lunch spot with a business or law clientele needs to turn and burn.  I\'ve been here a few times, however, and the wait just hasn\'t improved.\n\nAs for the menu, it\'s ambitious.  I\'m not sure they\'ve got their final menu items nailed down but they\'ve got some good options for salads and sandwiches.  I\'ve had a few sandwiches and salads and they\'re good.  Not great.  One huge plus: the ingredients are fresh.  Sadly, that\'s a rare compliment in downtown Vegas.  But one other negative for the Verdict is that the staff gets confused easily.  I\'ve been given the wrong order at least twice.  If the service starts executing orders faster and correctly, there are some tasty options that I would love to cheer about.\n\nAll for an average price of $9 for a salad and $8.50 for a sandwich.  That\'s a hefty price for so many problems with the service and food that\'s only good enough.\n\nAnd that said, I still want this place to succeed.  We downtown workers need it to succeed.  There\'s few options outside of Fremont casinos for downtown workers.  So, I\'ll be back periodically with the hope that Verdict\'s Inn improves.'

I was only here for breakfast and there was a fixed hot/continental buffet for $17/15 or so. I thought it was overpriced so we ordered a la carte. Service was LOUSY. My mediterranean omelette was $15 and didn't even come with potatoes or toast. It was just an omelette on a plate. So overpriced in my opinion.

However more often than not the hole in the wall joints turn in to hidden gems. This isn't exactly a gem, but it is cheap and good (say Los Favritos or La Salsa kind of  good).\n\nThe tacos are great and so are the tortas, the meat gets simmered for hours and the veggies are always cold and crisp. Ask for the extra hot salsa, it is smoky and spicy and wonderfully flavorful, I think it is chipotles en adobo but I can't confirm this. \n\nIf you happen to find yourself on the southside and are in the mood for fast, cheap mexican this is the spot to hit."

S"Disclaimer: I don't eat seafood! \n\nOkay, so I have mixed feeling about The Seafarer.\n\nI probably would have never chosen to dine here on my own, but my mom loves fried seafood and I was taking her out for her birthday.\n\nI looked ahead online to make sure they have at least one vegetarian option, and score! Veggie plate! Only when I got there, I found out the fresh collard greens and green beans are cooked with bacon, WAH WAH. Was I surprised? No, after all this is The South. Was I dissapointed? Yes, I really wanted fresh greens! So I was left with fried squash, fried okra, and sweet potato casserole. \n\nThe fried okra was good. The fried squash was not the best I've had. The sweet potato casserole (upcharge because it's seasonal, fyi) was delicious, oh my. But, it really was more of a dessert than a side dish. There was so much brown sugar I almost got a toothache, but don't get me wrong, I ate every single bite. \n\nSo, let's back up to the best part: when we were seated the waitress brought out complimentary hush puppies and tartar sauce. DAAAAAANNGGG these PUPS WERE GOOD. Like, maybe the best I've ever had! And the tartar sauce was bangin' too.\n\nMy mom got the fried flounder and fried shrimp plate off the senior citizen menu, which she was super excited about and loved. My boyfriend got the broiled whitefish, which he liked, but didn't love. \n\nMy only other complaint is that the slaw (mayo based) was too runny.\n\nThe service and staff here was really nice. The prices are low. The decor is horrible. \n\nDo not come here if you are vegetarian, vegan, or looking for anything remotely healthy.\n\nIf you love fried fish and don't give a *&$# about atmosphere, this is the place for you!"

Personally, I love anything with cheese, sun-blushed tomato, aubergine or avocado in it, but I can't help but thinking this is just yet another fast food place in a part of the city where there are already way too many.\n\nIt's not open late at night, so it's not ideal for your munchies when it's chucking-out time in the pubs, but if you're after a greasy grab-and-go lunch then you might want to give it a try."

S'In the mood for a sandwich and at a loss after discovering Laurel Market\'s closing - I decided it was time to give Cafe Fiesta another shot. Though (as noted by others) they are lacking in speed and efficiency, they do have a few things setting them apart these days.\n1) their own menu boards: bfast, sandwiches, salads, soups, coffees, iced coffees. and \n\n2) smoothies and juices, a fairly extensive list that can be blended with water, milk, \nyogurt, or other flavors. \n\n3) blue bell ice cream.\n\n4) their "half" sandwich is really a whole. (is a whole double stuffed? double decker? I have no idea)\n\n5) the bread of my turkey club was toasted perfectly, my turkey warmed just enough, and my bacon was reheated like it should have been. (sometimes that level of crisp perfection is not the easiest to achieve) \n\nstill lots of desserts and fresh fruit, and although they had mostly repainted they had left one quip up from the previous tenant. As far as the "fiesta" part goes - their daily specials seems to be one of the few reminders (quesadillas, fajitas), but the women behind the counter were extremely kind and I may be more inclined to return now with all the juice options (including guava, tamarind, mango) - even though it looked like they no longer carried pretzel bread.'

The new signs are funny, they used the "i" from "city"and moved it a bit to use it in Asia.  of course the "i" is faded and the three new letters are not.\n\nThis owner is going to try opening at 10:30 instead of 11:00 like the last one did for the first couple of months.  Getting there right after 11:00 all the trays were full and everything was the proper temp.  I wonder how long they can keep all the trays full with only the dozen or so folks that were eating without having food go bad.  They did have somebody tending the trays almost constantly.  I did notice one of the cake pieces was pretty well dried out but that may be enhanced with the heavy a/c this time of year.  Will have to wait and see how these folks do, the food and the price are right, they just need more customers.'

S'Uno Chicago Grill offers a terrific menu, including their irresistible Deep Dish Chicago-style Pizza where every last bite (including the crust!) is delicious. I\'ve frequented Unos numerous times in multiple cities, including Orlando, Rochester & Syracuse NY, and, of course, the original Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due in Chicago. However, the Uptown UNO in Charlotte is a disgrace to the UNO name. Twice now, we\'ve attempted to eat there, only to be met with poor customer service skills at the hostess stand. The first time was an early evening, and there were about 10 people (different parties) in line, empty tables...and nobody being seated. After five minutes of not seeing any hostess, we left. The second time, we visited in the afternoon for lunch. We were pleased to see that there were people actually dining in there, several empty tables, and only one couple waiting to be seated. We watched as the first couple were seated. Needless to say, the one hostess on duty never returned. Having watched her every step of the way in seating the last couple, it seemed like she was just wandering through the restaurant aimlessly, not doing much of anything. And she never acknowledged us previously either. We waited for about five minutes, watching her, not doing much of anything. That\'s when I took action and walked over to her to remind her that we were waiting to be seated. She unenthusiastically walked back to the hostess stand with me. She looked around at the several empty tables and said, "It\'ll be about 10 minutes." Enough was enough. We left. Do yourself a favor: Go to UNO when you\'re in ANY other city except Charlotte!'

NO... do not get the nachos...yellow cheese sauce, canned chili, tomatos and onions. ICK... Then our steaks came out well done (ordered MR) and we had to send them back.  I am really hoping there is something going on with the staff and that they will go back to the way they used to be. The burgers have always been great and the stuffed chicken has too.

S"Rest assured there is no Egyptian food here or anything close to it.  I once saw them serving falafel for dinner and nearly freaked.  Other than that, there is nothing overly unique about this classic Las Vegas style buffet.\n\nThere are two main lines that serve essentially the same things on each side.  The decor is consistent with the rest of the Luxor with sand colors all over the place and walls made of wannabe stone.  The only thing they're really missing is bits of sand and dust falling from the ceiling.  I didn't feel like a pharaoh based on the way the staff had treated me.  The prices were king-like, for a mere $25 I could enjoy my din din.  Breakfast is the better deal here for sure as its a little less than $15.\n\nThe food is good surprisingly and incredible abundant but hardly a step up from your average buffet at any of the casinos.  Its very bizarre to hang out in the pizza section where its tossed in front of you while walking around the feasts of Egypt.  That feast is usually limited to Mexican, Italian, and general American cuisine.  There is nothing that is exotic enough to mention, other than the fact their hash browns are fabulous during breakfast time.  Then again, so is the Pyramid Cafe upstairs."

He even said bye when his shift was ended.  \n\nThe second star for the price and special offer on monday to wednesday; second pizza 50% off, we didn't know that but the server told us, how nice of him :).  \n\nThe thrid star for the music.  The interior (as you can guess?) is like nice green painted wall with nothing on it so it's kinda place that if the door is closed, all the music could bounce back to your ears but fortunately all the door was open, additionaly to that the music was nice.  I thought I'd hear obnoxious pop or rap( it looked like that kind of place you'd hear those music) but I heard soft jazz like Diane Kroll and etc.  We, my husband and i, could have nice conversation and read books and magazine while we were waiting for the pizza.\n\nThe fourth star for the pizza.  Nothing to complain about.  We ordered Habs and Carbonara, all were good.  The dough was exceptionally good- when you pick up the pizza it stayed almost straight, isn't it how you see if it's good dough?  The topping was generous but not overly too much - I really appriciate it when the pizza has all the toppings evenly spread on the pizza dough.  They were all delicious.  How do I know?  Before we had long walk- about one hour? :P or little more, we had huge falafel wrap at home for dinner and had the pizza after one pint of beer at the Terrasse St. Amboise~!!\n\nI could give 5 stars I suppose but after paris trip and gave 5 stars for L'arpege, I couldn't let myself to give 5 stars to this place..... now I have even more high standard!\n\nOh!  and just you know, we decided to give a try because of the huge selection of hot sauces on the counter.  I am a hot sauce person so it was extremly intriguing- I wanted to taste the pizza just itself so I didn't pour all the hot sauces over but next time I will\n\n\n\nThey use a cute green electric scooter for the delivery.

S'I would rate this ZERO, BUT DO NOT HAVE THAT CHOICE!  I had family here for an impromptu dinner and thought I would order pizza and wings for a quick, easy dinner...well it was a disaster.  I chose to order from Pizza Hut.  Well, first of all, they told me 30 minutes.  I called an hour later and they said "he\'s on his way...just minutes".  The delivery person arrived, I gave him a $3 tip on a $20 order...waaaaay too much.  I opened the pizza box to find a burned, dried out pizza that was absolutely HORRIBLE!   It was burned, cold, and dried out.  I was so embarrassed that I ordered this for family from Madison that is used to GOOD pizza.   I called to tell them about my disappointment  about the horrible product they delivered. I called back after it was delivered to tell them about my disappointment and was asked to "please hold".  I did not hold and after I expressed my disappointment/concern about the horrible product and service, the person hung up!  That\'s what I call GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  This is why eateries do NOT survive in mt. Horeb...they do not care about quality or customer service.  Good  Pubs/eateries in Mt. Horeb don\'t make it here...go else where - New Glarus, Verona, Madison, Spring Green...somewhere they SERVE THE PEOPLE that keep them in business. Obviously the food business in Mt. Hireb doesn\'t care if they stay in business...they will declare bankruptcy...the easy way out.  PIZZA HUT GO OUT OF BUSINESS...YOU SUCK.  Will NEVER ORDER FROM THERE AGAIN.

S"I've always enjoyed places like Byrd's, a relaxed bar with good taps and a broad menu.  This place has become a semi-regular destination in Fitchburg.  I've mostly gone for lunch, meeting my father halfway between Paoli and Madison on Friday afternoons.  I've done dinner and drinks a few times and once tried to catch a Packer game on the NFL network with about 200 like-minded people.  I definitely prefer Byrd's when it is a less of a sardine can to be sure.  The bar is a relatively new establishment in a non-descript commercial area near the intersection of PD and Seminole.  It's a bit tricky to get into the parking lot the first time.  You need to actually drive past on Seminole and circle around to the parking lot on the west side of the building.\n\nThe menu at Byrd's is pretty broad, going beyond the standard burger and sandwich offerings.  I especially enjoy the Byrd's BLT, which is the usual BLT ingredients in a pita with homemade guacamole - delicious.  My father usually opts for the soup or chili and a salad.  The Greek salad is his favorite just for the olives alone.  I enjoy the burgers and sandwiches here just as much as the next guy, but it's nice to have a few options as well.  For burgers, my favorite is the Electric Green, which is the California/Southwest burger with guacamole and pepperjack, but this is the best I've had of the style.  It's got to be the homemade guacamole.  The buffalo chicken and the reuben are also standards, and my father especially enjoys the pork loin.  Last time we stopped by on a Monday, which happens to be all-you-can-eat softshell taco day.  \n\nThere are quite a few beers on tap at Byrd's, including the usual local micros (Capital, New Glarus) and a different mix of domestics and imports.  The bar is well-stocked and the bartenders are pretty adept at mixing a decent cocktail.  The service is usually attentive and quick.  I've only had a few instances when I've left the table to get another beer at the bar, and these were usually times when I was having something spicy.\n\nOne of the nicer features of Byrd's is that the entire place was non-smoking from its inception.  This alone would put it near the top of my list for places in Fitchburg.  There is also live music on Friday nights and other special events from time to time, with a jukebox otherwise.  The juke isn't the greatest but the bartenders seem to have pretty good taste.  When a group of my friends went out for a birthday they let us play poker in the corner and the waitress kept the drinks flowing.  It was a great time.  I seem to always have a great time at Byrd's, whether I'm watching the game or getting lunch.  It's a comfortable place to spend a few hours."

S'California Taco Shop occupied this space until recently when the San Diego-transplant hispanic family that ran it, tapped out and closed down. (very bad location, imo.)  The food was positively delicious and accurate of the Southern-CA. style of casual Mexican food...  Edgar, the former owner of "Taco Loco" in the South side apparently took the lease over and has in the process, raised the price of everything $2-3 while at same time, managed to reduce the quality of food.  I had high hopes but was very disappointed after trying, recently.  (A couple friends have relayed similar feelings.)'

The play area is just like the mall, but without the filth and crowds. There is a hand sanitizing station and a sign that says to use before and after play. The play structures aren't those disgusting tube slides and ball pits that are impossible to clean. These can actually be cleaned! (See pics). I hope this stays my little secret. Free wi-Fi too! Friendly employees. Food is of the same quality you'd find at your typical McDonald's. I just thought the decor, atmosphere, cleaniness and play area were good enough to Yelp about."

Now, they no longer have a Salad bar (at this location), and you have to look hard to find where the menu is even at.  The fod was still 'OK', but again not the Pizza Hut I grew up liking much more.  Perhaps my expectations have changed now that I am much older, but it seems like I can get better pizza at so many other places.  The service was pretty good and the place was clean, but I expect better pizza and better wings.  The wings here suck!!  I don't mind the boneless, but traditional wings are crap, they taste soggy.

They unfortunately have a minimum order price if like $8.10 or something weird like that for deliveries. Not sure if that's implemented due to a slow season (summer) or what. But I added on Parmesan Bites and a marinara sauce to bring up the price... And saw that ordering a sauce was extra. I'm not sure why they can't just give customers 1 sauce- do they think a seasoned bread ball will not need sauce? \n\nOverall amazing quality- yum! Like the good was amazing. Order took only 25minutes to arrive which is really good. I just hate when businesses do things to be cheap, especially in one of the busiest, most profitable areas-UNCC."

S'Ok so yelp keeps removing my reviews because I don\'t ramble on an on about every detail ....my hubby hates when girls (or anyone) over explains something and after being together 8 years I have learned to what he calls "MAN VERSION" everything....apparently on yelp that is not allowed so let me write a review maybe they can be proud of...  It was 11a.m. and we were hungry we thought hmmm bachi burger..no not bachi burger and it was then I realized I had this Mexican delivery place bookmarked on Yelp! Seeing how I was doing laundry and had nothing to wear this seemed like a much better choice. By the time we made the decision to order it was about 1230. I had to leave my house by 230 to pick up my kids. So I went online (btw I am very old school I hate ordering online its much faster to call) signed up made my profile and after 20mins of that I was able to place my order. I ordered 2 orders taquitos mixto,chicken asada torta with no beans, shrimp cocktail, alfredo nachos, 1 shrimp taco, 1carne asada taco,1 carnitas taco, and there supposed super hot salsa. I click to order and it tells me my food will be delivered at 240! So of course this convenient on line ordering has me on the phone with them anyway and the gentleman on the phone was great! He said no problem I will have your order to you faster than that. Great!!! My food arrives at 2pm awesome just enough time. The delivery girl went over my entire order to ensure everything was correct it was and she was super nice too!  As far as customer service this place gets five stars for that but the food? Well here we go\n\nTaquitos mixto: Every one of them tasted different very inconsistent..I know they are all different flavors but what im saying is my chicken one was good, my hubbys chicken one was dry and crunchy chicken inside and they were all soggy but I guess that\'s what you get for ordering delivery fried food.    The sogginess I understand but I would suggest not plating fried food on a bed of lettuce for delivery and put holes in the containers so the condensation doesn\'t build up.\n\nChicken asada torta: Bread was hard my hubby thought it was gross I took a bite thought it was ok thank you for not putting beans He HATES beans\n\nShrimp Cocktail: Im trying to be nice but it made me throw up it tasted like someone put Kool-Aid in tomato sauce with shrimp\n\nAlfredo nachos: This made me so mad!!! This is what my hubby wanted the most we didn\'t say no beans because on the menu it doesn\'t have beans on it!!!!! Open it up what was there??? BEANS!!!! All over the whole freakin thing so of course he wont eat it! He did manage to stick his finger in one spot to taste the alfredo he said it was good I took a bite it tasted pretty good but I had my own food, I didn\'t want that he did! AND AGAIN all soggy maybe for delivery you can deconstruct it in containers and just put the chips in the box youll have a better outcome I think people would rather assemble it themselves (although there are a lot of idiots that would probably need instructions) then have them soggy.\n\nThe Tacos: Shrimp one was weird not good or bad just weird, carne asada tasted like they reheated it and over cooked it very dry and hard to eat, carnitas was pretty much the same dry and hard.\n\nSalsa: Most white people would think it was super spicy, I eat habaneros for fun so for me it was ok on spice pretty good flavor\n\nAll in all I ordered 50 bucks worth of inedible food we threw most of it out it sucked cause these people are so nice I might try to stop in sometime and give them a try so maybe I can give them a better review!  Oh and last their prices are GREAT!'

S'I don\'t hand out 5 stars frequently but Primadonna is top notch in my book.  It has fantastic food with none of the attitude found at many highly rated restaurants.  It is a great experience from the moment you arrive.\n\nIt\'s a busy spot to be sure but a wait for a table doesn\'t seem too bad when you belly up to the beautiful bar at the rear of the restaurant.  \n\nI highly recommend the "Anti-Freeze" frozen martini.  Top shelf Vodka, Blue Curacao, pineapple juice and Madori.  A couple of those while you wait and you won\'t care if your table ever becomes available.  It\'s the best drink I\'ve ever had - hands down! \n\nIt\'s somewhat difficult to "pigeon hole" Primadonna from their menu perspective.  Definitely has an Italian influence but also has a distinct Asian feel to it as well.  Suffice to say though, their menu is quite diverse and full of unique items and combinations to suit any palate.\n\nI have dined there three times, twice with a large party and each time we ordered the huge sushi boat. It was fabulous!  Even if sushi is not your cup of tea, you just may like the sushi at Primadonna. \n\nThe third time was a party of four and I ordered the grilled salmon.  It was excellently prepared and came with some corn salsa, rice and beans.  I was a little surprised by that combination but let me tell you, it all works together.  It was very good!\n\nThe atmosphere at Primadonna is current.  It\'s got almost a club vibe to it and is a very entertaining place to eat.  The last time I was there (party of 4), we got a table overlooking the sidewalk.  It was a beautiful summer night, the large picture window was open and it was almost like dining Al fresco.  \n\nThe service is phenomenal.  Each time we were there, we had a different server and, while each had their own unique personality, all were not only competent, but FUN!  It seemed they were having as much fun as we were but ALWAYS got it right when it came to service.\n\nMy only regret is that I live in the Chicago area and don\'t get to Montreal near enough.  If your travels take you there, Primadonna is a must!  You will be very glad you carved it into your plans.'

S"I used to work there when I was in college and back when they actually were a brewing company. I am really glad that Dean started Ale Asylum, but it was a huge hit to the Angelic's appeal. Another blow while was working there was the MPD and ALRC's crusade against hip hop nights (or really any type of event that might attract anyone of color).  I witnessed the Angelic get targeted on this front and it wasn't necessarily always handled in the best of ways (lying to patrons about what kind of music was going to be played that night). \nI agree that most of the food is nothing special and is overpriced for what it is. But I also concur that they have some of the best nachos (everything was made fresh that morning) and artichoke spinach dip (I think I still recall the recipe and would sell it to the highest bidder) and some of the pizzas were pretty good depending on how much care was given to constructing them. All told, however, I think it is time the Angelic had an overhaul and reinvented itself outside of the brewpub it no longer is.  The space and location are amazing and the building has a storied history."

S"Two words to remember about Sweet Peppers Deli: potato salad. Oh. Gracious. The potato salad. It is not like most potato salads. It is the elite emperor of potato salads. A sour cream base with a wee bit of mayonnaise tang lightly coats the sliced potatoes. There's bits of bacon in it, which obviously makes it better. It completely overshadows everything else Sweet Peppers offers. So much so, It should be its own category on the menu. Instead, it is blasphemously relegated to tiny mentions among the comparatively subpar sides. \n\nIf, for some reason, diving into a vat of potato salad isn't appealing*, the menu is large, though unvaried in ingredients. Unfortunately, many of the options sampled have been no better than average. After several visits, entree favorites only consist of the Southwest Wrap and the rotating soups of the day.\n\nConsidering the size of the menu and the number of items sampled, it appears that much of the business at Sweet Peppers may be attributed to the prime location in Baxter Village, and the level of service that is offered by employees. Though it is a chain with locations primarily in Alabama and Mississippi, the Sweet Peppers Deli in Fort Mill, South Carolina has a staff who offer superior personal service. Or maybe it is just the potato salad that draws the crowds. \n\n*Reconsider. \n\nSweet Peppers Deli is located at 936 Market Street, Suite 106 in Fort Mill. 803-396-8888. Hours are Sunday-Thursday, 11 a.m. - 9 p.m. and Friday-Saturday, 11 a.m - 10 p.m."

S'This Jimmy John\'s replaced the Worst Chipotle in the Universe, so now, for roughly the price that used to get you lukewarm and poorly prepared Mexican food delivered with a sullen attitude, you can receive a pleasant sandwich served swiftly, with a smile and a cookie.\n\nJJ\'s is roughly what would happen if Warren Buffet read Douglas Adams\' Mostly Harmless -- the one with the sandwiches and the Perfectly Normal Beasts -- and decided that herein lay the future of putting meat between two pieces of bread. The chain decor cannot quite decide if it\'s preparing guests for their MBAs with plaques of how-to-succeed advice or if it\'s trying to be funky and in-joke-y and hipster. Your concentration is better devoted to your sandwich.\n\nAn 8" sandwich runs in the neighborhood of $5, or a bit under $9 with a drink and your choice of chips, pickle, or large cookie. So it\'s not quite as cheap as Subway, but it\'s a lot better. Take the bread. JJ\'s bread is not a spongy substance that can be mistaken for a yoga mat. It\'s more like a fresh bolillo or perhaps an elongated kaiser roll. It tastes like actual bakery bread. The meat, similarly, tastes like deli meat, not like meat you\'d pick up from the refrigerator section of the dollar store. The portions are not huge, but they\'re in line with what you\'d get at very similar Potbelly or from an $8.50 deli sandwich (no drink, no chips, no pickle, no cookie) from AJ\'s. Since the meat\'s just as good as the AJ\'s sandwich and the bread\'s better, I\'d go with JJ\'s over AJ\'s.\n\nThe cookie also is comparable to AJ\'s cookies from the bins, but larger. It\'s not the greatest cookie you\'ll ever eat in your life, but it\'s better than many of the cookies at the Paradise Bakery next door.\n\nService is so fast that my sandwich, completed and wrapped, hit the counter while I was still deciding on my cookie.\n\nSo essentially, a JJ\'s sandwich will not be a life-changing New York deli experience, but the place is staffed by hoopy froods who know where their towels are, and you can count on its being mostly harmless.'

S'I must say this is another of the numerous times that I am disappointed with the customer service in Montreal, but this time it was not only disappointing but also kind of insulting. \nWe went with the Groupon offer to experience the Tapas tasting menu. I must say that the food is okay, but my reason for the 1 star review was the poor service we experienced. \n\nI have been in the restaurant business for 20 years and I understand how sometimes one single employee can ruin the reputation of a restaurant, and it shouldn\'t be that way. I write this review with the hope that the people that run the restaurant read it and acknowledge that the staff should treat the customers as their one and only priority, and that good customer service is the best way to get new referrals that will help grow the business. \n\nMontreal is a multicultural city and therefore, what a entree means to one culture could mean different to another culture. When I asked for the beef tartare, I had no idea it was made of raw meat, since in my country it is cooked. When I asked the waiter if he could change it since I had no clue it was raw, he just looked at me with a  bad expression and said "somebody has got to pay for that" in a very rude way. I had not even tried the tartare; I just asked if it could be exchanged. Then, when I asked if it could be cooked a little bit at least, he again gave me that same negative look and did not handle the situation with care and patience. When my boyfriend decided to eat it and try it, I assumed that was going to be the end of it, but it was not. The waiter stopped by again trying to blame us for our mistake, naturally making fun of us. He asked me if I wanted to see the menu again and I just said no. I did not even want to look at the guy. I had never been treated like that anywhere else. \n\nWhen he came with the bill, we saw the $4 dollars that we had to pay for the taxes, which was perfectly fine, but then underneath the total amount, there was this other handwritten amount (about $9). When we asked what that was for he said it was for "the service". I was really in shock and just wanted to leave that place. Since when do restaurants in Montreal add a handwritten and compulsory service fee to the bills? My boyfriend literally laughed out loud when he saw that. We paid and just left the place. We went to another restaurant and spent $50 in food that we could have easily spent at Cielo Tapas if we had been treated properly. \n\nI hope the service here changes and that customers get treated with respect. In the meantime, I just do not recommend the place, merely for the bad service that waiter provided.'

S"Being health conscious, I really wanted to love this place.  Options for whole wheat crust, low fat cheese, and plenty of organic ingredients sounded delicious.  We went on a Friday evening, at 5pm ish, and were the only people there.  Maybe they do lots of delivery?  I hope so.\n\nThe manager was very friendly and helpful, and encouraged us to do a half and half 18 in. to try two different kinds.  I tried the Napoli, similar to a Margharita but with a garlic sauce instead of a red sauce.  The garlic sauce was.....different.  Actually, I was burping garlic all night and had a bit of a stomach ache.   The crust was flat and kind of blah too, maybe it was the whole wheat crust?  The boyfriend did like the pepperoni half of his though.  What was nice was that I was stuffed after 1 1/2 pieces, and for me, that's a miracle!  This girl can eat some pizza!  I credit the whole wheat.\n\nWe also shared the Greek salad, which was delicious!  \n\nI'd give them another chance, if only for the healthy choices."

Another reviewer said that they didn't feel like there was enough turkey on it, but I think the portions are fine. The wrap is so flavorful. It's also perfect on a warm day because it is so cool and the apples make it very refreshing. \n\nThe staff is also very friendly. My first time in, the owner was there and she made it a point to stop and chat with me which I thought was nice.\n\nI can't recommend this place enough. I've been telling all my friends about it.

S"We were staying in Chandler, AZ and saw this restaurant across the street from our hotel.   So, we tried it out for dinner and what a mistake!\n\nFirst off,  we ordered a pitcher of margaritas which was shared between the two of us.    After drinking the $20 pitcher, we came to the conclusion that there must have been about one shot of tequila in the whole thing. \n\nI ordered the Steak fajita taco salad.  That was my second mistake- well I guess third mistake if you count walking in the door to the place.  \nThis Steak fajita taco salad was a disgusting fried shell with a small amount of steak and onions in the bottom, covered by about five inches of old dry lettuce.    \n When it arrived at the table, the bottom portion was just a nasty juicy mess that could barely be eaten. The juice was not any sort of sauce. It must have been the oil that the steak and onions were cooked in.    The part of the shell that was not submerged in this grease even tasted like very old frying oil, and nothing else.  \n\nMy girlfriend had the spinach enchilada dinner.  There was no taste of spinach in this enchilada.  All of the taste was some spice that they had went overboard with.  We like spicy things, but this was not a good thing.  \nIt seems that the Mexican restaurants around here do not re-fry their beans, which is fine.   These beans in particular tasted like absolutely nothing-  which may have been for the better.  The only thing edible on the plate was the rice.\n\nIt's a good thing I live in Illinois so I don't have to look at this pace again.    I really feel ripped off.     You can't even count on your $20 worth of margaritas to have enough alcohol to make the food seem good."

S'Nice ambience and friendly staff make this a welcome addition to the New Town restaurant scene.\n\n\n A good quality, well priced wine list (including two rose when many places mysteriously only manage one)sets off well the food menu (half a dozen reasonably priced starters, 8 or so main courses leaning strongly towards the top of the \xc2\xa39 - \xc2\xa315 bracket, 3 cheaply priced salads, half a dozen medium priced side-orders and a handful of mid-price desserts (cheese \xc2\xa35.90)).\n\n\n My duck was melt-in-the-mouth tender and the ginger infused sauce a delight whilst the side order of green beans were cooked to perfection. Desiring more than one type of veg with your main dish could though start making thigs quite pricey so sharing is a good idea. The lemon tart with blackcurrant coulis was a pleasant dessert and the Spanish rose washed it all down well.'

We waited for about 5-10 minutes and then the bartender walked over and said "I need to see ID" and then walked away. After another 5 minutes, she checked our IDs and said she would be right with us. We waited another 10 minutes while she chatted with the only other couple at the bar. I got up and left as I didn\'t want to miss my reservation and the restaurant next door.

S"The national chain won out today over the tiny family taqeueria and the main reason is because if your in the mood for white meat chicken, those mom and pop places don't use that cut, they only use thigh meat. It's a prevalent trend in about 90% of those places. The funny thing was that the cook at El Pollo got mixed up making my two chicken breast grande tacos for 7 bucks (no side or drink included) and used dark meat. Once that was corrected these were very serviceable tacos. They were loaded with pretty good charbroiled white chunks, lettuce and cheese and some sort of salsa. Sour cream and guac were on the side of the fancy plate and the flour tortillas were freshly made as well. They were too big to pick up until you forked some of the insides away. They were supposedly under 500 calories too and hit the spot for a quick meal. It's hard to trust the smaller random places, but if I had more time I would have tried one of the many in this neck of the woods."

What set this one apart from the other locations is that it was able to handle the influx flow of customers that seemed to form a line to the door.\n\nThey worked efficiently to make the food as fast as they could.  The guy in the kitchen area was what really made them go so fast.  It was like he knew what was going to be going out soon and had it sitting there waiting for them when they were about to turn around.  The lady at the head of the line made it a smooth process too.  She had everything set up and was on to the next person.\n\nOne of the major things that I don't like is that it seems that the portion sizes have gone down since my last endeavor to a Qdoba.

S'I\'m tired, hungover, sore, and my ears are still ringing from the night before. What can get me out of bed? BURRITOS!\n\nOn our most recent trip to Vegas, my friends and I drove by this place on our way to Ralph\'s and saw their "best dam steak super burrito" sign and were immediately sucked in. \n\nI don\'t know about it being the BEST, but the steak burrito was juicy and decently sized. The chorizo breakfast burrito with beans was yummm. They\'re a little over priced in comparison to the cheap Mexican food in Los Angeles (you can check out a picture of their menu here on Yelp), but compared to the other food you can get in Vegas it isn\'t bad.\n\nMy only beef with this place was the wait. The second time we came here the wait was so long for them to TAKE our order at the drive-thru that we ended up parking and ordering instead. It took us 25 minutes to get the first of our 6 burritos (three separate orders). Turns out there was only one person working the entire place (on Memorial Day weekend!), but the wait should never be that long at a drive-thru taco stand. NEVER.\n\nAlso, there is no indoor seating -- there is only an outdoor seating area (no shade) by the street.\n\nBecause it\'s in Vegas, and because The Strip is lacking cheap Mexican food, I will probably come back, but if this place were in LA I would probably skip it.'

S"One star because McDonald's is not food... it's engineered matter that just happens to be edible. But I thought I'd review this McDonald's in particular. It's the last McDonald's I ever ate at. The year was 2004 and in the dark of night, in the cool spring air, my friends and I stumbled out of a casino, drunk from free beer and poor from expensive gambling. It was 5:00 AM and although our appetites were ginormous, our options were limited. We happened upon this McDonald's where they were offering double cheeseburgers for $0.99. I ordered three. My companions followed suit. We sat down among the other customers: three older men sparsely seated and desperate to stay awake lest they be thrown out in the street amongst the crumpled pornographic business cards. One man chewed with his eyes closed. Another bobbed his head up and down. Either he was falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything. The last man was not so far gone but was the dirtiest of them all. Once our burgers were consumed, we headed out. I was glad to leave... only sleep lay before me now."

While there was the giant Rocky picture on the wall, with him in his white suit; it also has a large arcade and a cabana. I almost felt like I was in between a Chuckie Cheese and a Dave & Busters. All I saw were adults, but the target was for kids.\n\nIf you haven't had their pizza, then you must have either been MIA for the past few years or despise pizza all together. I find the regular slice with bread sticks and a soda to be just enough for a quick lunch. In and out, that's how it needs to be.\n\nWhat I really don't like is not having the option to be able to bus my own table. It makes the place look especially dirty and discourages me from going there during the peak hours for lunch or dinner. Plus, if they haven't gone around to tables in a while, you're stuck sitting in someone else's mess. No thanks.\n\nGood food, but there's a location inside of West Towne Mall that offers a cleaner dining environment.

It\'s just slightly priced over what I really would want to pay for the size of a dish but the chicken was extremely flavorful and juicy so that makes it completely worth it. I really enjoyed the yogurt cucumber dip but I can see how someone might not. It\'s pretty heavy on the dill so if you don\'t like that favor stay away from it. \n\nThe restaurant is set up a little odd. Apparently, it is table service but reads much more like counter service at a fast food place. Mainly, because there is a menu billboard above the counter which is in the center of the restaurant instead of the entrance. \n\nThe cashier/waitress who was there when I stopped by definitely tries super hard to "sweet" talk customers for tips. It can be a bit much. Personally, I prefer a much more sincere and tailored to each customer approach for tips instead nice, repetitive, robot but whatever works.  \n\nThere isn\'t much atmosphere to the restaurant so I\'ll definitely be back but for take out and not dine in in the future.'

They are confused, as two told me the pool table area was open while three told me it was reserved.  I guess it was open reserved?

This place is all about appetizers and booze, but appetizers do not make a meal.  So I chose the booze.  The mixed drink @ $5.75 was not bad, star added!!  \n\nOverall - Jillian\'s is best if your company invites you, you are with a group of 10 + or if there is some special sporting event being televised.

S"Won't lie, dining in is not the best experience...especially after the flat screen television was stolen from the place, but even then O' Yummy is excellent! The atmosphere is fair, and the food is awesome. There is a great variety of delicious rolls to choose from. The BBQ dishes are also great, if you don't feel like seafood. It is also wonderful that there is delivery and call ins for pick up orders. If you are on the run, it's always good to order ahead of time and then be able to pick up your orders. Some of my favorites are the dragon roll, spider roll, spicy baked salmon roll, Las Vegas roll, California tempura roll...well, I suppose most of the rolls are my favorite =]\n\nThe staff is also very nice and there is diversity. There only used to be a group of Korean students and staff who ran the place but now, there are new faces to be met."

On my most recent visit here, one of the members of staff whose name I never managed to see, seemed to throw anything at me and my fiancee any time we asked for anything, not the best service in the world.\n\nGood for a cheap night out if you fancy some pizza though."

The garlic fries are good too; although they should be double-fried; but then again that\'s a fault of MOST places that makes fries in America.\n\nIt claims to serve "Abolutely, positively, the best burger in the world". I wish I could dedicate my life to eating burgers all over this planet so I could tell you whether that claim was true, but I\'ve got a few other things to do. (Hmmm, that\'s probably what they were counting on.)

I wasn't too impressed with the selection and the quality was definitely sub-par,\n\nThe facts:\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Easy to find off of 24th Street in Phoenix. It obviously used to be some sort of fast food place.\n\n2.  Plenty of parking in general.\n\n3.  The dinner buffet was $8.75 which is cheap considering what other buffets might charge.\n\n4.  The selection is pretty decent but very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.\n\nCons:\n\n1.  A little too salty on most of it's food. As I stated, they are very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.\n\n2.  I just don't think jello belongs in a buffet. It's a cheap option to maximize profit. Not very impressed by red and green jello.\n\n3.  The egg rolls were pretty bad. Yes they were crunchy on the outside but felt undercooked on the inside. That means soggy, which isn't a good thing.\n\nThis would be a good choice after a drunken stupor evening when it doesn't matter what you put in your stomach.

There doesn't seem to be a lot of BYOB places in Edinburgh (well not if you don't fancy Indian or Chinese food) so it was a bit slim pickings.\n\nI was pretty disappointed with this place I have to say and it's unlikely I'll go back.\n\nReasons:\n\n1/ The only menu we were given upon sitting down was the lunch menu which was limited and the food opitions not very appealing (I didn't particularly want a burger or a sandwich). The dishes I would have chosen were all on the main menu (which we had checked out already on their website) but we were only told we could have ordered from that menu if we had wanted at the point of us ordering our food. When I expressed interest in seeing this, I was basically told I had no time as the kitchen staff wanted to leave!!\n\n2/ the kitchen staff left immediately after cooking our food so even if we had wanted anything else, tough! Our booking was for 1.30!! Eh, the place cater for a lunch or not?!?\n\n3/ The food was 'meh'! Nothing to write home about - edible at best and I agree with Jenny's comment in her review regarding frozen food.\n\n4/ My baked potato came with a MOUNTAIN of melted butter already in it which swam all over my plate, wilting my salad and covering my chicken.

They were horrible. They were dry and no sauce was included with the sticks. The large pizza was small compared to other large pizzas. I found the pizza very similar to Dominoes but not as good.. I ordered on line for pick up, and they forgot to send me an e-mail to confirm or tell me when my pizza was done, so not only was it bad pizza but it was bad, cold pizza. I called the store and they said, "Oh yeah, your pizza is sitting here."  Where was my e-mail?  "Oh sometimes that happens, you don\'t get an e-mail or phone call with a time to pick up your pizza.

S"Still on a mission to find a local haunt with casual pizza for nights that I don't feel like killing a pie from the ever-so-fabulous Nello's.  As a very recent ex-pat of NYC, I do still believe that the quick slice, laden with pools of molten cheese and slicked with sauce, is a right and not a privilege.  A Slice of Bella tries to foster this ideal with the hot slice mentality in what seems to be a holdover from the 80s (I'm talking bar trivia machine and Ms. Pacman old school) - it's just that given the small amount of folks that are eating here coupled with the price ($30 for a large pie and a large salad), I'm not sure if they'll make it.  The jukebox is on sale and many items formerly on the menu are now gone.  Whether they are closing or not, it just seems like the place might turn over at anytime.\n\nThat all being said, if this is your local joint, give it an honest try.  The cheese is the perfect amount salty, the sauce is flavorful and not overly sweet (hate that!), and the crust is chewy and charred like a NYC-style pizza should be.  We had a Greek Salad as well that was not bad, but not worth the $7 price tag.  I'm also not sure how iceberg, olives (black and green), tomatoes, onions and mozzarella constitutes a greek salad.  Maybe feta took the night off?\n\nSolid 3 stars and I hope that they hold on a little longer."

S'Ichiban has quickly become one of my favorite places for great food.  My work-mates and I go there at least twice a week for lunch.  Although the name implies Japanese, the owners are local Korean folk who are extremely friendly.  The food is made by them fresh, so you know it\'s authentic.  So what if their English is broken and hard to understand.  When it comes to the other International language, the language of food, it\'s easy to understand, and what they\'re dishin\' out translates to "deliciousness" in my stomach!  I haven\'t tried their sushi but their traditional Korean fare is excellent- banchan (side dishes) with home made kimchi, kalbi (beef ribs), yoo ka jang spicy soup, seafood soon du bu (seafood spicy soup) are all at the top of my list.  The prices are reasonable and the service is very friendly.  I haven\'t been there in the evening but my friend Suejin highly recommends it as she\'s spent many an evening there, happily drinking soju and sake while tabletop-grilling kalbi.  And if you know Sue like I know Sue, you know she\'s one tough Korean cookie to please, and Sue is always pleased when she\'s at Ichiban.'

We finally got around to it on this visit, walking in without a reservation on a Friday night to find there was lots of room. Was this a bad sign, given that its Duluth neighbours Au Pied de Cochon and Khyber Pass were fully booked? We were about to find out. \n\nLa Colombe offers a short prix fixe menu with BYO wine. There are some extra app choices and some premium mains and desserts, but otherwise, you get soup, one of two apps, one of about six mains and one of two desserts for $45.\n\nThe vegetable soup: disappointing. Just not enough of a flavour profile. Come on, chef, work a little harder! Break out the truffle oil or something! I can make better at home.\n\nApps: buffalo mozzarella salad: disappointing again. The fancy mozzarella had barely any taste, the whole thing was aggressively average. And the venison terrine? Might have been better if it hadn't been served on a soggy pappadum. Huh?\n\nThe mains were better - and elevated my rating from 2 stars to 3. The magret de canard perfectly cooked, in a lovely port and fig sauce; the lamb shank equally good. The accompaniments: perfect haricots verts and parsnips pur\xc3\xa9e - nice, but exactly the same for both dishes.  \n\nAnd finally, dessert. Tarte au citron, and chocolate fondant with espresso ice cream, the latter a $7 premium. Both delicious, not too sweet, and a perfect combination to share. \n\nService was friendly, but unspectacular.  The room looks a little tired - needs an update.\n\nLooks like La Colombe is a bit past its heyday. Too bad. We feel no need to go back."

A great variation of tapas dishes and judging by the smells welcoming you as you come in the door I'll definately be back to try out more.. But until then I can honestly say that the Tortilla Espagnol is the best I've had in Edinburgh! Traditional Spanish black pudding was fantasitc and the Paella was definately worth the wait... If you like your tapas then you definately need to try this place! \n\nNow I know that you will never mistake Portobello for Spain but I'm not so sure now as I think if the sun were to shine just a little while sitting in Malvarosa then I'm sure you'd agree with me that a little piece of Spain's been uprooted and transported to Scotland!!

S'It was a Tuesday night and a blizzard was on its way to Montreal, so basically the streets were pretty dead. But, since it was the end of our business trip in Montreal, we decided to go out for dinner, but something with a French flare.\nThe conceirge at our hotel recommended to us Le Parchemin, but also suggested that we reserve a table ahead of time, which we didn\'t, but found out we didn\'t really need to when we got there. Perhaps because of the storm, or the fact that it was a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was pretty empty, except for a few couples out on dates (which is a good sign.)\nLocated inside an old Presbyterian church in the heart of Montreal, the ambiance is very elegant and not at all swanky. They had an extensive wine list, and also offered a special "Gourmet Dinner" package that includes soup, salad, main course, dessert and coffee/tea for CA$44.95, which is a good deal for this class of restaurant. (Wine of course is extra. ) \nThe lobster bisque soup was fantastic, and I ordered the filet mignon with the black pepper and Port sauce that was extremely moist and tender.  For dessert they had the Parchemin trilogy, which consisted of three small tarlets for three of us to share. The portions were right and I felt full but not overstuffed as I usually do with French cuisine. The service was excellent as well, and the Maitre D, Juan Comas, was extremely kind and even came to speak with us a bit. \nI recommend this restaurant for both as a date-night option or a group fare.'

S"I almost feel terrible for saying such bad things about this place because our server, a girl who looked about 12, was so sweet, and the service issues could not be blamed on her as she seemed to be manning the entire place by herself.  That said, after sitting down my husband and I ordered after not having a server come to us for about 15 minutes.  Then we ordered coffee which didn't come until AFTER our food came.  When it came it was cold.  The food was average but I couldn't even enjoy it because I didn't have my drink with it!  How can you be at a restaurant for over a half hour with no drink!? Who serves the first order, drinks, AFTER the food!?  Then we had to wait for utensils.  When I finally got a diet coke that I ordered it didn't come with ice so I had to wait another 15 minutes for that, and also had to remind the waitress to get it once.  This place could have been decent but I literally had the worst service I've ever had in my life."

S"I'm sporadically regular customer of Umi Sushi for years. The restaurant is still the best sushi joint on Nun's Island although relatively pricey. It is also a little cozy place with real table cloths and small sushi bar, where you can wait to pick your take away. There is a nice fish selection in the sushi list, variety of rolls and fresh sashimi you can fill your sushi boat with. The menu has also a good choice of dishes. The service has been always very attentive. My last visit was on Friday night and the personnel was definitely overwhelmed with the amount of people they need to take care of, two people were struggling to run in between the tables to take care of the customer's orders."

S"Tonight marks the worst fast food restaurant experience I have ever encountered.  This is the last time I will ever visit a Sonic. No other fast food chain I have visited has given me a worse experience than the Sonic on Mckellips Dr. First of all, my son's order was screwed up twice. Then my husband went to pick up his drink, and the lid wasn't properly on the cup and it spilled all over him and his food. Lastly, not knowing that pretzel buns are only for hotdogs, I asked for one on my chicken sandwich and they used 2 hotdog buns and didn't even tell me they don't offer sandwich pretzel buns. Plus, they charged me 2 extra dollars for this creation. This isn't the first time I've had issues with this Sonic. Something is ALWAYS screwed up in the order or the location is out of ice cream. Not only that, any time I call to speak with the manager, they don't care. They barely offer an apology. This restaurant is pathetic and I have many choices in the area, so this will be my last visit to Sonic, or any Sonic for that matter.  It seems that Sonic has no intention of bettering their restaurants. What a shame. Beware and stay away!!"

So, up comes the order missing the soup and the bread that I ordered and zero toppings on the steak.

S'I was given a heads up on this new Thai restaurant, and was able to give a try for the first time today!  I have to say, this little Thai restaurant was quite nice.  The location is a bit hard to find.  It is basically underneath Desert Inn (well, kind of North of the bridge, on S Highland).  Although small, the atmosphere was nice.  They put some money into decorating the inside.  The waitstaff was friendly, yet professional which is something I think they hit right on the head.  Overall, while not the best Thai food I have had, it was actually quite impressive!\n\nFirst up was the Crab Rangoon ($6.00).  A guilty pleasure of mine, this is an appetizer I often turn to at a new Thai restaurant.  The wonton shell was perfectly fried, not too crunchy, not too thick.  The inside was more imitation crab than cream, which was nice.  The sweet and sour sauce had a nice little kick to it, and tasted better than average.  Not too sweet, just the way I prefer it.  They provided me with a unique tasting chili paste, which spiced up my sweet and sour sauce a little more.  I quite enjoyed these.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Gang Kua, a red curry dish with duck.  I had it over brown rice, which was very well prepared (nice and fluffy, yum!).  It came with a slice or two of tomato, pineapple, and various herbs and spices.  The heat level was very moderate, so I added more of the chili paste that I was provided.  The duck was the most impressive thing about this dish.  They lightly shredded the duck, and as a result it was very tender and easy to eat.  There was very little gristle, and no bones.  It was a higher quality duck as well (less fat and gristle).  The pineapple was sweet and fresh tasting.  The curry was subtly flavored.  I would say it was a little Americanized, but still was tastier than most red curries in this town.  I would prefer it to be a little stronger in flavor, but I can appreciate the need to cater to a broad audience.  What counts is that the curry was decently unique and very easy to gobble down.  \n\nWhile they cater to the average customer, and there are a lot of Chinese dishes on the menu, the level of food here may be better than most places in this area.  I would recommend giving them a try.  I plan on returning with some friends to try other dishes!'

S"You have to be pretty bad to be a cheap Americanized Chinese joint to have me write a bad review of you. My standards really aren't high. I just moved to Charlotte from out of state and this place was around the corner so I figured I'd check it out. Oops. I called in an order for pick-up for what I normally order when I have never been to a Chinese place before. The orange chicken, egg roll & crag rangoons. These are pretty much the most basic staples of Americanized chinese food and if you can't do these right, you probably shouldn't be in business. On the phone I was told 15 minutes. I got there 15 minutes later and paid and waited. It was about 10 to 15 minutes later that a child of one of the employees finally brought out my order. Here's a word of advice: Don't call yourself FAST Wok if you can't get the food out by the time you say it will be there. (There was maybe one or two other people there at the time; definitely not a full house).So I finally get home and the orange chicken is pretty much tasteless. No flavor, whatsoever. The meat was not of good quality either, so no. Just no. The crab rangoons were also of poor quality and almost tasteless. The only thing that was even adequate was the egg roll. I have only tried one one other Chinese place in the area yet, but suffice it to say, it was miles better than this place. Do yourself a favor, get some flavor and save some time, skip Fast Wok."

S"Another roof top terrace in Old Montreal that features beautiful views towards Notre Dame church and intriguing sangria list.\n\nThat was the last stop of our terrace tour and we arrived around 11:30pm. There was a good number of people queueing to get in and if the place was not on the list to visit I wouldn't have waited. The line was managed with as less coordination as possible. People were leaving the bar, but for whatever reason nobody from the personnel knew if there are free tables on the top part of the terrace and if they are ready for new clients. The service was not very accomodating, the young ladies looked like they work in an office doing serious tasks, rather then offering drinks with a smile to their customers. Last comment, avoid tables just next to the bathroom. \n\nI regret I had time for only one magic ginger sangria, it was my green day, meaning no driving, so I had to catch a bus. The ginger sangria had chunks of ginger and ginger beer, giving a spicy twist to the drink, some coriander to balance out the spiciness, and good amount of alcohol. Absolutely delicious! \n\nI think this place would be best at happy hour time when there is a light and you can enjoy in details the architecture of the surrounding buildings. I'm definitely coming back for more of my new sangria love, Gingergrita!"

S"I was a huge fan of The Guilty Lily that came before The Bonnington, although will admit to not having been very often since its kitchen closed in August (I loved the burgers, and its sister pub The Espy is a bit far away in Portobello to go for one when I'm feeling too lazy to cook...).  Therefore the Bonnington was always going to have a lot to live up to.  The decor's very different to GL, with a much more classic, traditional but trendy feel complete with fake bookshelf wallpaper.  Prices are average, and at the moment it certainly seems to be doing well with plenty of custom at weekends.  We went for a quick drink on Saturday, which coincided with both our downstairs neighbour starting his stag do off at the pub (this meant the bar area was fairly monopolised) and the weekly open mic night - last weekend featuring a rather pleasant country/bluesgrass singer.  Have yet to eat, but the menu is fairly standard pub grub - steak pie, Hunters chicken etc. I do wish they did chips are a side though and not only with meals. Hard to give it more than 3 stars when I've not eaten, but it's perfectly pleasant and a decent local."

S"Even if you're just looking for fast and cheap (screw delicious), you're going to be disappointed\n\nWhat happened to Pizza Hut?  I actually have fond childhood memories of pizza feeds at the Hut.  Toppings were plentiful, the sauce palatable and oh that buttery crust.  \n\nOver the years, the pizza has morphed into a bland corporate pizza doppelganger that fills the stomach, but not the soul like good food should (I can't believe I wrote that in a review of the Waunakee Pizza Hut).  It's gotten so bad that lately the kids would rather have a bowl of Kraft mac and cheese instead of anything from the local Pizza Hut.\n\nThe crust:  A good crust should have some bite and chew, and serious flavor.  Pizza Hut fails to deliver on all three aspects.  The buttery crunch I remember has been replaced by greasy, limp and bland.\n\nThe sauce: It is way too sweet and lacks depth.  Think Ragu spaghetti sauce.  Actually, that may be an insult to Ragu.\n\nThe toppings:  They have really cut back on the quantity of the toppings over the years.  The pepperoni is cut razor thin and there is barely enough cheese to cover the sauce.  The texture of the cheese is off as well.  Just thinking about this is making me a little queasy.\n\nFrom a service perspective, my biggest gripe that carryout and delivery times are rarely accurate.  I've learned to add about 10 minutes to the stated carryout time and 15 minutes for the stated delivery time. \n\nWe rarely dine-in at the restaurant anymore, other than the occasional end of year sports banquet for one of the kids.  The restaurant is showing its age and really needs an update. \n\nUnless you have a coupon or order one of the specials, Pizza Hut is no longer the bargain it used to be.  For the same price, you can go to Zoe's or Doughboys in Waunakee and get a better pizza in a nicer setting.\n\nSo that pretty much covers it for today's rather depressing installment of the Waunakee Yelp Chronicles."

One of the burgers had clearly rotting brown lettuce which my dining partner is currently throwing up into the toilet as i type this.  The other burger I paid 50 cents to substitue "fried onions" instead of raw ones, and the fried onions were a disgusting soggy mess dripping with that transluscent oil/grease but the onions were still raw.  The burger itself was ok but we got the bread dipped in hot peppers and it was a bit much combined with all the other stuff on the burger.\n\nAll in all I don\'t think this place deserves the high ratings it\'s received.

The ingredients may be "better" but there was so little to the pizza it was shameful.  We could hardly discern any taste to the product.  Price was $10 for a 14" 2 topping pizza but a bargain is not what you spend, it is what you get.  In the future we will get pizza from Italian restaurants to get something with more substance and taste..'

S'With all the bars to chose from around this area, this is not an obvious choice, its only a few minutes from Lothian Road but is in a fairly odd position and easily missed.  If you do make the effort to check it out, or happen to stumble across it,  what you will be rewarded with is a spacious, comfortable clean and modern bar with a relaxed atmosphere, reasonable prices and friendly, professional staff.\n\nThere is a range of seating, from little tables to booths to comfy soafs so can cater for small or large groups.  I would imagine that its location means that it does a lot of its business with the "after work drinks" crowds, which means later in the evening and at the weekends (when I would tend to go) its never too busy, so getting a seat and drink is easy, and so lends it self well to having a relaxed drink with friends.  This is very much the type of bar I would choose if I was in the mood for a "chilled out pint and a chat with some mates".\n\nAs I mentioned, the drinks are reasonably priced, very much average cost for Edinburgh, with a good selection of wines, spirits, and lagers.  They do have a few offers such as \xc2\xa310 for a bottle of (perfectly nice) wine or under \xc2\xa32.50 for a bottle of sol, which is an "all day every day offer" and offeres great value for money.\n\nI have tried the food a few times, and was very satisfied with the quality and again, well priced.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend it.'

S'I went here for a weekday lunch on a cold January day - by cold, I mean like -20C wind chill.  Despite the bad weather, this place was open, warm and great food.  There were lots of other patrons enjoying themselves.\n\nFor lunch, there was a very limited menu: basically three starters and three entrees.  Three of us had the tomato soup, which was my favorite part of the meal.  It was not creamy, almost like a gazpacho, but warm.  A perfect choice for a cold day!   Our entree choices were grilled mahi mahi over mashed potatoes with veggies in them, charbroiled beef, and paella with seafood and chicken.  Two of our group had the paella and two of us (including me) had the mahi.  I am not a big paella fan and judging by the looks of the two entrees, I picked well.  The fish was grilled perfectly and the mashed potatoes were unique with assorted veggies mixed into them.\n\nService was good and I would definitely come back for dinner.'

S"***The good thing about the concessions at PNC Park is that they feature local brands/products like Primanti Brothers; the bad thing (and definitely not surprising) is that the ballpark version of Primanti Brothers is probably not a good representation of their food***\n\nI have never been to an actual Primanti Brothers location, but I've heard of it.  This Primanti Brothers location is inside PNC Park and it features a limited menu (a few sandwiches and their fries).  The sandwiches are served on thick bread and topped with French fries.\n\nI ordered some of their French fries as a side.  They were freshly cut, but the fries had been sitting around for a while.  Some of the fries were crisp, but most of them were limp, soggy and cold (they were also quite greasy).  With the skin on and everything, the fries might capture the great and guilty pleasure experience of carnival fries when they are served just out of the fryer.  But given that the fries are so unevenly cut here, you still may not get consistently great fries with one order (even when they are hot and fresh).\n\nCheese dip is also available for an extra charge.  The cheese dip was the standard cheese dip you get with stadium nachos.\n\nThe fries were expensive, but I did purchase them at a ballpark and the portion size was generous.\n\nService was fine and quick.\n\nSince ballpark food often sits around (I had a similar experience with garlic fries at AT&T Park in San Francisco), PNC Park is probably not the best location to try Primanti Brothers.  The fact that Primanti Brothers is a local product might make you consider giving it a try over other generic concession food at PNC Park.  That being said, PNC Park seems to feature a lot of local food so you may want to explore the park a little before committing to Primanti Brothers (or at the very least, you should request the staff to serve you a fresh batch of food).\n\nPrimanti Brothers is located within the stadium so it is only for ticket owners.  There are several parking lots and structures nearby.  The lot right next to PNC Park is $25, but a structure just one block over is only $15."

They have regular soft pretzels, some different flavored special pretzels, and small pretzel bites that are pretty yummy. The pretzel sandwiches are downright decent. I had the breakfast style with egg and cheese, and it was pretty filling. They also have soups, but the guy working had no idea if they were vegetarian when I asked, so I got the impression they weren't homemade. \nThere only ever seems to be one person working.

I promised I wouldn't,  so I am not.   I just thought that it was completely unprofessional and downright rude that this jerk would yell and swear at his staff in front of customers like that.  Apparently,  it was not the first time.  It happens frequently.   I have personally seen this on more than one occasion.  Just remember... when you go to Cheers on Bell road in Glendale, AZ the owners have no respect for the people who serve you.  So why would they deliver great customer service to anyone?  But they do anyway.  The bartenders are awesome and do their job very well.  Above and beyond despite the hostile work environment that the owners create for them.  This review isn't about the bar or the staff, but an abusive owner.  I'm surprised that he has anyone working for him at all.  My first time there, he was behind the bar and I asked him how much the pool tables were, he wouldnt even look in my direction and just said he didn't know and I need to ask a bartender.

S'It\'s always a risk to my waistline when a Chick-Fil-A opens up near my house, and when I saw this one going up so close by I was filled with both excitement and and a little dread.\n\nI\'ve visited this Chick-Fil-A five times since it opened in July. Most of my trips have been quick jaunts through the drive-thru. This location makes an exceptional traditional Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich, and service at the window is always quick and polite.\n\nSo yesterday, when I had an hour to spare, I decided to park and go into the actual restaurant to eat lunch and read a book. After my experience inside the restaurant, I\'ll be sticking with the drive-thru window from now on.\n\nWhy? Because while the food was still stellar, the service was lousy. \n\nIn this particular restaurant, you\'re given a number to take to your table to wait for your meal, which keeps people from lurking at the counter. It\'s a sound idea, but I think that the lack of patrons lurking around the registers makes service slower. It took upwards of 10 minutes for my lunch to come out, which is ridiculous for a classic "fast food" restaurant. \n\nThe staff behind the counter was SLOW in everything they did. I\'ve worked fast food before (and one of my stints was at a Chick-Fil-A in Atlanta no less). The key to being successful behind the counter in a fast food restaurant is to "hustle"... There was zero hustle in this team. They meandered about like lost Sims characters.\n\nI made the mistake of drinking my soda a little too quickly while I waited for my meal, such that I ran out by the time I was halfway through my meal. No biggie - CFA has always offered free drink refills and it usually only takes a moment to get one.\n\nI went up to the side of the counter, which is where I\'ve always gone for drink refills, and I was studiously ignored for several minutes by the cashier working the front, and the three other employees hanging out chatting at the drive-thru window. It takes ten seconds to refill a soda cup - but the cashier wasn\'t about to do it. \n\nA woman in front of me had also come to the side of the counter and asked for an extra nugget because her kid dropped one. The three girls hanging out by the drive-thru window were debating how to package that nugget, and it took all three of them several minutes to figure out a solution. \n\nWith my meal getting cold I finally spoke up and said, "All I need is a drink refill, can someone help me out?" This caused the cashier to finally grab my cup and refill it, muttering a brief apology about the wait.\n\nIf you visit this Chick-Fil-A, stick to the drive-thru. The staff can manage that, but when it comes to multitasking, or speed, or any sort of other customer service, they are sorely lacking. This staff did not know how to work effectively in a fast food restaurant. I\'ve never seen people as slow as this team in a Chick-Fil-A before.'

S'I ventured out to Dane to visit Tootsie\'s a few weeks ago, and it was well worth the trip. When I told my friends where I was going for dinner, I was met with furrowed brows of confusion.  "Dane? Like the Great Dane?"  Admittedly, I was not familiar with the city or its citizens either, but I had heard great things about this little bar called Tootsie\'s and their inventive, and at times risky cuisine.  I found out quickly that  this little hometown gem was worth the back-country trek. \n\n From the outside, this place looks like your standard dive bar, and honestly, it\'s appearance on the inside does too.  There are several tables set up for dining and a singular pool table lurking in the corner.  All of these things are fairly standard,  but what makes Tootsie\'s special is the proprietor, employees, and patrons.  We were there on a weekday night and the place was just banging.  Each person sitting at the bar was friendly and inviting.  Drinks were flowing and the party was on.  The owner was walking around and talking to everyone and the bartender and chef were equally amiable.  \n\nWhat was even more impressive was the food.  Tootsie\'s surprisingly houses a full kitchen in the back of the bar, making it possible to provide high end daily specials to patrons. The night we were there the special was  roasted quail and smoked pork belly.  We had the choice of picking either of the options or a combination of both. My dining partner and I opted for one of each.  Usually I\'m very critical of the way restaurants cook each of these proteins.  Pork belly is one of those foods, along with duck breast, that is ruined for me without proper rendering.  At Tootsie\'s it was cooked perfectly, and was served in a large meaty portion. Yum.  The quail was cooked to perfection, boasting moist morsels of meat.  \n\nWait....hold on...I forgot one major thing: the ranch.  \n\nSome people (my husband included) look down on me for my love of ranch dressing, but I stand proud with my obsession.  I will eat anything dipped in this herbed mayonnaise sauce.  The chef at Tootsie\'s brought me out TWO different kinds of ranch to use on my salad and side dishes, and I was in heaven.  For me, the ranch alone is worth the trip. \n\nOverall, go to Tootsie\'s with your expectations in check.  This small bar will most likely win you over the same way it wooed me.  It was a fun trip out to the country for this city girl, and I plan on making it many many more times.'

S"3 stars for the restaurant itself, quality is on par with where it should be and service is okay.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nDo not, under any circumstance, go to the drive through. Absolutely every single time, my order was catastrophically wrong. I don't mean, oh they forgot the extra pickles, bummer. I mean, ordered two big macs, a snack wrap, large fry, and two mcdoubles, got two big macs, a grilled chicken sandwich, two mcnuggets, no fries, one quarter pounder....you get the point.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough they put the big mac together wrong. No, you read that right. They couldn't assemble a big mac. I literally mean, bun, condiments, patty, condiments, patty, and then middle bun, and bottom bun. How do you screw that up?"

I especially ordered double cheese toppings on the nachos but never received an empty plate like this one, toppings on the nachos were invisible. Should have take a picture for you folks. Fried calamari and chicken wings was served at room temperature. The fried calamari was disgusting as the fried was wet &  mushy. We were having our office happy hour there on the third floor maybe that's why everything was served cold lol...

S"As fast food goes, I generally avoid it like the plague that it has become, but when our company received an envelope full of two-for-one coupons, with my limited choices for decent and affordable lunches downtown on days that I'd not prepped something at home, Qdoba won me for at least a try, and they became like my fifth in line for something to eat downtown.\n\nThese coupons were only good for this one specific location downtown, so this location got us.\n\nI have to say, I wasn't disappointed, and over the course of the next two months, we went through quite a few of these coupons. Almost every time we went in, the place was really busy, but they've divided it into two lines. One for burritos only, and the other for the rest, and it seems to work out rather well for keeping a smooth and timely flow. \n\nThe food itself is pretty good. I mean it IS fast food, so the crew from The Chew won't be standing in line to assess its gourmet goodness, but considering the crap that most conveyor belt fast fooderies crank out, Qdoba actually puts out a decent edible and I dare say even tasty product. I've gotten steak burritos and nachos, and neither have disappointed. They are decent sized, filling, and come with that thing that eludes a lot of fast food factories...flavor. It's not what I'd call cheap, nor is it expensive. For what you get, it's about right. The steak doesn't taste like freeze dried dog food, and the additives like guacamole and cheese are fresh. \n\nAdditionally, the staff at this particular location isn't the usual paper-hatted line-up of minimum wage zombies. Some of them are actually kind of adorable, including the little guy who usually starts you off in the burrito line. A slightly cherubic guy, he's friendly, being the starter of the burrito, with the tortilla, meat and rice/beans, seems to genuinely like his customers, and then he passes you on to the next staff member who will stuff the remainder of goodies into your burrito, and usually, they're just as friendly. \n\nAll in all, this is a nice option for a downtown quick lunch. Decent food, ok prices, pleasant staff, and a quick in-and-out. A chain worth linking with."

S'I go to this Subway numerous times a week since it\'s walking distance from my house. It\'s either really great, or really bad whenever I go here dependent on who is making my sandwich. \n\nOne guy who makes the sandwiches (he\'s the only guy I\'ve ever seen working the counter) is amazing. He spaces out your toppings, he\'s generous with the amount, and he listens to particular requests (i.e. a TINY bit of light mayo doesn\'t go unheard). \n\nOn the other hand, there is a woman who works behind the counter (she\'s the oldest I\'ve seen working there) and she is more than awful. Not only does she act like you are pissing her off, but she puts your toppings either entirely on one half of your sandwich - which is difficult for a 6" - or she puts hardly anything on your sandwich at all and when you ask for more, she grabs one or 2. On top of that, she never cuts your sandwich so when you get home you end up tearing it apart and everything falls out anyway.\n\nIt\'s not just me either, when my friends go there, the same thing happens to them, so I know it\'s her and she just isn\'t really that great at making the sandwiches. When I go back, I just get bummed when it\'s her that makes my sandwich and I\'ll deal with her angry sandwich-making ways until the next time.'

S"The name of this Indian take away gives me a kick, and was the reason I actually crossed the street to check it out. \n\nAlthough it claims to be a restaurant, its size and lack of dining luxury immediately give it away as a regular takeaway. This isn't to bash it though, because the menu is fantastically varied and surprisingly cheap compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to in Edinburgh. \n\nIt's possible to have a range of starters, vegetarian dishes, tandoori, biryani and popular curry dishes. To emphasise my point, one could have a curry, side dish and rice for just under \xc2\xa37! It's a steal, and the test at a cheap place is the way the food tastes ofcourse. I've eaten there a few times now, and I'd recommend the Kurma, which I must admit isn't an adventurous choice at all."

S'VEHEMENT is putting it mildly!!! I went thru the drive thru of this Popeye\'s while  on my lunch break on 4/17/2012. I started watching my calories for health reasons. I must say the lady @ the window assisted me, as she took my order with excellent customer service. So I decided to go back today 4/18/2012 and order the chicken wrap as I did yesterday. It is only a $1.61 nothing at all to pay, when I usually spend over 5 bucks a day for lunch.\n\n But like I stated, I was watching my calories. I pulled in approached the speaker and asked  to order a chicken wrap WITH OUT the WRAP ( a heavy, large, flour,  tortilla) Which makes up most of the chicken wrap, in addition to the calories. Immediately with out any thought the woman-behind the speaker said "No! We can\'t do that) this was @ 12:30 noon Ironically there were no cars behind me. That should have been a red flag to me. But I was hungry and apparently oblivious too. So I said I would pull forward to the window. \n\nAs I approached the window I repeated the order and the woman said "I told you NO we can\'t do that". My reply was: What do you mean you can do that?  \nShe says in her very broken English, You have to buy the chicken strip separately and it will cost you more. @ that point I requested to speak with a member of management. \n\nShe rolled her eyes telling me I am the manager. SMH because I\'m hungry, my lunch is just about over. I didn\'t believe Melissa, because the badge she  was wearing did not indicate manager, and her appearance defiantly  was not that of a manager over seeing an eatery.   \n So I became upset at this point. I asked her what was the problem? mentioning that my request was not rocket science. I didn\'t want anything free. All I wanted was my chicken strip and tablespoon of red beans and rice that come in side of the wrap.\n\nNo more no less. \nShe asked me how is she to prepare that. With tears in my eyes, because I was starving and my time was limited. I said... Look lady, how difficult is it to place a chicken strip and a tablespoon of red beans and rice on the the paper you wrap the wrap in. She says:" well it\'s gonna  take four minutes to cook, because you dunt tell me if you want the chicken spicy or mild". Then she request that I park off to the side of restaurant as the chicken cooks. And some one will bring it out,Because customers were behind me.\n\n I asked her what the hell am I?  and I refused to move until she gave me my order. Amazingly  the chicken strip appeared before my eyes. But the saddest part about it, was after all of the drama ,I returned to work late and hungry.\n\n I was afraid to eat the food Concerned that It may have been tampered with. A word of advise to Corporate and Franchisee alike. I will be sure to spread the news about my Very Poor service at this establishment.  With that said, Hopefully the drive thru will continue to look like a ghost town until your business is no more. And when it happens, Just remember the service @ your establishment is POOR, POOR ,POOR : ('

S"Never have we felt more unwanted at a restaurant. We walk in on christmas eve at 6.10 sharp when they close at 7. No greeting, well heck... Then there are only 4 dishes left which were what you would call left-overs. And he explains awkwardly that they're almost closing, hence no more cooking. Uh? What? I mean i'd understand if we walked in 10 min before closing but not 50 minutes, especially at a fast food joint. It gets even better, my wife later told me that while I was ordering, the clerk that was sweeping rolled his eyes at her. And since there was not enough orange chicken they had to make more so my wife had to wait. Which was fine, but when I got my food and sat down more people walked in and the clerk and the cashier looked at each other irritated. It was so unprofessional. And as these people were ordering, more people came and. And of course as the only thing that they had was orange chicken they ordered that. So the new batch got served to the people that just walked in while my wife was still waiting. My wife saw that they were serving the chicken so she got up to see why she's not getting hers, the clerk said 'oh sorry, I forgot. Don't worry' he said as he pointed to another waiting customer and said 'he is waiting too'. Didn't we come in first in order and pay first? So as my wife went up to ask they gave her a small plate of about five or six small leftover pieces, and asked her to wait for the next batch. And what do you mean 'don't worry', did she do anything wrong here? After 10 minutes they gave her the, literally, 'rest' of her chicken, in the smallest to-go box they could find. If I knew that a-holes like these two were working, I would've driven as far as I needed to, to another location.  Simply WOW! Forget about this place."

S'Disappointed in my visit to this Five Guys.  Ordered Bacon Cheese Burger and small Fry with drink that tallied $14.  Got my order and after initial inspection, noticed there was only one patty rather than the two expected in my order.  (even as I type this, I feel as if I\'m turning into some Austin Powers "Fat Bastard"creature complaining that I did not get my full fat intake...an slapping my belly while doing so)\n\nPurely from a financial perspective, I brought this to the counter attendant\'s attention who was super apologetic.  The grill guy overheard the exchange and was also super accommodating offering to remake the order.  All I really wanted was credit for my order to return the $1 difference between the regular hamburger (2 patty) and little hamburger (1 patty).\n\nThe counter attendant said she had to get the manager.  After waiting for about 10 minutes, the manager strolled over to my table to ask if everything was ok.  Perhaps maybe the counter attendant briefed her on the situation..nahh.\n\nI explained the situation and said all I really wanted was $1 back to make it even.  She offered instead to "take care of my next time I was in".  Um..not sure what that entailed but pressed on with my $1 refund.  After another 15 minutes, she returned with $3.  I insisted that I only wanted $1 but she stayed firm at $3.  \n\nAnyhow, my experience rating is largely due to my error in order but also the weird refund acrobatics that were apparently required.   \n\nThe hamburger wasn\'t worth the $7 either.'

So, it's a good mix of fast food and regular resto.\n\nWe had a poutine, a grilled cheese with apple and honey, and a side of fries with mielnaisse (honey mayo) between three of us. The grilled cheese was a little too much bread for the other ingredients, but the fries were perfect -- fairly thin, good and greasy without being gross, hot and fresh.\n\nThe bathrooms in the back are Asian-themed with different Asian characters on each door. This was a little stressful - going from French/English to Asian. Still not sure if they are actually men's/women's or unisex, but I'm going to assume the latter. Clearly not worth docking them stars, but it was funny watching a little girl (maybe seven) walk to the bathrooms and then yell for her dad in a worried voice to come and help her choose which bathroom she was supposed to use.\n\nGetting our check was slow, but this may just be a Montreal on the weekend thing, because the same was true at every restaurant we tried. Overall, it's just what you want (or what I want, at least) from a poutine/fry place."

S'I love this place, even though it\'s pricey... but it\'s good people watching *cough* hot women *cough*  The drinks are pricey (hotel pool bar), but great food... try the onion petals and try the different variety of fries... THE BEST.  The burgers are good, the tacos are great, basically I love this place and would eat here everyday if my wallet could afford it.  On Friday nights during the summer they have a live band playing outside, it\'s a great time and all the cougars of Scottsdale come out, so again, GOOD PEOPLE WATCHING.  I\'m waiting for the Housewives of Scottsdale soon.  If you\'re in the area or staying at any nearby resort, come by on one of their Friday summer nights... or just any other time around the mid-day pool time.  Also, try the "vitamin C" drink... refreshing, goes down like juice and very potent.  They also have misters, so if you get really hot by the pool, just walk over there. ENJOY!'

I don't have French food very often, so this was a nice opportunity to for me to try it again and eat at a nice fancy restaurant for a decent price. Dinner was wonderful and full of charm. The wine was rich and full of flavor, the escargots and mushrooms were wonderful, and my duck confit was spot on. Sadly, my friends were in a rush to get to the opera, so we had to make some haste, but it was still a great experience nonetheless. Professional and good service from the waitstaff; one waiter was a funny guy. I would definitely come back with family and friends! This is definitely a place you have to check out in Montreal. The only issue I could see with it is its location. It's not located in the most open or populated area, but then again it's the restaurants that are tucked away that tend to be the best!"

If you get your order to eat in, they will serve it on some white plates with silverware. The workers here are fast and efficient, and are friendly even in high traffic times. When they can, the staff will come around and ask if you need anything, and will clear your table for you. The service here has been better than at some sit-down full service restaurants I've been to!\n\nThey offer deals now which are great if you are dining with another person.

It has a slight feel of being aimed at the organic Earth Mother brigade, but don't let that out you off.\n\nWood pigeon might not sound the best, but it's far more tasty than munching on a disease ridden flying rat caught fresh from Waverley Station.

It was 19th of october friday afternoon around 3:30 pm when I went to this place and it was closed 1 hour earlier than the store hours! I could see people working inside so i knocked the door! The owner who is medium build man in his late 30s or early 40, light skin, hazel color eye (an unusual indian) opened the door and let me in! He seated me and told me to help myself and i went ahead and filled my plate! Nobody asked me what i want to drink for like 20 mins and after 20 minuts when I was half way done with my plate,  the  dishwasher came and took my drink order! They brought my bread after im already done eating! I was on hurry and went to the cash register to pay! I paid with my debit card, then left but then remebered that i forgot to tip and came back! For my surprise i saw owner putting the tip to my reseet and signing it! I was like oh I just came for that and looked and saw the amount that he put was what wanna give , anyways I left feeling weird about what he just did! Was not that illegal to sign some body's creditcard reseet like that? Anyways I decided not togo back there anymore!"

S'It\'s 115 degrees F outside and you\'ve got burn marks on your butt from sitting on the leather seat in your car trying to make it to Chinatown through the underpass as fast as you can. There\'s traffic. "Damn tourists are everywhere!" you mutter underneath your breath. You think that waiting for the light to change at Paradise underneath the monorail shade might just help....especially since your a/c went out the other day. But the traffic pushes you just barely out of the shade and into the blazing noon sun. You cry out in pain, "Dang this sucks!" They keep saying it\'s a dry heat...but it still hurts. Solution? You need a cool refreshing fruit slushy boba....and you need it fast!\n\nAs far as boba goes....I prefer mine with fresh fruit. I don\'t subscribe to the powdered mixes that some people prefer b/c I find them far too saccharine. Even other boba shops that purport to make fresh fruit slushies make it far too sweet for my tastes. If you\'re like me, this non-descript, unassuming little shop inside the Chinatown Plaza mall (just to the right, 2 stores down from the entrance) makes some of the absolute best fresh fruit slushies with boba I\'ve ever had in the bay area, NYC, Houston and elsewhere - prolly a near perfect 10 for me!\n\nThe boba itself is done right - not too hard, not too soft. It comes a bit warm like all places, which then melts the fruit slush a bit more....tempering the sweetness even more. They have an extensive menu choice for fresh fruit - mango, watermelon, etc. (Just look to the side shelf and you\'ll see all the fresh fruit they buy to make their creations!) They even run seasonal specials - look for the signs near the counter. My fave? The watermelon with boba. Otherwise, the kiwi or the honey dew melon are close seconds! \n\nThis is totally a mom & pop joint and not some bubble tea mecca like Tea Planet just a few doors down. So not much space to sit in...but just order a couple and sit on the steps of the plaza near the entrance to cool off from that Las Vegas summer heat..or walk around and peruse the store next door for some pretty kitschy stuff - we once saw a belt buckle with the LV sign saying "Welcome to fabdau Las Vegas". That\'s awesome.\n\nI don\'t like their coffee, or black tea versions of boba. For that I\'d go elsewhere (TP seems to be the best), but they do one thing better than those other places - cheap, fresh fruit slushies that aren\'t too sweet. 5 stars for the "No. 1 Boba"! They\'re "fabdau"!'

S"I dislike this place very much.  Every time I have gone, my pita has been dry, thin, and tasteless; the fillings have been sub-par (at best); and the service has been present in body but not in mind (something I won't hold against them personally, it generally comes with fast food).  I generally have a standby with Middle Eastern food by which I judge most Middle Eastern locations: the falafel.  The falafel is simple in its design, only ground chickpeas, salt, some spices, and a dip in searing hot oil.  However, every place makes theirs slightly different, and these minor variations make all the difference.  I figure: if you can't get a falafel right, then what can you get right?  So, how does Extreme Pita's falafels hold up? In short: they are terrible.  They are dry, tasteless, wads of unloved chickpeas.  \nHowever, I think it's unfair to judge a place solely on one mistake. Extreme Pita sells many non-Middle Eastern items on their menu, maybe it's just not their forte.  So, I ordered myself a chicken-based wrap to find that it was given the same care and attention the falafels recieved: next to nil.\n\nIn short, do not go to Extreme Pita unless you absolutely have to.  There is nothing inherently wrong with their food, but there is nothing right with it either."

I had went to this location about a week ago on a Saturday and service was much better, and no MSG crash.

Ok, you go for fine dining you get what you pay for but the prices did not seem justified based on the location/ambiance and really, we didn\'t feel like a $100+ meal for the three of us so we politely stood and said we changed our mind.\n\n"TOO EXPENSIVE FOR YOU HUH???" exclaims the older man.\n\nWow.

I told him that I was not going to eat the food, and that I was going to leave with out paying.  He didn\'t even care, or attempt to apologize or correct the situation.  His only response was "well it sat back in the kitchen for 10 minutes before your waitress brought it out".  \n\nI will never go back, and I suggest if your looking for a nice meal, you stay away also.'

S"This restaurant opened about 6 months ago or so and I haven't been disappointed yet. \n\nIf you're going for a light and semi healthy meal (depends on what you get there), this is the place. I love pita sandwiches and Mr. Pita has pretty much any kind of pita you can think of. Their menu ranges from an Italian (complete with salami, ham, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pepper rings, and italian dressing) to a Peanut Butter pita (with your choice of banana slices, apple slices, or grape jam). Each comes in 7 inch, 9 inch, or 12 inch sizes (cut in half). You also can choose what kind of pita bread. Your choices are white or honey wheat.\n\nIt doesn't stop with just pita sandwiches, they have other items too. Cold classics, baked pitas (oven baked pitas), pita pizzas, salads, soups, chilli, mexican pitas, and quesapitas (basically a quesadilla, but they use pita bread instead of tortillas). I've had their pita pizzas and they're not bad. The pita bread can get a little tough if it's cooled too much, but over all, it tastes just like a pizza. \n\nShow up hungry and want to get more than just 1 item off the menu? No problem! They have a pita bar that's all you can eat for $7.49 and it has everything (including the soups and salad) plus they throw in nachos. Talk about a steal. \n\nI've saved the best for last. If you get a combo, you can get your side items. What's so great about it, they oven bake their fries and chicken tenders. I don't think I've seen anything in there that's fried (I could be wrong though). \n\nAs for the time to go, don't go during noon rush hour because that place gets packed! I've gone a little after 1pm, and my co-worker and I were the only people in the restaurant, had the whole place to ourselves.\n\nI will defiantly will keep going back!"

They have very reasonable lunch specials during the week and kids eat free on Wednesday's!\n\nI've been here many times, mainly with large groups of people and have never been disappointed. The service is excellent. They pay attention to the details of finer dining establishments and have service that's comparable. \n\nThe menu is on the heavy side and if I were basing it just on the menu I'd give it 3 stars. The only option for light fare are the salads. It's the only thing that won't make you feel like you just ate a half pound of butter and cheese. \n\nThe layout of the restaurant is very interesting as it used to be an old First Interstate Bank (remember those?!) The numerous winding hallways make it obvious that it wasn't designed as a restaurant. It definitely adds to the charm of the place, but you're for sure to get lost on the way to the bathroom the first time you're there. \n\nThey also have a large banquet room which used to be the Bank's safe. The very thick interior walls are exposed so as not to mask the fact that you're eating in the safe! That's very cool."

S"Beware that the transition to summer grass is slower than at other courses and the fairways are rather bare now (June 16, 2013).  Add the inability for divots to grow back and it makes the fairways pretty ugly.  They are watering like crazy, so some fairways are closed to carts.  Greens are coming in a little faster.  This north Scottsdale location was 3 degrees cooler today than my Tatum and Shea neighborhood.  Breezier too!  Nice course layout and vistas.  Short and sporty.  If you've never played here before you'll enjoy the partial fairway views from the tee boxes.  Nicely constructed and maintained.  Elevation variations typical of a north Phoenix desert course.  The greens are spongy and hold well.  Great value, but wait for the grass in 2 weeks!  Water jugs on course are emptied by 1pm, so bring water."

The place was a little bit difficult to spot but once we got there, we were excited to try some new food! We went around 12pm and were the only customers in the restaurant at first, so we hardly had to wait for our food. I ordered the hot press-turkey sandwich, my dad ordered the chimmie chimmie, and we split an order of the chicken empanadas. It was all excellent. I took a bite of my dad's sandwich and was originally scared off by how all those ingredients would work together, but I think I will be ordering that next time I go. My sandwich was delicious and filling as well, and the chicken empanadas were really good (except a bit small for how much they cost). My favorite thing was definitely chimichurri sauce. It was on mine and my dad's sandwich, and a side of it was served with the empanadas. Overall, the food was great and the service was awesome. My only wish is that they would have had a bigger menu with more sandwiches and side options.\nIt was a great find!"

S'Yet another bizarre little shop in the quirky Papago Plaza. Going along with the theme of generic non-clever naming - The Sub Shop fits right in with neighbors "Papago Brewery," "Beads," "Mail," "Tanning," and "Korean Restaurant"... I swear, it\'s like stepping into a movie set where they opt out of product placement or name dropping. \n\nAnyway - going along with the name, this place has a pretty generic insides as well. It\'s definitely a sub shop. A place where you can get subs. Are they good? Yes... quite. The food all seems pretty fresh and you can bet it\'s healthier and of higher quality than the shit they shovel at Subway or the like. Generous with the meat - fresh sliced and priced to move as well. The bread has ranged from possibly day-old to squishy soft and fresh, but usually the latter.\n\nPricewise, it\'s a few bucks more than a chain that serves crap, but it\'s totally worth it. If you live in the neighborhood, I see no reason to not stop here for a bite. It\'s good. You\'ll forget it exists though... even if you write the name of the place down on a slip of paper and stick it to the fridge.\n\nEdit: Been eating from here for lunch regularly - wanted to add - their prices are great, they always have fresh white bread, and the quality of their meats is fairly premium. Really tasty sandwich. Had to add a star... It\'s not super special or anything, but it\'s really good and reliable and inexpensive. What more could you ask for from an affordable lunch?'

S'Crayfish and rocket wrap - where have you been all my life?\n\nI had read a lot of rave reviews of Thyme on Yelp previously but had never been passing when it was lunchtime. But my luck was on the up yesterday when I finally got sample more than one of their delicious fillings.\n\nThe rolls are big, fresh-baked, and covered in sunflower seeds. The wraps are soft but not soggy. The fillings - oh  my the fillings. What everyone else before me has said is true. They\'re just exceptional, really something a bit different.\n\nThe crayfish and rocket was divine. I now want it for dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow and maybe elevenses on Sunday. That good. The Thyme House was also mmmm tasty (although a little too rich on the mayo for me to have every day probably). Chicken, avocado, lettuce, what else was even there - I don\'t want to question it, best to leave it in a fuzzy haze of loving food memories.\n\nThyme are definitely a cut above the rest when it comes to sandwiches, rolls, wraps, salads and platters. Why would you pip for a pre-packaged generic tuna and sweetcorn when you could have something inspired, that will make your tastebuds do merry little dances of joy, for much the same price. And it\'s frickin\' central too!\n\nIf you do something this weekend, try a Thyme wrap. You won\'t be disappointed .*starts singing "time after time"* \n\n...if you\'re lost and your found and you will find me...time after timmmmee. That\'s no even the words is it?'

We waited 25 minutes with menus, they didn't take our drink orders and the waitress was chatting with the manager at the bar for some of that time. She did come and tell us she's be right with us after about 10 minutes. We left the place after 25 minutes and I waived goodbye to the manager who looked at me like he didn't care that we were leaving. I'm so glad we didn't give them our money. \n\nI do want to add that I've eaten here before and had terrible service every time, but the food is actually quite excellent. I really hope this review can help them realize how much business they are probably losing because of the horrendous service. I will never return but come on, I've worked in restaurants and it's not that hard to order drinks when people come in. I don't mind waiting for food if I have a pint (or two) to keep me going"

S"I won't eat here unless it's a last option.\n\nI was next door at the Gun Store taking a class on Saturday. It's a 10 hour class and to keep the class going and get done we were told we could work thru lunch. We should go next door to this restaurant, get the order to go and come back and keep learning. Good plan!\n\nWhile the plan was great this restaurant is not. No one working there looks remotely happy to see anyone. There was a man there who looked to be in good shape but just rude, short and generally unhappy. He never greeted anyone. He never made any eye contact. He took my order wrong and then acted like it was someone else's fault when I mentioned it. Here is a clue. When you make a $1.50 mistake you don't bill them for it. You comp it and move on. Just a hint. He seemed like he had better things to do.\n\nThe front door area smelled like a truck stop bathroom and they were trying to kill the smell of urine with perfume. Industrial strength perfume. \n\nThe menu is pretty normal fair and the food is average. Anyone reading this could order the same frozen crap from CISCO and make the same average food they are making without much fuss. \n\nThe other staff seemed to act just like the manager or owner guy. They all moped around and I would encourage them to find a place were life is happier and they end up working for people who care.\n\nThe dinning area looked like something out of 1970's Communist Russia. It was old, dirty and disgusting. The carpet has to be well over 30 years old and dirty as ever. \n\nFrankly you would have thought they would have been happy with 15 take out orders at lunch. Take out is the good for sales. You don't give up any sitting space and your staff is not burdened with waiting on anyone, but that is not a problem there since there were only about 4 - 6 people eating there on a Saturday at lunch.\n\nThe clue there should have been that no one was eating during a weekend lunch. How this place stays open is amazing to me.\n\nOver all I think a 1 star rating is still a bit high. They should look around and see what they are up against. This place should have been closed 10 years ago."

We also had some burgers and hot dogs with stale buns. A potato salad that still had freezer burn on it. Ok ill just stop there because you might ask why 2 stars?!?

S"I met my cousin here for a late lunch a few weeks back.  This is a huge open restaurant surrounded by glass windows that go from floor to ceiling. So I was easily distracted.  It wasn't intuitive to me where I ordered or what to do.  But there were friendly people there and my cousin nudged me in the right direction. \n\nIt is a huge menu and you can have pretty much anything you can think of.  Breakfast, sandwiches, salads, etc.  So I decided on the meatloaf sandwich which was described as being an open sandwich.\nMy cousin had the orzo salad was a mix of cool pasta and fresh spinach with slivered almonds, crumbles of feta, warm slices of chicken, and a drizzle of sweet balsamic dressing.  It was huge!  \n\nMy meatloaf sandwich was more of a pattymelt without the melt.  It was a round flat piece of meatloaf that had the flavors of meatloaf but not the texture.  I should have known when as soon as it was served the manager came over to ask me specifically how it was.  I told him that I thought it was a patty melt rather than a meatloaf sandwich.  It didn't make him happy.  Oh, well.\n\nAfter you order you are given a number and you sit down.  They did a great job making sure our drinks were refilled and checking on us though it really wasn't a sit-down restaurant.  So I didn't know if I should leave a tip or not.   But on a good note we sat there for almost 2 hours and we never once had to ask for a refill.  It is a new restaurant and needs to work some kinks out but it was an easy place to meet and wasn't too expensive.  Sandwiches and salads go for $8.97-10.97.   \n\nJust on a side note - the women's restroom is decorated in a neon green color that has to be seen to be believed.  They are not afraid of color here. So if you are going to the movies at the Camelback Esplanade give it a try."

But this one happened to be down the street and I decided to check it out. It truly felt like I was back home. Be careful with the salsa they put on the tacos! On a scale from 1-10 it was an 11 in the level of spicy. If you can't handle spicy I would recommend to ask for no salsa or ask for it on the side.

S"I have been to the Guru Balti a few times, over several years. It can be summed up as offering good quality meat and above average curry, though the hotter dishes tend to lack that real zing of back end heat. They have some of the best and biggest naan bread though their rice doesn't particularly stand out.\n\nThe restaurant tends to be fairly quiet through the week, making it a good choice for post cinema eating if you happen to be at the nearby Cineworld. Guru is a good choice for an Indian meal and if you live in the area it should probably be your Indian restaurant of choice."

S'my mtl \xc3\xa0 table stop #2.\n\ni was reading my twitter feed and came across a tweet about this place by a trusted food blogger. not someone who gets paid by restaurants to blog about places to eat but someone who loves food and is not afraid to write about their experience, good or bad. so after reading their review and mouth dropping the food porn, i had to RSVP for a friday night date with this place.\n\nRSVPing is easy. its done through bookenda (not open table) and they send a "please confirm" the next day. no interaction if that\'s what you want. otherwise, a simple call is the easiest of way.\n\nextremely beautiful place on mcgill street in old montreal near the old port. as you first arrive, stop at the storefront and admire the cooks doing their magic in the basement kitchen. big windows let you look at their work from the outside. how awesome is that? once in, i was seated at the bar which i love as you can admire the barman handy work and sometimes, talk to your neighbor or barman/waiter/waitress and who knows, share food if you\'re lucky.\n\nfirst thing first, i was giving the wine/drink list. the smoky julep was my choice. orange bitter with rye and mint. pretty good boozy cocktail. if you love classic cocktails like say old fashioned (they can do pretty much any cocktail you want), you won\'t be disappointed. you can go light or strong booze here. up to your liking.\n\nthen, they explained the menu. its a 6 service menu for mtl \xc3\xa0 table if you are 2. since i was by myself, it was only 3.. talk about disappointing. nonetheless, made my choice and enjoyed some bread with olive oil as snack.\n\nfirst dish was the tuna tataki with cherry tomato sauce vierge and white anchovies. its a cold app. the tuna was fresh and delicious. with the anchovies and cherry tomato sauce, it was an explosion of flavor. my taste buds was titillating. it was a nice intro to what seem like a great dinner. boy, i wasn\'t ready for the next one.\n\nsecond dish was the seared scallops with foie gras shaving, brussel sprouts, sliced apples, hazelnut crumble and parsley root pur\xc3\xa9e. i licked the plate clean! ok, i didn\'t put my tongue on it but used the bread to soak up everything! perfectly seared scallops. the foie gras was buttery. the hazelnut gave it that textural crunch. the brussel sprout and its slight bitterness cut through the richness of the dish. and the apple added another layer of sweetness alongside the sweet scallops. i was in total heaven at that time. talk about mouthgasm!\n\nthird and final mtl \xc3\xa0 table dish was the seared duck breast with roasted eggplants, tahini cream and oyster mushrooms was a good way to end the evening. the shine on that duck fat and the ros\xc3\xa9 breast, you knew it was perfectly cooked. the fat was so ever melting. roasted eggplants and tahini cream were divine. and the mushroom gave the dish that oomph, that finishing touch. i\'m pretty sure a good red wine here would totally killed it.\n\nonce done, i was giving a dessert menu and see what tempted me. i could have gone with the famous greek donut holes but that black forest cake screamed for me. chocolate and ice cream to end the night? always!\n\nand then came the cake. after a couple of bites, barman asked me how i like it. one word: heaven. barman reply: like that 90s mcdonalds commercial where 2 kids slid down some slopes. one of them would ask if they were dead and the other would look up and then said "we\'re in heaven!" something to that effect. and that\'s how i truly felt. chocolate wasn\'t as intense as i would of like but it was just perfect at that moment. with the orange ice cream, mmmhmmm\n\nall in all, it was a sublime 90 minutes of delicious food. mouthwatering and totally a feast for the eye. my bill came to $80 including tips\n\ni was looking for a wow moment, i got it. i\'ll definitely be back!'

S"I think Caribbean Palm has potential.  The menu has a lot of interesting variety, the kind of stuff I'd like to try over a series of visits.  Food was reasonably priced and quite tasty. I think with a few minor changes they could significantly improve the customer experience. \n\nThe area for ordering takeout looked kind of like a convenience store, with some mini fridges stocked with some obscure energy drink.  If they tidied that up a little bit, and added a little background music (maybe some reggae?), it would be a nicer place to hang while you waited for your meal. \n\nI got the sauteed spinach side, which while very delicious, also included a lot of onions and peppers. I don't have any problem with that (I love onions and peppers), but someone that didn't like those extra ingredients wouldn't appreciate the fact that the menu and delivered product didn't coincide. \n\nThe jerk chicken, which I'm assuming is a typical flagship dish for a Caribbean restaurant, had a rich, spicy and sweet flavor.  Because it was so good, I was more than a little disappointed with the amount of meat that was on the bones.  When I was done, there were way too many bones left on my plate and my stomach wanted more chicken!   \n\nThe hostess was friendly, but she didn't do a great job of explaining the menu to a newcomer, so I was a little confused at first.  Regardless of the faults, I would return to try a few other dishes and check out their progress as a new restaurant."

He rated it as 4 stars, i am rating as 3 stars because i was annoyed with how slow the service was... given the restaurant was not that busy.  There were private rooms, with screens and also a sushi bar area. It looks like this restaurant could seat a large number of people.  \n\nWe ordered the sushi "love boat", appropriately themed specials for Valentine\'s Day.  This special came with a variety of sushi and tempura as well as lychee cocktails. The sushi seemed fresh and was presented in a lively manner.  Nagiri was also flavorful. We had green tea ice cream for dessert. \n\nFor me the real star of the show was the lychee cocktail and the lychee saki. yum!'

Fast forward to today; I honestly don't think this is the best fast food sandwich anymore. I think everything has changed about it. Well basically it seems like Carl's Jr has changed all of their vendors and quality of products. Ingredients are still the same, it just tastes different. Carl's Jr. buns are now kind of waxy, their burgers don't taste that good, and the bacon is just chewy fat strips. I just hate these sandwiches now. I won't be eating one again or at least not for awhile.  \n\np.s. I had to order their onion rings because they changed up their fries. I'm sorry but I loved their French fries, but their new ones are the worst. These onion rings suck too!"

They are about sitting back and relaxing in a comfy chair with a warm brew and a sweet treat.\n\nSo I was really thrilled when this chain shop renovated and brought in the atmosphere! The new look reminded me of Veritas -- the stores are not related except that they are both coffee shops. Big easy chairs, plenty of reading material in English and French, and delectable goodies to go with simply good coffee. Ask for your stampie card and collect towards a free coffee!\n\nThis outlet also sells sandwiches and salads. On a nice day there are tables out on the sidewalk.'

I could not ask for a more crispy, summer-y meal. \n\nThere were some problems with the service, we had a dirty glass and a bad glass of wine.

This was our first experience with the traditional Vietnamese dish and I must say we are now BIG fans.  \n\nThe building has been given a nice new make-over and the service was fast and friendly.  I tried to chat with our waiter but the language barrier made it a bit difficult.  \n\nWe both had the special which included a small bowl of the Pho of your choice, choice of fried srpingroll or un-fried shrimp roll and a drink for less than $8.  It was a great deal. The small bowl of Pho was not-so-small.  I couldn't imagine finishing a LARGE bowl.  We both chose the beef sirloin Pho and it was delivered steamy hot and full of flavor.  Accompanying the Pho was a dish of fresh basil, bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos and limes to add to your soup as you like.  The table also had a nice selection of sauces to add.  \n\nWe really enjoyed the spring rolls as well.  They were both fresh and full of veg and shrimp.  However, I didn't care for the peanut sauce that accompanied them.  But I don't think I would like ANY peanut sauce... you may think it's great."

The whole time we were ordering she was speaking spanish to someone on the telephone. Kind of irritating. Idk if it was a personal call or what, but she could not put down the phone even when three other people were in line behind us. The lady with her two kids behind us split, and me and my friend would have too but we decided to wait it out because we were starving and really wanted to try their new surf and turf and fried brown rice which was awesome for it being panda express.

S"I ordered a drink that I stumbled upon at another restaurant by accidentally mixing horchata and Jamaica and I really like this drink.   I ordered it at this restaurant and the server, who was Diana made faces at me and asked if I was sure that was what I wanted and I said yes, that's what I asked for.   Then when she brought my drink she told my friend that speaks Spanish that she has never made a drink like that and laughed about it.  Her attitude completely ruined my experience.  I couldn't even enjoy my food (which was good) because of her facial expressions and remarks.  And I must say, that she shouldn't speak in Spanish to my friend and belittle me.  Have the nerve to say it to me in English, so I can defend myself."

S'This is my first visit to the new hotel and casino.  On my way from work to the hotel, I called up reservations to ask what my dining options were at this time of the night (arriving at 8:30p) and was told that I had Ditka\'s (steakhouse), the 24/7 Cafe, and the food court, where I could find Panda Express, Fat Burger, and Los Reyes de la Torta.  As soon as I heard "Los Reyes," I knew where I would go for dinner.  :)\n\nAfter studying the three menu boards overhead (a shorter list of their regular selection of tortas, aka sandwiches, and tacos) and concentrating on the tortas board, I considered two options: Cubana and the Carne Asada.  I ordered the Cubana (ham, sliced roasted pork loin, melted cheese, jalapenos, onions, and minus the avocado, and served with refried beans) since that was what grabbed my attention the most.  I was told my wait would be around 10 minutes, so I went to the Players Club to get a reprint of my card, should I ever get the itch to gamble during my stay.  (I found out the unused free slot play I\'d received when I first applied for my card years ago was only good for the first 24 hours, so I was not able to get a re-issue of that free play- darn!  However, if you play nice, you can always get something comped.  :)  Thank you, Patrick!)  After getting a new copy of my card, I made a quick stop at the Square Bar for a glass of wine, and then headed to LR to retrieve my to-go order**.\n\nA styrofoam box with my name on it was waiting for me, and while I dropped off my claim ticket, I asked where I\'d find the utensils and was told it was at the cubicle next to me (couldn\'t see it because I was approaching the pick-up section from the left and the divider kept me from seeing the utensils, condiments, wet naps, and napkins, which were to my right).  The tables are cafeteria-style, so just grab one that looks clean.  This sandwich, which came with ridged potato chips, was HUGE!  I expected refried beans goop, but these were actually whole beans scooped onto the bottom of the sandwich, upon which sliced ham, white cheese, sliced pork, tomatoes, sauteed seasoned onions, and jalape\xc3\xb1os were added.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-reyes-de-la-torta-laveen?select=XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ#XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ  The telera roll was toasted and buttered- so delicious!  It was all I could do not to eat the whole thing, and I am accustomed to eating light at every meal.  I ate so much that I don\'t think I\'ll need to eat breakfast before heading for my morning swim... With Dunkin\' Donuts coffee and Munchkins to tempt me, however, I may just have to force myself to have a few bites!  ;)\n\n**  I should\'ve just gone with "dining in" option, since I knew that I didn\'t have a refrigerator in my room.  However, I had planned to look for a bar to order a drink, since LR didn\'t serve alcoholic beverages, and I didn\'t want to leave my food open to the elements.  Thank goodness I went with the boxed option, since there are flies in the cafeteria-- disgusting!'

Our one experience with Pomo was not positive so I wasn't excited. It appears that Pomo has been improved from a quick view of the menu but music and other noise came through the shared entrance and made the meal more hectic than I would have liked. The food was good. There were two pasta specials and we each tried one and were pleased. We shared tiramisu for dessert  it was very good.  There is a decent, fairly priced wine list. We had a Sicilian Chardonnay. We liked it. I also had some chamomile infused grappa which was an interesting experiment not to be repeated. Service was good. I have mixed feelings about the Italian market as my wife got $74+ in olive oil during the lunch hour.  We had a good, expensive lunch. I think other places are as good but not as noisy. We will probably go to one of them the next time we want an Italian lunch."

Plus they aren't as good. \nMine , the Flatiron at 13.95 USED to be one of the best steaks in town under 20 bucks(there 19.95 steak was the other one), and now it is somewhat disgusting at any price (it used to have a delicate, tasty reduction sauce-now it is a tangy thick mushroom gravy-and too much of it). \nThe salads are now part of the meal (a plus)-but the old side salads were great-now it is just a salad. \nWe bumped into 2 of our friends there and we all agree that we are probably not going back. We live to far from it-better stuff in our neighborhood. It used to be worth the drive!\nThe menu does have a larger variety of items and a bunch more choices under $10 , so others should check it out if you are nearby. My wife's $23.95 steak was ok-not great. My friend had the Gorditos (like a mexican lasagne) and he said it tasted like a neighbor would make it (a compliment).

I had been meaning to stop by for a Hot Italian Beef sandwich, so I figured the dog would be a good litmus test for a future visit.\n\nYovi's is pretty small inside, just a counter with some bench stools and a few tables with two seats each.  Despite the size, I had to actually look for the window to order.\n\nI ordered two Chicago dogs and they came out almost immediately.  While the steamed bun was on point,  the dog itself was bland and the toppings were mediocre...  while its the closest interpretation I've seen in PGH to the original, it just simply failed in execution.\n\nOn a positive note, my coworker let me try some of his fries and they were deadly good.  I'm assuming blanched then fried a second time given the thick crusty exterior and pretty smooth interior.  You can get some nacho cheese on the side and you're good to go.\n\nOverall, I'll probably stop back at some other time to try the Italian Beef, but I was actually surprise by the price (over $6 for two simple hot dogs) and it was cash only (luckily I had some on me)."

Located in the same center as Bachi Burger but way on the other side. Its a pretty small, clean pizzeria, holds about 10 people maybe more, with a flat screen and some happy pics of who is probably Mama Cimino on one wall and a mural on another wall. \n\nMy sausage calzone was larger then any other I've had a nice size and hot right out of the oven. Enough for tomorrow's lunch or tonight's snack. Came with some marinara sauce on the side, which was a little watery so just mixed in some parmesan and it was fine for me, some made from scratch ranch dressing not the processed stuff. I would have taken a pic but I was starving and already ate some of it. Order in advance because it took at least 20 mins. \n\nThey make Chicago style deep dish pizza, which is my favorite type of pizza so I'll probably come back for that, and the NY style pizza, their largest was huge I forget the measurements but it was only around $17. they have a good menu, calzones, strombolis, sandwiches, pizzas, wings, and at some decent prices. i think they also have some 5 and 10 foot long sandwiches. get back to you on that. \n\nSome of their by slice pizzas during lunch were old and dried up. so hopefully you catch it when it's fresh and right out of the oven.\n\nIf you like them on facebook you get 15% off."

We waited an hour between the third and fourth courses and then didn\'t want to eat our lamb.\n\nOur other courses consisted of a "short rib" that was basically beef jerky, a steak salad that was swimming in dressing while managing to have most of the lettuce dry, and a store bought brownie in watery vanilla sauce.\n\nThe highlight of our night was when a waiter came over and took our picture and told me that I looked like I wanted to punch someone.   My response: "He\'s probably wearing a chef\'s jacket"'

I didn't realize it was over cooked until I got home and took my first bite. Ended up going back to the restaurant to raise the issue. They offered to replace the Coney or refund my money for just the Coney since I didn't bring my soda and tots back. I will not be back at this location. Hot Dogs should not be served if they have been sitting on the burner long enough to burn."

S"Admittedly, the grump factor is high in some of my Yelp reviews.  In my defense, that's because my priority when reading others' reviews is to take note of the bad places and avoid them and I try to return the favor.\n\nThat said, I'm happy to click five stars for this location and would give them a sixth if I could.  Unfailingly helpful, polite, friendly and efficient, the crew lineup at this store has been remarkably stable - it makes one confident of getting the same excellent product and service regardless of the day of the week and despite the brutal early morning hours including weekends.  They are never shorthanded.\n\nThe bagels themselves are unmatched in the local market and in the Bruegger's chain overall.  The whole 'thank you baker' routine is a bit contrived but this one deserves the gratitude from staff and customers alike.\n\nI'm not crazy about have to stand in a queue to get a quick bag of bagels and a to-go coffee waiting for others to place intricate eat-in orders but that's generally a problem only on the weekends.\n\nThis location has the self-serve coffee bar which also saves time and headaches for all.\n\nI'm roughly equidistant from a few Bruegger's locations.  I occasionally visit other locations and am consistently disappointed, especially in the Park Road store (see other review). I'm a slow learner, I suppose, but grateful that one location does it right."

Tonight is one of many that my order was completely wrong.. Nothing is worse than not eating much all day and deciding to spring for Taco Bell and your food being made wrong.. I ordered a tostada and two spicy chicken tacos with no lettuce.. They all came with a ton of lettuce.. I absolutely hate lettuce and spent a lot of time picking every single piece off..to top it off my chicken tacos didn't even have the sauce that it comes with..

S'I went to university in Waterloo in the 90s and stayed for a few years afterward to work. I am now in Long Island, NY but was back in KW to meet up w my UW friends. We selected JLB.  When I lived here and JLB was in uptown Waterloo I had heard fantastic things about this place. But I had never been, so I was very excited about going. \n\nTruth be told, I came out a tad disappointed.\n\nWill start off w the good:\n\nService was fantastic. Attentive without being overbearing, they understood we were "reunioning", and were not intrusive in any way, despite our slowness to order.  Server knew the menu very well, and made great recommendations.  Perhaps I am now a dumb American but I left an extra $50 bill for my che(que)(ck) and the waitress double checked my generosity. Very honest of her.  Stupid new $50 designs.\n\nI have never really cared about ambiance, but the place is a little loud.\n\nThe food was ok.  Unfortunately, I began this review 2 months ago, so I can\'t remember exactly what we ordered.  I do remember our general impression after leaving was that was ok, but not great. \n\nOverall, I am giving this place 3.5 stars, which is heavily influenced by the service we received.   Breakdown: 5 stars for service, 3 stars for food.  Ambiance, like I mentioned, I usually don\'t care about, but but it was loud.  Fortunately Yelp doesn\'t do half stars, so yelp rating  is 4 stars.'

The mushrooms were delicate and delicious and the omelette overall did taste good.  However, this $7 dish was pretty blan with no fruit or toast to have with it.  I did order toast for an additional $1, and was SHOCKED when the bill came and the substitution for egg whites was $3.  \nThis place has NO atmosphere, NO Splenda or Equal for coffee or tea, and little personality.  I'm not sure what the concept behind the place is, and with overpriced food served with no sides - I'll pass."

The food is really really good. Ok, so they don\'t make their own tortillas on site, big deal. The food is fresh and prepared to order and best of all, the dudes making the food are super nice and will customize just about anything. \nI kind of order off the menu a lot and they were more than careful that they got my order right, double checking with me as they went, "Sir, you don\'t want onions, right? Why you are correct  my man!"\nThey have a selection of lunch combo plate specials and even with that, their prices are pretty inexpensive. \nSorry Hot Dog on a Stick, sorry McCrappy\'s...Tony\'s gets my money every time'

Prices are very reasonable - about $9 bucks for most salads.  Comparable to Dean and Deluca any day - size and freshness are very similar (but Crisp is cheaper!!)\n\nGet there early - a line starts to form inside.  You will love it!

Service was a bit slow, but not truly bad untill we asked for the check. Our waiter started asking if we enjoyed the Hogmany/fireworks the previous evening, which we had, then proceeded to rant about how it was a waste of money that should go to starving children worldwide.

S'As the principal dining spot within the Scottsdale Hilton Resort, The Bluefire Grille really doesn\'t try very hard to elevate above the level of "expensive and mediocre."  Perhaps they believe that Hilton guests are a captive audience, a serious miscalculation with so many good restaurants within walking distance.\n\nService, even with a near-empty dining room, is unbearably slow, while at the same time presenting themselves as being under enormous pressure.  Of the 6 breakfast items ordered by the four of us, one was incorrect (not even close) and a second was completely overlooked.  What was brought to our table was prepared without passion, and struggled to reach the level of "eatable."  \n\nYet, the breakfast problems paled in comparison to the dinner service.  As the only diners in the restaurant, being seated should not have taken anywhere as long as it did.  Once seated, the "10 count" prawn appetizer (i.e.- shrimp of approximately 2 oz. each) came to the table as shrimp of less than half that size, clumsily wrapped in eggroll wrappers and fried.  Aside from the fact that 3 different wrapping techniques were employed, this misrepresentation is clearly fraudulent.  My crab salad entr\xc3\xa9e wasn\'t bad, but family members who chose the duck and apple salad were considerably less positive in their assessments.\n\nThe Bluefire Grille presents itself as an eatery blessed by a good location, but with no serious intention of remaining in business.  Regrettably, and IMRHO, The Bluefire Grille thoroughly denigrates the guest experience of the Scottsdale Hilton Resort.'

My hubby and I have come here at least 5 times since living close by here and every single time we come we come thru the drive-thru and  they never have anything ready.  We have to wait for 5 to 10 min for the food. Sometimes the food doesn't even taste fresh and they are always missing something in our order.  I don't know how hard it is for the employees to work there or what they're doing in there to mess up orders and not have fresh food ready but this location needs to get it together.  My husband and I said we weren't coming back to this location again."

S'As I noted, if I returned I would update.  Here is that update.  Honestly, the only reason I went back was because I was invited for a birthday celebration - so I basically went for the people and not the restaurant.\n\nAfter my initial review, I was asked to email the company.  After hesitating a couple weeks I finally sent an email to see what they had to say.  To this day I have not received a reply.\n\nThis visit occurred on an "All You Can Eat Wings" Tuesday.  I made the decision to go with the wing special.  The wings are so-so and the flavors are boring. To me it just seems overpriced, especially since they don\'t include fries anymore - but instead allow you to munch on a sad nacho bar which is never restocked. All of the food just seems pricey at QSL in general.\n\nKnowing that this location and the Concord location are owned by the same company I expected a lot more out of them.  Even though the service and food in Concord is so-so.\n\nThe previous businesses in that location, for some reason, have just failed to succeed.  Hopefully they continue to make it.  \n\nI don\'t feel the need to return.  You can make your own decisions.\n\nThis is just an honest from-the-heart review (update) from a paying customer.'

S"I had to switch to a different McDonalds because I simply hate the one in Mint Hill off of Lawyers and Lebanon rd.  So I now go to the one on Independence near Sam Newell Rd, I've been going to this one for a few months now, but as of last night I don't think I will be returning.  I think sometimes fast food places get so caught up in the steady flow of traffic, they forget how to give good customer service.  I saw treat others how you would want to be treated.  So I ordered two orders of food for me and my family, and the little guy at the window told me I had to wait on my chicken to cook for 2 minutes I said ok, so he gave me some of my other food which meant that now would be extra cold by the time I got the newer food and returned home.  I always check my food because that's what you should do.  Well my first order of food was wrong, but I was afraid to send it back thinking hey they will spit in my food, or drop it and then give it back to me.  So I kept it and figured I would just make it right once I got home(stupid right) being that I paid for them to do that.  And who I got my second order, and everything I asked for I didn't get so they had to remake that, I had to sit at the window longer than I wanted while cars were upset behind me driving around me like they were on the Carolina speed way or something.  I finally got my complete orders of food, and it was completely cold when it was returned to me I of course complained about it to the lady at the window(assuming she was the manager) she looked at me and said well I can give you a small soda for that.  Can you believe it? She offered me a small drink for giving me cold food.  Now if that's not good customer service then I don't know what is.  I know in your every day life and job you may get burnt out every now and then but if you are working with the public maybe you should give your self a refresher course on how to treat people.  I think all companys who work with the public should do this.  And on top of that, when I got home and started to eat the cold food I paid for, my chicken wasn't cooked all the way through the middle, can any one say SALMONELLA?  Yuck, Yuck, Yuck, and to think I waited a extra two minutes for undone food."

S'Was it all just a dream? I don\'t recall Banh Mi Cao Thang ever being lesser than the average banh mi. Sure, it\'s not the most incredible Vietnamese sandwich I\'ve ever had, but it\'s definitely far from the worst. When it comes to the checklist that is how I evaluate banh mi, the meats, the prices, the spreads, and the bread were all definitely solid.\n\nEach time I\'ve been here has always been on the road before I head back to New York. They make for great snacks / meals on the go and beats the highway side fast food options any day (Yes, I\'m talking about you - Harvey\'s). The price is usually just right. My first banh mi here was roughly $2.50CAD a few years ago, now it\'s around $3.50-3.75CAD for each sandwich.\n\nThe sandwiches themselves aren\'t massive, but they\'re packed with a good amount of fixens. A serious banh mi lover (#1) will usually shoot for the ultimate combination - dac biet (house special) - which has a little bit of everything. It can be a little sweet but is usually a lot of savory, something Cao Thang does fairly well.\n\nLike any solid Vietnamese bakery / sandwich shop, they sell much more than just banh mi. There is guoi cuon (summer rolls), banh xeo (meat crepes?), and a nice serving of goi du du tom tet (shrimp papaya salad). All of these are nice takeaways when a sandwich doesn\'t fit the appetizing bill.\n\nOne last tidbit: Don\'t ever approach a Viet sammy joint toward the end of the day expecting incredible bread. Similarly to people who complain about subpar Dim Sum at 2-3pm, ought to know to show up before noon like the locals. Apply this concept to Viet sandwiches and the difference is noticeable right away. Fresh is how we roll.\n\n__________\n(#1) Also, a serious banh mi lover won\'t spell it "bahn mi." That\'s okay, I write "sandwitches" to see if anyone is paying attention sometimes.'

This place holds a lot of memories for a a lot of people. (For me, I first went to the Ranch House on a date with my first boyfriend around 20 years ago!)  Honestly, the food was not my favorite but the place had character."

S'OK, I must start by saying that this horrible experience was made right byt he owner who was aghast and refunded my entire $50 ticket! I took my wife and daughter out for a special Christmas tea - or I thought so. It was not very Christmas like, although they were not advertising as such, and the music was Christmas, but rocky. The decor was not as quaint as I was hoping, more like old grandma grunts than chabby chic and garden like. Country not Victorian. Anyway, it was the experience we were looking for, and my wife had been here before. \nWell, we started off with a brand new waitress, nice girl, but zip on the training, than a girl with three months experience came out, again, no training. Both of these girls would seem happier in a less than Victorian life. We asked about teas and blends, but had no assistance. They only offered a couple and you had to share the pot! What is the deal with that - for $19 bucks a pop I wanted my own pot of earl grey while my wife sipped on apricot! \nWell, one waitress was quitting that day and decided to slam her boss over and over again to us, we were about to leave when the owner came out - we said it was not the experience we were looking for, she apologized and the service got slightly better. Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. \nMy daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty. The scones a bit dry and the jam, maybe WalMart strawberry.  The worst was the dessert. COSTCO SPECIAL! Little dainties of mini eclairs and mini cheesecake squares still frozen with some Rheddi Whip Cream on the side. My six year old loved as she has a dairy intolerance and took an enzyme and she got to splurge. All of this with the griping trainer and the poor helpless trainee for 19 bucks a person. What else could you ask for? A REFUND - which the owner graciously gave us. The place has potential - but needs to work out the kinks, up the presentation, get a better scone recipe, take some time to learn about teas and train their staff, and YES - learn to bake desserts! A 3 tiered plate for presentation and some real tea cups would be nice too! Sorry TEETER house - my Christmas special was a bomb - the best part of it was I did not have to pay for it.'

S"The basic rule of thumb for us gringos when it comes to getting authentic, delicious, cheap Mexican food is to go to Mexican restaurants that actually have Mexicans eating in them. Lupita's is one such restaurant.\n\nMake no mistake, Lupita's is a dive. A complete and total dive. And what can you expect for a restaurant based in El Mirage? It's not exactly the gastronomic capital of the world and Lupita's doesn't disappoint.  The furniture is mismatched and the sombreros that are hanging on the wall are definitely cheesy.  Even the Christmas lights that are hung up are hap-hazard at best.  However, there are no better Carne Asadas, Green Chili Burros, or dare I suggest it...the Gringo's delight....tacos...in the Valley! \n\nA kids' menu is available with the usual kid-type fair and the adult menu has a broad spectrum of delicious offerings sure to please the most discernable palate. \n\nOn Friday nights, there is a live Mariachi band from 6:30-9:30PM and Mondays-Thursdays, margaritas are only $1.99 from 3-7PM. And those margaritas are quite yummy!\n\nThe service staff is friendly, relaxed, and treat everyone like regulars and there are A LOT of regulars. Guests can sit wherever they like and there is always a game of some sort on the televisions. And dependings on the evening, you can find Lupe herself cooking in the kitchen. \n\nTake out service is available and they are more than capable of handling orders large and small in short order.\n\nOh, did I mention the fresh, housemade salsa? Yeah...that's a definite must have as well. The chips are fresh and hot...not hot from under a heat lamp, hot from being just take out of the fryer. \n\nAgain, make no mistake, this place is a total dive, but you will not regret for a second going to Lupitas' for your dose of Mexican food delights."

S"How Do You Roll? basically meets my expectations.  I mean, it is simply sushi done in a fast food manner.  i know that i can get better mexican at cantina than i can at taco bell and a better burger at crepe cellar than i can at mcdonald's.  these are the simple truths in life.  it's McSushi...\n\ntheir build your own roll concept isn't a bad idea and it makes it relatively easy to just get a meal.  yes, they get a little heavy on the rice with their rolls.  \n\nthe flaw in the concept, though is that when you go to a real sushi restaurant, you have a real sushi chef that knows what flavors and textures compliment each other.  as a layperson on the matter, i have a moderate idea of what is going to be a winning combination.  and their half dozen or so preconceptualized rolls don't leave much to the imagination.\n\ni usually double up on the meat which makes an already thick roll a little thicker.  thankfully, i have a big mouth to cram the so-so roll pieces in.  the pricing is somewhat reasonable and the service is pretty cordial.  their high roller program could be beneficial for a regular and i usually drop a business card in the fish bowl for grins..."

S"This is a chain restaurant, but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.  It's a little pricey at around $20-$25 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is high quality.\n\nLet's get our priorities in order:\n\nIn terms of drinks, I had a vodka tonic (Well vodka there is Smirnoff but they also carry Ketel One) and a Watermelon Margarita.  The vodka tonic was about what you'd expect.  A decent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.  The Watermelon Margarita was a little sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.  It's a $9 drink but it comes with a sidecar caraffe that will completely refill the Margarita glass and then some so it's really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.\n\nNow that that's out of the way let's discuss dessert:\n\nI had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty, but not award winning.    \n\nEntrees:\nI tried the NY strip and a lobster tail, both of which were well prepared though I'm not a huge fan of their spice rub.  It's not bad mind you, I just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.  The good news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts I saw looked pretty high (mine was good).  The lobster tail was good.  I'd say comparable to Red Lobster which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.  Besides, I like Red Lobster so that's not intended to be a slight, it's just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely different thing.\n\nThe house garden salad was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't disgusting either.  They rounded up the usual suspects (Iceberg, Carrots, an onion ring, a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes) and held them for questioning in an average sized bowl.  it was about what you'd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.\n\nThe bread was fresh and delicious.  I liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at Outback.\n\nMy baked potato was pretty much what you'd expect from a baked potato. Split down the middle with butter in it.  It was good, but I couldn't finish it as I had too many other competing morsels to contend with.\n\nAll in all the food was good and my only complaint was that I ate too much.  I would definitely go again."

I ordered a Philly cheese steak pita, and had it the way they normally make it. A pita bread is stuffed with meat, cheese, and veggies, and topped with a special sauce. It was hot, filling, inexpensive and I got a bag of chips and a soda to go with, for about $8 and change. I'll definitely go again when I get the urge.

S'We enjoyed a tasty meal here -- two excellent curries, prepared exactly as we ordered them (very spicy).  Naan was reasonably priced ($1.49) and just right -- hot, fresh, but not drenched in butter.  We were shocked to get such good Indian food in a suburban location in a city not known for its Indian cuisine.\n\nApparently this location used to host a restaurant called India Gate.  Restaurant.com is still selling vouchers for India Gate.  This new location won\'t honor them -- ask them if they\'re India Gate, and they\'ll say yes.  (I asked "Is this India Gate?" and the hostess replied "Yes.")  One of their menus still says India Gate.  But expect them to honor the discount, and you\'ll be disappointed.  They initially claimed to be totally unaware of the problem but on further questioning admitted that at least one other customer had come in with the same problem.  Follow-up emails were equally unsuccessful at resolution.  I\'d give them 4 stars for food, maybe even 5 in light of the alternatives in the area ... but unethical behavior like this earns a huge drop.'

I have been a few times since they opened to give them a chance to work out any issues in the kitchen and in the service. \n\nOverall the ingridients used in the burger are top quality and I am a huge fan of the onion strings as they taste both delicious as a topping and as a side. However, when you begin to build your burger, mind you it will get messy when you eat it, so do not go here on a first date or for a business meeting as you will look like a savage when your done with your meal. Or at least I did :)\n\nMy one knock against this place is the way they cook their meat. I prefer my burgers cooked to a medium-rare to medium range and while I know this is not Morton's steakhouse or the Burger Bar, they do ask you how you want your burger cooked. And every time, it looks and tastes well done even when I have asked for it to be as rare as possible, like just sear the outside and I want it dripping in blood. But when the staff asks me how my food is and I say the meat is over cooked, they tell me its the lighting in the that restaurant makes it look well done and not their grill cooks in the back. Really now? Really? Do I look that stupid to you? Just apologize and offer to make another or just apologize is all I really want to hear."

S'Well apart from having my ears assaulted by the same song in mandarin on repeat.. with the requisite \'skip\' in the soundtrack... the food was really nothing spectacular and not the least bit authentic.. tho the forks and spoons on the tables in place of chopsticks was a dead giveaway for the "authenticity".. \n\nThe decor is \'sparse\' to say the least.. the one waiter put on some weird accent and tried to be all chummy.. "how was that, pal? enjoy that buddy? etc."... then proceeded to ask us where in America we were from.. uhhh... we\'re NOT?! Then he was like.. so where are you from then? But threw in "Europe? Canada?" before we\'d had a chance to answer.. then when D finally managed to say "Edinburgh" the waiter seemed to lose interest completely and we pretty much got the cold shoulder for the rest of the meal... WTF??\n\nHe then proceeded to offend someone else at a table which was behind me, all I heard was him apologising repeatedly to the woman who at one stage slapped the table!\n\nAll the main dishes were far too heavily flavoured.. the chicken & cashew in yellow bean sauce and mixed veg were far too salty.. the sweet & sour pork too vinegary.. it was a good thing the mixed fried rice was pretty bland along with the prawn & green pepper..\n\nHighlight was probably the banana fritter for dessert although the nondescript syrup it came with was too sweet... \n\nWe ate here out of desperation & convenience.. I\'ve been right not to set foot in this place in the 4 years I\'ve live in Edinburgh and I don\'t see myself setting foot in here again....'

S'As long as you don\'t expect service with a smile, then this will be a good spot for you!\n\nI sampled the fried chicken wings, fried scallops, fried whiting filet, fried jumbo shrimps, and French fries. As I review this, I realize how calorically wrong this plate sounds but if you are going to indulge in seafood, this is where you want to be. \n\nAnd everything for me was a sample because the portions were so large that I wasn\'t able to finish any one thing. It made for great leftovers the next day, though.\n\nThey sprinkle some dust on the fried seafood after it comes out the fryer but I wouldn\'t be able to tell you what it is. It looks like sawdust but has no taste and the "friendly" cashier ignored me when I asked him what he was sprinkling on my food. \n\nEven with his attitude, I still give this a 4 star experience. That says a lot...\n\nThere is a take out only restaurant so unless you live in the area, be prepared to eat in your car...like I did.'

S'Typically I\'ve come here to eat during the day and get taken care very well by a very nice and wonderful waitress, Anita. After this experience I refuse to go back unless she is the one waiting on me. The food here is great but the service can certainly be lacking. The waitress tonight was certainly busy but she didn\'t even make an effort to check up on us. That is even after I had to go to the bar and get a 2nd round of drinks for me and my fiance. I didn\'t get guacamole with my entree like I was suppose to and couldn\'t even get any ketchup for her fries since it\'s like we weren\'t even being waited on. I don\'t know if possibly we were being discriminated upon for having a Groupon, since she was checking up on everybody else and would just walk right past us. I still tipped cash but below the norm of course, and wrote on the tip line on the receipt "disappointed" since the service really was.'

S"Hmm I ve never been so confused about writing a review before. This place is scabby, the coffee I was served was cold filter coffee. Though I think this is the whole idea about forest cafe, an Edinburgh CBGB's more poetic rather then punk rock. There is a tension in the air here, a political and spiritual tension. I feel a lot of sadness, frustration and anger at the forest and I can't say I felt very comfortable here but can see how people feeling the same seek out each other to fight internal struggles and injustice in the society. \n\nThey say that a messy room is a messy mind, maybe some passion to make good drinks and food would do good here, after all it is in human nature to seek out good food if we can. Though this is just my opinion."

S'Ahhhh another Italian deli that has a special place in my heart. \n\nThis is a hidden gem and more people need to find there way here. With the bus route going back to normal tomorrow maybe more people will find there way here as I have. Ok on with the review.  Great little italian cafe/ deli with a good menu of sandwiches and coffee and other goodies. As my hunt for all the italian delis in the city continues this was my first stop and I was jonesing for some salami and parmesan cheese. This place of course had both and they were both quite tasty. I had a black peppercorn type salami that didn\'t last the evening. Couldn\'t help myself and it got devoured. The cheese I am savoring but still probably wont last that long. \n\nThe shop has  comfy looking tables to sit at and enjoy your coffee or sandwich. I really liked the sandwich menu with all the variety and next time I stop in I will be getting a panini before you can say " Don Corleone " and of course my espresso shot to sample the coffee. Really liked the gentlemen working there, they recognized my American accent and started a friendly chat with me, made me feel like famiglia. The deli had all sorts of salamis and cheeses and the prices were not to bad at all. I even think I remember them having a few loaves of bread but I cant be sure as I was to focused on the salamis in the case. So otherwise another great little italian deli, I do recommend it if your in the area or even if your not then you need to find your way to the area! I will be going back  in regularly I believe as my bus route is right next to the place almost. After I sample the food I will also update this review, which I am sure will be even more positive!'

S'I hold this little gem near and dear to my heart. My husband and I first dined here on our anniversary, when we were both students and could afford little more than a glass of lemonade. But just being in the elegant Buttes Marriot Hotel, surrounded by Beautiful People, and waited on by the attentive staff made us feel, well, *rich*. \n\nThe Market Cafe serves sandwiches, chicken, and a variety of California-style menu items. And while the menu may not be terribly inspired, the setting surely is. Call ahead and ask for a table by the 30-foot-tall indoor waterfall and fish pond. The last time we dined at the Cafe, we splurged and had the dinner buffet --- wonderful!'

It tastes like pizza.\nWhat I wouldn't get here is the salad.\n\nMy friend had some kind of salad, the Health Nut Salad. The vegetables were not fresh, it was wilted and in some parts had rotted already.\n\n\nI had Pizza with, sauce, two cheeses, artichoke hearts, spinach, onion, sausage and ham.\nClassic Pizza: MARGHERITA\nHealth Nut Salad\n\nConclusion: The pizzas are great, the salads are to not be bought without looking at carefully first."

They have a great menu with a full variety of selections for the meat eater, seafood fan or vegetarian.  Im writing this review bc I went there last night and had a FANTASTIC meal, nc mtn trout with a side of saut\xc3\xa9ed veggies and my favorite beer on earth KRONENBOURG 1664 a French beer that is pretty hard to find and even harder to find in restaurants.  my food was PERFECT, the fish could not have been any fresher or more perfectly prepared, it was dynamite!!!  Took my mom and dad with, they got fried oysters and the capts seafood platter and everything was PERFECT...oh yeah the cole slaw was great as well, tasted very fresh and I am a cole slaw snob, often judging restaurants per their slaw.  So once again Hotel Charlotte knocks it out of the park for my entire family, my Mom doesn't live here anymore and was going on about how many times we had eaten there when I was a kid and how good it was and still is = great night for her and me.  im going to give this one 5 stars bc they deserve it.  A true charlotte landmark that has been there forever and seems to be chugging along just fine."

It took over 55 minutes to get a kids grilled cheese!  Our appetizer was served to us twice.  We brought up how long our meal was taking at least twice - and I was told *a manager will come over to talk with you and perhaps make an adjustment*.  We let our server know we wanted to make the 8pm show (our reservations were at 6:30pm).  Didn't order anything complicated that I thought we would be able to make it.  Guess what - after 35 minutes from being told mgr would come over - they never did.  Clearly - they didn't really care.  Finally - my husband and kids left to go see the show - we weren't able to finish our dinner - had to have our dessert wrapped up.  Server then said - you can always call us and we can try to make right by you?  I'm like - really - I get to spend more time giving feedback vs. you've now had 2 opportunities (both you and your manager) - to make this right when I am right here and you didn't think it was important enought?  And the best - kids meals include drinks - they charged us $3 EACH for a kiddy cocktail.  NEVER diclosed that was an upcharge.  \n\nIt was our first experience at Rawhide overall - and we were having a fantastic time - as we really had no idea what to expect and the kids loved it!

She says opps forgot to use the coupon I will give you cash back I said cool... So now I have to wait till she trys to figure out how much money to give me back with a super puzzled look she hands me back 1 dollar and 5 dimes... That his point I think I am in another world lol... I said you charged me $14.27 she says oh yeah at this point I am watching mind shut down the manager comes over at this point and try\'s to fix it I had keep the $1.50 on the counter I slid it back and said you take this money back and just redo it. So after all that she hands me back $7.10 I not even sure if that right lol... Plus there was a random hamburger in my bag looks like another fun Burger King adventure...

S'This Subway has come a long way. It used to have pretty poor, unfriendly service. The teenage gals working there seemed to rather chit-chat than work but I think a manager with a somewhat ironfist may have read them the riot act because service has improved (at least this trip!).\n\nWhere the sandwiches used to be put together half-@$$ed, this time they were made with a little more love. The gals were more interested in greeting us, taking our orders properly, and being fast and efficient with getting everything prepared and paid for. The restaurant itself is very clean and the food very fresh, so it\'s safe to say there\'s new management involved.\n\nI have to say that Subway has the best tuna sub on the planet. That is no lie. I\'m not sure what it is they do, but that\'s about the only thing I can ever order here. I have a nephew who worked at one years ago, but he said there was no secret to it.  Adding bacon to it might have something to do with it. You can\'t go wrong with bacon! I\'ve even seen chocolate-covered bacon but have yet to try it. I\'m not big on the lettuce at these joints but I always go with the fresh spinach instead if there\'s not an ecoli scare happening. The sandwich makers can go a little extreme with the mayo so I have to tell them "just a little bit" and not make the mistake of just saying "light mayo", because they will indeed get the bottle of "light mayonnaise" and slop too much on my sandwich, not realizing I just meant " a little bit" of mayo. Comprende?\n\nThe breads are all good but I always stick with their wheat, never toasted. I swear I scrape the hell out of my lips on any sub that gets toasted.\n\nNice selection of chips. Nothing like putting them on your sandwich for that extra crunch. They also carry one of the best iced-teas for these type of restaurants called "Fuze". I wish more stores would carry it. Tastier than Lipton\'s!\n\nFair prices but it gets weird how they judge the prices of a footlong. They can go anywhere from $5 to $9 depending on what\'s inside. Is there a tuna shortage?\n\nYour pal,\nWalter'

S"Turkish Kitchen was a thoroughly decent, inexpensive meal for a group of us who hadn't booked a table in the city centre on a Friday night.\n\nOn sitting we were brought some bread and the most amazingly tasty dip ever.  I need to know what's in that dip because it was the highlight of the meal.  \n\nNot very hungry, I opted for the Turkish ravioli which, despite not being listed on the menu, came with a side of salad and rice.  The sides were a bit awkward and somewhat wasteful, but were certainly tasty.  \nThe ravioli left a lot to be desired, primarily because it was so overcooked it came apart the minute it I tried to eat it.  The taste was fine though nothing compared with my other experience with Turkish ravioli, which was such a shame because I was expecting something really fantastic.  \n\nI probably should have ordered something kebab-ey like everyone else, but I just wasn't in the mood for a meat feast.  Everyone else seemed happy with their meals, though.  \n\nOne weird thing was that when we ordered beer we got glasses which appeared all different sizes and smaller than what you would expect of either a pint or a large bottle. \n\nIt was a really good option for a group looking for something cheap and cheerful but is, in my opinion, not Edinburgh's best Turkish by a long mile."

My favorite is the one with chicken, spinach, and artichoke hearts. \n\nAlthough previous reviewers might have assumed that if they don't have items prepared in advance of the lunch rush, that if an item is not available, they will prepare it for you on the spot. They have always made any dish that I have asked for if they didn't have it ready without unreasonable delay.

The restaurant inside was beautiful as well, although it seemed outdated. When we arrived, the dining room was empty. When we left, about an hour later, it was packed. \n\nOur waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. We asked several questions about the menu and our waiter was able to answer every question. \n\nFor appetizers, I ordered the squash and smoked chili fritters and my husband ordered the corn and rock shrimp chowder. The fritters were amazing - they were a little spicy but they melted in my mouth. My husband loved his soup. \n\nFor my entr\xc3\xa9e, I ordered the chicken - it came with tumbleweed dumplings and a simple sauce. The chicken itself was extremely tender and flavorful. Normally, I wouldn't order a chicken dish, but the waiter talked it up and was right on the money. I would order it again. My husband ordered the bison bistro steak. The steak wasn't anything special. My husband kept stealing bites of my chicken, since he thought it was much better! \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the Cowboy S'mores. Oh. My. God. It was amazing. It was a dark chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, and toasted marshmallow in a mason jar. Then there was a cinnamon/graham cookie bar on the side for dipping. My husband ordered the huckleberry pie. It was huge and he was unable to finish it. Granted, I couldn't finish mine either, but I tried. It was that good.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience. The food was amazing.

S"Lucky my friend had a car and decided to eat here before our Cramond Beach walk.  This is my first time in a Toby Carvery ever.  \n\nThe location near the beach and the fact that it is a huge family gathering style eatery makes it perfect for a family gathering and a nice walk at the beach to let the children run wild and burn some fat.  \n\nI have the barbecue chicken wings to start off.  Smothered in barbecue sauce, the wings were average and accompanied by a yogurt style dip.  We then proceeded to get the main roasts.  There was a queue but soon it was our turn.  I was a bit disappointed with the portion of the meat.  You get 4 to choose from - gammon, pork, beef & turkey.  You can either choose all 4 or choose a selection.  I chose everything except turkey.  The pork was dry but the other 2 were just OK.  \n\nFunnily enough I wasn't given extra of another since I opted out of the turkey.  My friend chose 2 so she got 2 miserable thin slices only.  You can take as much of the other extra as you want.  They consist of yorkshire pudding, pork crackling, stuffing, brocolli and cheese, mash, potatoes, peas, parsnips, carrots and a few more others.  They looked like they have been mass prepared so lack of quality.  Gravy station consists of beef, vegetarian option and another.  Horseradish sauce was the best amongst the sauces.\n\nWaitresses were very friendly and helpful though.  Everyone working there were always smiling and no attitude.  \n\nUnfortunately, food is just average and just enough to make my stomach happy.  Nothing special to be honest.  Off to the beach to burn some fat!"

The atmosphere was relaxed, great vibe.  Good wine.\n\nWe ordered:\nlamb shank: this was the favorite: Very tender, the meat melts in your mouth in a "can i have more please?" way\nduck margaret with cranberry sauce: very tasty, very good\nveal and pasta: reminded me a little of stroganof, also very good but hard to match up against the lamb shank\nsteak and french fries: also good\n\nThe soup was zucchini soup which was fine.  Pepper gives it added flavor, but it comes with a light spice on its own.\nThe salad was good, sprinkled with a light vinegrette; preferred it over the soup.\n\nAll in all a great experience.'

Jimbo has brought many of his cuts and rolls with him here but many are missing giving way to the owners menu. You still can get your special scallops fix but many of the other cut rolls and hand rolls are not the same as we use to know it. Still very good and worth the visit! They offer all you can eat as well as \xc3\x80 la carte along with some cooked beef, fish, chicken, and noodle dishes. The tempura is great! Not on the all-you-can-eat menu but a must is the "Star Roll". I recommend the trying: Paradise roll, Girlfriend Roll, Vegas Roll, Baby Tako, baked clam, and Oyster Shooters.. They also almost always have both halibut (hirame) and red snapper(shirome) and are the freshest I have ever had! They also offer many different and newer (to most folks) cuts such as "white tuna" or "super white".. I believe the proper name is Escolar.'

S"Greasy breakfasts and poutine with smoked meat - that's why we stop into La Belle Province.  Also, it's proximity to La Carrefour Laval makes it an ideal pit stop before a shopping frenzy.\n\nI discovered this location of the chain La Belle Province a few years ago when we were in town for a friend's wedding.  We had to run to the mall to pick up a few things we forgot to pack and thought we'd swing in for a quick pre-wedding poutine.   Now it's just part of the La Carrefour routine.\n\nI ordered the large poutine with smoked meat ($7.99) while others ordered the hot chicken sandwich, breakfast with 2 eggs and the club sandwich with fries.  \n\nTo our surprise, there's a small patio attached with a few tables and umbrellas.  Sure, the scenery isn't that impressive - suburban houses and industrial parkway - but it was nice to eat our greasy diner food outdoors.\n\nStaff is always friendly and willing to accommodate food allergies.

S"The beauty of Buffalo Grill is that you can go and know exactly what you're going to have - comfort food (in a way) and at a cheap and cheerful rate. However, in these recession hit times, eating out is more of a luxury than it used to be and lots of caf\xc3\xa9s and restaurants have thrived by ensuring that they provide an experience worth paying for, using locally sourced ingredients, cooking to a high standard on the premises rather than using pre-made food and taking pride in their menu and what they offer. Unfortunately, Buffalo Grill has not done this. I used to love BG; the El Diablo burger was a particular favourite. However, on our last visit the scales fell from my eyes as I waded through my 'salad' (NB it's not the '80s anymore, who serves a slab of iceberg these days?) and chewed through stodgy, packet sourced, frozen-until-half-an-hour-ago chips which incidentally had been advertised on the menu as 'fries' (not the same thing). Making chips is not difficult and even the local pub would balk at serving up anything less than hand-cut triple-fried little beauties nowadays. For dessert, I had dime-bar cake and when it arrived I realised that it was just out of a packet (don't they sell that at IKEA?) and certainly not worth the \xc2\xa34 per portion being charged. \n\nThe restaurant was shabby with paint peeling off the walls, the tables were in an appalling condition and our wine was corked. Oh and if your waitress tells you that it is illegal to serve mince (burgers) at anything less than medium cooked in Scotland, she's delusional. This is totally untrue and if so I've been to several other restaurants (one with a Michelin start chef) who are flagrantly breaking the law. Maybe that's Buffalo Grill's policy and if so that's fine but at least be honest about it. My advice? Don't bother unless you want a below average meal that leaves you feeling just a little bit 'meh'."

S"I visited last Sun. for dinner after seeing a movie at AMC Loews theater in the Waterfront.  Because I visit the Waterfront now and again to see movies, I keep a list of non-chain restaurants nearby handy, and Dorothy 6 was at the top of it.\n\nI don't know if the bells on the door failed to jingle when I walked in, but oddly, nobody came to greet me and my dining partner. Because it was empty except for maybe one other customer at the bar, we took the liberty of choosing a table.  Before we sat down, a waitress emerged from the kitchen and handed us menus.  Because their website doesn't seem to be functioning, I wasn't able to look up the menu ahead of time, which would have been nice.  As it were, I found the prices a bit higher than I would have liked.  The waitress mentioned the special of the day, crab-stuffed salmon, which sounded amazing, but I balked at the price ($20). Instead, I went with the pierogi entree ($16), and my dining partner went with the reuben sandwich ($10).\n\nWhen the food came out, after about 10 min., it looked good, but I was a bit surprised by the presentation of the side dish, which was described as caramelized brussels sprouts with bacon.  I was expecting whole brussels sprouts, but this was more of a salad (see photo).  Nevertheless, I found the taste quite pleasant.  As for the pierogis, it was obvious that they were made fresh on site.  The exterior had a satisfying crispness, and the filling had just the right amount of cheddar flavor, and was soft but not mealy.  The caramelized onions served on top of the pierogis added a hint of sweetness, and the sour cream had a pleasant tinge of seasoning.  I was only able to eat half of the pierogis and brussels sprouts, so I took the rest home, and they were just as good the next day.  I didn't taste my dining partner's reuben, so I can't comment on it myself, but he enjoyed it, finishing it and the steak-cut fries that came with it.\n\nIn general, I found the quality of food here to be quite good, but I found it to be a bit overpriced.  I don't have any complaints about the service, and the ambiance, as others have mentioned, is quite interesting and beautiful.  I'm not sure if business is normally as slow as it was when I visited.  I hope not, since I'd like to see this place succeed, esp. in a town such as Homestead, which has few shopping and dining options outside of the Waterfront."

The pasta dishes are created by the chef who then  thin decides what should go into it instead of what you order/expecitng. Value wise it isnt bad but I think youd be better going elsewhere for \xc2\xa38-13 per main course. The decor is sligtly clinical with all the metalic tables and everytme I removed myself from the table I banged my head on a low light and I am only 5'5 ish ( 5'8 with hair bun) so its not the best designed.

My experiences here range from poor to mediocre. The food is nothing to write home about and the prices are high.

They seem to be consistently under staffed during lunch as my colleagues and I regularly find ourselves waiting extended periods of time to be served, as was the case today. \n\nThere seems to be a stark difference between this location and the Tavern on Monkland which I remember as being a good restaurant.

Service is moderately slow (so don't come if you are in a hurry for your flight). Menu is much more limited than as stated on Yelp. Food is expensive and they are chincy. I got all of 4 pieces of sliced (shouldn't it be shredded?) chicken breast on my nachos and a small dollop of guacamole, each for about $2 extra a piece. Music is irritating and loud. I haven't received the bill yet for my nachos and margarita but I'm thinking $30-35 not including tip. BUT this is in an airport and so considering the alternatives....this isn't bad. (If you look at the other Yelp reviews for McCarran, you'll notice similar low ratings for most of the restaurants). On the bright side, there is a full bar with 4 TVs, they let you stay a long time at your table without hurrying you, the service is not attentive but not neglectful either (I got a nice bowl of salsa when I asked for it), and  the seasoning on the freshly fried tortilla chips is TDF (is that an acceptable and understandable abbreviation?).

S'Update - August 2009.\nUgh. It\'s all over. The Luau Buffet is no longer held poolside with fire dancers and other entertainment. Now the Luau Buffet is a very sorry standard buffet at heightened prices. There are free "mai tai" drinks provided, but even those can\'t put back the party atmosphere I experienced at the poolside Luau two years ago. If anyone suggests it, you\'re better off finding something less expensive (it was $25/per on a Saturday) as putting a sweet sauce on chicken breasts does not a luau make. Sorry, Imperial Palace, we know the economy is bad, but this was once of the worst cuts we\'ve seen over the past year.\n\nNot the best buffet I\'ve ever been to, but the combination of the food and the show made for a wonderful evening. The Luau Buffet and Show only runs through the summer months, so if you\'re thinking about going, be sure to make plans early. Also, spend the extra $$ and get the VIP package - special give-aways, better table service, better view. Don\'t plan to get too loose on the "free-flowing" mai-tais and pina coladas advertised as endless. We needed to drink quite a few before we finally found one with some alcohol. But, fun none the less. Reminiscent of what I envision as a "typical" Las Vegas dinner show from bygone days.'

Although there are many variants, La Chilenita, opened 6 years ago, probably produces the best Chilean Empanadas in town! \n\nI tried the "La Chilena", apparently the most popular choice, with its traditional filling which includes beef, onions, black olives, and a slide of a hard boiled egg. The lunch special came with a hearty lentil soup for $6.99! Also available by the unit, 1/2 dozen or dozen, you can order your a choice of 6 meat and 5 vegetable fillings!\n\nIf you stop by for lunch, there\'s also your usual mexican fare including tacos, quesadillas, chimichanga, salads and burritos. I tried the chicken burrito grande jam-packed with savory chicken, beans and rice - there\'s enough for 2 people. \n\nCome say Hi to owner Patricia, hawkeye lady who pays attention to the team who helps produce these pocket of love and practice your Spanish!'

S'Je me souviens d\'avoir entendu l\'expression "L\xc3\xa2che pas la patate!" pour une premi\xc3\xa8re fois et de ne pas vraiment comprendre pourquoi on dit "patate." Si quelqu\'un a la r\xc3\xa9ponse, j\'aimerais bien le savoir.\n\nBon, tant qu\'\xc3\xa0 jaser de patates, aussi bien prendre le temps pour parler de Patate & Ciboulette. Le concept comme tel est pas mal g\xc3\xa9nial. Des patates au four, fournies de garniture de toutes sortes et pour tous les go\xc3\xbbts. J\'avais pris celle au poulet et curry (avec fromage et coriandre) alors que mon amie avait pris celle au chili v\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, sans fromage ou produits de bl\xc3\xa9. C\'est un repas parfait pour le lunch, surtout quand il fait tr\xc3\xa8s froid dehors et qu\'on a besoin de se remplir l\'estomac pour plusieurs heures. Des patates, \xc3\xa7a peut \xc3\xaatre lourd quand on en prend trop, mais puisque le m\xc3\xa9lange \xc3\xa0 l\'int\xc3\xa9rieur est fait s\xc3\xa9par\xc3\xa9ment et que d\'autres ingr\xc3\xa9dients frais comme des l\xc3\xa9gumes et des herbes y sont ajout\xc3\xa9s, \xc3\xa7a n\'est pas si pire. J\'ai donc bien aim\xc3\xa9 et j\'ai trouv\xc3\xa9 le concept rafra\xc3\xaechissant.\n\nVous pouvez aussi y aller pour acheter vos patates congel\xc3\xa9es puis les r\xc3\xa9chauffer quand vous en avez de besoin. L\'endroit comme tel est tr\xc3\xa8s petit, propre et bien \xc3\xa9clair\xc3\xa9. Puisque les salles de bains sont cach\xc3\xa9es vers l\'arri\xc3\xa8re, j\'ai pu voir qu\'il y a plein de place dans leur g\xc3\xa9ant garde-manger/cuisine, et il me semble qu\'un petit r\xc3\xa9am\xc3\xa9nagement leur donnerait plus de place pour asseoir plus de gens.'

S'So I look up from my desk and The Good Doctor (PhD, not MD) says: "Lunch?"\nIt being noon I\'m good with the suggestion so after the normal round of indecisiveness we settle for "That New-ish Dumpling Place nearby.\n\nThe place was quiet, not having gotten hit by the lunchtime so we were immediately greeted and seated by one of the chefs working the dumpling station. (Hello handmade purses of savoriness!) \n\nAs our our orders were taken I asked for the Beef/ Coriander dumplings with a bubble tea, but was told that the tapioca (the "bubbles") weren\'t ready.  An eyebrow shot up, wondering how a bubble tea restaurant could not have their bubbles ready for the lunch crowd. On the other hand - you have to appreciate the freshness of the bubbles so I let that slide, resolved to having a St Laurent frapp\xc3\xa9 (water) alongside my dumplings.\n\nMy dumplings... Chef brings me this plate of gorgeous steaming-hot dumplings and I want to dig right in but can\'t because The Good Doctor\'s order hasn\'t arrived. When his plate of Beef/Onion finally shows up 3 minutes later my dish is now only warm. Their sense of timing is *not* stellar, but moments later I am presented with my bubble tea, fresh off the bubble express. I\'m pretty excited and quaff a couple of squidgees before turning to my meal.\n\nI love coriander. I really really do. \n\nNot too hot and not too cold, these dumplings were exquisite! The full flavour of the beef and the freshness of the cilantro combined harmoniously in my mouth. Try them with the hot sauce they put out on the tables, but don\'t get overzealous with the stuff or you\'ll have your own story to write about.\n\nSynopsis:\nWhile the food was good their timing is a bit of a problem.'

S"The tearoom itself could use some work - it's rather bare and sparsely laid out (room for at least a handful more tables in there!!) but I say mostly because they ought to to fit more people in there considering scrumptious this spread of tea goodies is. \n\nThe savories (which in most places tend to be sad and lifeless with bland fillings) were inventive and flavorful - a salmon wrap with cress, an asian noodle salad, balsamic eggplant bruschetta. The sweets were equally delightful - fresh raspberry tart, mini eclairs, salted caramel popcorn panna cotta (!!), candied orange ganache chocolate cake. This is serious. \n\nAnd on top of that, two humongo raisin scones served with orange/rosemary marmalade, some kind of dark berry jam, and a potful of clotted cream. \n\nThe cost comes to about \xc2\xa314 per person, but we each got an extra pot of tea and I don't believe we were charged for it. If I lived in Edinburgh, you might find me here every afternoon, it's that scrumptious."

S"Two words come to mind that best describe my experience: thoroughly disappointing. The ambience is great - the decor is good and the waitstaff were nice enough. If I could end the review there this would be a 5 star review... but oh, the food. \n\nI ordered a staple, Pad Thai. I'm not sure where they went wrong but it was terrible all around. Instead of choosing your protein (as is common with the dish), this chef is confused - they include chicken, shrimp, and something else I couldn't quite make out; the flavor was just 'off' from what Pad Thai should be - that's as best as I can describe it. The spice level also left much to be desired - I ordered 'Thai Hot', the spiciest they have and the dish packed as much punch as a wet noodle, no pun intended. Lastly, the consistency of the noodles was just wrong - either it was too soggy or too wet and the noodles were round instead of flat so it didn't feel quite right in the mouth. \n\nAnd the price? At $14.95, this was the most expensive Pad Thai I've ever had; I wish I could say it was worth it. \n\nOn our way out (based on what I could see), I noticed that they didn't have a single Asian/Thailander working in the kitchen - it just seemed like a bunch of Southerners trying to mimic Asian cuisine; maybe that's why the food didn't have an 'authentic' taste. Maybe I'm being way too harsh/overly critical, but I'll tell you this - this is the first review I've ever given less than 4 stars; that's saying something. \n\nI really wanted to love this place, I did (especially since we live across the street from it), but based on tonight's performance, they're going to have a really hard time winning me back. \n\nOh and did I mention they don't have a lunch service? A Thai place with no lunch - that's like McDonald's with no breakfast."

S'Oh heavens above..... if there is a god I would quite safely say he cooked the devine 3 course lunch I had here!\n\nMy friend and I decided we would go out for a fancy lunch as a little bit of treat, we had phoned the Kitchin and they were fully booked so we decided to go here. I had been eye-ing it up anyway so I did not mind! \n\nWe arrived, maybe a little late as there were roadworks, and we were struggling to find somewhere to park. But we were warmly welcomed, and told to pick any table we liked!?\n\nAfter coming all this way we decided we had to have 3 courses of course, it would be criminal not to. So we ordered our meals and were eager to start....... until this dainty little plate of amuse bouche turns up. Oh yum! Smoked salom ballotine with caviar, a beetroot terrine with sour cream and black pudding bon bon.  - I hate black pudding, or so I thought. It was sooo tasty!\n\nThen my starter of smoked salmon, pickled cucmber, crab and caviar arrived. It was the perfect size and the flavours went together perfectly. May even be slightly converted to cucumber. Then there was the main....... perfect in every single way. John Dory with truffle risotto and a scallop sauce. I would date the heck out of that if it  were a guy..... amazing. And the pudding, chocolate fondant with coffee ice cream. Simple, well cooked, oozey and delicious... and anyone who knows me, the coffee ice cream was just the icing on the cake.\n\nI thought the food here was mind-blowing. The service was prompt and efficient, but maybe a little too clinical for my liking, like seriously....... just say something...... anything to me!?!!? And the parking was a bit of a nightmare, but I do not know Leith too well so that may be entirely my fault.\n\nI have now come to the conclusion that I MUST keep having lunches like this as they are improving my palate and making me less fussy...... had you told me I would eat Black Pudding and Cucumber and that I would actually like it!? Pfffft, not. A. Chance. But...... Yeay for widening the food horizons, and this place certainly does that.'

My friends and I used to eat at the Yoshinoyas a lot when I was working in NYC, and the places were almost always packed. And no wonder - the food is good and cheap, and the service is fast. The main drawback (for me) for this lone franchise in AZ its distance from Phoenix; but even that isn't so bad, as it is one minute from the Dysart Rd. exit of  I-10. Still, I wish they'd open some franchises in Phoenix itself. And Chheng L was right -- pouring the clam chowder into the beef bowl sounds crazy but I found it to be yummy when I tried it.  However, if you've never tried the beef bowl before, try it by itself first. Enjoy!"

S"While walking back to work from Spice Island one day, I made a mental note to try more pizza places in Oakland. First on the list - Pizza Romano.\n\nI walked in around 11:10 and was one of their first customers. I saw them rolling out the dough for my XL pie, which is definitely a good sign. The pizza came out fresh and piping hot, and continued to be hot even after I carried it all the way back to work. I mention this because I have an undying love for cold pizza, but Pizza Romano is a dish best served fresh out of the oven.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\nCrust - texture was kind of blah and uninspired, but the dough was extremely wholesome - like eating a roll or something - and definitely tasted pretty fresh. Not crisp or chewy enough for me though.\nCheese - best part of the pizza for sure. Lots of cheese, very chewy and stretchy, like one of those lame commercials where a family is sitting around the table on a Friday night instead of the reality that they are sitting in a living room watching awful TV while the parents get wasted on wine coolers and Canadian blended whiskey. However, the cheese quality slowly declined as the temperature of the slice went down, and I would describe this pizza as one that would be much less tasty when cold or leftover.\nSauce - eh. It was red, some tomato flavor, some spices, but nothing that knocks my socks off.\nPrice - ten bucks for a fresh-out-of-the-oven 18 inch, can't complain about that. \n\nOverall, this pizza was average. It would probably be best if eaten in the restaurant, but there isn't a whole lot to look at in the restaurant (no TVs, no bars, no other patrons) so make sure if you order it that your final destination is close. I would recommend Milanos over Romano if you're looking for a delicious and budget-conscious slice in Oakland."

I saw some images I would have loved to buy from them, but they were holding on to them for the previous owner.\n\nZaidi's is situated in a small strip of shops/stores on Granite Reed Rd.  So, this is a little out of the way, but I think it is worth the extra couple of turns.  The restaurant decor is an average mom and pop style.\n\ni really enjoyed my food and so did everyone in my party.  I will say that the most memorable dish was the Goat Kahrahi.

After the added salt, it actually had an okay flavor about it.\n\nBreakfast is a fairly difficult meal to destroy or get wrong, and 1889 cafe did fine.

S"Let me start by saying that Carefree Catering has 11 trucks around the valley so your experience may differ.  I believe these are the trucks that typically service the construction sites but have branched out because of the recent food truck craze. Also, when there were two Carefree Catering trucks parked within a block of each other outside my work (the courthouse), I noticed that the menu items and prices were different for each truck.  The trucks that come by my work are all white and don't have any distinguishing characteristics.  I know there is one that is painted but I've never eaten from it.  I have no idea how to distinguish the plain white ones.  \n\nI ordered a California burrito for $5.50 at one truck.  Maybe California burritos have been bastardized outside of San Diego, but, in San Diego (the home of the California burrito) a California burrito is carne asada, French fries, cheese, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.  This was ground beef, French fries, and a little bit of sour cream.  The ground beef did not taste good so I stopped eating it and I ended up getting sick later in the evening.  \n\nLater, I did notice that another Carefree Catering truck was selling California burritos for $5.  No idea if they differed in any respect from the other truck.  I wasn't willing to risk it again.\n\nBasically, this truck chain is a crap shoot.  I have encountered some people who enjoy the food from their neighborhood Carefree Catering truck.  If you have a favorite Carefree Catering truck, stick with it.  But don't expect consistency between the trucks."

I looked over the menu and noticed that they had a hot dog/chips/drink combo. I asked if I could have a Strawberry Julius as my drink. The girl behind the counter said that was only a Dairy Queen Combo and I couldn't sub the drink. I guess I'm not getting a hot dog then...Next I looked at the prices and notice it was $4.79 for a medium julius. I remember it was only $2 in California. I won the $15 free bet so I bought it anyways. It was just how I remembered....except the price."

It was just Shila, myself and an old man drinkin a draft beer. Shila and I talked as I played Dueces Wild on the bar and I ordered some breakfast.\n\nShe was telling me the bar is totally dedicated to all sports teams from Philly. Wish I wouldve known during the 1st 2 World Series games - Im sure the place was crazy!\n\nFull 3 egg breakfast was 6 bucks and the beer was comped. Nice!\n\nTheres a lot of room in this place! Theres couches and tables all around the bar so a bigger group would fit in just fine. Big screen TVs galore! Video poker machines will keep you busy during the game and the progressive jackpot for a royal flush was 1200!\n\nYou sure were friendly Shila! Hope to see you again!'

S'"Bonjour" was the greeting I got from the friendly man behind the counter when I walked in the door. I had just gazed at a tower of macarons in the window after walking down the hill from the Royal Mile on my way back to my car parked in the Grassmarket. Within a couple of minutes I realised that my "bonjour" was partly to do with the fact that very little English was spoken in the cafe... I had basically just stepped into Paris from Edinburgh. \n\nThe staff in La Barantine Victoria were really friendly. It had the feel of a family-owned business, which may actually be the case. \n\nI had the La Basque sandwich. It was a fresh baguette with chicken, mayo, roasted peppers and salad. I couldn\'t resist putting it down. Even though it was a big sandwich, I wanted more just because it tasted so good. I decided to go with the lunch deal of a sandwich (or quiche), hot drink, and... wait for it... a macaron. I had a nice pot of English Assam Breakfast tea which was tasty and at a good strength. And then I went with a salted caramel macaron, which was divine. \n\nIt doesn\'t look like it from the outside, but there\'s actually seating inside, so grab a table and savour the goodness of La Brantine. \n\nLa Barantine Victoria is great and should be on your list of places to try, even if you\'re getting a baguette, quiche or macaron to take away.'

They are juicy with enough smoke and spice to enhance the pork without overpowering it. They also have ribs drenched in sauce, but we've never tried that. They also have wings and Mexican items, which are all good, but the ribs are worth a hefty detour.\n\nThere are a few tables inside the food mart, and some picnic tables outside. Takeout is the common mode.\n\nThe whole station and food mart is a sort of living tribute to the spirit of Route 66. They have about everything a traveler might want, and a few kitschy do-dads that you might not realize anyone sold these days. \n\nIf you are in Gila Bend, there is a good chance it's because you're traveling.

S"I'll get right to it. Their fried chicken is the best. It blows Lolo's out of the water!  It has a light, crisp coating, the chicken itself was juicy and well-seasoned. Per usual, I got the hot sauce bottle at the ready. But after tasting that chicken, I set it right back into the rack. It didn't need a thing.\n\nHonestly, the chicken was better the first time I went, rather than the second time. I think the second time, they cut back on the salt. \n\nThere was great praise for the fried catfish and the red beans. My dining companion is from New Orleans, and she raved about the red beans. She claimed they are the closest thing to the real deal that she has tasted, outside of N.O. I thought they had a slight earthy, smoky flavor to them, that I couldn't quite pinpoint (maybe sage or file?), but was quite tasty.\n\nThe cornbread was mighty fine too (IIRC, it was sweetened). Next time, I'll pass on the mac and cheese. I thought it was pretty bland -- tasted mostly of the starchy sauce, little of the cheese. The noodles were cooked to oblivion. But mac and cheese is such a subjective matter. I am sure there are many others who will love it.\n\nThe greens were really delicious. Salt, fat, sweet, and spice were all represented in just the right ratio. \n\nI have not tried the desserts, so I cannot comment on them. I did note that they have red velvet cake, and several soda cakes. Yum!\n\nAtmosphere-wise, it is a comfortable little place that has live music and comedy on the weekends and evenings. The staff is super-friendly and even a little chatty.\n\nSo stop by Lil Mama's and have some chicken!"

S"The dining gods were kind today, At lunchtime they led us to La Mirage, a Mediterranean restaurant in the almost deserted Bell Canyon Shopping Center near Rt. 17. On entering, you're in for a surprise - a stage set up for musical entertainment, a dance floor, catering style cloth-covered dining tables with upholstered barrel chairs on wheels. And not a customer in sight.\n\nThe extensive menu is a combination of familiar Greek dishes, more exotic Lebanese ones, and a great many dishes I had never heard of (which made me very happy). The owner is Arab, so perhaps that's what these dishes are. There are many combination plates and family platters. You can even get a whole lamb with rice (called Quzy) for $225.\n\nWe ordered the deluxe appetizer platter ($13.95) which came with stuffed grape leaves (served hot), falafel, a large plate of hummus, and fattoush, a salad with pieces of fried pita bread. This was more than enough for a meal, but we had also ordered an entree of\nShish Kafta ($13.95), skewered ground beef with onions and parsley. The two skewers were accompanied by a mound of fluffy rice and a pile of raw chopped onions coated with sumac, a spice not used enough in restaurants in the U.S. A bowl of lentil soup came with the entree, and it was delicious, as were all the various dishes. Our very nice waitress also supplied us with a bowl of curry potato stew because the sauce goes well on the rice.\n\nHere's a list of some of appetizers and entrees. I hope it whets your appetite and curiosity: Quail, Foul Mdmass, Bajilla, Kibbe done three ways, lamb chops, kabobs and shawarma, chicken cream chops,\nghallaba, lablabee, fruit smoothies.\n\nIf you go to the website you can check out La Mirage's menu, and also their entertainment schedule. There are card games on Sunday and Wednesday evenings, belly dancing on Saturdays, and Latin and Salsa dancing on Thursdays.\n\nThis is another place that's barely managing to hang on. So if you feel like having a Middle Eastern meal, safe or adventurous, please give them a try."

S"Old school sumptuous setting. Great food.\n\nBuuut the service was a let down.  I think Grace summed up the entire experience rather poignantly in her review (we had dinner there together). I, on the other hand, rather enjoyed the lengthy descriptions about the wine, if only because of the entertainment value. My wine palette is just not developed enough to appreciate whichever 'famous' wine grower grew the wine and in precisely what region of where it was grown. I treated it as like a little story telling although we'd forgotten the stuff he said at the beginning by the time he got to the end... ok.. maybe they DID go on a little long.  All of this not aided by the fact that he was so soft spoken, you couldn't hear him half the time.\n\nStand out dish was the rabbit ravioli, the rest of the food was good but I would expect nothing less from this calibre of restaurant. And to be honest I was expecting a little more 'WOW'... Having stolen tastes of G&S's wine pairing, I think D & I were glad we'd passed on the option and just chose a bottle of wine to go with dinner.\n\nAlso beware the after dinner drinks trolley as nothing is priced and imagine our surprise to find that our dram of whiskey cost the same as our bottle of wine! \n\nAll in all a fun night out but feel like I got a lot more bang for my buck at The Honours where we'd been the month before."

S"I came here with two friends prior to visiting Apis Meadery next door this past weekend.  I ordered the General Tso's chicken, and my friends ordered the sesame chicken, crab rangoon, and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  They ordered the combo with less meat, and I ordered the one with more--the names were very similar, which I found confusing. The food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.), so I'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  While we were waiting, the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese, and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).\n\nTo be honest, I'm not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived in Singapore for 3 mos. and have visited Hong King and Japan); it's been awhile since I've had it, and this dish reminded me why.  I don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce, nor do I care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (I like to cut up my own meat, thank you very much), so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  Having said that, my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare they'd had in PGH (and they live in Squirrel Hill!), so if you're a fan of this cuisine, you can take that into consideration.\n\nIf nothing else, this meal provided us with some much-needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead, which I appreciated."

While the food is not better than chipotle, or Baja Fresh, or most other fast food burrito chains, Moe\'s has a couple of things going for it that I really like. \n\nThe big one is a different option than most. You can order the Triple Lindy, which gives you the choice between sour cream and guacamole. Since I dislike sour cream and love guacamole, this is perfect. Most other places (Chipolte) overcharge for gauc. Moe\'s on the other hand, charges you if you want both (the Home Wrecker) or the cheap option is one or the other (the Triple Lindy). \n\nMoe\'s also has a pretty good selection of cheap beer!'

Whilst Poland might not be the most far flung of destinations, I can safely say I had never come across Poilsh food until I crossed Pani's threshold so I maintain that it is exotic. Unfortunately my experience will not have me rushing out to sample Polish sausage or Bigos again. The sausage looked like those nasty smoked ones that you can get in every Scottish chippy, but on the inside it was grey and fatty - I am generally the sort of girl who clears her plate, needless to say I didn't finish that particular meal. The Bigos, a typical Polish stew, didn't fare much better; it had clearly been microwaved and the meat was a bit dry and shrivelled because of this. On the plus side I discovered Tymbark, a popular Polish fruit juice, but this is not enough to make me want to return."

S'NOT VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY.\nWalk in and the smell of bacon greets you.  Really nothing on the menu is suitable for vegetarians.  I ordered the home fries, which were described on the menu as grilled potatoes, and lo and behold they turned out to be potatoes covered in pieces of bacon.   I told the staff I was a vegetarian, the cook politely offered to make me a new batch of potatoes, but everything is cooked on the same grill.   Ergo, the next batch of potatoes were infused with bacon grease and residual bacon bits.   \n\nThey didn\'t offer an apology, or like any decent restaurant, comp the bacony potatoes, or apply a discount or coupon for future visit.  Nothing.  We were charged the full bill as if our meal was satisfactory.  Our return business was not important to them.\n\nI also ordered a cinnamon roll and what I received was a cinnamon muffin.   There is a difference.  A cinnamon roll is a soft chewy rolled up magically delicious thing covered in lovely gooey icing that leaves your fingers sticky.  A cinnamon muffin is a dry, crispy, cinnamon flavored MUFFIN.   I thought perhaps they made a mistake so I mentioned that it was a cinnamon roll I had ordered and they said "yes, we make it a cinnamon muffin".  So why not put "cinnamon muffin" on the menu so I know what I\'m getting into?   False advertising.   \n\nThis was the worst breakfast I have ever had in my life.  Prior to this, the worst breakfast I\'d ever had was in a dingy hostel in the worst part of Rome, in which the breakfast was fake juice and a crust of bread.   Well done, PapaGallo.\n\nAlso the obsession with rooster decor was a little creepy.'

S'Super Buffet has more tables than most of the buffets I have visited and so they have a wider variety of dishes to choose from.

The avocado ones had not had a chance to oxidize, so I knew they were fresh. Nothing special but worthy of a "three star" attempt.\n\nLots of non-Chinese options, including pepperoni pizza, quesadillas, mac and cheese, pigs feet and french fries plus peel-and-eat shrimp. I did see at least two ethnic dishes, one of which was squid in garlic sauce. This one certainly looked authentic enough for me to walk on by. :-)\n\nDesserts included the standards for these places - banana pudding with (knock-off) Nilla wafers, chocolate pudding and assorted sheet cakes in various flavors. They also had apricots, lychees, peaches and pineapple available (straight from the can is my guess) and a bunker of individual ice cream cups and ice cream sandwiches. Surprisingly, the brand was "Hershey". I expected a soft-serve machine or something more generic. Thumbs up here!\n\nPlenty of parking and plenty of seating. Well lit. Even at the busiest time, I don\'t think that there would be much of a wait. The floor around the buffet tables was rather slippery. I don\'t know if there had been a recent spill or if this is a normal thing, so watch your step!\n\nOverall, while it had a large selection and the price was right ($7 for lunch), I found the food rather bland. If you don\'t mind that and you want variety and lots to eat, this is the place for you! I\'d also suggest that this is a great place if you have picky eating kids, as there is plenty of things that aren\'t just "Chinese food" and the few kids I saw and heard seemed happy enough.'

We shared the Tea braised pork and while it was pretty salty and left us satisfied again to definitely eat from this stand again. \n\nThe dish came with a pretty large portion of white rise, cucumbers/celery and an egg. Everything was good, but everything (besides rice/salad) was also a little bit on the salty side. Too much non-sodium free soy sauce I believe. \n\nThey also carry bubble tea, which I haven't tried."

The misters were on but were not functioning well. The bartenders were slow and took a long time to acknowledge everyone. The security guys were very aggressive. The reason I went there was to see the concert and since it was a bar I assumed I could drink while watching the concert. Nope... They do not allow you to drink in the room where the concert is. So I go to buy some water. They only accept cash at the nearest bar. I didn't have cash so I made my way through the crowd to the other bar. They are out of water bottles. I finally make it to the other bar where there is a $10 min purchase so I had to buy 5 bottles of water. So frustrating!!! The concert tickets were way over priced. I don't care who plays there in the future. I will never go to this place again."

S"I note at the time of this review this restaurant is newly opened and still might be working things on the menu out.\n\nFirst of all maybe the most useful information needed is that you must use the address posted on Yelp and not the Fairmont Princess Address posted on the Toro Website or you will be in a mess and will have to use the Fairmont Shuttle Bus that may or may not be running to get to the Toro Restaurant and Rum Bar.\n\nWhen we finally found this restaurant sort of hidden in the Fairmont Golf Course we found that it didn't have a sign. You will know your in the right place when you see the bottles of rum and restaurant tables.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is very slick and modern with a big sushi/ceviche bar in the middle of the room.  We decided to sit on the patio with lovely views of the golf course and the McDowel Mountain Range.\n\nThe menu is Pan Latin Cuisine. We were told the menu is mostly Peruvian with flavors but blended with Asian too. \n\nThis restaurant features a rum bar but I didn't partake in alcohol and had Iced Tea and water instead. The restaurant could use more filtration as the water had an off taste I didn't like.\n\nWe started with the Angry Tuna Roll. It was made with quality Tuna that was delicious. I liked that they dotted each piece with actual wasabi sauce. The tuna really was spicy and the rolls sat on some sort of Thai Chili Sauce. The Angry Tuna Roll was really very good. \n\nFor me what wasn't as well received as the Tuna Roll was the Chicken Soup (Caldo De Pollo). It was presented to us as cold pulled chicken in a bowl with some rice and a little bit of something like pico and a little pitcher of warm water laced with a little bit of chicken flavor that you pour on. This soup was very weak in flavor. TO BE FAIR as possible I do think maybe the soup might have had more flavor if the liquid was hot enough to bloom whatever was in the bowl and maybe you might get a better tasting soup than I got. The waiter asked us how it was when we were finished with it and my husband told the waiter the soup was very bland. The waiter thanked us for the imput.\n\nWe also shared the Lomo Sactado. It was delicious and made with Medium Rare  (almost too close to rare for me) Tenderloin and Crispy Fries as promised. It was really a very tasty Stir Fry in a Soy Jus. The tomatoes and onions just tied it together. I do think they should ask you how you want the meat cooked in this dish. I'm OK on a tenderloin with M/R but not everyone is.\n\nThe kitchen was very good about splitting our plates for us.\n\nI really want to give this new place 3.5 stars but if I have to decide between 3 and 4 I'm closer to three stars on this one mostly because of the Weak Chicken Soup, the very high prices on the iced tea and soda ($5.or a small glass of soda) and the rest already mentioned.\n\n3.5 stars"

While it does not come anywhere near the greatness of Romados' grilled chicken out in the Plateau, Casa Manolo does just fine, thank you.\n\nExcellent sangria, the grilled squid, sardines, chicken and sausage are done very well also. I have not tried their steaks or lamb chops here yet, but I'm guessing they're probably just as good as everything else.\n\nOne thing you absolutely have to try here is their dessert. The chocolate mousse is probably one of the richest, most decadent versions I tried anywhere and their chocolate and passion fruit dessert has to be tried to be believed.\n\nService can be spotty at times since they also have a brisk take-out counter business too but the waitresses and waiters I've had here in the past are always polite and mean well."

Ate here with my bf and his mother and the experience was interesting. We decided to share a table with 2 other groups because we were just starving from waiting. It was extremely busy at the time we came, and we just wanted to eat.\nThe hostess accepted our request and put us at a large table with 4 other people. She was very pleasant.\n\nNow onto the food! The har gow was not heavily stuffed with shrimp, rather it was smaller in size. I noticed that some dim sum places make extremely large har gow...too much shrimp like it's overkill. The flat shrimp pancake rolls were slightly on the dry end, and this happens to be my favorite dish. Bummer. \n\nOverall the food was decent, service was ok except they messed up the bill making us pay 15 dollars more than we should have. Thank goodness my bf and his mother rechecked the bill!\n\nCome here for dim sum if you're in the brossard neighborhood, it's fair priced and acceptable. Also the establishment holds a  lot of people, so it is quite spacious."

This pizza place is DEFINITELY geared towards delivery, as their attempt at seating includes two benches facing each other in reception. Funny enough I believe I've eaten pizza there on more than one occasion anyway! \n\nI think I'm just always impressed by large sized pizzas, and from what I've personally had over there I would recommend the hawain, bbq chicken, and vegetarian pizzas. I won't scrutinize the quality of their dough, cheese and the like, because in my opinion, ALOT of these pizzas taste the same to me; granted they're equally delicious, but unless they're made in a wood oven by an actual italian (who has spoilt all pizzas for me since) what is there to say really?"

I had green mussels that were cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the nigiri sushi I ordered. The pieces were smaller which made it nice for me to try several different kinds. The yellow tail was very fresh! The shrimp tempura was okay...it tasted a bit like onions, which it was fried with. I did find it odd that the shrimp tempura appetizer not only comes with 2 pieces of shrimp but also potatoes, carrots and onions (fillers!)

That was a bit upsetting but I was willing to wait. When I ordered a pan pizza, I was then told that they were out of pan pizzas. Grant it I called at 9:30 pm and it was close to closing time, but with a $10 for any pizza, they should have been prepared and had extra dough prepared. I asked to speak to a manager so I could complain. I was expecting lame excuses and apologies but I was so pleasantly surprised! Carla, the manager on duty, did apologize but she did not try to give me a song and dance. She was honest with me and that goes a long way. She handled my complaint so well that I decided to go ahead and order anyways. She offered me a substantial discount for the trouble that I experienced and for that I am thankful. \n\nIf every manager could learn how to handle customer complaints with the same amount of honesty and understanding as Carla did this evening, the world would be a much better place. A little but of humility and honesty goes a long way and is very much appreciated. Thank you Carla for renewing my faith in customer service.'

S"Operated by Cantonese - that's one star I am voting for already! \n\nBut let's get serious here, The Teriyaki Company is pretty awesome.  $3.99 for the teriyaki bowl, and I hear they have a second-to-none awesome deal on lunch.  Teriyaki chicken lunch plate with egg rolls for $4.99. \n\nSpeaking of egg rolls, they are absolutely LEGIT.  Being from Hong Kong myself, I know a legit egg roll when I see it.  It is twice as long as the ones you usually see at similar teriyaki chicken places, and the timing of the frying is superb.  The egg rolls don't have none of those crazy cabbage fillers, but instead, they are pure chicken and, wait for it...., chopped up chestnuts!  Yep!  The chestnuts act as a filler, but they also create that extra crunch, not that it need it... But chestnuts in egg rolls is what you will find in Asia, or at least in well-to-do restaurants in Hong Kong.  Still not convinced?  I usually don't even eat the egg rolls that come with my meals, but I would go back to TTC just for the egg rolls.\n\nNow that since I am here at the TTC again for the egg rolls, might as well get the better-than-your-standard chicken teriyaki plate!  Now, mind you, this is still a chicken teriyaki bowl after all, so don't expect a life-changing experience because this is not the restaurant for it.  However, if you are interested in fresh chicken and just the right amount of teriyaki sauce with slightly-moister-than-usual rice, then TTC has it all!\n\nI also tried the yakisoba, and THAT was also awesome.  I don't know how yakisoba can be awesome, but it was!  \n\nListen, I feel a bit shameful to be giving TTC a 4 star just because it is located in a somewhat gross side of town and that it is basically a mock of Asian food, but I will feel wrong to not yelp about TTC because they actually do know what they are doing there, for what it's worth!

They still can\';t get the meat cooked right though. You can place your order for Medium and It will either be too raw or over cooked. After being there for a year you think they would get it right??? Service can be "very" hit and miss though when they are busy as  the kitchen is small and they keep it short staffed usually (probably a sign of the economy and rents in Troon North aren\'t cheap!

S"I've been eating at a lot of food trucks lately and I can honestly say this is one of if not the best one I've had. It's been around since early 2012 and has been active at Charlotte's bustling Food Truck Friday since January...yet it has no press here on Yelp?! That's unheard of.\n\nThe good folks who own and operate this truck are from North Carolina but lived in New Orleans for a bit of time, and boy oh boy did they learn some good cooking while they were down there. This Creole food has all the flavor of home cooking, the convenience of a food truck, and the quality and presentation of a stellar restaurant. The prices seem reasonable too...though I live in DC so I might be super jaded which it comes to prices.\n\nThe red beans and rice ($6) were the most amazing dish I had from Root Down...and at the entire Food Truck Friday event last week. I've made RB&R myself and they were awesome. Root Down made them look like a child's attempt at cooking. The gumbo was a close second favorite for items and had I not already eaten more than my share of other items, I would have happily ordered my own bowl. The catfish po boy was a full meal (and at just $8), and though there was a sizable portion of fried catfish on there, it must be noted that the bread was pretty big -- hence why it could be an entire meal in and of itself. The homemade tartar sauce and micro greens on it added flavor and color making it a beautiful dish of perfectly fried and seasoned fish. My table mates raved about the mac and cheese, but damnit for being too proper and not wanting to eat off of Kerrick's spoon on the second occasion I met him. Serves me right. The $2 sweet potato chips were dusted with powdered sugar and were the only disappointment of the truck. The little snack was a filler and nothing else. Save the space and order a second serving of RB&R.\n\nThe next time we're back in Charlotte I hope to have some more Root Down cookin. I hope they open a restaurant so that it will be more accessable for every time we go visit the family."

S'I know people are crazy for Culver\'s. It\'s an ok place for a custard, but I don\'t get the butter burger thing. Every meal I\'ve eaten there just hasn\'t set well on my stomach--especially the "walleye" sandwich. I even tried a salad in an attempt to find something healthy. The lettuce was wilted and what chicken they had on top was uninspired and as dry as a shoe.   I\'ll keep trying, though. I haven\'t had any of their soups, and if these are good I\'m willing to rethink this review a bit. \n\nI will say they are very awesome with kids and generous with the free little dishes of custard for them.'

When  you walk in you are greeted by many students. They are all waiting on you. We ended up getting the buffet...which is more like a mini buffet. If you check in on Yelp you get $1 off..which makes it only $7 and that includes your drink.\nIt was a great deal.

I can say that this was the best short rib I have ever tasted and the meat slid off the bone.  The sun dried tomato polenta was equally tasty. I had the sea bass which was prepared perfectly.  drizzle of olive oil and some cherry tomatoes.  \n\nWe really enjoyed this place and would recommend it in an instant."

The Aegean pasta was overcooked to mushiness. (Side note: Funny, the prior owners served mushy pasta too.) The food was served out of order (e.g. soup/salad with entree comes before the entree unless specifically instructed otherwise). Fries and burgers were barely luke warm when they arrived.

The food wasn\'t bad, tasted good, could have used some onions on the sandwich though.\nThe restaurant it self could use some work. It was hot as hell in there, it didn\'t really have any "atmosphere"  Just a bunch of tables with red and white checker plastic cloths on them.\nI sat there and watched them lose more potential customers than what they actually had in there eating because there is no bell for you to ring to let anyone know your there to be waited on. The "workers" are all in the back cooking. So, people standing to have their order taken end up just walking out. You\'d think the the restaurant wouldn\'t want that happening.

The Enchilada was good, the red sauce was good too. \n\nThey also gave us two Flans to share. I thought it was really cool. I had never had flan but thought it was OK.

However, when compare to the one in Chandler, This Zen is definitely two steps behind.  Since this is new, it is clean, it is expected.\n\nI\'ve noticed many dishes are "deep fried" rather than "Stir fried", I also noticed, many dishes are SOAK - BATH in oil. Far more so than other Chinese buffets I\'ve been to ( greasy, that\'s the word I was looking for). Other than too GREASEEEY, it is pretty much the same as other Chinese buffets.\nI ate heavenly on the Salad and desert section, it is very fresh - no grease. \nOver all its not too bad, just don\'t set your expectation hi, don\'t look for anything new,  or exciting. \n\nWhat you will find is  a typical Chinese buffet  food.'

S'A fairly new addition to Scottsdale Fashion Square, Blue Burrito has seemed to have reinvented itself before. Whereas before, you could order items like salads, enchiladas and tacos off the menu, BBG now has a Chipotle-like setup that lets you pick burrito, bowl, salad or tacos and choose your ingredients. Much better than what they had before because before they had a tendency to mess up my order. \n\nIf you\'re lucky, the salsa will be good on the day you visit. Some times it\'s watery and upsetting. Other times, it\'s thick and flavorful.\n\nI\'m told the rice & beans and both vegetarian, unlike many local Mexican joints, so that\'s a big plus. You can add things like corn, cabbage, peppers and guacamole to your item of choice if you like, too. Although, the guac could be kicked up a notch w/ some cilantro and lime juice.\n\nIn the future, I\'d like to see a vegetarian "meat" option but I\'m not going to hold my breath. It\'s easy for a place like BBG to add grilled eggplant, or tofu, or strips of grilled portabello mushroom or mock meat at very little cost to the business. The additional costs could be passed on to the consumer, in so gaining the heart of the vegetarian community, expanding their customer base, and giving vegetarians a heartier, more satisfying burrito.\n\nAnd I think that about wraps it up.'

I've also had no problems redeeming my survey code for a free cookie (if you don't know what that is, check the back of your receipt next time). Preparation seems pretty consistent except for one occasion where they might have skimped a bit on my chipotle mayo. It's kinda small, but aren't they all? Only things stopping this from being a 5 star are that it's a fast food chain restaurant and that the white guy (haven't caught his name) constantly tries to upsell. He asks if you want more cheese and whatnot, and it gets annoying.\n\nNote to self: keep getting my sub toasted because it seems that it's $5.41 for both toasted and untoasted."

S'Irgendwie habe ich die letzten Jahre dieses Caf\xc3\xa9 komplett ignoriert. War wohl ein Fehler. Ich bin hier unz\xc3\xa4hlige male vorbeigelaufen und hatte auch schon mal draussen einen Caf\xc3\xa9 getrunken, aber drinnen war ich gestern das erste mal.\n\n\n Vom Ambiente wirklich gem\xc3\xbctlich. Das Caf\xc3\xa9 ist zwar riesig, aber irgendwie hat man es geschafft, dass man nicht das Gef\xc3\xbchl hat im Bahnhof zu sitzen. Von der Musik Abends gerade noch im vertr\xc3\xa4glichen Rahmen, ein bischen leiser und man k\xc3\xb6nnte sich besser runterhalten.\n\n\n V\xc3\xb6llig begeisert hat mich der Service. Hier sollte sich der ein oder andere Karlsruher Gastronom mal was abschauen oder gleich sein Personal in die Lehre schicken. In vielen negativen Qype Artikeln geht es um langsamen, genervten und \xc3\xbcberforderten Service. Hier kann man lernen wie mans machen muss, wenn man von den G\xc3\xa4sten 5 Sterne haben m\xc3\xb6chte. \nDie Geschwindigkeit mit der uns gestern Abend die Getr\xc3\xa4nke serviert wurde, obwohl der Laden rappelvoll war, war schlichtweg atemberaubend. Man hatte das Gef\xc3\xbchl, dass der Service das Hefe schon hinter dem R\xc3\xbccken hielt und sowieso schon in meinen Augen gelesen hatte was ich bestellen wollte. Hammer!\n\n\n Auch gut gel\xc3\xb6st ist der separate Raucherraum im Wintergarten. Einer der wenigen Umsetzungen der "Nichtraucherschutzgesetze", die ich auch als militanter Nichtraucher komplett akzeptiere und applaudiere. Mit dieser L\xc3\xb6sung spart man sich als Nichtraucher auch den Spiesrutenlauf wie bei vielen anderen Kneipen, um die Qualmbarrieren vor den Eing\xc3\xa4ngen zu passieren.\n\n\n Ich werde hier definitiv \xc3\xb6fter vorbeischauen und \xc3\xa4rger mich ein wenig, dass ich den Laden so lange hab links liegen gelassen.\n\n\n Weiter so und bitte beim Service nichts ver\xc3\xa4ndern - es kann nur schlechter werden!'

S'No, but you don\'t understand, it isn\'t LIKE that, guys. It isn\'t snooty. It isn\'t scene. In fact, if you didn\'t know that everything here was good and virtuous, that whatever your dietary requirements you are probably guaranteed to find it catered for, you wouldn\'t realise that that was the whole point. Sure, there\'s gluten free stuff, vegan stuff, dairy free stuff, juice cleanses, organic boosters, aaaaaaall that jazz.\n\nBut it doesn\'t feel preachy or superior - it\'s just... really nice. Wooden tables, big front window in a leafy street in Marchmont just beside the Meadows, lots of light and space, and a mighty fine looking lemon tart I want to go back and try. Yep, it\'s a winner. Maybe they could do with a couple more comfy places to sit, perhaps, as one of my lasting memories is of "quite hard".\n\nHowever, my carrot, orange and celery juice was a super-refreshing start to a day that would later contain, from another establishment, two coffees in a row and the world\'s largest slice of red velvet cake, and yet I felt healthy all day because of the juice. Maybe that\'s the only danger here: the ability to fool yourself your diet is JUST FINE because you feel so good from just the smallest Meadowlarking of a morning.'

The workers are so friendly and welcoming, it felt like I was back in K-town in NYC for a minute :). I asked our waitress a few questions about the menu, and then I saw that they have jjambbong (my absolute favorite). She explained to me that it's different here (not our traditional jjambbong, but similar.. and with udon noodles!). Of course I was intrigued. I ordered it my usual style (as spicy as possible with extra noodles). \n\nWhen it came out, it looked and smelled incredible but I knew right away that it will not be anything like jjambbong. There were lot of crabs in it, which you never really find in a traditional bowl of jjambbong but I was more than happy to see them! They were fantastic! There wasn't enough noodles for sure... because I asked for extra noodles, and it did not come even close to cutting the cake. I can't imagine what the bowl is like without the extra noodles..... probably just soup? Anyhow, this dish is a great choice if you like spicy seafood. I will definitely be ordering it again!\n\nI want to return to this place to try other food items but I know it will be hard not to order the same dish I tried :)."

S'I really expected better! And I\'ve HAD way better from Roy\'s in the past. The Ahi poki starter was fine, although spicy enough to drown out the side portion of Tobiko caviar, which was a shame. The Sunrise at Haleakala role - a delectable sounding roll of salmon, aji, hamachi, and asparagus, was a disappointment due poor "tempura" frying of the whole roll. The batter was more like a fish fillet batter than a tempura, and too greasy. The overwhelming taste was fried batter, not fish. The scallops encrusted in foie gras were ok, but not the standouts for which I had hoped. The accompanying blackberry plum reduction was too fruity and sweet to complement the scallops. The dish included 5 giant scallops - I would have preferred fewer and better. \n\nService started out almost oppressively attentive and dwindled to virtually nothing (except water refills) by dessert. We waited about 20 minutes for someone to show up so we could ask for the check. The server was stumped by my question about if they have a chardonnay that is not oaky. He pointed out that one that was "buttery but not oaky"... hmmm, he needs a wine 101 lesson. And of course described the "artesian" vanilla ice cream. Again hmmm...can\'t say I\'ve ever seen vanilla ice cream spurting from the ground under pressure. A forgivable error, but another indicator that the it\'s no \'pro" service. \n\nThis food and service at a Bahama Breeze would get 3 stars, but at Roy\'s?? I really expected better.'

It was around 530 pm and think it would have been better around 7 as the meat was not quite fork tender and the risotto was still crunchy. The salad was good and it came with a glass of house wine.

S"Wholesome, hearty  food with a homely feel.  Think of the Compass' offerings as your mum's feel good grub with a professional guise.\n\nWalking past the window of the Compass, I caught a glimpse of the chef slicing a big crusty bread loaf on a rustic wooden slab, slices of what looked like Brie and a bunch of fresh herbs nestled at the side.   That image convinced me to dine there with little consideration and I was not let down.\n\nInside you'll find a typical up market pub interior: stone walls, wooden tables and slouch worthy chairs. What sets this place apart is food. I tried a braised duck leg with a spicy potato stew - top quality stuff and under ten pounds too."

The food is always hot, and always tasty, and the order is never wrong, but not the cheapest because the place has a lot of overhead and stupid billboards to pay for. \n\nAll in all,  I eat here a lot, and keep going back because it's f'ing Chik-fil-a, and there is crack in the food, but the wait in the drive-thru is just ridiculous... 2.5 mins per car, and there are usually about ten in front of me no matter when I go through.  \n\nThat's a long time to wait after a fifteen hour day. With a staff of like fifteen at any given time, I don't understand the wait.  It's an excellent location if you go inside, know what you want, and don't mind ten bucks per person for fast food, but the drive-thru trap has to be dealt with before they find an aging corpse in the line."

S"A couple of friends and I ventured downtown this morning for breakfast, intending to eat at the Silver Spoon Cafe, located inside the Hotel San Carlos. Surprise, it was closed- as it has been every single time i've gone past the place. But, as luck would have it, the other restaurant on the premises, Copper Door, was open. \n\nThe dining room is really nice, and the staff is great. The menu is small and straightforward, with a sampling of fairly traditional American breakfast items. Eggs Benedict, Huevos Rancheros, Biscuits & Gravy...you get the idea. The prices are good, with entrees ranging from $5 to $8. \n\nI had the Hashbrowns entree- hashbrowns mixed with onion and pepper, with a little cheese. (It comes with sour cream, if you're so inclined) It was okay- tasty, but dry. The portion was really small, but I can't complain too much for $5. My dining companions had the Eggs Benedict and poached eggs with fruit, both of which got full-mouthed approval. \n\nI had no idea this place was even open for breakfast. Give it a try. It's tasty, without the grease of that *ahem* other place down the road."

Overall, this place is a beacon of hope in the sea of wannabes that is the Mexican restaurant landscape of Charlotte. \n\nI can't believe I've only seen one mention of the sopes. Holy crap, that's the main reason I keep coming back!!!! I dream of their sopes. Okay, maybe not. But they're amazing. And the salsas? I could probably drink every single one. Though, I'm the biggest fan of the dark red one. It's super spicy. But really, they're all a little spicy. Sensitive tongues need not apply. \n\nTheir store front is pretty nondescript. You would drive right by it if you didn't know any better. Inside is small with probably about 8-10 tables total.

S'I go to this location often on the way to work, and the past six times I\'ve ordered a double cheeseburger with bacon added... Lately they\'ll correct me, "YOU MEAN A BACON DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER???" Kind of meanly, So I say yes obviously because I guess that\'s a value menu item now. Six out of six times it has come with no bacon, while I\'m still being charged for it. Most of those times they also give me no receipt, so I can\'t even go back after work. It may not seem like much to most people but seriously it wasn\'t a one time mistake, they\'re going to continue to misread their screens since they added that to the value menu instead of the old "cheeseburger + bacon."

S'First plus: best lamb curry of life. I\'ve had lamb curry before - I know what\'s good. HOWEVER, the butter chicken was too sweet for my liking (and my date agreed) - I would definitely not order it again. We had a combo plate for 2, which also included a vegetable side plate (tasty) and a few other little appetizers which were also yummy: delicious sausages and pakoras with really good dipping sauces. The naan bread, though, was not as good as it could be - I\'ve had much, much better naan. \n\nWe showed up very late, like about twenty minutes before the kitchen was closing at 11pm, and were still served but asked to make a decision quickly. Our gracious waiter served us water out of a reused 2L Evian plastic water bottle (hilarious? or in bad taste? I\'m not sure) and poured it like it was expensive wine. Kinda hilarious, actually. I ordered a martini, which came in a short water glass with ice cubes, not a martini glass, and was not a real martini but one of those pre-mixed "martini" drinks. OK, so it\'s not classy. However, the d\xc3\xa9cor was quite comfortable and cozy, though I was a little turned off by the fact that the table cloths were not removed and washed after dinner guests had finished their meals and left - the waiter would simply come over with a damp cloth and work hard to scrub off any food stains that might have happened. My date and I were laughing up our sleeves as we observed this slightly absurd behavior. \n\nMy recommendation: try it once. If you don\'t mind spot-cleaned table cloths, water served in re-used plastic water bottles (with the labels still on them and very worn out, I might add), then you\'ll find a good plate of food. Somewhat on the pricey side, so they *really* need to work on their naan.\n\nI must also mention that we took our leftover food home with us, because it had cost us a fair bit and there was a lot left over. I was disappointed when I got home and discovered that they hadn\'t given us all the food that we had leftover - they only gave us what would fit into their styrofoam container.'

S"I spontaneously went to China City Super Buffet with the intention of trying something new.  Ironically, the experience that I received was far from what I was looking for...\n\nAfter finding this location in the hood, I was promptly seated and went for my first tour of the buffet.  After discovering that the first plate was not clean, I grabbed another and loaded up on some sushi.  It wasn't great sushi, but it wasn't bad either... it just didn't taste that fresh.  On my second trip, I grabbed some mixed rice, orange chicken, beef, and some cooked shrimp (with the head on).  Everything was quite lukewarm.\n\nFortunately, I was still using the chopsticks that I used for my sushi as I sifted my way through the rice.  Then, I found the special surprise of the day in my rice: AN INSECT LEG!!!\n\nNow, I'll gladly admit that I'm not an expert when it comes to bugs.  I've seen plenty in my day, from cockroaches to bees and even crickets.  So, I can't say for sure which kind of insect that this leg came from, but I am absolutely sure that it didn't belong in my food.  After discreetly taking pictures, I called for the manager and showed her the evidence.  She tried to act like the two-jointed leg was a black thread as she held it up to her black shirt.  Good try lady- I may look dumb, but I am not stupid.\n\nLong story short, I will not return and only recommend this place if you are really open to wanting any kind of extra protein in your diet.  Two photos of the leg are attached for your viewing pleasure."

We ordered to go food last night.  We purchased a french dip, their November wing special and a club sandwich.  \n\nFirst off the french dip was barely edible.  It had shredded beef and was over salted and way too much pepper.  That was my dinner.  My husband ate half and we threw half away.  The wings were breaded and fried and came with fries.  Pretty good deal for the price.  However hubby ordered plain with mild sauce on the side.  The wings, unsauced, were very spicy so just be aware. How is that even possible?  And the club sandwich was okay.  The bread was greasy from the cheese.  It's like they grilled the cheese and then added the cold meats.  The fries that came with the food were good.\n\nThe french dip was almost $12.00, the wings $7.00 and the club sandwich I think was around $10.00 or so."

S'One of the neat things about Montreal is that even fast food is made with quality ingredients and served with alcohol. When you have that "beer and a burger" craving, you don\'t need to go to the local pub, you can head to Frite Alors!.\n\nI give this place four stars...\n\nStar #1 is for the local microbrews and homemade iced tea. All yummy.\n\nStar #2 is for the burgers. They\'re served on good-quality buns and there are lots of delicious toppings. (Unfortunately for dairy-free me, lots of those toppings are cheese. Oh, how I miss cheese).\n\nStar #3 is for the frites. They are skinny fries served in a paper cone, \xc3\xa0 la Belgique. They are served with your choice of homemade mayo. I can recommend the a\xc3\xafoli, the Frite alors, and the B\xc3\xa9arnaise, which tastes even herb-ier if you request vinegar for your fries. Someday I have to try piccallili, which I love with crackers and cheddar but have never thought of trying with fries.\n\nI always go in promising to have salad instead of fries (or at least half-half) but the frites are just too yummy to pass up. Also very filling. \n\nStar #4 is for the crayons and brown paper "tablecloth". I am so easy to entertain.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual but classier than a fast-food chain. At this location in the Quartier Latin, we often see groups of university students. It\'s not a quiet spot for date night but it\'s an affordable indulgence when you want some artery-clogging goodness. Service is a bit hit-and-miss. Food and drinks come promptly but it\'s sometimes a challenge go flag down the server for the bill or a refill on drinks.'

I always come here with my friends at lunch for their pizza buffet.  At 6.99 its more expensive then cici's but you get what you pay for ten times over.  The pizza is covered in high quality toppings and they make a variety of different pizzas all the time to satisfy all different taste buds.  They use a cheese mix on their pizzas that includes provolone and it just adds to the great taste of their pizza.  The garlic knots are great when they are fresh and hot, so if they are old ask for a new order to be placed out there and I've never had a problem with staff accommodating the request.    The salad bar is also included and is not bad for the price, it has all the fixings and dressings that you need to make a good salad but don't fill up!

We had a menu thrust under our door during Fresher's Week and it sat in our hall until we felt hungry and lazy enough to use it.  \nThe menu has the usual range of Chinese classic dishes and I went for the crispy chilli shredded beef along with fried rice and a bag of prawn crackers.  They said they would be 20 minutes, but in reality it was more like 50, and they charged a fiver at the door for it.  \nNonetheless, the food was tasty and filling.  The beef was good quality and the spicy sauce which accompanied it was delicious.  \nI'd certainly recommend ordering from So Good, just be prepared for a bit of a wait."

There was a sign on the door directing customers to Peter Wong, which is owned by the same family. I am polite and always follow directions, so I went.\n\nPeter Wong has a virtually identical menu to that of Big Wong (featured since the dawn of time). The space is more cavernous and banquet hall-y then Big Wong, but I'm pretty sure any noises from dimly lit corners weren't caused by bats.\n\nOh, the food: lunch was fine. Completely standard lunch combos, served pipin' hot. I had the Szechwan shimp. All combos come with soup, a crab puff, an egg roll, and fried rice. Good place to indulge your fried/crunchy needs.\n\nThe rest of the anglo menu is probably more extensive than most places, and I'm sure this is a great go-to option for take-out in the area. There aren't many Chinese options at 15th Ave, and Camelback."

For the ladies, they even have an autographed picture of that dude from Prison Break, Fonzworth Bently or something like that?\n\nBeing a New England style seafood shack, they offer clam strips, fried oysters and chowdah! I still haven't had the chowder, cause it's almost $5 and paying $15 in total for lunch will break the bank (me poor).\n\nThe rest of the menu is pretty straight forward with southern seafood fair. Basic sides come with the entrees and premium sides are offered at an premium - go figure. \n \nAll items are cooked to order so they come piping hot. Two different batter styles, classic and country and both are pretty tasty. The Big boy fish sandwich is just that big, and at $2.99 on Wednesdays it's a steal. While it isn't my favorite fish sandwich, the hush puppies here definitely are.\n\nNew England seafood is now one of the lucky spots in my regular lunch rotation and I will definitely be back to sample the rest of the menu. =)"

S'Try the ox tail pho!  I was silly with glee that Pho Loc finally reopened so that I could have my favorite pho - ox tail.  If fact this can hardly be considered a full review of their menu, because during the dozens times I\'ve been there I pretty much order one thing - ox tail pho.  I\'ve tried the myriad selections my husband has ordered, and while all are quite tasty (lacking ox tail pho, I\'d be happy with any of them), nothing comes close to my favorite.\nWhy ox tail you ask?  The meat comes in tender hunks, not in thin slices or manufactured ball shapes.  The texture and taste is fantastic.  Ox tail meat is pretty fatty, but don\'t be dismayed - it is so tender that you can usually separate the meat from the fat with only chopsticks.\nAlong with the availability of ox tail (I tried pho shops all around Phoenix during Pho Loc\'s absence and could find it nowhere else), Pho Loc serves some mysterious slender-leafed green to put in the soup along with the mint and bean sprouts.  I asked them what it is, but they did not know the English translation, but did comment that it is "very expensive".  It\'s extraordinarily tasty, and once again I have not noticed it at any other pho places.\nThe dessert made of crushed ice, coconut and red beans is tasty, especially on a hot day.'

The owners, Bob and Freda, have done a magnificent job in creating a hub where you can just drop in for a chat with them or the guys that work there and catch up on local goings on. There are always homemade goodies like blueberry scones and muffins on the counter and they brew their own coffee, which if you want strong, is actually strong. The inside is small but cozy and it can get a little crowded at lunch time but the atmosphere makes up for the wait for food with everyone talking to everyone and enjoying the down time. The panini's and salad are great and they have great bagels with cream cheese too. Very kid and family friendly. \n\nWith one of the sole purposes of opening that cafe in order to give back to the community, they recently ran a tree planting day where six mature red crabapple trees on Lakeshore Drive were planted to brighten up the local neighborhood. \n\nWay to go guys! I am all in favor of supporting small family owned businesses and it's so nice to see at last one venue that takes pride in their surroundings, treats their customers as friends and is not just interested in profit margins."

S"Tried Sabor for the first time tonight and was underwhelmed. Maybe it's better when you go in versus getting it to go. We ordered the elote loco, chicken nachos, burritos (steak and steak/chicken combo), chicken empanada, chicken veg w/black bean quesadilla, steak tacos authenticos, and guacamole. The elote was very disappointing ... not the grilled street corn that I'm used to. There was no flavor and the corn was steamed. The burritos and quesadillas were not made to order either.  The order was read back to me, a mistake corrected and the young man read it back correctly a second time. I would recommend a visual inspection of the order next time.\n\nI had heard great things about the nachos and they looked great from the pictures. This was a miss for me ... The nachos were packaged all together and were a soggy mess once we got them home (we live less than 10min away). I should have asked, but I assumed that they would have packaged toppings in one container and chips in another. Not the case. If ordering takeout I would definitely ask them to do this! The flavor was bland.\n\nNow on to more of the positives.... The guacamole was simple and delicious. I ordered the shrimp taco (prepared authentic style) and thought it was well seasoned and pretty tasty. Unfortunately, everything on the menu felt like I could have prepared it at home and with more flavor. \n\nOne major plus ... The staff were really helpful and friendly!"

S'Decontamination chamber.  Stat!\n\nI cave to the kids and come here about two times a year. It\'s always crowded and the pizza is mediocre at best, but the cinnamon rolls are passable and that\'s what sticks in my brain and causes some sort of experience amnesia. \n\nSafe to say tonight\'s visit will not soon be forgotten. The place was packed tonight. Seemed to be a four child per family minimum. I soon realized that preschool aged children were being allowed to help themselves to the buffet.  One little guy dropped his food on the floor and then proceeded to sit there and eat it off the floor.  He was spotted by a parent/person with his parent who merely said "you\'re nasty" and then turned back around to continue eating and talking. That\'s the Cici\'s clientele folks.  \n\nThe temperature inside the dining area must have been 90 degrees.  Pretty much unbearable. I heard a customer say something to the manager and his response was "you think you\'re hot?  Imagine how hot we are (the workers)!"  Oooookay!  \n\nAs for the food, I can honestly say the pizza was the worst I\'ve ever had there.  They were quick about refilling it, but they had very little variety and they all just tasted bland and awful.  They had the standard cheese, pepperoni, pep and sausage, a white veggie, a sausage and a deep dish with cheese.  It looked like the spots were labeled for the staff and these must be the standard choices now.  No Hawaaiin, taco, supreme, BBQ, buffalo or anything even slightly creative. However, the desserts were represented - even the gooey cinnamon rolls. Again, they were the ONLY highlight of the evening.\n\nIt\'s been a few hours and so far no food poisoning, so feeling optimistic about that.  I also feel optimistic that that was finally my last Cici\'s visit.'

Definitely, very tasty.  However, we were disappointed that on a snowy day they were out of soup - rather, that they hadn't taken enough out of the freezer.  It seems a bit of a given that soup would be number one on everyone's list of wants on a day where the city grinds to a halt because of three inches of snow.  \n\nWe were also unimpressed with the pricing.  I understand that rent can't be cheap on Broughton St but 4.50 for a sandwich in a cafe feels a bit steep.  Maybe I'm being cheap?\nTheir takeaway sandwiches were 3.00 - so two lettuce leaves with three slices of cucumber cost 1.50?  \nThey also charge 3.50 for sit-in toast with butter and jam.  3.50 for toast, seriously?  \n\nAs I said, I did like the food and the decor was cute....

The place itself was nice and clean and smart, which is something I always like in a takeaway.\n\nThe food is decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Fairly standard for a Chinese takeaway, but maybe a little less greasy than normal. For vegetarian dishes expect to pay on average around \xc2\xa36, which might seem like a bit too much (I think it is) but this is a bit better quality than your average Chinese.\n\nA slight cut above the rest.

S'I wish I could give this place a good review since the food itself is usually good and they have some decent deals.  But the fact is that make far too many mistakes with their orders:  Once they only brought me 25% of my actual order and more than once a driver would forget something, promise to return with the missing item and then abandon me.\n\nBut the main reason Papa John\'s has lost my business is because the Phoenix Director of Operations, Christina Carter took it upon herself to send me a homophobic email describing gay people as vulgar and stating that I should take my business elsewhere.  Prior to this, I had boycotted Domino\'s Pizza for years because of the company\'s antigay attitude but never in my entire life have I ever heard of an employee of a company (much less an upper manager) directly targeting a specific individual customer and telling them "We don\'t want your kind here."\n\nI notified both the corporate office and this store of Ms. Carter\'s actions and neither place could even be bothered to do so much as to issue a minimal apology, implying that the company itself fully condones, supports, and encourages Ms. Carter\'s reprehensible actions.  If you give Papa John\'s your business, just be aware your pizza will be topped with hatred and bigotry.'

S'Came back recently to get more of their bomb Garlic Crispy Chicken Wings and noticed that they also have a spicy version.  I opted to go with my old fav, and it did not disappoint.  I also ordered the Curry Chicken over Rice (you can also have it over noodles instead), and the curry was good.  However, the larger pieces of chicken were slightly undercooked, just the way the French Chefs like their poultry. \n\nIf you need to brush up on your Chinese, drop in and watch some TV while you wait for your take out order or while you eat.'

S'I was getting ready to leave for Spokane, and just kind of hanging around.   It was a couple of hours until I had to leave for the airport, and I was hungry. I thought I would stop by one of the sandwich shops near my place, get a sandwich to go, and relax by the pool with a beer and sandwich.\n\nI headed to 90th and Via Linda and headed for the Lunch Box.  Damn, it was not even 4 PM, and they were closed.  Well, no problem - the Vermont Sandwich Company was right across the street, I would go there.  What the hell, they were closed too, even though their sign said they were open until 4:00.  I just wanted a "fu***** sandwich to wash down with my beer and I couldn\'t even get one.\n\nI noticed a Subway across the intersection, so I thought, why not?  Went in and the server making the sandwiches was great.  What a personality!!   And the sandwich was good too - one of the best I have ever had at a Subway.  Of course, I got one of those low calorie ones, so I headed home to supplement it with beer. \n\nFor a Subway, I have to give it three stars - at least they were open!!'

S"We stopped here on a Tuesday night around 6pm. Honestly, upon arrival, we were about ready to turn around and leave just based on the looks of the place and setup. It  is small with a few tables (used and dingy) for seating, and has a very limited menu, which was sloppily written on the menu board. We ordered two gyros (it just said gryo meat, which was odd) that came with two cups of soda for $6.00 each and a large piece of spanakopita. Our total was $15.00 and the wait was about 10 minutes. \n\nThe place does not have the feel of a real restaurant, and I wasn't really sure where the food was coming from, which makes me leery. The worker behind the counter was very friendly, but she was literally using a kitchen griddle or two behind the counter to warm the gyro meat and pita bread. I'm not sure where the meat comes from, or if it's made in house, but it seemed like it was mass produced prior to warming behind the counter. The worked then pulled out tupperware containers (like we have at home) with tomato, lettuce etc. and a yogurt container to put the toppings on. The credit card machine was not working while we were there, so there was a delay while it was fixed, which is no big deal. The worker got very frustrated with the machine and was not very professional. \n\nWe took the food home (we live about two minutes away) and ate it. Very dissappointing. The pita was tough and greasy and the meat was just ok. The sauce was good, but again not sure where it's coming from. I could make a gyro like this (or better) at home. \n\nWe had to heat the spanakopita in our oven, based on instructions from one of the workers, so we did. It had no flavor - we actually ended up lifting the phylo dough off the top and added seasonings and some parmesan cheese, just to make it edible. \n\nI know this place is just getting started and needs to work out some kinks, but we will not be returning. If you are going to have a limited menu, then everything on it has to be fantastic, and this most certainly was not. I would not recommend."

S'I went there when the truck was parked on de Bluery and St.Catherine for the Just For Laughs Festival. \n\nI ordered the special of the day which was a roast chicken and bacon grilled cheese and I got a side of tator tots. It took almost 15 mins before the guy at the window came to tell me there was something wrong with their fryer and was unable to make the tator tots. I substituted with the gazpacho which really was okay. \n\nYou`d imagine that there would be better communication with the staff for such a small truck, I would have thought the guy that took my order knew there was an issue with the fryer. Maybe not. I waited more than 20 mins for my order. That`s a bit much for a grilled cheese and cold soup. It wasn`t busy, at the time it was only myself and a friend who had ordered. \n\nI found they were extremely over priced for what serve. I think it was like $11. We`re talking grilled cheese. It was actually pretty good, my mother makes it better. \n\nI did reach out to them on Twitter to see what time they closed at and they responded within mins. I`ll give them that! I wouldn`t go back but I hope others have a better experience.'

Jackie"\n\nAnd my response:\n\nHey Jacqueline H, I don\'t care who you are.  The way you have gone about this situations only brings more attention to you. This is probably worse for you than it is for me.\n\nI have plenty of time to post about my own personal experience at your bar, but not nearly enough time to entertain your less than stimulating questions on a constant basis. If my review concerns you so much, you should consider retraining your staff. If you put as much effort into running your bar as you do with harassing patrons that give your bar less than stellar reviews, you\'ll be just fine. \n\nIn regards to you coming after me for slander, let me give you a brief law class, I\'ve taken a couple myself. Slander is a defamatory remark made or communicated orally. Libel, on the other hand, is the written publication of a defamatory remark. Tell your attorney you want to come after me for libel NOT slander, that should get you on the right track. Cheers and BLOCKED!'

We call to place an order, but there were about to close. They were kind enough to way an additional 15 minutes for us to drive over for our Take out order. We paid (there's a sign that says Cash only) and when we got back into the car, the smell of the food was AMAZING. Note, I'm not sure if this a Mexican or Peruvian food, but it is AMAZING! We got home and opened up that delicious meal! The chicken was rotiserie, the tortillas might have been home made, the onions were amazing, the salsa was fresh with the perfect amount of heat, they used white beans, and their Mash potatoes were not what you would expect... THEY WERE BOMB.com\n\nYou're welcome in advance if you used my review to lead you to this tiny little jewel!"

They serve up a variety of foods - a lot of which you see in takeaways, yes. But kebabs and pizzas aren't a slapdash effort in Zenobia, with the quality of their kebabs suggesting it was fresher than the likes of stuff that sits under a heatlamp or steeped in grease for hours.\n\nZenobia marks the beginning of South Bridge, which admittedly is not the kind of area where you'll be seen puttin' on the Ritz. So when I was hungry one lunchtime, I had to step over the sick in the street to get to my food destination - a bit of an appetite killer. Sadly, it's the area that needs cleaned up, but at least it's not an overall reflection on the better, more respectable businesses like Zenobia which reside in it."

Well he's on the right track, since it is yummy and definitely 2 go (as there is no seating in the Metro station where they are located). His wife literally makes fresh Vietnamese springs rolls the minute they run out of the ones in the chilled display case. I tried two of them (you can get one, two or three in an order), with both the traditional fish sauce (excellent), and the more Western peanut dipping sauce (also tops). The rolls themselves were right up there (not the best of my life, but quite fresh). They also have a new mango salad offering (chock full of colourful veggies including red onion, carrot, bell peppers and of course thinly slice mangos (both orange and green)). They make Vietnamese sandwiches of which I tried the curry infused tofu (they call it vegetarian). Nice taste, but the bun was a but too crusty for my liking and a little dry. For the $3-4 dollar price range of those three items individually, the budget aware can not be too picky. I myself will keep going back to try different items. The service and smiles made up for some small fine tuning on the food items. In sum if you are on the go it's worth a quick stop and go. Note they do not use MSG or preservatives and carry all beef hotdogs."

The tasteless decor, the crappy tables, and the stacks of condensed milk on the counter that are used to make milk tea, all give me a sense of nostalgia as I harken back to my time in HK. Don't expect great ambiance or western style service, because if you do, you are totally missing the point.\n\nThey serve a lot of HK diner classics like tomato pork chop bake, Portuguese chicken rice, and beef brisket lo mein. And of course you need the obligatory ovaltine, horlicks and milk tea in a restaurant like this.\n\nI tried their beef brisket and tendon noodles. The soup had body, and the brisket and tendon were well braised and tender. No complaints. I also tried their Portuguese chicken and it was what I expected: thick, starch-laden, nuclear-yellow sauce and chicken on top of rice. It was great. Both times I've been there I always accompanied my meal with their milk tea. It's quite hard to find proper Hong Kong style milk tea (all the places in the University Plaza try to imitate it and fail) but I think these guys totallly hit the spot.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I found this small piece of home in Waterloo."

My mom wasn't too pleased with the fact that her filet mignon was wrapped in bacon, which she had only realized after eating 1/2 of her plate. My mom doesn't eat pork. It was hard to tell what it was at first due to the sauce covering most of it, and the menu doesn't mention that anywhere (I believe it should). Others felt as though the filet mignon was rather tasteless and drenched in sauce to compensate for that. I had ordered the chicken brochette with butterfly shrimp. I thought it was pretty good, the chicken was great actually, but the butterfly shrimp was a tad greasy and mushy. The rice needed salt in order to have any taste at all, and the potatoes... same problem.\n\nIt was a nice sit-down dinner, however not very enjoyable."

And waited. 90 minutes later we get the pizza, nasty and cold. \n\nA week later, in an effort to right their marketing wrong Papa Johns offers us a free pizza, two liter, and free side of our choice. We order and wait. And Wait. And wait. An hour after they were supposed to show they finally get here. Pizza is cold and nasty. And they forget the side. I realize $8 per hour doesn't exactly inspire the best work or get the best employees but when I called in the guy on the phone was rude and extremely unhelpful. No doubt he was used to fielding calls from angry customers. \n\nThe bottom line here is that this is terrible pizza, with even worse service and delivery. We didn't pay a dime (except for $2 delivery fee...twice) and we still feel like we got screwed. With so many other places to go to get your pie, save yourself the headache and wait of this dump. They should be out of business and hopefully will be soon."

S'Okay let me break it down for you like this; It\'s Captain D\'s! They have fish and some chicken. I don\'t expect a lot from this place. You may find yourself waiting in the drive-thru and being approached by a bum looking for money. When that happens it goes down as such; "hey you got any money?", "uh no" (which they know is a lie because you are buying food), "ah come on man just a dollar", "I don\'t carry cash" (which is a lie because you do). You then wait for like 20 minutes while the bum watches you hand the cashier a crisp twenty dollar bill. You then make eye contact with the bum and feel ashamed. You can see it in his eyes, the whole "you son of a bitch" look. I usually crack a smile at this point because I\'m all like "the joke\'s on you bum". By the way, what in the hell does the D stand for? Dirty? Delicious? Dangerous? Historians maintain the history has been lost forever. I will just assume it stands for "Captain Don\'tcomehereanymore"'

S"it was going on 2 years since I last reviewed this one, so it seemed past time for an update!  Well, things here haven't changed much at this old but busy neighborhood buffet.  Once you successfully maneuver past all the drunks wandering around in the middle of the street on Van Buren, you arrive here to find a good selection of 56 food items, not counting sauces & dressings, & for me, after paying the friendly lady up front, it was on to the Hot & Sour Soup.  (It was a good!)\n\nLike Norm R. remarked regarding a regular haunt of mine, Best Wok Buffet, the booth seats here have worn too soft.  My favorite seating spot was available, but after landing in it I sank down until the table was at mid chest height!  Was it just trying to tell me that I need to lose some weight?     :-O     In any event, having the table up by your chin does make your soup easy to eat!\n\nNow their fried rice was greasy, but the Egg Foo Young made up for it by being thoughtfully presented in various patty sizes, & delicious with it's rich brown gravy!  The salad area was good for a buffet this size too, & included various greens & tasty ham chunks.\n\nThere were several kinds of fish & other seafood to enjoy, plus a variety of other meat (mostly chicken) dishes.  I liked almost everything, & thought both the fried chicken & the chicken on a stick were better than average in taste.  For dessert it was chunks of various kinds of fruit, served in cream.  Yum!\n\nThe pricing is right & this smooth running place holds onto a solid 3 Star vote here!     :-)\n\nLunch Buffet including help-yourself beverages $6.46"

S"I've been coming to Samurai Sam's for a while.  This location used to be a Rubio's in case you've not been in the area recently (like me).\n\nGenerally, I like the food & that fact that it is wok'ed as you order it.  Sometimes, the white meat chicken is a bit dry (the chicken is precooked) .  The prices are decent.  this particular store had some items not on the regular Samurai Sam's menu, like garlic chicken & sriracha chicken.  There were others, but I ordered a chicken yaki soba & a Low Carb Special (no rice, white meat chicken).  Both items were consistent with the other times I have ordered them. The yaki soba was stir fried & pretty dry (only Teri sauce to give it flavor). It should be noted, their teriyaki sauce is very sweet. Too sweet for my tastes.  The veggies were very fresh & cooked well & the dark meat chicken was tasty & not dry at all.\n\nFor those of you who want a quick Teriyaki Bowl, you might be better served at the Chinese-fast-food-place-of-the-black-and-white-bear.\n\nAll told, though, YMMV."

S'Middleton Sport Bowl is kind of a mixed bag.  I\'ll briefly break down how I gauge them (I\'ve been many times, both before and after the renovation)\n\nFacility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.\n\nCost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it\'s around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  I\'m sure it\'s hiked up otherwise.  Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.\n\nFood:  It\'s typical bar food.  They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you\'d see at an alley.  Nothing to write home about but if you\'re in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won\'t go wrong.\n\nService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  There\'s a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you\'re there.  Everytime I\'ve gone in I\'ve tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like "I\'d like to get a lane, there\'s 3 of us and we all need shoes" etc, etc.  These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn\'t help either party move the process along.  It\'s really irritating because I\'ve gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it\'s always been like that.  The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don\'t share the same attitude.\n\nPersonally I\'m more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.'

S"Love Malaysian food. Love it. So when the Mrs took me for a stroll through the Quarter Mile development, my eyes lit up to see a new Malaysian restaurant coming our way. Before I knew it Nanyang had arrived and, like a mongoose, I was ready to pounce as soon as it opened.\n\nAfter a starter of Soft Shell Crab, I plumped for my Malaysian staple (and the bar by which I will henceforth measure all asian fusion restaurants) of Beef Rendang. The crab was tremendous and the Rendang was different, not as dry as traditionally expected and also slightly hotter, but as tasty as ever I'm used to.\n\nThe hostess was warm and welcoming and happy to chat about the business and how they couldn't wait to get started any longer and their plans for finishing off the decorating in the following few weeks. The waiter was apologetic and charming and offered us a complimentary round of drinks to celebrate their opening. All good.\n\nThe menu was expansive, not exclusively Malaysian as it turns out, and definitely for those with an eye for the spicy. The d\xc3\xa9cor and surrounding areas are very pretty and it's also good for those who enjoy a good people watch. In honesty there really isn't anything bad to say about the place...\n\nExcept this:\n\nIf Nanyang are not careful, they are in danger of pricing themselves out the market. Kampong Ali is no more than a 5 minute walk away, and Kampung Ah Lee is 10 minutes in the other direction. Both are a good \xc2\xa32-3 cheaper per dish and the quality is just as good, if not better than Nanyang. \n\nWith a small Malaysian restaurant contingent within Edinburgh, and if they improve their website and advertising (aside from the students and the rich who frequent or live in the Quarter Mile respectively, who else really knows there's anything down there?) they might last a while, but as soon as others cotton on that there are just as tasty Malaysian cuisine options at cheaper prices within walking distance, Nanyang could feel the pinch.\n\nVery good, but be warned."

S'When I first came to Montreal back in 2006, I loved coming to this tea lounge located on the second floor, overlooking one of the most beautiful streets in Montreal.  I savored their Taiwanese beef noodle soup, delicious teas, and view.  However, after coming back recently the vibe is not the same.  The place is now run by one person, an older woman, who is not in the mood to deal with customers.  \n\nDuring this year, our first visit, we came in and were completely ignored.  Then, I came back the next day and did receive some service.  What I go through just to get some Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup is beyond me.  The teas were not as good that they used to be, and the overall feeling of the place is no longer young and hip.  Before there used to be young customers, young servers, and music videos playing.

My recommendation was always: get there by 5 pm & don't show up in a group, because group service is long, inefficient and full of mistakes. Otherwise both the food and service is great... Except that now i have tried take out ( slow....) and dinner with a toddler. Hmmm... Could the service be any slower?! Close to 10 minutes to be seated despite being at the front of the line when the restaurant is empty at 5! Then no kids menu was given to us, and no service for 15 minutes again! I made due with our options only to find out, yes there is a kids menu. We were left close to 10 minutes after that even though there are only 4 choices and the decision was quick. During this time I noticed our waitress running around like mad as the restaurant begins to fill up. Couples who came in after us are getting their food and we have yet to have our order taken. They appear understaffed. Finally, some service... Reasonable wait from the kitchen but then impossible to get the waitresses attention because the food is salty and I want the water I requested at the beginning of the meal. More waiting, less service - yes! Water.... And we don't see our waitress again for a long time. 45 minutes of waiting for our plates to be cleared, and 10 more minutes for a bill to be brought after we asked for it. Not impressed at all, and amazed my kid didn't blow her lid when I was tempted to. 2 hour dinner service on a week night? WTH??? Never mind that the food was good, the service was horrible, and it got me wondering: at what point is it acceptable to get up and walk out? Tempting... So very tempting!"

S"I want to love The Coffee Shop. I really do. I am a fan of independently owned coffee shops, and with this being on Water Street in old Henderson, it's close to home. \n\nMy biggest issue with The Coffee Shop would have to be the operating hours. Opening on weekdays at 8 am means there is no chance of me stopping in here for a cup of caffeinated goodness before work. Closing weekdays at 2 pm means there is no opportunity to swing by after work either. And with The Coffee Shop being closed on Sundays, that means Saturdays are the only days I can get coffee here.\n\nAllison S. and I stopped in on a Saturday hoping to get a little breakfast and some caffeine before starting a day of shopping. The food menu was limited to sandwiches, salads and some crepes, so we inquired about other breakfast offerings. The man working, who I believe is the owner, suggested a souffle which sounded excellent so we each decided to get that as well as a drink.\n\nFood is made to order at The Coffee House, which we were warned about when we ordered, so there was a short wait for our breakfast. There was a musician playing the guitar and singing both covers and original songs for us to enjoy as we waited. Our drinks came out rather quickly, mine was one of the daily specials and it was excellent.  I wish I could say that the food was as good as the drinks. I don't eat a lot of souffles, but I am pretty sure that they are not supposed to be quite as runny as the ones we were served were. \n\nI'd love to return to The Coffee Shop for more caffeinated drinks, but unfortunately due to the hours it may be a while before I get a chance to do so."

S'Sonny\'s is the pinnacle of great BBQ.  While the atmosphere of the restaurant is a little...lame (I\'ve been to 2 Sonny\'s--Tyvola Rd and South Blvd), the food and service more than makes up for it. \n\nWhile I will forever be a pulled-pork girl, I have also had their sliced pork, and that was also delicious.  The chicken is pretty darn tasty too!  And I recommend the garlic bread for your sandwich--it is absolutely great!  In terms of sauce, I like the Sizzlin\' Sweet. It\'s got a great kick, but isn\'t overwhelmingly spicy.  \n\nIn terms of sides:\nCorn on the cob (had it twice): Soggy and pretty flavorless.  \nSweet Potato is good--really soft and moist and delicious.  I do not, however, recommend the cinnamon spread that they serve with it--just use butter.  \nBaked BBQ beans:  good, very thick and saucy.  \nPotato salad: good.  \nColeslaw: eh.  I\'m not a huge slaw fan anyways, but this one does not stand out as one of the better ones I\'ve had.  \nCornbread:  great.  \nString beans: soggy, but good.\n\nThe service has always been spectacular when I\'ve been there, even when they\'re busy.  My husband always gets the "All You Can Eat" meals, and they are quick with replenishments when he wants them.  Pricing is also very good.  You can get a lot of food for under $10, and leave feeling very satisfied.'

S'On a hot summer night, after walking several miles (from the Gold Coast, if you believe that) down to the strip and on and on, my buddy and I started getting hungry.  I\'m talking the kind of cartoon hungry where one guy starts picturing the other guy as a steak...or a hamburger...or a hot dog (easy there, big fella)?  Well, it was like that.\n\nWe got so desperate that I actually called my wife and asked her where we should go eat (she\'s always in front of the computer, so I knew she would be able to hook me up).  I was admittedly disappointed when she recommended Hooters.  "They have great buffalo shrimp," she said.  I\'m like, "Uh great. Thanks for nothing."\n\nSo, we went there anyway, but the wait for the Hooters restaurant was something like 2 1/2 hours.  I\'m thinking, of course, wtf?? I mean, I can understand waiting 2 1/2 hours for Hooters in Grand Rapids, MI where there\'s nothing else to do (and the waitresses are FANTASTIC, btw; I\'ve been there), but in Vegas, where top notch cleavage is not exactly hard to find?\n\nWe decided to bail and ended up at the DAM restaurant next door which had no wait whatsoever.  We both ordered sandwiches.  I don\'t even remember what they were, because last minute, my buddy says to me, "You want some nachos?"  I\'m pretty go-with-the-flow, so I agreed, but then he said, "How about these barbequed pork nachos?"\n\nI reluctantly agreed.  I\'m not  a big fan of barbequed pork.  It\'s generally too sweet, too fatty, and, to be perfectly honest, the moment he said "nachos", I got my mouth already for some ground beef, beans, etc.\n\nWell, I was wrong.  When the ABSOLUTE MOUNTAIN of nachos appeared at our table, I knew I did the right thing by not fighting my friend\'s urge for the pork.  They looked delicious.  There was tons of pork, and, well, everything.  What made them, though, was the sauce.  It was a spicy, not-too-sweet sauce that packed something of a wallop.  There was WAY too much for 2 people to eat. I don\'t even think we touched our sandwiches.\n\nBest of all, this plate of nachos was like 9 bucks.  It would have easily fed 4 people. Easily.  \n\nI\'m not one to go just for big portions.  Granted, this was a giant heap of food, but it was also top notch.  This was easily the best pub fair entree, appetizer or menu item that I have ever had.  Ever.  It\'s probably in the top 10 things I\'ve ever eaten anywhere (assuming we\'re just talking about food).'

S'Best spot for lunch / snack in the neighbourhood! I\'ve been going there at least once a week for the past 5 months, and the food is always good, the staff is always nice, the place is always clean and it smells like their delicious baked goods. I don\'t recommend going there for a sandwich if you are in a rush, because they make them one by one "with love" so it does take more time than getting a premade sandwich. But it tastes so much better, so if you can spare 10 minutes, it\'s well worth it. (Perhaps getting there a bit before noon is also a good strategy to have less of a wait.) All of their baked goods (brownies, pecan pies, scones, etc.) are delicious, and they make good espresso drinks as well. I have not tried their soup and breakfast sandwishes yet; it\'s next on my list! Oh, and remember, it\'s cash only.'

It's unassuming and simple, even the menu isn't elaborated, I think 10 items total.  It looks like just another chicken bowl place, wrong!!! It's anything but that, the food was amazing.  They use really fresh ingredients, seasoning is perfect.  You don't get the cardboard chicken doused with teriyaki sauce like other places.  Texture and doneness of the meat was perfect. I tried the combination plate which had rib eye beef , chicken, lots of vegetables, a slaw style salad and half an orange.  The portions are huge and filling, and  the prices are great too, and I love their emphasis on good healthy food.  This is great place for a fast lunch or a good healthy meal."

Je n'ai entendu que des bons mots au sujet de leurs caf\xc3\xa9, ce sera \xc3\xa0 essayer lors d'une prochaine visite!\n\nFinalement, il est impossible de terminer notre visite sans se prendre une p\xc3\xa2tisserie.

S'3.5 Stars\n\nI came to Tacos La Lomita based on another Yelpers experience an am glad I gave them a chance!  I\'ve been driving by this place for sometime and always told myself "self you need to try that place"!  When the family and I went to one of our regular Mexican restaurants for lunch and could not find seating we came here.  For my non-Spanish speaking Yelpers, don\'t be intimidated to stop by.  It is pretty authentic as far as it\'s appearance both inside and out.  If you speak Spanish even just a little it\'s your chance to get some practice in when ordering or they will also take your order in English too.  Since this was my first time I can only speak on the few items my family and I had.  The chorizo, egg and potato burrito has a good flavor to it.  The rolled taquitos supreme has a hefty layer of carne asada on top of them, this was a first for us but very tasty.  Finally I had the carne asada plate that has a good amount of flank steak with grilled onions(Yum), rice, beans (both rice and beans are pretty standard), very good tasting guacamole and homemade tortillas all that I enjoyed.  Their salsa bar only has a red and green salsa, I personally liked the red better.  It was spicy where the green was on the tangy side.  The salsa bar also has your standard carrots and jalape\xc3\xb1os along with limes and cucumbers.  The prices here are very fair to cheap and will  definitely be back to try more items on their menu.'

I went for the coconut -pineapple swirl. I didn't like the pineapple at all. and while topping are fun, i'm really looking for the quality of the base product and have admit that this frozen yogurt was really icy and not creamy at all. \n\ni don't know.

S"The Bristo Bar deserves 5 stars. It's cheap, the food is tasty, and the service is up to par with Canadian standards (that's a good thing!) \n\nOne day it seemed as Assembly had magically turned into the Bristo Bar. I was intrigued. I've been a handful of times for mid-week lunch and a few times for after work beverages. Each time, my experience warrants five stars. I'm very impressed with the service. The servers I have had have been very knowledgeable, welcoming, kind, and overall in good spirits - essentially everything you wanted in a server. \n\nI normally go for the club sandwich, which with fries is four pounds. It's delicious. I've also had their halloumi sandwich, and it was great. It comes with a very generous portion of halloumi cheese. \n\nThe drinks are cheap (it is across from Edinburgh Uni, after all). A pint of West lager is under 3 pounds. If you haven't had a West beer yet (Glaswegian brewery) definitely check it out. I'm a big fan of their wheat beer. \n\nThe venue looks fairly similar to what Assembly looked like - but that's fine.\n\nI'll say the Bristo Bar has the best service I have encountered in Edinburgh. Do check them out!"

S'My girlfriend and I ventured downtown to this spot because we were kindly given a $20 coupon by a friend of ours. Usually, we stay far away from chain restaurants and our experience reminded us why we do that. \n\nOur first experience through the door was to be looked down upon for not having a reservation for the half full dining room. HINT: a restaurant does not magically become upscale by being pretentious. It also would have helped if our waiter would have noticed we seated before 15 minutes went by.\n\nI am a food person and was highly disappointed by the fare. The good thing about chain restaurants is that they always seem to have some free food stuffs to keep you busy until your entre arrives. At Palomino we were treated to cold crushed tomatoes with raw onion stirred in. I think it was supposed to be some kind of italian inspired sauce to go with our cold, dry-ish, foccacia. That night we also received fried fish from the "seasonal and local" menu that was unbelievably salty and some scallop and shrimp fettucini alfredo that confused al dente with under cooked. \n\nThe whole experience really made me glad not to be a traveling business person stuck sleeping in Mariotts and eating at over reaching, not as tasty, downtown olive gardens. I couldn\'t do that on a regular basis.\n\nSorry guys.'

S"I don't review fast food places.. but this is one of those establishments that I need to review because of their outstanding product and i am not alone in this opinion. i first discovered this franchise in Alaska, and then everywhere else. It is plainly good pizza - but the secret is quality AND quantity. Their stuffed pizzas run 4+ lbs (terrible measuring system invented by imperialistic invaders and lingers in our society like a bad fart), and if you make that a family size then you'll come home with a 5+ lbs pizza pie that will feed you amazingly aggressively and violate your diet restrictions so hard and send you on the express train to obesity..\n\n.. but its good, oh-so good. And you can buy it early, store in fridge and unleash flavorgeddon in your own oven when you feel the need. That is why I use this franchise.\n\nAnd this particular store is great because of the mood. The shift manager (I assume) is the happiest guy you meet, and he is quick, witty and happy. That's another plus. try this pizza. They deserve it, and go big - go stuffed, but don't under-cook it."

S'I ate here today with my husband and son. I had the white fish tacos which were pretty good; the portion was large (way to much for me... But a good value), the fish was good, not too fishy, the black bean salsa was delicious, but the flour tortilla was a little tough. \n\nMy husband had the BBQ Brisket sandwich with onion rings, both which he liked very much and said he would definitely have again. \n\nMy son had the kids bacon, eggs and pancakes, all of which he liked. \n\nThe one drawback was the FLIES!  For some reason they got really bad just as we were finishing our meal.  \n\nOverall this is a place I would recommend and visit again.'

This is the only such official store / cafe I've ever seen, and it acts as both a magnet and a shrine for tinned soup fans the world over.\n\nBeing of significantly higher quality, but only marginally higher price, than other brands it shares shelf space with at  Tesco, Baxters soup is one of the Scotland's greatest exports, and a true industry standard. This store is more than deserving of a few of your well-earned pounds. I went for a nice tin of Scotch Broth the last time, It was lovely."

S"Viva Elvis , viva Zapata, viva Arepas, viva Mercado, viva Michoacan ...so many vivas are popping up in viva Las Vegas and so many pupuserias but I'm not complaining, we need more options beside those fast food restaurants that only make you miserably fat, we need instead more places that make us happily voluminous. \n Enter...Viva El Salvador pupuseria restaurant. Here you can find many Salvadorian dishes but like all Salvadorian restaurants pupusas are the main star of the show, thick corn tortillas filled with your choice of ingredients like chicharron (pork) frijoles,(beans) queso (cheese) or revueltas (mixed) covered with curtido (pickled cabbage slaw) and tomato sauce. The good thing about ordering pupusas is that you can order only the amount you want, for me usually two are enough but it all depends on how fluffy you are, also don't forget to order some to go or you'll be wishing you did.\nService is good, order at the counter, find a table and they'll bring the food to you.\nPlace is clean and very affordable. I can't tell you that this are the best pupusas in town but I can tell you that they are very good and I'll be stacking on pupusas every time I'm in the area.......I give this place 4 stars, although everything here is made from scratch, it could be a little bit faster!\n\n  Viva Yelp for showing me the way to this pupuseria!"

The menu includes salads, sandwiches, flatbread pizzas, rice bowls, etc.  The menu actually lists the nutritional content of each menu item.  You will see a lot of sweaty people in running shorts and tank tops here.  Oh yeah, it's good and pretty cheap.  The turkey burger (served with a side of cucumber salad) is excellent.  Their homemade granola is pretty damn good too.\n\nNote - the menu is hit or miss here.  The vegetarian options are all quite good, as is the salmon.

I approached the counter and looked around.  I was greeted by an influx of home-style aromas and next a pleasant employee.  He asked me what I would like, and I told him "I\'m in a major hurry, I\'m absolutely starving." Within five minutes, he had made me an Italian sub that puts all others to shame.  Since then, my family and I have been devoted regulars.  The food is consistently fresh and delicious, and the service is impeccable.  They have a good wine and beer selection also.  Their canolis (pastry shell filled with ricotta cheese and whipped cream topped with chocolate chips and powder sugar)  are the best I\'ve ever tasted- in fact, I ve never been able to find one as good as Carmine\'s anywhere else.  \nAll-in-all, I just love this restaurant.

S'Trying to book New Year\'s Eve dinner for four at the last minute anywhere is going to be a pain in the arse. You will get your pocketbook emptied at most places.  I ended up making reservations here because it looked like a place we could afford ($16 - $25 for a main entree).\n\nThe restaurant is tucked inside a mall in the middle of downtown. Half of the restaurant is glass and overlooks the city.  Most of the tables line the windows.\n\nThe food itself was decent.  I had their "spots", which was a crusted and pan fried white fish. It was good but was it $20 good? Not so much.  The salad that accompanies the meal had a housemade balsamic vinaigrette to die for. I think I could\'ve just eaten the balsamic vinaigrette for dinner and been good. Other diners in our party had the carbonara (proclaimed good, but not great), a shrimp with clams and garlic butter sauce pasta dish (proclaimed very tasty), and the house special that night (a pork roast that had some bold flavors that were too bold per the person who had it). We had two ice teas, a cosmo, and two beers.\n\nTotal for the meal (with tax) was $116. \n\nI can\'t say I had warm fuzzies for the place. It wasn\'t great. It wasn\'t bad. It just was. The server and greeter were very nice, though.\n\nAnd so ends my 100th review.'

We sat in the outside area at first, which was quiet for a while, but soon they started with very loud music and a belly dancer.  I think she was supposed to make people start dancing, but we hadn't even eaten dinner yet.  The music was so loud it made conversation impossible, so that wasn't the best.  We ordered a hummus appetizer to share, and then our dinners.  Our meals and the appetizer came out at the same time, which was weird.  In general, the service seemed disjointed and disorganized.

S"2.5 Stars\n\nThis is my first visit to Sushi Sonora(SS).  This experience left me in culture shock with never partaking in Mexican sushi.  Growing up in a half Mexican and half Cuban household being a glutton for Japanese food was a serious no-no until later in life.  SS is a very unassuming hole in the wall.  There is nothing fancy here but it is clean.  I came here with some coworkers for lunch and we were the only customers.  Let me be transparent with two things about SS, their rolls are expensive(none less than $10) and all their rolls have cream cheese.  I am not a fan of neither!  They had telenovelas playing on the TV along with Spanish rock which gives this place it's vibe.  \n\nSS has many Mexican related treats that they fuse into sushi.  I saw a roll with carne asada or ceviche that did not catch my attention.  They also have one with a Sonora style hot dog just to name a few, BTW I did not get the above three.  I went with the Sinaloa roll $14(yikes).  It had tempura crusted shrimp, processed crab mix(I prefer crab stick), avocado and cream cheese.  The processes crab mix had a hint of tuna flavor which was odd.  Everything was fresh and I did not get sick so let's go with tuna in the crab mix.  I'm a bit embarrassed but the crab mix also appeared to be imitation from what I could tell.  The presentation was very nice but the plate had chips on it.  Am I being super picky, maybe but if I am paying $14 for a roll I want near perfection.  \n\nSo on this day I finally broke my Mexican sushi cherry!  Will I try Mexican sushi again, YES!  The likelihood of me returning to Sushi Sonora is slim to none until they drop their prices.  One more thing about SS, they do not sell aguas frescas!  What's up with that?  I am lucky enough to have many choices for south of the border sushi and cheaper prices in the metro Phoenix area."

I give service a straight 10 !!\n\nI must say, the lighting was a bit bright for a saturday evening dinner. I mean, the fact that we noticed how shiny and bright the room was means it probably could have been a bit smoother  - how about cute candles ?\n\nOK - let the fun part begin. FOOD (and drinks!) \n\nFirst off, awesome wines, starting at around 45-50$ per bottle, but fun stuff to enjoy and discover.\n\nAs per the food itself, all plates are pretty much appetizer sized meaning you get to try a few without feeling too full afterwards. Too bad I didn't take any pictures -  the presentations are pretty nice.\n\nI had the foie gras dumplings with lobster mushrooms and an asian broth. The broth was a tad too salty, but hey, whenever there's fois gras and mushroom, there's me happy. So that was yummy !!  My friends tried the octopus and enjoyed it very much as well.\n\nI followed with sweetbreads which were very good. Not that big as a plate as I mentioned earlier, yet very tasty. Plus, I had some extra room for cheese! \n\n\nThe best  part was the cheese part. The waiter presented me with the selection and I chose three different kinds to try. The highlights of this course, however, were all sides : O-M-G. The waiter served me honey directly from what seemed to be a piece of hive (?). That was sticky, melty and delicious ! The cheese platter also came with an amazing jelly and a fruit compote. Yum-my. My friends had deserts which seemed funky and interesting - one of them had a black sesame cake which was weird but good !! However, I was enjoying my cheese was too much to even pay attention to what was going on around me. \n\nAll in all, it was a really good night. I would really like to try the brunch, although I will probably wait for a special occasion  - it's a bit pricey I must admit. However, it's definitely worth the try. You should go !! :)"

S'I discovered many little gems during my short stint of living in Bruntsfield, and this fantastic diner, owned by a couple, was one of them!\n\nYou won\'t miss the traditional diner sign hanging outside the restaurant, and the food is just as wholesome as you\'d expect a place like this to be. The starters are quite wonderful on their own (which include cheese filled jalapenos, and garlic mushrooms) and I\'d be tempted to make a meal out of one them and the devilish desserts. Like most diners, this place isn\'t too concerned with watching calories, and after your meal you\'ve got the option of having banoffee shortcake, pecan pie, and sticky toffee pudding to top things off\n\nAnd finally I get to the main dishes, which I\'ve saved for last! Firstly, because they can be a little pricey for what you\'d expect at a diner; the fillet of steak is over \xc2\xa320, and there is no burger that costs less than \xc2\xa38! And secondly, because there\'re so many great options I feel like eating my way through the whole menu. Katie\'s prides themselves on using fresh Scottish beef, and ALOT of it, and the steaks and many burgers, as well as salads, come in all sorts of flavours, my favourite being the garlicky chicken salad and the good ol\' BBQ burger!\n\nI\'ve always gravitated more towards these places where one can get wholesome meals rather than the "2 pieces of designer potatoes and a strategically placed leaf" restaurants, so Katie\'s certainly does it for me.'

S"I've been here twice. Once it was day-after-party haven, the second time it was hosting out-of-town family gold. Both times we came here for the Sunday buffet brunch. I'm such a light weight that buffets are wasted on me. The place is perfect for the ravenous though. I especially like the omelet station! There's always roast beef (a hit with the fam), ham cut to order and a massive whole salmon waiting to be dug into. The dessert selection is quite extensive though not to my taste. Endless coffee, tea and oj does the trick for me. Though there are cheaper options ($17.99 for Sunday brunch), for value, and pure 'big business in small town' feel, I'm giving the Stone Crock a thumbs up."

S'I decided to eat here for lunch with a friend during a weekday. We found it alarming walking in to see it empty of all clients besides us. Usually, that\'s a bad sign but I\'m glad that my dining experience went completely against that bad sign.\n\nSapori Di Napoli, which is located in the basement of a building is a homely resto with spacious seating and a distinctive Italian decor that screams of the old country to you. The music is clearly Italian with a flavor of the napoletan and as someone who lived in Naples for 2 years as a teenager, a smile formed on my face.\n\nKindly note, as an Italian who\'s favorite resto is "Casa Di Mama" (Mom\'s Cooking!), I\'m a very harsh critic of Italian food and service... so let\'s see how it went. \n\nWe decided to split an order of calamari and we both went with the tomato/basil gnocchi from the Yelp pictures already provided. The calamari was very good, with the right amount of chewy/crunch ratio to make it a classic dish. The gnocchi are made the old fashion way, the right way, with homemade pasta with homemade sauce. The gnocchi was good but I was a bit disappointed by them as they were smaller sized than I expected them to be and I didn\'t really taste the tomato/basil with a somewhat weak liquidy sauce. All in all, they were alright but I probably should have went with something else, like their Pizza.\n\nFor desert we both ordered a Cappuccino and a Tiramisu. The Cappuccino was decent enough but seemed to be off somehow. The Tiramisu simply wasn\'t for me. Perhaps it\'s the way my mom used to make it but I didn\'t like it at all. Too liquidy, flavor wasn\'t there.\n\nThe best part of our visit was our waiter Guido who was very friendly, accommodating, funny and amiable and took care of us. We got immediately served with the most delicious warm garlic focaccia bread that was simply phenomenal (and the best thing we ate!). I mentioned to my friend how I should bring my wife here as garlic focaccia is her kryptonite and would LOVE IT. At the end of our visit, Guido provided me with a huge bag with warm garlic focaccia to bring to the wife. WOW! During desert he provided us with free freshly made donuts as well. They were very good! I was blown away on his service. 5 STARS!\n\nAnd the wife LOVED the garlic focaccia and we\'re now coming back... for good reason! I want to try their pizzas, arancini balls and those delicious donuts again! Once this is done, I\'ll update this review to the 5 stars I\'m sure it deserves!!!\n\nAs for the resto being empty on week days, the problem is mostly location, I\'m sure if the location was closer to the main streets of St. Laurent (it\'s located smack in the middle of very residential streets, so weekdays it\'s pretty quiet and weekends require reservations apparently) it would be otherwise full. With this type of food/service... no doubts about it.\n\nWill come again.'

I also got the greek salad with homemade Greek salad dressing which was made with very fresh ingredients and the homemade dressing was very good as well. There was lots of stuff in the salad and it kept me full longer than most salads. They are definitely not skimpy on their ingredients. \n\nIt's in an old bank building and the entrance wasn't very obvious, so it took me a minute to find the deli, but it was worth it!\n\nI will definitely be back for the soup again and to try one of their deli sandwiches!"

It was overflowing with perfectly seasoned mushrooms and (I believe) jackfruit, thousand island dressing and sauerkraut.  I wish they had slightly better transport (everything is packed into a small open-air fry basket), as I take my items that I get at library mall for a slight walk before sitting down to eat, but that's okay. The sandwiches all come with vinegar coleslaw and tortilla chips. I also got a vegan peanut butter cup that was quite yummy.  Overall, highly recommended.  The food was fresh and delicious."

S'Alice summed this place up - Maxi\'s is the regular meeting place of ladies who lunch and excessively talk about their "friends". But if you\'re looking for a place to talk to your buddies in a similar fashion, it\'s rather nice.\n\nServing up wholesome food and a few continental deliesque offerings, Maxi\'s has one foot in being like an old fashioned tea room and the other on moving with the times. I didn\'t find it difficult to get a table since it\'s quite big but then, I wasn\'t visiting near lunch time. It\'s probably mobbed then, especially on a Saturday, because even during a mid week afternoon it seemed pretty popular with the locals.\n\nThat\'s always an indication of a good cafe though, and service was very efficient. They do a tasty soup of the day for a very reasonable price which I polished off.\n\nI can imagine this place doing well if it was transported to the main street in a seaside town. I don\'t know why but it reminded me of the kind of cafes they have scores of in Helensburgh! But by that I mean it\'s relaxed, airy, affordable and a good place to come for a natter over a cup of brew.'

If you are a FETA fan, please i beg you to try the French Feta. It is beyond creamy goodness.\nI have to say, you can also get your Pecorino Romano here as well as your PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO \nOh did I mention the full Italian Deli?? Prosciutto, mortadella, imported provolone and pancetta..i can go on and on( i use their homemade Italian sausage in my sauce)\nFraboni\'s is a TRUE Italian Specialty Store. \nI have not indulged in their ready foods, but based on the store itself, i wouldn\'t be surprised by excellence.\nPlease go in...be amazed by Italy in Madison.

Last night my boyfriend and I ordered two curries: chicken pathia and king prawn jalfrezi along with the usual rice and naan accompaniments. Within 35 mins of placing our order it had arrived (and we live about two miles from the place so good on them). The servings are large. The largest for any curry take away I've had in Edinburgh! had the king prawn jalfrezi. It had about seven large prawns in the curry and it was hot (tasty hot). It was so flavourful and not runny and soup like. It was one of the best curries I have had in a while! My boyfriend's pathia curry was loaded with chicken that was fairly tender. It was both sweet and spicy. The only down part was the naan wasn't as warm as I would have preferred but we just stuck it in the oven for a few mins!"

S"What do you call those days in between Christmas and New Year? Is there a name for them? Whatever they're called, I doubt anyone can really be bothered cooking and so the hunt for an excellent takeaway is on!\n\nNow, it probably says something about how good Silver Bowl is that my sister ate from here two nights in a row.  The second night, my boyfriend and I joined in on her recommendation.  Unsure of what to have, partly caused by my reluctance to order Green Curry (I make this all the time at home) meant we ended up playing it safe and choosing to share some Pad Thai and Green Curry between the two of us, with my sister going for the prawn Pad.  And we threw in a starter platter too.\n\nThe food took about an hour to arrive, longer than we'd have liked, but not so long to warrant a complaint.  When it arrived we were delighted by the very generous portions.  So big were they that we couldn't finish!  The Green Curry was delicious, although bear in mind it is also fairly hot.  The Pad Thai was huge!  And really tasty.  But I was so full from eating the curry (we'd ordered rice to accompany), as was my boyfriend, that I'm afraid we ended up wasting about 1/3 of it.  I reckon you could easily share it, throw in a starter, and be satisfied.\n\nOur order - starter selection, prawn Pad Thai, chicken Pad Thai, chicken Green Curry, rice and garlic noodles - came to just over \xc2\xa340, so really very reasonable.\n\nI can see us ordering from here again!"

The coffee is better than the sandwiches and even though its a bit pricey its still cheaper to eat here than Rick's Cafe which is one of the few other lunch options in the area.  They have a larger selection of other convenience store type items here as well."

S'Why did I decide to try out Nolia\'s for brunch is beyond my comprehension. Hubby wanted Waffle house and I thought it would be cool to go somewhere a bit more upscale where we could do mimosas and fancy omelette\'s. I had an open table reservation at Noon. We got there at 11.55. They made us wait for 20 mins for our table. Our waitress was super nice but really soft spoken...I mean we had to crane our necks to hear her. The menu only had the main brunch items listed like "veggie omelet: list of ingredients with your choice of breakfast meat and a side" The breakfast meats were not listed and neither were the sides. So our quiet waitress had to actually rattle out the sides and even she didn\'t seem to know all the sides!! But we wanted basic brunch items like bacon and toast with eggs so we could make do. We didn\'t get a beverage list either...so I just had a coffee and hubby had the OJ. But we didn\'t know the cost for the drinks. Note to Nolia: Get well printed menus! The most surprising thing was that there was a guy who were there before us...and he didn\'t get seated until 10 mins after us! Either this man really loved the food here or he had nowhere else to be. And the restaurant wasn\'t even packed! \nService was slow and when we finally got our food...it was so so. I mean not bad but nothing to boast about either. So if you like long waits, slow service, have a hearing aid and don\'t mind sub par brunch food for around $20...then Nolia\'s works for you. If not,  I suggest any waffle house where you\'ll good yummy food for around $10.'

Apparently truckers LOVE their footlongs. :P By the time we got here, I was absolutely sick of subs, and fast food in general, really. \nFinally the craving for a tasty sandwich came back, and off to subway I go. Tastes just as good as I remember. This location was clean, the service good, the vegetables fresh, and they even had spinach, which is something that you don't find as often back home. Perhaps all the subways here have spinach, but I wouldn't know. \nOnly thing that I didn't like, was that they didn't have sliced Monterrey cheddar, only shredded. Weird."

S'Ok, so this review is for Noble Roman\'s HOT DOG, not the pizzal  What you get here is a "foot long" hot dog for only $1.99!\n\nThe bun is 11" long & the weiner is 13" long in this tasty treat, for only $1.99!  But is it good, you ask?  YES, the taste of the weiner strikes me as like the Hoffy brand one at Pink\'s down the street (5 Star Chili Dogs!), but up here you\'re in for a lower price & the comfortable dining area is INDOORS, not out in the heat.  \n\nNoble\'s hot dog is now a staple for me to get a bite to eat between the awesome Buffets here along the Strip.     :-))\n\nPS:  Are you an older fuq# wanting to get laid on your visit to Vegas?  THIS is your bar here at Casino Royale!  The babes at the bar here are hot & ready & not prostitutes.  (No further comment!)     :-))'

They did not deliver to the hotel room and made me go from 28th floor to the lobby. I ordered from Eat24 and included the tip in the order, so I couldn't deduct any money for laziness. Additionally, I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and pineapple, and the pineapple only covered 45% of the pizza, what a waste. Another pizza was olives and pepperoni, olives were minimal.

S'This restaurant has seating inside, and than opens up to a hidden terrasse in the middle of the building. It was a perfect place for lunch on a sunny day. The down side to this is that there was construction happening inside several offices surrounding the this space, which was very loud and took away from the experience. \n\nThe food was able to make up for the loud construction. I had a Cesar salad followed by pasta with prosciutto and mushrooms in a rose sauce all washed down with a glass of Carpineto Dogajoli Rosato (Ros\xc3\xa9). \n\nOverall, very nice place for lunch or dinner in the summer, excellent for a meeting or date.

S"Oh. My. Word. Amazing cakes. After uhm-ing & aw-ing over the choice, I finally settled for the white chocolate & raspberry eclair to have with a cheeky hot chocolate and it was deliciousness personified.\n\nThe raspberries tasted like they had just been picked that morning: juicy & sweet & full of flavour. The patisserie vanilla cream filling was light & not too sweet and there was lovely layer of raspberry confit which added flavour. The pastry was light and the white chocolate was delicately flavoured with vanilla. Portion wise - it was the perfect portion. I could've eaten another one but maybe that's because I love cake and could eat it all day every day if I had a chance.\n\nThe hot chocolate was made with proper chocolate shavings and was a rich satisfying milk/dark blend. It wasn't sweet at all. \n\nAfter a few disappointing trips to a rival patisserie, this is a firm favourite and well worth the trip down to Stockbridge. What's more it must be some sort of well kept secret because, despite the time of day/week (1.30 on a Saturday afternoon), it wasn't even half full!! I'm sure with word of mouth that will change but I enjoyed the fact the staff had time to chat & I could sit and watch the world go by without feeling I had to give up my table."

S'I\'m fairly new to Aspinwall and have enjoyed trying all of the different places around here.  Tavern in the Wall is the type of business that Aspinwall needs -- casual bar/restaurant where you can grab a brew and a bite, watch your Steelers/Pens/Pirates/whoever games, and generally just have a good time. \n\nI enjoy Tavern in the Wall as a bar.  They have some great drink specials, friendly staff, and free live entertainment on many weekends.  The owner also seems like a nice guy.  As a restaurant, however, it\'s sorely lacking.  The food, I hate to say, definitely resonates as your typical blah, not-horrible-but-not-great bar food.  That would be completely fine with me if Tavern in the Wall acted like a bar serving bar food.  But their food is priced like they believe they are a legit dining destination -- seriously, $10 for a fried zucchini appetizer? For reference, the high-end Joseph Tambellini restaurant across the bridge in Highland Park charges $9 for fried zucchini. $17 for pasta with sauce? Again, just to put that in perspective, Girasole in Shadyside charges $13. Based on the "bar quality" of The Tavern\'s food, their prices definitely need to come down to Earth and be more in line with the type of food they serve....either that, or they need to up their game quality-wise and change their bar vibe to more of a nice restaurant vibe to justify the price.  \n\nSo, in sum, if you\'re looking for a good local watering hole where you can catch a drink, definitely give Tavern in the Wall a try...but if all you\'re in the market for is a great dinner, I\'d look elsewhere.'

I managed to find it this time, it is a little out the way, and not particularly well advertised, but that is a good thing! This place is a quiet little haven in a big bustling city like this. There were 2 other ladies there when I sat down for my cappuccino with a toffee and chantilly cream tart (you know just by the name that it is going straight to the hips...... but hey I can deal with that!) and by the time it had arrived I was all alone.... and I loved it. Sometimes I do enjoy the bustle of a good coffee shop, but I could be tempted to go back here with my uni work.... it's just lovely. \n\nThe frenchy music in the background made a good setting, and the lady who I assume runs the place is so friendly and welcoming... so I would recommend this to anyone who likes a nice peaceful coffee now and again.... oh and a good bit of indulgent cake!!"

I first experienced this place in early 2003, which is becoming a terrifyingly long time ago now. However, this place hasn't changed a bit in that time. Rather than seem old, it's rather comforting that it has largely remained the same- why fix it if it ain't broke?\n\nAnyway, I've always had tasty snacks in here. We have always been caught on the hop when seeing a show but takeaway service was prompt. It looks like an equally nice place to sit in, and the quality of food and service is great. \n\nLike Dino's in Glasgow, it manages to fill the position of both a place to get a quick bite to eat and a full blown place to sit down and have a meal. I have never been disappointed and I daresay I'll be back next time I'm seeing a show at the Playhouse."

We chose this place because of its excellent happy hour deal; something which seems to be amiss throughout the area's chinese restaurants. However, even without the happy hour deals, I would venture this place is a pretty low budget night out as it is. This is reflected in the quality and taste of the food - its not the best I have ever had, and one of my dining companions questioned what type of meat was in his dish more than once. However, as I mentioned, this place is cheap, and you get what you pay for - something not to great, but filling and cheap."

S'I am not sure why people are always raving about this restaurant.  Sure, it\'s okay, but honestly, nothing special.  There food is never bad, but never so great that it wows me.  I do like its location (convenient, right off the bus line).  Whatever you do, and I have other people that agree with me, don\'t bother with a dessert.  I believe that a dessert was once described as "lavender soap" to me (I can\'t remember the exact dessert, but that description didn\'t exactly encourage me to find out more information).  Subsequent desserts were not wonderful and suspect going elsewhere for the dessert is just a better idea.  Service is friendly here though and that is part of its charm.\n\nOverall, a decent Italian restaurant that can get pricey if you don\'t watch out.

Turns out they deliver, and the menu shows an offering that expands beyond the restaurants misleading name of Pizza to the second power.\n\nThe pizza is actually quite good.  It's blatantly apparent that the cheese and sauces are higher than average quality.  The prices are decent for a pizza shop, and they have a few specialty pizzas that help strech your dollar.

Despite having a newspaper on hand, I still felt obliged to explain my singularity to the guy working here via a half-hearted "I\'m just on my lunch break." I got a sympathetic nod in return.\n\nIt was worth breaking the social boundaries however, and was the best lunch I\'ve had in a while. There\'s only a very limited menu of 3 mixed meza plates on at lunch, and I went for the only meat-laden option. Grilled garlic sausages, chicken, i basket of flatbreads and a fantastic yoghurt sauce were all good, but the rubbery, meaty cheese was the star of the show.

S'The pizza here is very thin not a Neapolitan style but they use very thin skins.  I think the price is kind of high they must have killer markup. The pizza took 5 minutes to cook which is way too long considering a regular PH or PJ pizza takes 8 minutes. The bottom was only slightly brown nor browned cheese so the oven must be around 425 or so, they need to crank the over to 575 or higher. The problem running that long is that the center of the pizza was doughy and slimy. This to me is not a good concept, being in the outlet mall they may not survive the off season.'

S"Since Basha is supposed to be a fast-food type restaurant, it was nice to see that there was a good sit-down section, like in a traditional restaurant. However, the speed of the service turned the fast-food into slow food. The waitress was nice enough, but there was only one of her, and many hungry patrons. The food is standard fare Montreal Lebanese fast food. We ordered some wine with our lunch (what can I say, I'm European!). Since we didn't want to be drunk getting back to work, we ordered the only wine which was available as a 1/2 bottle. It was terrible! All in all, there are much better restos in the area which are much better and cheaper, though often without the liquor license (try Chinatown, right close by). If you must have Lebanese food in the area, this is one of the only places to go."

S"Situated in what used to be the Galaxy Diner, the Pizzaiolle on Saint-Denis still has that old diner feel. It's not trendy or chic, but it's cozy. This is my comfort food. It's perfect for one of those casual nights when you just want to relax away from the crowd. Slide into a booth, sit back, and catch up with an old friend or two. Order a glass of Italian red. \n\nPizzaiolle is the only place where I always get the same thing: the Capretto (tomato sauce, fresh basil, and goat cheese) on whole wheat crust. Simple, yet so satisfying. Their pizzas are made on a wood oven, and are always solid. Prices are pretty reasonable."

Good thing we were looking for that one thing!  We both ordered the small, which is a good portion size, and some appetizers.  The apps, the mushrooms and eggs were good.  Soon after, we were brought two piping hot bowls of delicious noodle soup.  The broth was quite good, and the beef, contrary to one of the Yelp reviews, was just fine.  (This isn't fine dining.)  The noodles and overall spicing and flavor was excellent.  It was perfect for what we wanted for dinner.  I would recommend it if you are looking for a great bowl of soup."

S"The owners of Talula's have managed to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. If you have any sense of east side Madison history you'll understand that they inherited the Brady Bunch interior and hot pink exterior from previous tenants, but they make it work. To me the decor says East Madison hip frugal green with a generous dose of local artists on the walls. \n\nRather than run themselves into a financial hole by trying to do an extensive remodel, they've wisely focused on making do with what they have (and quite nicely, I might add) and paying attention to food, service, and a mix of weekly entertainment options. In today's economy, that's downright sexy.\n\nThe food is a mixture of gastropub and regular eats, and there's probably something for everyone. Good beer is readily available (as opposed to when it was CJ's and your choices seemed to be Bud and Miller Lite). That, in combination with people watching, makes it a local hangout where not everybody necessarily knows your name, but they are always glad you came. Blue collar, white collar, families, you name it and they frequent Talula's. If you're looking for East Side Madison with a sense of humor about itself, head here. It's all good."

And no other place fills that craving better than Panda Express because there just don\'t seem to be any other descent Chinese restaurants.  Most Chinese restaurants in Phoenix are terrible with a capital "s", "u", "c", "k", "s".  Panda Express fills the void by offering descent, fast food fare with easy to order combinations.  The Kung Pao actually comes with chili peppers making it spicy and there aren\'t those large flat misshaped pieces of meat loosely referred to as chicken.  And who doesn\'t love pandas?  I get the up sale every time just in case the two option plate isn\'t going to be enough that day.  Or maybe I\'ve just grown too thin like most Americans.  In any case, if you find yourself in Phoenix and that dilapidated Chinese restaurant store front staring you down doesn\'t look inviting, Panda Express is always just around the corner.'

S'One day, my je\'e (mother) and I were wandering around Mesa trying to figure out where in the hell we were. The Navi was on the fritz and we were both getting aggrivated. \n\n"I\'m not trying to get us lost Cheryl Miranda... I\'m trying to find somewhere to eat - I\'m hungry!" She shouted at me while nearly sideswiping a car off of Stapley - it was our third near accident that day. \n\n"Oh... DUDE! Turn Left at Main - there\'s a place that has popovers!" (For my non-O\'odham yelpers, Popovers is my tribe\'s nickname for frybread; wah-much-tha is the traditional name for it btw) \n\n"POPOVERS!! Hell no! If you want frybread, we\'ll go home and you can make some!"\n\n"Awww... come on! It\'s prolly the only place around here anyway!"\n\nSo we turned into a rather... dank looking strip mall (aren\'t they all dank looking?) and my mom nearly slammed into a drive thru sign for a small taquillia who specializes in tortas. We pulled up to a small resturant that was BRIGHTLY painted with Apache Crowndancer and large promises of Apache burgers & Navajo Lamb. \n\nWhen we entered we found a large airy room with a small dining room. Tables and booths to line the windows. There was a cute lil White couple dining on large tacos and huge sodas and a counter where employees took the order. We grabbed a couple of menus and then sat at a booth and looked things over.\n\n"oh my gosh! haha! the ONLY difference between an Apache burger and a Navajo burger is that an Apache burger has two patties!" I giggled to my mom.\n\n"Well... Navajos are really skinny." Score one for mom!\n\n"the ONLY difference between an Apache taco and a Navajo taco is that one has crushed (think refried) beans and the other doesn\'t." \n\n"oh what in the HELL?!" I exclaimed as I turned the menu and I saw the monstrosity they call a dessert. The "tempting" Indian Dessert... looks - (I\'m so sorry to say this) disgusting! I\'m sorry! Grandma never EVER put so much on a frybread! It comes with a full sized frybread topped with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, powdered sugar & cinnamon. It\'s too much! frybread has such an amazing texture and delicate flavor... it\'s best when hot and to dump so much STUFF on it and let it get melty and gloopy is - gross. My advice is to stick with the basics and get a LIGHT dusting of sugar OR honey. \n\nWe were both a little grossed out at the thought of the \'indian dessert\' and decided to finally order. I had the red chili taco with whole beans (which cost extra). Normally - at frybread stands, it\'s called a red chili combo but not here. The madre got a whole bean taco (navajo taco). \n\nWe started to talk with the employees for a second and it turns out they are pretty friendly. We got our drinks and sat back down. I began to really get a scope of the room. Photographs of Apache Sunrise Ceremonies where plastered on the walls as well as cradleboards and small Navajo rugs. I thought it was cute and I\'m glad all the art was authentic. Within a few minutes, an employee came out from the kitchen and brought us our food.\n\nThe bread was normal sized (umm... I guess large to non-natives?) it had a great texture and was very fresh. I liked the redchili\'s flavor but was disappointed it wasn\'t very hot. Their hot sauce was good and I put it on EVERYTHING! My mom liked her taco as well but wished there was more salt. She in turn - then sprinkled half the shaker on our table onto her taco. \n\nWe wound up ordering another couple of breads one with honey and the other with sugar and enjoyed our light dessert. Overall the food was good. I\'m glad the service was quick and friendly and I\'m even more grateful that the chili sauces were fresh and flavorful. The bread itself was crisp and light and yet still hearty. It takes a lot of years to develop such technique - I was quite impressed with it.\n\nthe prices on the other hand... compared to on-reservation stands are astronomical but when compared to powwows and the state fair they are still a little high but when compared to other resturants - they are actually cheap. lol... odd I know. The entree`s are about $7 at the resturant but NOTHING will EVER make me to pay over $3 for ONE single tortilla! That is outrage! it should be $3 for a half dozen, but not for one thick tortilla! \n\nTo my yelpers, These are real Natives. They are cooking traditional recipes handed down from generations. The bread is good. The dining area isn\'t anything to write home about. The prices are both decent and highway robbery at the same time.  The cooking facilities and the dining area appear very clean. The burgers and mutton appear to freshly grilled. If you\'re in the area - give it a try. But do NOT order that damned dessert! I don\'t wanna hear about one of ya\'ll slipping into a diabetic coma from eating it.'

They hand make their tortillas, all the meats are good and seem pretty authentic. Salsita is the bomb (and I'm sure I gained close to 20 pounds during the year or so I was living in the house i own nearby). Their carnitas is the best I've ever had. They have a great salsa bar with super good somewhat runny guacamole, yum. The Torta Cubana is the real jewel on the menu, all though I never had anything there I didn't like.

S'My former manager at work came across this place completely by accident one day, while delivering a document to the owner. She is a Southern Belle, to put it mildly, and had some of their fried catfish while she was there. Well, she enjoyed it to the point that she brought about six of us there for dinner the same night for an impromptu "staff meeting".\n\nOur group tried several different dishes, from chicken to shrimp to the \ndifferent kinds of catfish on the menu. No one had a complaint about anything they tried and I thought my blackened catfish was quite good. The star of the show is the fried catfish, by far, as I later learned. \n\nI\'ve been back a few times since, once for a sit down dinner and a couple of times for takeout. The place has a small-scale, "home cooking" feel to it and don\'t be surprised/too disappointed if they are out of a few menu items. The location is sort of scary after dark, but the food and friendly staff are worth it.'

They're pretty excellent in general although a warning about getting extra hallipinios (cant be bothered to correct that) they come from a jar and are very salty.\n\nThe sandwiches are good but I'm not a massive fan of the quiche.

All the windows were painted, the inside was decorated, and they even had a fake Santa Claus. This just seemed out of character for a chain. \nThe staff working were also fantastic. The two guys working behind the counter were courteous, quick, and funny.

They have a great selection of wine, some cookbooks and gadgets located towards the back, with comfortable seating available in the front.\nI dined here for lunch and found several items on the menu that sounded good, but opted for a specialty they have called "phazanis" that seemed like a cross between a calzone and a wrap.  The outside is a nice, somewhat thin, pizza crust and the filling I chose was egg, mushroom, gruyere and ham.  Very good.  \nI was happy to find that their selection of wines by the glass offered several that I was not familiar with and I was pleased with my choice.\nPrices were reasonable and I would not mind returning to explore the rest of the menu.'

S"What a mentally crazy place. If I hadn't been warned about the process at The Square, I would have just been confused ie. pick your bread from the side (oh how I think about grubby paws manhandling the bread...euw) and then order. I was a bit confused as there was a huge queue, which I joined like a good and proper Brit, only to watch someone else march straight up to the counter and order. I then realised this was some strange gathering of people who were either waiting for a table, to pay, or to get their order. \n\nThus enlightened, I walked up to the counter and placed my order. Looking in the deli counter I started to feel less confident, noticing that there was no separation of meat and non meat products, and the same equipment used for both. \n\nI heard another guy complaining after his lunch was lost, and my confidence dorpped further. I then saw, from the side, my lunch (a vegetable melt) which I assume would have been treated like a panini, having the contents removed from the bread, thrown into the panini toaster, then shovelled back into the panini and toasted as one. Hmm.  Hungry and not super fastidious, I took it, but I wouldn't return, The Squares practices just seem a bit too shambolic for me."

S"A tucked-away Stockbridge gem that has been on my list of places to try for some months and it still is! How, you may ask, can I be reviewing a restaurant I have yet to try? Well, dear reader, I went there last week for a work christmas party and had a very good time. But I remember very little of the evening. THAT's how good a time I had.\nA small, cosy, intimate restaurant with a Mexican theme; the staff managed to make a party of 12 seem not only welcome, but a joy to behold (I'm not sure this sentiment was shared by the other diners).\nThe menu is classically Mexican, but the execution is a class above the bog-standard. Nachos, natch; chimichangas, burittos and enchilladas ditto, but all done (reportedly) to perfection. There are also Mexican style steaks and fish for the less conventional.\nThere may be puddings; I can't remember. They do serve cocktails and liquers, for which I hold them entirely responsible. \nSo, as I said at the outset, I shall return to The Blue Parrot Cantina for a more sedate and considered meal as soon as they let me back in the door."

The daily special was a short rib sandwich with roasted tomatoes and blue cheese. Whenever I see "blue cheese" with meat, I\'m on board. You can get a half sandwich and a cup of soup, or a whole sandwich and a side of fries. I opted for the latter. \nI love love love when I see fries come in a cup with brown paper. I don\'t know why. It\'s just one of my "things." The fries were perfect and had good chunks of salt on them.\nBut the sandwich...oh the sandwich! The bun was perfect. Crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle. The portion of pork was enough that pieces kept falling out. The rib meat was juicy and tender. There was enough blue cheese for flavor, but not enough to overpower the meat. It also came with some jus on the side.\nWe had Rhonda serve us, who is also the main squeeze of the place. She works in the main bar in the lobby, but she\'s been there forever. The hotel itself has gone through a lot of changes, but Rhonda is always there.\nIf you\'re looking for a nice vibe for a lunch Downtown, or a great place for a business meeting, you must check out Marston\'s.'

S"They claim to be the very first drive thru, but I cannot verify this. What I can verify is that no other fast food chicken sandwich compares to Farm Basket's Clucker. I can honestly tell you that once you try one, if you haven't already, you WILL be addicted, so proceed with caution. I don't know how many are left in Las Vegas, but the one Farm Basket that I go to is on Tropicana, and it is a little ray of sunshine on this otherwise regular street. The Clucker meal is a chicken sandwich, fries (with the best seasoning I have ever had) and a drink. The sandwich comes with miracle whip mayo, and a side of cranberry sauce. It is fried outside, and juicy and tender inside. I really didn't think I could fall in love with food, but guess what, I did. My boyfriend is jealous, but I can't help myself. They also offer the Gobbler, which is a turkey sandwich, and it's tasty, but not as great as the Clucker. If you are super hungry, they have buttery corn of the cob, and lemon butter biscuits...Enough to clog the healthiest of arteries, but worth it. For a place that only offers chicken and turkey, Farm Basket knows what it takes to create the perfect chicken sandwich...\n\nRecommended meal: The Super Clucker Special, supersized, for super satisfaction!\n\nRecommended side: The lemon butter biscuits. So so so sticky, so keep some handy wipes nearby..."

S"QI, People, QI.  I was on a road trip passing through Charlotte and thought I would stop at McDonald's for dinner.  When I got off the interstate, I did not realize this location as about three miles off the interstate, but I went anyways (not good during rush hour time.)  I was only going though the drive through.  I saw person before me drive away and realized they were missing part of their order.  Then my turn comes. Drink and hamburgers come out, but not fries.  Had to remind employee part of my order was missing.  I was directed another way back to the interstate seeing that if I waited a couple of miles on the interstate I would have come across another McDonald's (closer to the interstate)."

S"Aside from a consistently good (and occasionally changing) menu of snacks, sweets, and of course, excellent coffee, Matina is a fantastic neighbourhood hangout. If you wander in on a weekday afternoon, the cafe will be full of a mix of students, the work-from-home laptop at the coffee shop set, along with a smattering of other locals. On a weekend you'll find locals reading the paper, catching up with friends over a caf\xc3\xa9 au lait, or watching the ever-interesting foot traffic on Bernard.\n\nIt's noisy enough to be comfortable to work in (nothing is worse than a silent coffee shop!), but not so loud that you'll want to pop on your headphones. \n\nMusic selection is great, and the space has lots of options for seating - typical tables that seat 1 - 4 people, along with some comfy sofas and a lounge area all the way at the back that's perfect for groups (book club, anyone?). The two pool tables keep this from being solely a sit + read spot. \n\nStaff are extremely friendly and helpful, and always seem to have a good dose of neighbourhood news to share if you take the time to chat. \n\nGood wifi access and people-watching."

S"My husband and I rarely go out to dinner at Italian restaurants because we are from Italian descent and eat it on a regular basis at home.  But we thought let's give a local business a try.  What a big mistake!  After waiting for the hostess to discuss with a server where to seat us for what seemed to be an eternity (restaurant was about 95% empty) we were escorted to a back room to be seated.  On the way to the back room, you walked across the carpet of the main dining area that was so filthy I wouldn't let my dog lay on it.  I cannot emphasize enough how bad this carpet looked.  It was black with dirt and grime and didn't look like it had ever been cleaned in at least 20 years!  We were then seated at our table which looked like your hole in the wall Formica table and cloth chairs.  I don't know how you feel but cloth chairs in the restaurant industry does not make sense to me.  We would have left at this point but we were both so hungry we decided to stay.  Then we were given the menu which was a huge shock!  Now if you were going to order a pizza or calzone then I would  consider the prices reasonable.  However if I am going to spend $15 to $25 for an entree then I expect the cleanliness, decor and ambiance of the restaurant  to be better than an hole in the wall eatery.  I am trying to watch my weight and asked our waiter if they served any whole wheat pasta as a healthy alternative but it was not an option they provided.  At this point diet to the wind, I decided that a calzone was the best option to eat here.  I ordered the Melanzane Calzone which listed it had eggplant, prosciutto, red peppers and mozzarella.  The dish also came with a garden salad of iceberg lettuce, onion, bell pepper, carrot and cucumber (basic salad) for $10.00 which is a reasonable price.  When I received the Calzone the top of it was soaked with oil which immediately gave you a greasy impression of this Italian staple.  The eggplant was cut into extremely thin flat squares and breaded  and the prosciutto was cut in large squares that were hard to chew. Needless to say, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone except the Board of Health for an inspection."

And of course welcomed by many a familiar face! The menu had a good selection of choice.... I was struggling wtith the Starter, but ended up going for Mussels in white wine, cream and garlic and lots of other things to make this quite simply the best bowl of Mussels I have had! Then it was time to get out burger on. I decided to stick with a simple beef burger. All the burgers here are home made as I have been told from the man himself and it totally pays off! Delicious. Simple. \n\nThen there was pudding...... Dime Pie. My hips were screaming at me not to, but I totally did, and I loved every single mouthful of it!! \n\nThen came the Movie, some drooling over Ryan Gosling, bucket loads of banter..... and the infamous mario kart on the Nintendo 64. This is what made the night for me.... the guys here are just such a hoot and that is what makes that extra difference!'

S"I have to agree with the other reviewer that when you are presented with seven hundred identical looking lunch time, snacky, sandwich places you get kinda sceptical that you'll be able to differentiate your experience between them, as they all merge into one ubiquitous blur.\n\nHowever Fresh Cut is actually pretty decent. Despite its modest exterior once inside, you get the impression that every other sandwich joint has taken its style from this place, as Fresh Cut just seems to be that bit more professional. The small seating area looks cleaner, smarter, the boards advertising the food look better organised, better presented.\n\n As for the actual food, well yeah it's still a sand which place but it is better than most. The first thing that struck me was the quality of the bread. I had a baguette that used nice tasting wholemeal bread. What a change from the cheap white crap!\n\nAlso expect paninis, wraps and baked potatoes as standards, costing around \xc2\xa32-\xc2\xa33.50 depending on what you pick and how many fillings you choose to stuff your face with.\n\nOverall, the best of a mediocre bunch."

It is very similar to Qdoba and Chipotle, but I would say I prefer to eat here rather than the other similar options on University Ave. I appreciate that they make the tortillas straight from dough rather than heating up old tortillas. This prevents the edges from getting undesirably tough. I usually get the carnitas tacos, and they are always delicious. \n\nMy only complaint is about the atmosphere. Whenever I go to eat there, I am the only customer. It doesn't really create a good vibe. However, in their defense I do go there around 10 pm so not many customers are to be expected.\n\nI definitely recommend going there if you like carnitas!"

The Chili Rellano Burrito for lunch or dinner is another good choice: mild Anaheim chili filled with cheese, with guacamole inside the tortilla. Fish tacos have deep fried fish, but they still are good, we also like the chicken enchiladas, although the enchilada sauce is not memorable. The staff is willing to make substitutions, example: the Texas burrito comes with French fries inside, but will put diced potatoes instead.

My favorite is the hook and ladder but I have tried many and never had a bad sub here.\n\nFirehouse has a couple cool features that set it apart from some restaurants.  First of all, they have a massive hot sauce collection that is rated 1-10 based on spiciness.  Try the Firehouse hot sauce (I believe its called Datil Pepper Sauce).  It is a slightly spicy bbq flavor and really adds a kick to sandwiches.  Most locations also now have Coke Freestyle machines which I think are just plain cool.  \n\nI wish there was a Firehouse closer to me so I could eat here more but for now I will have to stick to tracking them down on road trips.'

I spent all of Monday there and half of Tuesday and was made to feel welcome by the owner/partner, Gary, and staff. There is plenty of comfortable seating inside including areas to lounge and tables.

They've got some pretty good Irish cuisine.  Shepherd's Pie.  Boxty's.  The standard fish n' chips (although the taste is far better then standard).  I've been told the Bangers and Mash is lackluster which is disappointing.  For your classic (i.e., boring) appetite, they have burgers, sandwiches (though the Patty Melt was poor and the Reuben was mediocre), soups, and salads.  \n\nWish the happy hour lasted until 7 as showing up at 6 and missing out on the deals was a little frustrating.  \n\nService was alright.  Not exceptional as the beers took awhile to make it from bar to table.  However, the service isn't going to keep me from going back.\n\nDefinitely a great place to go after work for some drinks, for dinner, or for a nighttime gathering.

S"Went in the restaurant and it was pretty much empty.  The waiter said that the business has been slow so that they had to stop doing the buffet.  We looked over the menu and they had a large variety of seafood, steak, chicken, and sushi dishes and combinations.  All the dinners came with all you can eat soup, salad, and dessert bar.  I chose the shrimp and filet Mignon steak plate and husband had shrimp, scallop, and filet steak plate.  I was pleasantly surprised how tender my steak was.  It practically melted in my mouth.  The shrimp were very good also and I received a dozen of smaller sized jumbo shrimp.  I don't know how many ounces the steak was but we both brought home a good bit of it in boxes for we couldn't finish it all.  It also came with your choice of rice, white or fried... and grilled mixed veggies.  The tea, both sweet and unsweet was very good as well.  I am sad to say that I doubt this place will be open much longer for the lack of customers and it is a shame since the food is quite good.  Our dinners were $16.99 and $17.99 and I thought well worth the money!  Hope you can try it out before they have to close up shop!!\nThis is the restaurant that is kind of across the street on Monroe rd from Greg's BBQ kitty corner in the Hillside Plaza that used to be a Chinese buffet and then it was a Tropical Buffet and Grill"

S"I think they deserve the 4 stars just for all the work they put into their full colour glossy menu (more like a catalogue). Pretty much everything has a photo, even the side dishes. They have everything from a side of chicken and rice to whole chicken meals.  I chose the #18 chicken sandwich on a grilled pita before getting to confused. It came out after a good 5-10 minutes piping hot, so much that some of the outside edges crumbled off into pita chips. Excellent garlic mayo oozed from the sandwich, which also included hard-to-find pickles and a few French fries (I grabbed one that was hanging and it tasted a little Burger Kingish). The decor was fresh and clean (orange and green), with light wood grained tabletops and large screens with heaps of photos, plus descriptions of the menu items. There is a lot to take in on the screens, so my tip is to read off the printed menu. On the coleslaw front, if you close your eyes it's like you are eating KFC's green coleslaw which is super minced. Not a huge portion, but at $1.49 it's not bad. While eating, I read the rest of the menu and discovered some interesting fried options including a shrimp plate and a sub roll fish filled sandwich. On the side cheese sauce looked just right to have with the buffalo chicken tender sandwich, especially for the students on study break from Concordia University. Sriracha chili sauce went along side the other condiments. It seems like everybody wants to join the Asian band wagon (or compete with the dozens of Asian restaurants nearby). It's nice to see a little variety pop up in this area. If you have room, you can also top off your meal with a choice of 3 chocolate based desserts. Had to run, so may try more another time. Hope the owners keep up their hard work, positive vibe and desire to succeed."

So when I first visited this store and saw the cashier texting on his cell phone (he claimed he was texting his manager), instead of preparing my transaction, it made me very frustrated!\n\nI would go back to this store if my guests wanted to have subway subs, however ONLY because they are the nearest location within a ten mile radius or so.

A visit to this family run cafe alone is worth the 1 1/4 hour trip from Tucson and Phoenix.  The calabasita enchiladas plate and mexican cheesecake dessert were delicious.'

S"I recently hired Adri and her Charlen's Cafe staff to cater the opening reception of a museum exhibit. It was a big job for over 150 people on a very tight budget, and she worked closely with me to create a menu that fit both of those needs. On the day of the event, both the food and service were fantastic and we couldn't have been happier with the turnout.\n\nA few weeks later I stopped by the cafe to settle my bill, and was really pleased to see how nice it is inside after the remodel. The restaurant looks great, the food is awesome, and Adri and her staff are professional, friendly, and easy to work with. If you need a caterer, especially in the downtown Phoenix area or the South Phoenix area, I highly recommend Charlen's Cafe."

I can't speak for the sandwiches/lunch menu because I've never dined here, but I do like the pastries - the usual coffee house suspects like muffins, scones, cookies. Some of the varieties are atypical - blackberry scones, ginger-pear muffins, and the like. \n\nMy favorite part: the exterior wall is usually pulled back on a nice day, making everything open-air.

S"Welllll.... I didn't try the food, but they do have great specials every day for drinks. I headed in yesterday (Monday). A sign out front stating $2 Coronas & $1 Margaritas led us in to kill some time while laundry was being done. \n\nWe both enjoyed a Corona. Mine tasted weird but it was mainly due to a really bad lime, ick. Thankfully bobby switched with me. He also enjoyed a $1 margarita. Of course it was made with bottom shelf products for the low price but i tasted it and it honestly was not bad at all. I can't remember all of the weekly drink specials, but there are atleast 2 per day. Wednesday is ladies night and we can enjoy a $1 well drink. Bobby also noticed a $3(?) Any Shot special on another day-- not sure if it's ANY shot, so I guess we'll have to go back & see. I can't judge the food because I didn't have any, so this review is solely on the drinks & specials. \n\nOn bone I have to pick is that the bartender was using her laptop & Pandora over the speaker as music. It was cool, throwback 90s Hip Hop, but they didn't upgrade to the commercial-free Pandora so every few songs there were those annoying Pandora commercials. I am truly a fan of Pandora so I'm not judging their personal DJ, but they should have atleast upgraded to the commercial-free Pandora. It's literally $1.99/month. \n\nDue to the specials, I'm sure it will not be my last time here."

He loved the lamb, I didn't care for it, I would prefer chicken dishes next time.\n\nThe service is very distant, lowered gazes, almost no talking or interaction. It's a given here. \n\nThe food used to be much worse (and much cheaper), when they first opened, so this is a restaurant going in the right direction. There are about 5 Pakistani Restaurants in Parc-Ex, and Dera overall seems to be in the lead."

S'Good Ol\' Days is a throwback to the 1950s, poodle skirts, cruisin\' cars, and jukeboxes.  It\'s a pretty decent and clean 50s-style diner with neon, chrome, checkered floor tiles, and bright pink colors.  \n\nI\'ve been to Good Ol\' Days a few times for breakfast but I have yet to try anything from their extensive lunch or dinner menu.  The menu is like a book.  There\'s a lot to read just for breakfast alone, so I can\'t imagine having to pick something for lunch or dinner where your choices extend way beyond eggs.  I usually get their Western omelette for breakfast, which is their "most popular" according to the menu.  Sure it\'s popular.  It offers the most ingredients in it, and I like my omelettes loaded with "stuff."  That\'s why I order it.  Wash that down with some bottomless cups of coffee and I\'m good to go!  \n\nI\'ve taken out-of-town friends and family to Good Ol\' Days for someplace different after I\'ve already taken them to my favorite breakfast place (Pewter Rose) the day before.  You can\'t go wrong with a 50s diner; there\'s something for everyone.  And this one usually offers great, fast service and delicious food.  Just be prepared to have a make a tough decision with all their menu items.'

S"17h30 on a Jazz Fest Sunday.  I wanted to go to the Buffet Samrat  for Indian cuisine, but it was closed and slated for redevelopment.  The window recommended Restaurant Tabla on Ste. Catherine Street, off the Beaudry subway station.  If you mention the Samrat, they will give you a 15% discount.\n\nThe place was deserted, but soon began to fill, those Montrealers not being in a hurry on a weekend.\n\nAttractive decor, with batiks (I believe) of various Hindu deities.  Some banquettes available along the wall, and a patio in the summer.\n\nThe table d'hote, starting at CDN $12.95, comes with your choice of appetizers; I chose onion bhaji and a quality mixed salad.\n\nI had a Taj Mahal beer as accompaniment, and as is the norm with Indian restaurant beer, it was decent but forgettably unobtrusive.\n\nServed with a huge portion of rice, done to perfection, topped with something deliciously crunchy (forgive me, as I was distracted).\n\nI ordered mushrooms, peas (beans) and cashews, served in a creamy orange sauce.\n\nThis was the finest Indian cuisine in memory, and I eat Indian regularly. Not highly spiced, but tasty and well-prepared, even fussy (parsley dustings around the edge of the plate).  Real linen on the table.  Large and heavy cutlery.  Shmancy, in other words.  And a welcome choice in an ethnic range which relies on the tried, though tasty, and true."

S'It\'s always a challenge to review a franchise.  It\'s a Subway,  so the food is going to be the same nation wide.  Subway is always a great alternative if you don\'t want a burger for lunch.  Since you all know what Subway tastes like I will focus my review on the service.  I go to this one pretty often because I work close to it.  It is usually pretty packed.  I have been once or twice where I didn\'t have to wait during lunch.  The employees are friendly and to have the "I hate my job" look on their face all the time.  The restaurant is pretty clean too.  I think it is because most people take their food to go.  So if you are in the area try out this Subway.  I\'m addicted to the flat bread.  I don\'t even get the other bread anymore.  Cheers!'

I think the preblem is that the place just lacks a few little things that could make it so much better. It has few fillings/topping for it potatoes, and the ones that they d have are pretty basic - cheese, beans etc. Its also very 70's when it comes to its decoration - frankly making mke want to take my meal somewhere else for fear of growing a mullet and buying flared trousers.\n\nRegardless of this, the potatoes are always really nice, and cheap too.

S'Let me preface this by saying I did not choose to come here, but it was my coworkers choice and I was immediately skeptical as anything with "House" in it concerns me - i.e. International HOUSE of Pancakes, Waffle HOUSE, nonetheless I tried to keep an open mind. \n\nWe were there for lunch at around noon. There was one other person in the restaurant. \n\nFood: If you come here expect to eat Fajitas, which by the name could be expected, they have a few other selections, the normal Tex-Mex appetizers, burgers and chicken, but the majority of the menu is Fajitas. I had the steak fajitas, decent lunch portion that came with two corn tortillas, rice, beans, a minuscule amount of guacamole and sour cream and a decent lunch amount of steak mixed with sauteed onions and green peppers. The meat was a seasoned skirt steak, unfortunately it was over cooked and grisly. The seasoning had a lot of black pepper that overwhelmed the dish. The rice was okay but by no means a flavorful Spanish rice, think the Rice O Roni equivalent to Mexican rice. The corn tortillas definitely store bought, and not at a decent Mexican market but more of the Albertson\'s store bought type. They did bring chips and salsa, the chips were decent and it came with a very mild green salsa, I asked for a hotter salsa and they brought me a mild chipotle salsa which had NO heat but good flavor. I added Cholula. \n\nThe big plus to me is that they had fresh brewed iced tea. \n\nI would have probably given this 1 1/2 star based on food but I appreciated the good service. The waitress came around numerous times and refilled my iced teas without complaining, I love ice tea and at some point some waitresses will say "wow you are thirsty today" or worse they will stop coming around - the waitress here did neither. She was pleasant and accommodating. \n\nAlso, they had a two for one fajita special with the purchase of two drinks. Drinks are $2 and the steak fajitas were $9. It was reasonable overall and although I hope that they improve there food, I certainly wish them the best of luck as they are clearly a small business. However, unless the food changes drastically I will not be back.'

Moi qui r\xc3\xa9f\xc3\xa9rais ce bistro \xc3\xa0 tout le monde depuis la derni\xc3\xa8re fois, j'ai trouv\xc3\xa9 cette deuxi\xc3\xa8me visite bien ordinaire malheureusement.\n\nVous pouvez consulter des photos et plus d'infos sur mon blog (la boufferie)"

I had a cheese danish which was warm, soft and chewy inside and flaky and warm on the outside.  The coffee was excellent, and we had two cups for the price of one, which was cheap already.  They have free Wi Fi and a comfortable and quiet seating area in the back with wooden tables and soft benches and chairs.'

S"Francais plus bas.\n\nFirst I've put a 3 stars but it's really a well deserved 3.5 stars. Not enough to be a 4 stars. My friend had a gift certificate he had won. The service was really good considering it was under-staff. Maybe a bad choice that wasn't suppose to occurs but regardless, our waitress did well. The menu is pretty great. It has some Tapas plates (shared meal) Pretty good. Was it wow? Nah just good bistro food. I think I will give it another try, The plates were generous, good bread. Next time i'm getting wined-up! They're specialty is private wine importation. Great selection, each avaiable by glass. Not that I'm too cheap for a bottle, but they understood the more people drink wines each time they come, the more they will want to buy bottles of their collection for their on to be found. I mean having private importation in your wine rack is pretty cool! They have a store section where you can just buy bottles of their wine, by the way. \n\nPremi\xc3\xa8rement, j'ai mis 3 \xc3\xa9toiles mais c'est un bon 3.5 \xc3\xa9toiles bien m\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9 que je donnerais. Mon ami avait un certificat cadeau et on est all\xc3\xa9 manger la. Bon service m\xc3\xaame si notre h\xc3\xb4te \xc3\xa9tait clairement d\xc3\xa9bord\xc3\xa9e. Le Menu \xc3\xa9tait sympathique. A gauche des entr\xc3\xa9es et entr\xc3\xa9es pour deux (des tapas) et des mets principaux. A droite les vins d'importation priv\xc3\xa9e. Quelque chose de rare au Qu\xc3\xa9bec et qui donne un certain cachet de savoir que nous pouvons les acheter . Sur le menu on peut consommer l'alcool au verre ce qui d\xc3\xa9montre de bonne cr\xc3\xa9ativit\xc3\xa9 pour faire d\xc3\xa9couvrir un maximum de vins durant un repas. Savoir que si nous avons aimer, on peut aussi s'acheter une bouteille du vin qu'on a but.

Donc au niveau de la cr\xc3\xa9ativit\xc3\xa9 c'est p-e un peu limit\xc3\xa9, J'ne connais pas la sp\xc3\xa9cialit\xc3\xa9 de la maison mais la prochaine fois je vais test\xc3\xa9 la recommandation."

At our table we had everything from Kabobs to Schwarma and everything was absolutely wonderful! The meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The saffron rice is some of the best I've had and the bread, my god the bread! Made to order in what looked like some sort of clay oven.

In the back I saw the deep fryer, what looked to be a burrito press and a friendly guy offering his homemade items.  I asked him if I could try some of his chips freshly fried.  He said sure and they tasted good!  So I purchased some chips and fresh salsa!  Will update a bit later on with the fresh salsa!  \n\nUpdate on the salsa: This salsa is amazing with a good amount of heat!  So fresh tasting and 100X better than the Doritos crappolla and anything else in a jar!  It makes me wonder why I ever eat salsa out of a glass jar???"

It has recently undergone a refurbishment and now the interior looks classy and modern; I went for a meal there this evening and there were fresh tulips on the tables, it was a nice touch. The staff are wonderful; whenever I visit I am greeted like an old friend, it's one of the reasons I keep going back. Tonight I ordered the lamb tikka, it is a relatively simple dish but a lot depends on the quality of the lamb; needless to say, the quality of the meat was excellent and I enjoyed my dinner immensely. I finished off with the pistachio kulfi which the waiter informed me was homemade, it was delicious and my mum declared it 'magnificent'. I can't wait for my next visit."

S'First of all, please forgive. I have been AWOL for the past...months!!! So many changes in my life have happened--mainly the "career" aspect of it--that I haven\'t had the chance to catch up with the "social" aspect. \n\nOkay, I jest...I\'ve been going to happy hours left and right that I haven\'t had time to even write a single review for the past few months. Hey, at least I know that the first step is acknowledgement that I have a slight problem.\n\nAnyway, I work in downtown Phoenix now...and let me start off my new batch of reviews with the NASTY.\n\nHere it is in a nutshell...101 Bistro is a waste of precious, precious real estate! From what I\'ve heard, this restaurant has re-incarnated itself a few times, and each time, the owners can\'t seem to get it right. \n\nIt was lunch time and this sheltered suburbanite decided to step into what seemed like a very cool place from the outside. 101 Bistro has a corner, sidewalk patio where you know want to be seen with your patent leather high-heeled shoes, your Chloe Paddington bag (the fake one, of course), and maybe your pouffy, yappy dog, while sipping tea and munching on the most decadent chocolatey cheesecake. Well, I didn\'t possess any of those that day, so I opted for a table inside where the lunch atmosphere was the typical "blue-tied gentlemen and women in ubiquitous polyester suits (not that there\'s anything wrong with polyester)" all intently examining the mysterious brown leather-bound portfolio, acting as if they have some top secret shit in their hands. You know the kinds.\n\nAnyway, my lonely self found a corner table and began looking at their lunch menu that is supposed to be served fast enough to get you back in the office on time. I decided on the gyro--with slices of meat, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, onion and then drizzled with a Mediterranean yogurt sauce wrapped in a fresh, warm pita bread (is that what you call the bread?). Oh it was served super fast alright, too fast that the warm pita bread was not at all warm and the thin slices of meat could use a little more nuking (oh please don\'t tell me that they only grill their meats...if you have to serve it quick, I\'m sure you nuke it). The meat also needed more seasonings (Mediterranean seasonings preferably). Ooooh, and that yogurt sauce drizzled over it? Water-y and bland.\n\nSo, my lonely self was forced to never let go of the pepper shaker throughout my dining experience and peppered that crap out of that gyro just to give my taste buds some kind of sensation and pleasure. Then I had a thought! Maybe...just maybe...I should order some kind of dessert to make my lonely self feel all better deep inside. But alas, I looked at their refrigerated display case where their desserts are housed, and sad to report, I couldn\'t really see inside because of the major condensation on the glass! Their frickin refrigerated display case was not working up to par; there was a pool of water on the floor (meaning: the ice is melting); and there are rounds and rounds of cheesecake and other dairy-filled goodies in there waiting to be saved!!! IN THE SUMMER HEAT!!! Uhhh...I don\'t know about you but, improperly refrigerated dairy desserts in the Arizona heat is a no-no to me.\nSadness filled my heart for 101 Bistro. It has the potential to become the hip happening lunch place to be seen, especially when the light rail is up and running. \n\nBut hey, the service was fast...so fast that they forgot to give me my iced tea (until I realized that I was choking on the bland gyro) and my eating utensils (until I realized that I needed a fork and a napkin to wipe off the watery yogurt sauce dribbling down my chin). \n\nSad!'

And let's not forget Jack's core target demographic, the late night stoner suffering from the munchies. \n\nThat's what a diverse snack-oriented menu, a dining room open until midnight and a drive-thru open 24 hours a day, will do for you.

S'The people opening Yelp*, or any other web review accounts to talk three sentence trash about one business are humorous in a twisted way.  Like the thousands of online press commentors armed with five sentence flame throwers.\n\nThat\'s not me.  Check my stats.  \n\nMy chosen belief guidance states, "Praise unceasingly."  and "If one has nine bad qualities and one good, speak only of the good."  \n\nIn a way this is about a person or persons, but it\'s really about a single location for a successful three-state restaurant chain with over 100 locations.  \n\nWe eat at Coco\'s a lot.  We eat in restaurants lots more than we\'d like to for personal family reasons.  The 75th Ave. Coco\'s has great friendly service, the excellent Coco\'s menu, delivers meals fast, and in 2011 had some of the best holiday season decoratiing of any same-class restaurant chain in Phoenix.  \n\nThe food coming from the kitchen is not consistent.  It is consistetnly inconsistent.  One day meals will be fine.  Another day, somebody in the kitchen forgot to read the preparation guide, look at the "playbook" pictures, or maybe decided they knew better than the whole rest of the company what kind of food should go out the window.  \n\nWe had the discussion on the drive over tonight, "I hope it tastes good, hope it\'s OK, etc."  In our last three or four trips here, soups and spagetti sauces were served unusually thin.  Two times ago, the commentary was, "I don\'t want to ge there."  How do four of us know?  \n\nWe\'ve eaten at the 7th Street location at least twice a month going on two years.  We order the same items consistently, and rarely, 7th Street gets off in the weeds.  Ave. 75 seems like someone or ones have overwhelming personal issues occupying their full attention.  Tonight, my Santa Fe melt sandwich, a grilled cheese and turkey sandwich with green chiles and avocado came out with barely grilled bread and a vast amount of ice-cold turkey.  Mom\'s turkey sandwich came out with a mortarboard of a top layer bread slice.  Uncuttable for her.  If uncuttable, inedible.\n\nSomebody needs some guidance.  Some careful, kind, loving, responsibility-and quality awareness coaching.  Some management.  \n\nThis is food service.  At it\'s worse, people can get very ill or die.  At mediocrity, it\'s a death sentence for, at least, the location.  At its best, people say good things and return often.  \n\nIf this continues, one more time, we will take our $45.00 tab, plus generous tip, elsewhere.\n\nDon\'t take the easy way out dumping and replacing loyal, long time, faithfully working staff.  Coach them to excellence.  If possible.  Or ignore it.\n\nTwo final comments; Amanda returned over and over, politely, with no sign of annoyance, to get the sandwiches correct, and drinks full.  Rito insisted on comping the Santa Fe melt.  This kind of service and desire to make things right is deeply appreciated.'

However, after asking the other customers if they had ordered, I realized there was no line, they were just all waiting, but you couldn\'t tell b/c there was no sort of organization.\nBeing a "club sandwich" lover, b/c of the bacon addition I went with the #11, the Giant Club "ToGo".\nThe service was very sale and the employees definitely didn\'t seem happy to be at work.\nSo, after arriving to my destination to enjoy my sandwich, I had a feeling of disappointment. First, the bread was so stale, I ended up throwing most of it out b/c is was too hard to eat. Second, and more disappointing, I didn\'t receive the club I ordered.  I basically received a lettuce, mayo, cheese, and a slice of ham sandwich,  no turkey & NO bacon :-(. \nOverall, very disappointing experience. As Jeff said, I\'ll stick with Jersey Mike\'s!'

S'Twas a very strange bar on George Street we stumbled into one evening in Edinburgh ... I say strange because for them, I\'m not really the ideal clientele; I\'m a tourist when in the UK and more importantly, I\'m uncool everywhere on the planet.* The staff definitely gave me the "you ain\'t from here, are ya?" attitude, but served us efficiently enough. The whole thing was kind of bizarre, since they have all sorts of deals with hotels and such to refer people there, and discounted food, but then seem not to want folks bothering them. And I simply have no idea what to make of the decor; is it really modern and chic, or is it just strange and brightly colored?\n\nCocktails were unremarkable, so we imbibed them relatively quickly and moved on to more hospitable pastures.\n\n* I say on the planet because if you think about how many stars there are, the relative percentage of earthlike planets orbiting those stars, the likelihood of intelligent life evolving, etc., it seems likely to me there is a planet somewhere in this universe on which I could be considered trendy.'

S"Went here to grab a pizza on behalf of a family member.  The expectation is for cheap and fast pizza.  It is inexpensive pizza -- $5.00 for a pepperoni pizza and $8.00 for a combination.  The expectation for fast comes from their Hot-n-Ready pizzas, which they make ahead of time and keep in warming ovens.  When I was there last evening, the fast part broke down a little because of how busy they were -- they had run out of their made-ahead pizzas.  Where it broke down as a whole was in boxing up a pasty-white under-cooked pizza.\n\nExpecting good pizza from Little Caesars is expecting more than they can deliver.  Cooking it to their standards is expected, but something they didn't deliver on."

S"I stopped by Graziano's last night for some pizza with a friend.  She had suggested that we eat there because she had heard that they had some good pizza.  The outside of the place doesn't have the appearance but is consistent with all of the buildings on the block.  Once you are inside though the place is pretty clean.  There are probably around 10 tables in the dining room portion of the restaurant with a single flat screen hung in one corner so that you can watch as you eat.  Just past the dining room and on the way to the register were about 6 beer coolers filled with everything from your normal adjunct lagers to Four Loko and even some more expensive 22 oz Dog Fish Head bottles.  As a beer lover who normally doesn't drink adjunct lagers if I can help it, I was really impressed with their selection.  As a matter of a fact in the hour or so that we were there, I actually saw more people get beer to go than order their food.  For our dinner we decided to get a large pizza with chicken on it.  It came out piping hot and I was surprised at how large it actually was.  What I was not as big of a fan of was the amount of grease that was still on the pizza but I understand that is what happens with cooked cheese  As with most pizzas, there are the three major components to them cheese, sauce and crust.  The crust was definitely the standout of this pie as it was crispy while not being too think.  The sauce was merely average as I did not really notice any spices in it or anything to distinguish it from anything else.  Finally the cheese was decent, there was a lot of it, and I enjoyed the garlic flavoring that was with the cheese.  Overall it wasn't the best pizza in the world but I enjoyed eating it and it got the job done.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I may head back here in the future.  The price is definitely right and the food was decent enough but where they really shine is their beer selection."

S"I was in Pittsburgh since yesterday from out of town on business. Tonight was the conclusion a long day and all I wanted was to go back to my hosteI and maybe grab a bite to eat. In my haste to get dinner before I passed out, I almost made the mistake of entering Fazio's, the other hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Penn Avenue in Lawrenceville. Well-I am glad I did not do that!  Remembering that the restaurant I quickly Yelped before walking out from the hostel had a longer name, I continued to walk down Penn Avenue until I found Graziano's. Upon entering, I was greeted by a slightly unwelcoming smell. It wasn't pizza I was smelling, or at least fresh pizza. But I remembered how positive all the reviews on Yelp were. I was a little disappointed when I saw how small their menu was, and yet it still took me a while to order. I first contemplated getting the fried fish with french fries. I do love a crispy fish sandwich. There was even a girl at another table who had just gotten hers for eating there. I tried to inconspicuously spy her fried fish. It looked good but it's a who lot a fish. I decided to order the steak and cheese sub instead. Now that I am home eating, I am glad I went to Graziano's and I am very impressed with their steak sub. Meaty, greasy, tangy, and large. What more can I say? That's a good steak sub. The bread is slightly toasted but still soft. Just perfect. I don't know many places that put Italian dressing and mayo on steak and cheeses, but I like the combo. It's more than enough food for 2 and only costed 9 bucks. I think I will finish it all off because I did not eat lunch today. MMM. stiill got lots more to enjoy. I recommend Graziano's for take out, not eating in. There are tables and chairs, but as I mentioned...the smell is a little off-putting. like the inside of an old dish cloth.  If they could fix that, they would be golden."

S"My wife and I went to the SunCoast today to play a round of bingo. Afterward, we decided to get a bite to eat. My mom has told me that she really likes Senor Miguels, so we decided to give it a try.\n\nThey had a 2 for 1 fajitas deal so we went with that. We got one shrimp fajita and one steak and chicken combo.\n\nWe started with the requisite chips and salsa. We were also given bean dip. The chips and salsa were average. I did like that it came with bean dip, as most places don't give you that so it was a nice little surprise.\n\nNeither of us were impressed with the fajitas. They seemed very Americanized. There was meat, onions, and peppers with little to no seasoning. All of the flavors were very muted. The fajitas were served with flour tortillas and even there weren't that good. They  were barely warmed and didn't seem to be fully cooked.\n\nA couple of weeks ago my wife and I had a fajitas throw down. Neither of us are professional cooks (though I do enjoy cooking; my wife only cooks if she has to) but we both agreed our fajitas were better and more authentic (I'm Swedish, she's Filipino) than these. At least because of the two for one deal, we only had to pay for one order.\n\nThe fajitas came with re-fried beans, rice, sour cream, and guacamole. All of it was average at best.\n\nThe star of the meal was the Mexican banana split. I'm pretty sure it's a gringo dish and not authentic, but it was still pretty good. It consisted of a banana wrapped in a tortilla, deep fried, and sprinkled with cinnamon. In the middle were three scoops of ice cream with whipped cream on the side. It was not overly sweet and the deep-fried bananas were really good.\n\nI doubt I'll ever be back, but if I do it will be to get a Mexican banana split."

When I say the chicken is consistently good I speak from experience.\n\nMost of the staff has remained the same over the years. I've never had a bad experience service wise. All of this equates to a decent sized following of locals. You can expect to see many of the same faces in there for lunch and happy hour.\n\nThey have very good happy hour food and booze specials.\n\nChicken, tri tip, white fish, shrimp, lobster tacos, fajitas.. its all good. I haven't had anything here I wasn't happy with, excluding maybe the quesadilla.\n\nAll the meats are mesquite charbroiled and very tasty. The parking lot smells amazing all the time.\n\nThe chicken is very heavy on the black pepper and garlic. Their marinade/rub is put all over the chicken and under the skin as well at times.\n\nThey have a nice salsa bar with at least 4 different types of salsa plus spicy pickled jalapenos and carrots. Their chips never seem to be overly greasy and are surprisingly fresh for sitting at the salsa bar under a heat lamp.\n\nI'm also a fan of the wings. They are nonstandard as far as the wing sauce goes but they are a nice change from the standard franks/butter.\n\nWhen it comes down to it its solid food at a reasonable price. You can't ask for much more for a regular day lunch experience."

S'DO NOT GO TO THIS SUBWAY!!!!!!!!\n\nI walked into the Subway at about 12:30 and waited in line.  When it was my turn, I ordered  a footlong BLT on herb cheese bread and a footlong meatball and pepperoni on Italian (their monthly special).  "We ain\'t got no meatball" the man behind the counter said in a mumble.  He had to repeat it a second time for me to understand him.  I then ordered a cold cut combo and requested that both be toasted.  \n\nThe Mumbler put my bread in the toaster and then went on to the next customer.  As he was preparing the sandwich of the customer behind me, he reached over the sandwich that his co-worker was preparing for the customer in front of me and literally put his armpit in her sandwich in spite of his co-worker\'s futile attempt to protect the sandwich.  \n\nSo the customer behind me paid and left and the customer in front of me had left and my bread had now been sitting in the toaster waiting, as was I, for the two people making sandwiches to finish with people BEHIND me.  Now it was finally my turn.  I had to explain the order again as The Mumbler had moved on to someone else.  Did I want my bacon heated?  As it looked almost raw, yes I did.  Then I had to wait again.  Why didn\'t The Mumbler put it in the toaster while the bread was toasting?  Two more customers behind me paid and left the restaurant.  The microwave dinged, but by now the woman behind the counter was helping The Mumbler as he seemed to be falling behind.  The bacon sat ignored in the microwave for at least two minutes.\n\nFinally, we have the bread and the hot bacon. Three times while I was requesting the vegetables/ condiments, the woman behind the counter stopped helping me to help a co-worker, refill the napkin dispenser, and take another customers money (a customer in line behind me).  Two more customers behind me paid and left.  Then two more workers, one of which appeared to be the manager, came out of a back room and just watched the long line of customers!  Neither of them tried to help and then they both disappeared out of sight again into the back of the restaurant.\n\n35 minutes after I walked into the Subway, I walked out with two footlong sandwiches and returned to work.  I gave my co-worker her sandwich and went to my desk.  That is when I realized that the bread and cheese had gotten mixed up on the orders.  Then my co-worker said that she had the wrong sandwich.  The woman behind the counter had given me one of the sandwiches that must have belonged to one of the myriad of customers that got waited on before me even though they were behind me in line.  The sandwich that my co-worker received was turkey and bacon.  My thought from earlier was confirmed as she said that the bacon was, indeed, almost raw.\n\nMy co-worker returned to the Subway in order to receive the correct sandwich.  When she explained what happened, the woman behind the counter explained that the man who had accidentally received her sandwich had returned that one as well.  THEN THE WOMAN BEHIND THE COUNTER TRIED TO GIVE THE "USED" SANDWICH TO MY CO-WORKER!  It took the manager coming out to convince her to make a new sandwich!\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS SUBWAY!!!!!!'

Go early because it gets quite packed for lunch and they begin to sell out of items. They also serve cookies, brownies, and muffins, which I have not had, but I heard they were also delish.

S'So I totally didn\'t read the reviews and discovered that this place is vegetarian while I was looking at the menu thinking "where\'s the meat".    I didn\'t miss it though.  It is a 3.5 for me.  Here\'s why.  \n\nFirst impression...what a cute cafe!  It\'s clean and cool with some tables and a little seating area with leather chairs.  There\'s also a small private room with a conference table in it.   Bathroom is clean and modern.  \n\nThen onto the ordering - it\'s fast casual style.   I was sort of reminded of a trip to the doctor\'s office because it was a really clinical experience.   The lady at the counter was really slow and rather uninspired by her work.  Turns out we\'d interrupted her lunch, which she went out to the dining area to eat after she waited on us.  My lunch was served to-go.  Not sure why since she didn\'t ask. \n\nThe food was mixed.  The jalape\xc3\xb1o popper panini I had was pretty good.  Creamy and cheesy, with a punch from some sliced jalape\xc3\xb1os.   It was pretty large too.  The hash brown tater tots were straight from the Ore Ida bag.  Not bad, but pretty generic.   The sandwich, tots, bottle of water, and random bag of chips I didn\'t order came to just over $10.  \n\nA solid lunch cafe if you work in the area, but the menu is a tad limited and the service could use some work.'

S"IT'S FIVE DOLLAR PIZZA!!!\n\nOkay, I'll be the first to admit that Sorrento's is not the best or classiest pizza joint in Pittsburgh. But it's cheap and open late (until around 3 on the weekend). For college students this place is always a good choice....especially after a late night of partying. After around 10 is when the place really gets packed, mostly because of their $5 large pizza deal (starts at 8PM and ends at closing).\n\nThe pizza is okay (it's neither outstanding nor disgusting), but I've definitely paid more for much worse in Pittsburgh. It has never been under-cooked and is ready pretty quickly. If you are doing a late night pick-up I would suggest calling in your order to avoid waiting in line surrounded by super drunk college kids (although the conversations you can't help but overhear are pretty funny). I would say splurge and pay the extra $1 for their super yummy BUTTERMILK RANCH (if I could I would probably drink it...andI basically do...) The ranch is ADDICTIVE so I don't mind paying a bit extra. The pizza is hot and super cheesy with a thin crust and okay sauce.\n\nI've had times when I've literally eaten a whole box by myself with two containers of ranch (cuz the guys didn't want to share) and I loved every moment of it.....even though my stomach wasn't too happy. I'd say give it a try! Instead of paying $3 for a slice, grab a box or two with some friends and stop by the 24-hour Rite-Aid for 2 for $3 2-Liter Pepsi."

They were playing a CD but it started skipping a lot so they just turned it off. \n\nEven though the food was good, here's why I won't be coming back...\nWhen we got here it was just us and an Ethiopian man dining. The husband and wife owners were there with their son. When the other man was leaving, he struck up a conversation with the wife, and said that he was a frequent customer and wondered why he hadn't seen her before. She said it was because she had a M-F job, so she was only in the restaurant on the weekends. After he walked out, the husband and son started cracking jokes about him.

The rice, black beans, yams, and greens were also well received.

S'This place is truly unbelievable. For $6-7.50 you get a massive sandwich and a side salad or a side of fries. They also serve breakfast.\n\nNow, normally, a chicken bacon ranch wrap is nothing to write home about. The bathroom reeks of cigarettes, the decor is decidedly 80\'s. But here I am, starving in Brookline, and the pizza guy gave me a dirty look when I asked if they sold pizza by the slice. I gotta eat somewhere!\n\nBetween all the traveling I did in college and high school for sports, I became quite the sandwich and wrap connoisseur. I can say unequivocally that Tisha\'s wrap is truly the best I\'ve had in my life. The spicy flour the chicken was dredged in was light with just enough zing without being overpowering. The oil was clearly fresh and delicious; the chicken wasn\'t fried and then "fried again" when I ordered it, which results in a greasy disgusting mess. You\'ve never hear the words "fried" and "light" in the same sentence - until now.\n\nThe chicken, along with tomatoes, bacon, ranch and lettuce, were stuffed into a truly massive tortilla. The bacon was crispy without being overdone. The lettuce and tomato were fresh and crisp - a tall order considering it\'s snowing outside. I wasn\'t expecting much, but the tortilla was crisped and flaky - did they make their own tortillas? Apparently according to a PG review they make their own bread, so they either make their own tortillas or get them from Las Palmas close by. But dear sweet Jesus was this a tortilla for the ages.\n\nShe set it down in front of me and said "sorry, I tend to overstuff them". What kind of saint apologizes for too much food? I wanted to kiss her on the mouth. I\'m used to Pittsburgh Portions, but this was epic. I could only eat half.\n\nNow, onto the salad. Normally a side salad is a puny piling of greens. Not this one! Its served in a medium (not small) sized bowl consisting of iceberg and a ton of tomatoes and chopped bell peppers, and perhaps carrots too (I can\'t recall). \n\nShe plopped down extra napkins without me having to ask.\n\nThis place is unreal. I\'d go back here in a hearbeat. Will Brookline become the next foodie heaven? \n\nFood done to perfection with a huge  portion size is a very rare thing indeed.'

S'This establishment is pretty new to The Ivy and  I kept seeing signs for it so I was stoked to try it as a sucker for Chinese food.  Each time I see the sign, I start singing Kings of Leon "Sex on Fire" but "Yeaaaaaaaaaah, this WOK is on fiiiiiiire" \n\nThey had a pretty nice setup inside with a spacious seating area. I wasn\'t expecting that as I thought it was a take out only kind of place but it was roomy with nice decor. My friend and I ordered at the same time and we both got the General Tso\'s Lunch Special (which lunch specials comes with a free drink, rice and spring roll) but only one came out. So we waited for mine. And waited.....and waited. I got up when I saw a waitress coming by (it\'s one of those joints where you order in the front and they give you a number and bring to you) and I said "Excuse me" and she looked at me and walked away. Ok???   I am not a quiet girl so that annoyed me as she must have heard me so I went right to the front and found the manager who alleviated the situation right away and got me my General Tso\'s. He was very nice and helpful so it was nice to see my situation taken care of right away and later came back to make sure everything was ok.\n\nThe Tso\'s was good but not the best I\'ve ever had (could have had more spice as it was pretty mild).  I would go there if I wanted a quick (well hopefully next time it would be quick) fix for Chinese when I am work but don\'t think I will be saying "Oh, I need some Wok on Fire stat" anytime soon. \n\nFrom working in the restaurant business for a number of years, I appreciated the good service and concern from the manager so that added some brownie points for them in my book.'

I first came here with my flatmates on the way to our friends' house party and we left impressed by the speed of the service and the general atmosphere of the place.  They have a really cool fish theme going on which is in keeping with its style of food.  \nTheir fish and chips are excellent and we were glad to see that our haddock hadn't been sitting in the counter keeping warm for an hour before we arrived.  They were cooked to order in nice, crispy batter which went amazingly with their fluffy chips.  Along with a can of coke it came to about \xc2\xa34 which was actually very reasonable considering the quality and the size of the portion.

I must say that the dual order drive thru is great.  It is only 1 line and allows this location to take orders from 2 customers, but no one gets in front of the other.  It is still single file so you don't cars in front of you, like the dual lane drive thrus.  \nAs for food this place has finally got the fries right!  I expect salt and some oil on the fries.  Also nice and hot is a plus.  This location, on a consistent basis has made me a nice batch of fries.  I also enjoyed all the different hamburgers here and so far a great location for hot, fast food.  \nIf you are a fan of McDonald's, like I am this is the best location in Surprise and it is as good as it gets here.

S"I'd heard a lot about Michael Neave. Especially his \xc2\xa37.95 express lunch menu.\n\nI share similar tastes to my dining companions on the day too; and know that it had been highly rated in the past. And whilst my meal was nice, it didn't knock my socks off or even make my toes tingle a little bit.\n\n\xc2\xa37.95 for 3 courses is a fantastic deal, especially considering MN is going for fine dining. I had the venison terrine, beef and then we all had the brownie as dessert.\n\nThe terrine was lacking flavour. It was a nice portion size, and I did eat it all; but having just had venison and chilli the night before at a deli in Glasgow that I can still taste, this was quite bland. A few bit of chewy fat in there too.\n\nThe beef was a little dry and chewy in parts. Not a cut that would lend itself to being medium rare, and the sauce gave it flavour. An ample serving too. Again, however, the side of new potatoes with some butter needed a lot of pepper and seasoning.\n\nI rarely season, if ever, and never with salt unless it's a few crystals of Maldon sea salt. So to have to add pepper to my potatoes, and wish I'd done the same to the venison, just wasn't great.\n\nThe brownie, with cherries, was rich and stodgy and mainly tasting of cocoa. Nice, again, but not a touch on the Peter's Yard chocolate and cheesecake brownie; or the Peppers brownies; or, well, a lot of other brownies I've had.\n\nSo overall this was a perfectly fine meal, and I can't sniff at the good value. But given I could pay a tad more for a really exceptional meal means I probably will. I'm hoping I got it on an off day. Laura D, Joe A and Blythe R all rate it 5 stars, and I know that none of them give out 5 star reviews lightly. But I can't see myself, off of the quality of a \xc2\xa37.95 express lunch, coming back here to spend full price on an evening meal - and surely thats the point of such fantastic offers?\n\nBut all the same, I had a very enjoyable lunchtime with wonderful company. And the service was friendly, attentive yet chilled out."

The venue is sort of stark - iron bars as decor and stiff black leather couches, combined with the chill in the air, it was not very welcoming. \n\nService was friendly and efficient (although we were two of four people in the place). They were out of more than two options on an already very small   tapas-style menu. The blue cheese fig panini we ordered was lackluster. The bread wasn't very high quality and I thought the flavors were a bit too sweet for me personally. I thought it was very strange that our server actually told us that no one orders that and the cook was shocked when he gave him our order... not a good sign!\n\nI did appreciate that our server took the time to ask how the food was and asked us for honest feedback, which we gave. He did say he would take note of the bread for next time and possibly add some arugula to the panini. \n\nI will say the wine selections were priced great - and we did enjoy our bottle.\n\nI think with a better atmosphere and food this place could earn some more stars in the future.

S"This place has definitely gotten a bad rap and I have stayed away until this last weekend. To be honest, I had forgotten about it completely until on I was on Mill a couple of weeks ago meeting up with a buddy for lunch at Five Guys right next door to the Regions that opened in Tempe. \n\nMy fiancee and one of our other good friends celebrated their birthdays this past weekend with a bowl-a-thon at the Via Linda Lanes and we needed some place to eat beforehand. I did a little research and found Regions is part of both opentable.com and restaurant.com, had a decent looking menu with stuff the group we were going with would like and I thought we should give it a shot. Besides, I was getting the points and a great discount anyways, if it was no good at least I would get a deal.\n\nThe inside is nice, clean, and modern. The seating is spaced nicely and not on top of each other and the music isn't too loud either. We had a group of six so they sat us at the big table in the back corner. My fiancee and I arrived fifteen minutes or so prior to the next couple. Yumi was our server and she was great; very attentive as well. I felt bad that the rest of our group was running as late as the were and so we ordered some drinks and appetizers. The first apps we ordered were the Rings and Fries (The rings were good, a little on the softer side, but at least the onion didn't come out of the battering on the first bite. The Fries were decent, but the Gorgonzola they were covered in was a bit too much in the cheese department. We also ordered the Mussels which were quite tasty. Yumi even apologized when she noticed 2-3 hadn't opened before they were plated and served.  We also ordered the calamari which was crunchy and had a little kick. All and all everything was enjoyed and brought in in a rather timely manner.\nOnce our entire party had arrived we took advantage of the date night special that Regions runs on Saturdays (any bottle of wine 80.00 and cheaper is half off) and ordered a couple of bottles as well as our entrees at that point.  Half of the table ordered the mac and cheese with either crab or chicken. I tasted the crab one and it was good, although I like much more pepper on my m&c so it was a bit bland for me.  I ordered the filet mignon med rare and it came out perfectly. They don't ruin the meat with a bunch of spices and sauces here, it stands alone and was juicy and cooked just right. I was quite happy about it.  It is served with a baked potato and veggies. I think if I do it again I would try to sub out the potato for another side if possible. \nThe birthday girls ordered an apple pie a la mode and a s'more for dessert. They were both nice and warm and very tasty. However we were all stuffed from the meal and couldn't finish either of them between us. The bill came and we were happy that we used restaurant.com because it made the meal even more affordable for the amount of food and drink we consumed.  We will definitely go back and try other options in the future. It was nice that Yumi checked on us as often as she did as well as the manager and chef and I think these folks have something good going on over there."

S'Subdued, comfortable dining room, arrogant servers and mediocre pasta. Yep. I said it! Started the meal with stale bread a 20 min wait for beverages. The olive oil was tasty but I\'m assuming the guys in the back had nothing to do with that. Mind you it was 5pm on a Wednesday. When our server did bring drinks I mentioned this was our first time and we looked forward to some authentic pasta. He stared into my eyes, awkwardly, and said, "Yep, were kind of the real deal". I knew then we were in for it. The pizza was fine but the pappardelle with bolognese was umm.. Not amazing. It wasn\'t the pasta itself rather the sauce that turned me off. Bland, slightly tomatoey and vaguely creamy with a smattering of coarsely ground meat. Just not what I know Bolognese to be. In my world it\'s deep red and heavy on pancetta, ground veal or pork and beef with just enough tomato to make everything come together. They missed the target. Sorry guys. If you want a decent pizza give it a shot or just find a Grimaldi\'s, La Bocca or Isa\'s. Have I been harsh? Maybe, but I\'m tired of these trendy spots telling me what the "Real Deal" is. Thanks but no thanks. Next time I want good pasta I\'m staying home.'

S'Don\'cha love it when you can actually "taste" the love put into your food?  At Hana\'s It\'s kind of like a home cooked meal (only with more exciting food than I actually cook up at home).\n\nPlus, the namesake, Hana herself, is just as sweet as pie.  \n\nYummy, simple, Mediterranean fare whose portions are More-Than-Enough- combined with reasonable prices, is the best way to describe it.    The Chicken Pita is by far my favorite.  (Think Gyro but with grilled chicken instead of gyro meat).  Fresh veggies and Tzatziki sauce top this delicious meal.  It\'s only $6.89 and it includes french fries (the old-fashioned thick and high calorie ones- YUM!) or a light and refreshing salad.   Her gyro is also pretty damn good!\n\nMy kids think her burger\'s (yeah, I know it\'s Mediterranean, but they REALLY like her burgers!) are the best in the world!  They are honestly okay, but not by any stretch of the imagination are they the best.  This is where that whole "made with love" thing comes into play. \n\nFor the vegetarian\'s out there, you will not feel left out at Hana\'s.  Her Eggplant Sandwich has roasted red pepper, provolone, and veggies "served on a fresh baked sub roll".  And she has several salad choices.\n\nSo if you need a quick meal, and you are dying for a Mediterranean version of "home-style" cooking, head over to Hana\'s.  \n\nTake care!\n\nWarmly,\n\nKirin :)'

S"As we walked through the casino area of the Hard Rock, my friend stopped and saw the menu for LTO.  We didn't get our pizza the night before so we decided to come here for dinner Friday night.  Our party of two arrived around 6:30pm and was seated immediately.  We were probably two of eight people in the restaurant.\n\nLOCATION:\nIn the back of the Hard Rock Hotel, further back but next to the entrance of Nobu\n\nFOOD:\nI thought I was set on getting the pizza, but once I looked at the menu, I decided to get the linguini with fresh clams.  You have the option of getting white or tomato sauce, I chose the white.  The linguini was delicious!  It was actually the perfect portion size where I was full and content after finishing my entire meal.  The white sauce was light and delicious, perfect for scooping into the clam shells or soaking with the accompanied bread.  \n\nMY GRIPES:\n*We weren't given bread or butter\n*Clams were small\n*Fresh parmesan cheese wasn't used, it was more like the Kraft kind you put on pizzas\n*A spoon wasn't given to me with my pasta dish - an absolute must with Italian pasta dishes!\n\nBeing one of the only parties in the restaurant, we thought this place was either new or horrible.  I looked up LTO on Yelp to find only one review and it was a horrible one at that.  The waitress actually told us that they've been open for about two months but I still found it odd that there was basically no one in the restaurant.\n\nService was a bit spotty.  We were rarely checked up on but the workers were friendly.  \n\nLTO does have the potential to make it.  The food was good, but maybe because they're located in a back corner, there's a whole lack of promotion.  Until it gets a bit more crowded, I think for the time being, they should think about having less staff on duty.  Its odd looking into an open kitchen and seeing the wait staff and chefs just standing there."

S"This place is a really off the wall Vegas experience, an authentic German gasthaus just off Las Vegas Blvd.  Full bar and great beer on tap - at great prices.  The club is private, but you are allowed a limited number of visits without joining.  \n\nThere is usually a dinner on Saturday nights (check the website for details).  The quality of the meals prepared by the members is good, and again the pricing is reasonable.  Non-members can enjoy a meal also.  Just call the club by Thursday to make a reservation.  \n\nAbsolutely one of my favorite places to have a beer in Las Vegas.  Surreal atmosphere, warm and friendly people (almost none of them are German ;))) and delicious German beer on tap!\n\nThe Club itself (known as the GASCON)  is pretty neat too.  They have a couple boozy golf tournaments a year, which are a lot of fun, and also do a fantastic job hosting the Oktoberfest in DT Las Vegas.  Annual membership is like $35.  I carry my card in my wallet.  \n\nThe GASCON is making a push to increase the headcount of its younger members (hold your national socialist youth movement jokes please ;))).  There's talk of using the space on the off nights as a music venue and also of hosting viewing parties for both the US and Germany games at the 2014 World Cup.  I'll be there..."

S"Okay, so this is really what I call a hole-in-the-wall.  We were in the area (at Revive Salon) and pretty hungry.  The only restaurants available were Chinese food and The Sandwich Shop.  Well, that was an easy choice.  Here, you can only order food to go.  There is a small waiting room and there are no tables.  Service was friendly and pretty quick.  I ordered a grilled chicken club sandwich that was very good ($5.55 + tax).  However, the bread was really not thick enough to support the sandwich as it should have.  Mind you,  I was pleased with the sandwich but it seemed they used the thinnest of thin bread to make it.  The sandwich included the grilled chicken breast with bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo although you can omit what you don't want.  I am sure I will visit again when I am in the area and my stomach is calling.  I will choose this restaurant over Chinese food any day of the week.  Although the place is not visually friendly, the food is good to eat.\n\n4 stars for the food and the menu variety\n4 stars for service\n3 stars for the restaurant overall"

S"You have to forgive me as I am a little sad today. One of the cheapest, and best chicken places has gone totally down hill. In the world of fast food chicken places it is normally a choice between KFC or Church 's. In fact until today I would have said Church 's by a mile. Disagree? Then let 's talk price for a minute. \n\nWhen you can get eight pieces of chicken, four biscuits,  a side of mashed potatoes and gravy plus coleslaw all four around $10 then there is no choice involved. There is just me asking for some hot sauce and a pile of napkins. (LOL) But after moving to Michigan for a few years and having no choice but to pay the super high prices the colonel commands from his troops (customers),  I was looking forward to moving back to Arizona and some good fried chicken. \n\nBut somehow things are never as great as you remember them. My first experience with Church 's was not only a disappointment but a slap in the face. Forgotten were the memories sweetened by the warm honey butter biscuits I used to enjoy. Gone were the days when I sat with my grandma and feasted on tasty fried chicken. Now all that remains is the smell of burned food that taste like it had been made three days before and reheated till it was almost charcoal.  \n\nI mean come on I like dark meat but this was ridiculous. Maybe to increase profits they were selling this cremated fowl as fuel to KFC to make their grilled chicken with (LOL). But seriously though the food was really bad. The biscuits looked like the kind you buy at the store just with a little smear of honey and were rock hard. This is to bad because they sold one of the better tasting biscuits sold by a chain ( KFC 's taste like they used to much flour, and Popeye 's is way to salty for my taste). \n\nThe bottom line is with great power comes great responsibility. If you have a great product do not mess with it. Just keep cranking it out and offering it at a affordable price. Why? It is simple, because you will make a lot of money.(LOL) I only hope that someone at Church 's will awaken from this nightmare and start making the food that makes good memories instead of just making people sick."

S"One of the worst dining experiences I have had in Las Vegas in recent memory.  We walked in and no one greeted us at the door.  Finally a gentleman who had walked by us before asked if we were looking for a table.  Finally we were seated.  We were taken to a table where there was a wine bucket with an empty bottle of wine next to it, which was moved away.  We sat down and the server proceeded to tell us about the items that were not available.  It was still early on a Friday and they were out of many high cost items including steak and clams.  We decided to order a glass of wine to start.  It seemed as if they were short staffed.  So everything took a very long time.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine and an order of bruschetta.  The server returned later with a bottle of wine and informed my husband that they were out of the wine he ordered as well and would he like to have a glass from the bottle she brought over.  Finally,  we got our bar order.  We had been seated for a while.  No bread came.  Then finally about 15 minutes later we were brought a mediocre loaf of white bread. (nothing special).  I went to use my bread plate but it was dirty, it looked clean but felt like it had a dirty film over it.  The bruschetta was finally delivered and it was nothing to get excited over.  The bread was not toasted and it was just chopped tomatoes and garlic on untoasted bread. \n  In the meantime there was a musician who was playing in the dining room.  He sang Billy Joel, Cat Stevens songs kind of your typical lounge songs.  I enjoyed listening to him.  It seemed as if most of the people there were coming to listen to his performance.  A party of 3 people came in to listen to him but 5 more joined them and they needed a bigger table.  They wanted to put 2 tables together but the waitress kept saying that someone would move their tables for them.  Finally, the manager? came over and moved the two tables for them inches away from our table.  We were literally an inch away from 2 people at the table yet there was plenty of room that they could have moved them to the other direction.   At this point my husband picked up our table and moved it out of the way.  No one really seemed to care or notice that we had moved ourselves. \nAt this point we decided to cut our losses and leave.  No service, no food, no clue!  We went in looking for a casual dinner out and left angry and frustrated.  Don't waste your money!"

S'We would go here pretty frequently for work lunches.  Maybe it is the close proximity to the other (better) places near the Chandler Mall, but it always seemed to be half empty at lunchtime.  The crazy part was - as bored as the waitresses/kitchen had to be with only 4-5 parties in the whole restaurant, the food still seemed to come out kind of lukewarm and drink refills were pretty hard to come by. \n\n+2 stars for the fact that there was always ample seating available on the patio, which is a pretty nice place to be during the spring/fall.'

S"The staff is really nice, they rarely if ever mess up my orders which are usually complicated and require alterations or substitutions, they don't skimp on the hot sauce packets or napkins, the service is always really fast and friendly, and the food is very reasonably priced if you order a la carte. I've found that most combo meals aren't the greatest value (especially because there's a circle K right across the street, you can go get a drink there for 85 cents unless you want baja blast) other than maybe the taco box. But yeah, pretty much everything you could ask for from a taco bell. You should know what you're getting into. This taco bell meets expectations, and in a time where customer service can easily fall by the wayside, this a five-star in my book."

S"I'm sooo glad that they finally have a sushi place at Santa Fe!  I frequent this place as much as I can (sometimes by myself after a session of bingo lol) -- my favorite rolls being the Ultimate Salmon and the Ultimate Yellowtail!  The sauce is to die for on these rolls and I highly recommend them!  Also, for something super-unique, I'd recommend the Monkey Roll!  It has banana, tuna, and crab... Sounds crazy but it's excellent and I make sure everytime I bring someone to Sushi Avenue 2 they try it, and they fall in love with it everytime!\n\nI have never had a bad experience here; the sushi is always fresh!  The servers are very attentive and some of the sushi chefs are really entertaining when you're being served at the bar.  \n\nIt became even better when they added happy hour specials during the evening before closing on weekdays!  If you're a fan of oyster shooters, they have 3 different varieties to choose from...\n\nIf you're ever in this casino, this place is a must-try for any sushi lover!\n\nThe ONLY negative I can think of is that they're only open for dinner. Boo."

S'Mmnnnn... In reading everyone else\'s review I don\'t know if I\'m being harsh or not but I\'m not a fan of this place. I\'ve been in a couple of times recently. Once for coffee and cake which was an "ok" experience. Central location, but there are so many other nicer places nearby you can go for a fabulous coffee in a nicer setting. Plus I found the squoosh of canned cream next to my bit of lemon drizzle cake a bit cheap and it coloured my perception of their Italian home baking.\n\nNext visit was for food during the festival, primarily cause we walked past and the folk I was with said we should go in as they couldn\'t be bothered trying to find anywhere else that would take 6. It wouldn\'t have ever been on my list of places to eat Italian food in Edinburgh however I\'m happy to go with the flow on occasion as I\'m hoping to be surprised. I wasn\'t. Pasta was overcooked (an offence in Italy!!) and the sauce wasn\'t all that. Weird tasting meatballs, kinda tasted like they were frozen from Costco. Nothing authentic about this place in my mind apart from the Italian waiter. The place had a slightly grubby look to it which might have been down to the huge amount of tourist traffic in and out for the festival, but still... No toilet paper in the ladies either. Grump. \n\nSo cannot recommend. But as I say, I might just be more harsh than others :)'

S'I\'ve been eating at Carl\'s for years and they have always been pretty good as fast food burger joints go for sure. The Western Bacon Cheeseburger is very good, the Grilled Barbeque Chicken sandwich is likewise delicious and the Cross-cut Fries are an excellent accompanyment for Carl\'s burgers. Lately though I\'ve fallen in love with Carl\'s Turkey Burger. I\'ve been trying to make the occasional "healthy choice" and this burger fits the bill when I need to grab something on the fly. This sandwich is served on a toasted whole wheat bun with plenty of lettuce, tomatoes and onions and a deliciously juicy turkey patty. Turkey patties tend to get somewhat dry when cooked, but Carl\'s does a good job of keeping the burger moist and succulent. If you\'re trying to eat health this burger is a great place to start.\n\nBTW, this location is great! I use the drive-thru here with great regularity and the service is excellent. The location is very convenient, near the intersection of Rainbow and Westcliff and they are generally not too busy.'

I am originally from the Champaign area so when I go home to visit the family this is what I crave.

Their pizzas are delicious, and many specialty pies priced below  $15 for a large. Would easily feed 3 or 4.  Could rival local pizza joints!

This was my first time here, my friends had been at the original Blanco several times.  They were craving the nachos.  Now typically when a menu item has been changed either your server will tell you or the menu will state the change.  Neither happened in this situation.  My friends didn't like the taste of the nachos and they specifically asked for no cream on them.  It came with cream on the bottom and both girls are lactose intolerant.  This ruined the dinner. The nachos were sent back and my friends had upset stomachs the rest of the night.  My meal was the short rib tacos.  These were actually good but this is AZ and good tacos are expected anywhere.  They claimed I was getting borracho beans. These beans were just refried and not smashed all the way.  I will not be reccomending this place and to have a restaurant in such a nice location you have to really step up your game Blanco"

This seemed be a great idea, healthy food after a good bit of exercise. As I went in, I really liked the vibe. Small, cozy, and smelling great. I had a veggie burger with avocado salad & a stuffed vine leaf salad. The veggie burger was good, and the salads were fantastic. While I ate my friend had a biscotti, which was not too bad, this made me want to get something to eat so I opted for an energy ball made of coconut & some sort of green tea. It was delicious. In the end I am super happy that my friend introduced me to this cafe. I will definitely go back and give a try...after a nice sweaty yoga session that is.'

S'This review is for the airport location which to a non-native Montrealer is probably awful, but for someone from Wash DC whose first introduction to smoked meat was at Moe\'s in the airport....this place will always be great.  I know it\'s probably not as good as "real" smoked meat from one of the authentic deli\'s in town, but when I crave smoke meat this is what I think of since it was my first experience.  I\'m pretty sure I offended all of Quebec when I described my first sandwich as being like a shaved hot dog after my first bite, but since then a Moe\'s smoked meat sandwich has almost become reason enough to but a roundtrip ticket from DCA to YUL.  If you\'ve never been to YUL and have 30 minutes to kill, go here and order the smoked meat sandwich and you\'ll probably understand.'

S'I stopped by this McDonalds yesterday before work. I knew I wanted some nuggets and maybe fries. I got to the window and ordered nuggets. I wanted a second to decide if I wanted the full meal or anything else but the girl in the drive thru rushed me so I decided not to get anything other than the nuggets. I know it\'s "fast" food and ideally I should come through the drive thru and already know what I want to buy, but I wasn\'t going to spend more than 2 minutes looking at the menu and deciding. It wasn\'t even busy, there was no one behind me and this location has two speakers. Even when I went to pay she was in too much of a hurry and practically threw my change at me. I won\'t go out of my way to come here again. I ended up going to Burger King for a whopper and fries a few hours later. If  the girl at the window had been a little more patient then I probably would have just gotten a full meal and drink from McDonalds.\n\n2 Stars because the girl at the second window was nice and the nuggets weren\'t bad.'

It was the service that was awful. We sat on the rooftop terrace for a view of the city, which meant that our server had to hike the stairs to bring us food, napkins, silverware, drinks, etc. Which meant he when he brought us our food and had neglected to bring us silver and napkins, he had to go back down to get them...and it took him 20 minutes. By which point our food was cold. Our drinks were empty for 20 minutes at a time waiting for him to come back up and give us replacements, our dirty dishes stayed on the table long after we'd finished...you get the idea.

S'This is a French wannabe restaurant, but oh well, it tries hard. It\'s like if an ordinary Peter changed his name to "Pierre," put on a berret, but forgot to fake the French accent.\n\nIf this review sounds snobby, it\'s because I\'ve been spoiled by bona fide New Orleans restaurants for years. \n\nLet me start with the good, first though: The banana chocolate dessert bursted with flavor, and their cinnamon donuts were to die for. To give the restaurant credit, they also had a lovely, fresh chive cream cheese you can tell they made from scratch on the premises. But the waitress looked at my aunt like she had just asked to "peel her a grape" when she asked the bagels be cut into quarter sized pieces. Ha ha ha.\n\nWhen I ordered a Croque Monssieur, it came with a white sauce that it "said" was bechamel, but come on: it\'s supposed to be more off-white and not be so bland.  My aunt made fun of the fact it was not on a french sort of toast but on white bread. Tacky. Perhaps Wonder? ;) Le sigh. Can you really be ALL that discerning about Parisian cuisine when you are in the land of beer and brats?'

S'Beetlejuice is a relatively new addition onto the sandwich scene in Edinburgh. It was only fairly recently that I first came here for my lunch and I realised what I was missing. Beetlejuice is situated just around the corner from the main University campus, George Square, so it is a convenient place for students to go to for their lunch. \n\nBeetlejuice is relatively small inside, but they sell the most delicious home made lunches and they offer a wide selection of sandwiches fillings in the deli counter at the back of the shop, with a lot of non-meat options so it is a great place for vegetarians as they will have lots of choice. \n\nThey also serve a wide range of really delicious smoothies and freshly squeezed juices, as well as home made soups. I ordered the carrot and coriander soup for my lunch which was tasted really fresh and full and flavour - yum! The food is perhaps a wee bit more expensive than the other sandwich shops in the area, but the food is truly beautiful so it is worth it!'

S"This is not your tourist friendly Italian restaurant where you would settle with a pizza. This is an Italian restaurant run by Italians with a real Italian experience in the taste of their food and wine. Having visted Italy many times my expectations were high.\n\nThe interior has a nice modern designer feel to it without trying too hard to be cool, lot's of dark wood and granite walls with soft lighting and some funky lightshades is a good mix and they do it well.\nThe staff were friendly, so i didn't hold it against the waiter when he accidently threw the bread roll at my wife, and it was quickly made up for by the excellent service.\n\nThe menu has more of a regional feel to it, rather than trying to cover all that Italy has to offer. The majority of pasta dishes are reserved for the starters, as they should be and with the mains are meat and seafood. I noticed there was a lot of seafood available from lobster, seabass, swordfish and tiger prawns, and the only red meat was lamb.  I didn't see this as a bad thing, rather more of a sign that if things are kept simple they will be done well.\n\nWhile deciding, we had olives brought out for us with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, i am not a fan of olives (unless cooked) but i thought i would try one, and i must say not bad, still not a fan though but a lovely gesture.\n\nMy starter, described as filled pockets of pasta in olive oil and nutmeg, was the perfect sized starter, i must admit perhaps it was a little too hot, which the waiter did warn me about, so i felt some of the flavour was lost, untill i allowed it to cool down. My wife went with the bruschetta, which although the bread was slightly too cook around the edges, it certainly held it's flavour and the mushrooms were amazing.\nThe mains, well im glad my starter was not too filling because this did the job. We both went for the orecchiette with lamb, and i could have given them 5 stars alone just for this. The lamb was cooked to perfection and just melted in your mouth and the pasta to meat ratio was too my liking, plus the orecchiette was not over cooked.\n\nNow i must admit, the highlight of the night was to go down stairs after the meal to sample some Italian artisan beers in their newly opened bar 'Serendipidy', with a huge selection of personally imported beers and a private tasting room in a cellar, i was sold! But we were told the bad news that as it's just opened they are only opened on weekends, but the waiter did take us down for a private tour.\n\nSo now im looking forward to Saturday night, go see a movie and finish the night sampling some Italian craft beers.\n\n...........Oh and i loved the little box your bill comes in, i did want to take that home with me."

The dining room is very nice and the food was great. Its a mainly seafood menu, with an emphasis on fish. There are about 8 different types of fish to choose from and several different sauces, and ways to prepare them. The appetizers were all very good too.  The fish portions were also very large. I dont think anyone in my party actually finished what they ordered. I had the Hawaiian sailfish with bacon and gorgozola cheese, and it was very tasty. It was off the specials menu, so might not be around anymore, but the standard menu looked very good too.  I liked it and will go back next time I'm in the mood for (cooked) Fish...best I have found in the Green Valley area."

S'As someone else said, you\'ve got to call these guys on "Wacky Wednesdays".  Even the specialty pizzas are half price.  With that said, price alone doesn\'t make this place great.  We ordered the "Pittsburgh Steak Pizza", the "BBQ Chicken Pizza", and a plain cheese pizza for the kids.  The cheese pizza was good, but the Pittsburg and BBQ pizzas were out of this world.  I haven\'t had a chance to order anything else on the menu but if the Pizza is any indication of overall quality then I can\'t imagine not likening the hoagies and such.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pizza was unique enough that I\'m giving this place a 5 star rating.  I tend to only give 5 stars to places that are good and/or unique enough that I\'d take people from out of town there to eat.  If you are looking for something a little different, and very tasty, give Pizzeria Primos a shot!'

S'July 6th, 2014 - My first taste of Nepali dish at a Nepali Restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA after living in the city for more than a decade. Any my experience was just "A-OK". \n\nWe were driving back from Ohiopyle from a long weekend of hiking and biking - when we decided to stop here for dinner. The restaurant sitting area and a "party hall" was being vacuumed as we walked in. I was told that a wedding party had just ended but the restaurant was still open for business. The restaurant has more of a cafeteria/dinner settings with a row of corner booths.\n\nNow comes the mouth watering part - which we were hoping for. Since it\'s supposed a Nepali Ethnic Restaurant, we chose to order only Nepali dish. We were a group of five - so we ordered the Non Veg Thali for 2 (chicken and mutton), chicken chowmein, Chicken Momo and Chicken curry with Rice. Apparently they were out of Chicken Momos so we got the Veg Momo instead. Everything seemed fresh and the Manager assured that everything was cooked fresh and from scratch. There\'s also several Indian Dish on the Menu which was a lot cheaper compared to the Nepali Dish which I can understand but the Thali in my opinion seemed a bit high. As a Nepalese and having cooked and tasted Nepali Dish myself - the food here was okay and authentic to some extend.\n\nEveryone working here was very friendly and the service was pretty good. My recommendation to fellow yelpers if you happen visit this place - stick to the Nepali Dish.'

If you need food it always seems to be open and is proabaly the best option in the area for street food at night.'

S'Like I have said before, having children makes it nearly a necessary thing to be at McDonalds about once a week. This isn\'t always for Happy Meals (we prefer home cooked food to fast food always - especially for our kids), but I don\'t mind treating him with a soft serve cone or a Sprite on the way home from the park, or maybe when he\'s been really good at the grocery store. They also tend to be a good caffeine fix for me when I don\'t feel like the Bux. \n\nThis McDonalds is on the way to "Grandma\'s House" so we make stops here more frequently than any other on this side of the valley. We\'ve never encountered any problems more than the occassional broken straw here. Employees are generally pleasant. How much better could a Mickey D\'s get?'

S'I had a really lovely lunch here - but I think that, had my company not been so splendid, I wouldn\'t have had such a good time. This place seems confused about whether it\'s a classy restaurant or a kooky indie eatery. In support of the former: it\'s elegant, spacious, and served us each an intimidatingly large glass on arrival with the wide base of its bowl moistened with a finger of white wine - complimentary, apparently, although it was just kind of plonked in front of me and I had no idea whether I\'d be charged but was too English to ask. (Also "plonk" might be entirely the wrong word. I don\'t know, for obvious reasons!).\n\nIn support of the latter: it has a wide range of clocks on the walls, all stopped at somewhere kind of afternoonish time, so don\'t trust them if you\'re out for lunch. I know, I get it, "tempo perso" and all that, but it just seemed a little like trying too hard. There\'s also this weird screen showing some kind of cookery programme, to which, fortunately, I had my back, or I would have been utterly distracted.\n\nThat said - the food was pleasant - we simply ordered three dishes from the antipasti part of the menu to share between us as a light bite and they were pretty nice, all around the \xc2\xa36 mark. I\'m not sure I\'d have necessarily seen fit to charge that much for the mushrooms or the bruschetta trio (\xc2\xa32 for each wee bit of bruschetta? Cheeky). I guess when the mains are hitting into the teens price-wise it\'s to be expected, though. The trio of bruschetta was excellent, however. The roasted vegetable one was my favourite.\n\nFor me, it\'s not quite settled enough to be a treat meal out, and it\'s not quite kooky enough to be characterful; I guess most of the competition in the immediate vicinity seems to be coffee shops and patisseries, though, so it serves a purpose and if you\'ve got the budget for a full meal sometime in the evening when there\'s more atmosphere then I\'m sure you\'ll have a fine time.'

I saw several walk-ins get turned away during the course of our meal, even parties of just two people. Regardless of the configuration, there's only 26 seats in the place. We were lucky to nab a same-day booking for an early 6pm meal, on the condition we be up and out by 8pm.\n\n(We just barely it)\n\nEverything about Dubh Prais is exquisite. The menu, staff, ambiance and most importantly the food are all fantastic and expertly executed. I'd be so bold as to claim that it doesn't matter what you order; it's all going to be good.\n\nI had a large glass of the house red (a Spanish rioja) and it was insanely good for a house wine. My main - a dish of beautifully medium rare Angus medallions in a sauce of pure joy - was unparalleled. How the chef manages to prepare so many dishes so perfectly boggles the mind.\n\nThe desserts?

I believe they swap out the bacon and put this dried up steak and dried up onions on the same egg, cheese and bagel. Because she said i would have to wait and then Bam! the sandwich was there. 15sec.  My other item bacon, egg, and cheese was also hard, dry and cold. After waiting in drive thru line at this time of morning, I was expecting 3 hot freshly made biscuits and bagel. Smh. terrible. They didnt even offer me anything for their mistake and wait. Looks like they were in there just playing with ppls food. My thing was, breakfast just started at 4am. It was 4:11am when i ordered. Why is the food hard and dry?\n\nI was so disgusted with the unprofessionalism, not caring employees, i didnt want to even look at them anymore and i didnt want to wait and make them cook it over because i was tired and hungry. I don't usually eat at Mcdonalds and you pretty much know what ur getting, but dam! That is just ridiculous. You had to see it with your own eyes.  \n\nAll i can say is the staff at this location needs to be trained much better including managers. There is no reason to run a business that way.

Skip the fries and get a side salad for $3 to at least make you think you're eating healthy. Co-located with Nathans which is kind of odd.

S'Pho is one of my favorite food and finding a good Pho place in Las Vegas is like trying to get rich gambling in these big casino, it\'s "Pho-get about it" hard. Everytime a new Vietnamse restaurant opened up in Vegas, I always hope that  they will finally have good Pho.\n\n What define good Pho? Must have good flavor and  flavor must come from either beef bone or meat + enough herb + spices (star anises, ginger, onions, salt, sugar, etc...), not just MSG +salt+sugar+ star anise. \n\nEven though I grew up in California, I don\'t think I set my standard high when it comes to Pho in Vegas. Anyway, get back to Pho Thai Binh. Tried it the first time when it was first opened, wasn\'t impressed. Tried it again this week, it\'s even worse. The broth was so bland and flavorless that it tasted like water + salt + sugar only. Also tried the rice dish, wasn\'t impressed either. Rice was old and hard, so was the meat. Bun Thit Nuong, decent.\n\nOverall, Pho # 1 or Pho # 8 are still better choices. The only upside is the restaurant is really clean, but I think b/c the place is still new.'

As Risa D. mentions in her review, the cafe itself isn\'t very cozy and inviting but the pastries are delicious and the staff are friendly. \n\nThe item I keep returning for every few weeks is the "Feuillet\xc3\xa9 Epinard"...a triangular-shaped buttery flakey pastry filled with a savoury mix of spinach, olives, sundried tomatoes, and cheese. At roughly $4.00 it is a nice light meal. They also offer lunch combos of soup or salad, pressed sandwich, dessert and drink for roughly $9.00 if that is more your style.\n\nTheir to-go baked goods selection is always fresh and made with love. I have tried their flax bread (very good) and a few of their pastries that rivaled Premiere Moisson (of which I am a fan!). Today I sampled the fresh mixed berry tart which was not altogether unsatisfying but not a highlight. A dense, crispy butter cookie crust took the place of the more traditional crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth crust. The berries atop saved the dessert which, according to the owner, came fresh from Jean-Talon market in the morning.'

It is only on the receipt.\n\nWhen we arrived there was one large table of about 10-12 people and one table of 4 who were paying their bill. The large group was getting their food as we sat down.\n\nMenus were brought out and as I inquired about the bbq combo specials, another group of 3 arrived and then shortly after, a group of 2. Now, ordinarily, when there is only one person manning the floor, I am a little more sympathetic, but, when we didn't get drinks and banchan for 20 mins? \n\nI continued to be patient, we ordered the combo with chadol baegi, jumulluk and samgyupsal which I asked if we could swap the samgyupsal for more of the the other two since we don't like the pork belly.

You can also get beer or soju but we didn't want that and so got 2 sodas instead. Our small combo was enough to feed 2 she said and was $39.99. I also ordered the yukgejang (spicy beef soup).\n\nThe quality of the meat was pretty good. The chadol had almost no fat and had slight marbling. Banchan was the regular stuff -- kimchi, kkakkdugi (cubed radish), oden (fish cake), the acorn jello, cucumber, kongnamul (bean sprouts). There was no dduk, and when I asked for chili sauce, she brought me gojujang. I thought that was a bit weird.\n\nThey charge for mixed grain rice -- as well as the rice with barley in it. I think both were 2 bucks.\n\nThey also don't offer any dwenjanjigae at the end of the meal.\n\nThis place also offers Korean style Chinese food like zajangmien and champon. We didn't try any of it, but I saw the large table eat this.\n\nOur food was good, I'd say 4 stars for the food for Vegas standards. For LA standards, probably 3 to 3.5 stars. However, service was just slow as hell and if you are hungry, I suggest you not bother coming here because it will take a while. \n\n3.5 stars from me."

S'I don\'t like giving a 1 star rating. I usually reserve that for a really horrible experience but in this case, this place earned a one star rating. I know that is harsh but this place straight up sucked. \n\nThere were 8 of us and when you have a large group it\'s difficult to coordinate where to go to eat. Someone in the group suggested we check out the Binion and off we went. We stumbled across Benny\'s and decided to go in since it wasn\'t busy. \n\nThere is no hostess stand so you walk in and find your own table to sit at, at least I think that\'s how it works. The middle aged waitress didn\'t acknowledge us while we were standing at the front. We walked around the small space seeing if there was a table for 8, there was not. There\'s only tables for 4. One couple was leaving and told us we could have their table to put together with the open table next to theirs. We did that. The waitress came over and did a quick wipe down with a dirty rag that left streaks and food behind. Eeww. I ended up wiping it down with the paper towels that were on the table.\n\nThe menu consists of 4 things. Full rack or half rack of ribs, 1/2 roasted chicken or 1/2 roasted chicken with 1/2 rack of ribs. Prices were really cheap. I\'m thinking with only 4 things on the menu, the food has to be phenomenal. I was wrong. Mediocre. The ribs were a dry rub with sauce on the side. The sauce tasted like bottled sauce. My corn was the smallest out of the group about 2 inches long. The slaw was watery and the baked beans tasted like a pound of sugar was dumped in it. I didn\'t try the corn bread. My friend\'s chicken wasn\'t cooked all the way and was pink by the bone so she didn\'t eat it.\n\nService was slllloooooooowwwwww. My 86 grandma walks faster than she does. It took about 15 mins (and I\'m being generous) for our waitress to come over and give us menus and even longer for her to come back and take our order. She left her bifocals on our table and when we were finally able to flag her down she mentioned she was looking all over for it because she couldn\'t put in our order since she couldn\'t see the computer screen. Great. We probably waited about an hour for our food. I really wanted to walk out but my friends said to give it a couple of more mins. Luckily we got our food after that. \n\nOne thing I saw that really disturbed me was, I saw our waitress dumping water glasses full of ice into the water pitcher. I know what I saw. She had 3 of the red water glasses, the same one I was drinking out of and saw her dump all 3 one at a time into the water pitcher. I don\'t know if she was recycling customers drinking water or if she used the glasses as a vessel to carry ice. She then dropped ice on the counter and scooped it up off the counter with her bare hands and dumped it into the pitcher. I stopped drinking the water and told my friends not to drink it.\n\nThere was another waitress there, a younger one but she was more preoccupied with coming in and out of the restaurant. Can\'t tell you what she was doing but she wasn\'t working that\'s for sure. \n\nWhen our very frazzled and slow waitress finally brought our check, she actually gave us the wrong check. We had to flag her down and get the correct one. We spent another 15 mins waiting for her to come back with my friend\'s credit card. Actually she didn\'t come back so we went to her. My other friends went to go gamble while we dealt with her and my friend\'s now missing credit card. When she finally found it she hadn\'t processed it yet. While she was doing that she told us that the party before us forgot their credit card...uh..more like you forgot to give it back. \n\nAlso there was a young couple smoking their vapor there which I thought was rude and disrespectful. I overheard our waitress tell the young man "oh you go boy, just like smoking a hookah"...wow...just wow. We were there for more than 2 hours. Walk past this place and don\'t do it. Seriously not worth it.'

S"It took me until this year (my fourth year living in Edinburgh) to get around to going to Greens Deli. I mean, it's not because I never wanted to, but because I'd only ever heard rumour of its existence, and people never tended to elaborate on what they served there. They just tended to see you gotta get there early, or there won't be any ingredients left. So, one day, I did. \n\nGreens Deli is the typical kind of student foody place to go. It's right next to the George Square library and the other abominable buildings that the university has built around George Square, and where it educates its students. This means that around 1, the place is packed with really hungry kids. \n\nThe fillings are really delicious, and the price is OK for how good it is. I don't know of any other sandwich place that has roasted courgettes AND aubergines AND peppers as fillings. And the honey mustard sauce is delicious. One warning, though. If you go here and decide to take your panini or wrap out to the park to eat (or wherever), be careful or you definitely will get covered in sauce."

S'Le Hangar - opened by Le Local\'s team, and most notably, Francois Louis Marcotte - was the subject of much buzz when it first joined Montreal\'s restaurant scene. Located at the edge of Griffintown nearest to the Old Port, Le Hangar is nestled within an old brick warehouse, decorated with an industrial chic aesthetic and surrounded by condo constructions and highways. It was destined to be a hot spot - after all, it was opened by a local star chef and situated in an obscure location.\n\nBut, something happened since Le Hangar opened. At the end of March 2012, bowed out of both Le Local and Le Hangar. I had been to Le Hangar when it opened - it was delicious, the service was friendly and the atmosphere was fun. Now, how would the restaurant fare without the local star chef? \n\nAs we walked in, a cheerful (and ridiculously good-looking) host brought us to our table. Having seen the menu online and dreaming of a delicious meal after a hectic day at work in the marketing world, my friend and I knew exactly what we wanted to order.\n\nWe started with the fried mini-shrimp, herb butter, garlic and pecorino ($12). It was fun! Not particularly inventive, but the batter was great and the shrimp weren\'t overly dunked. The butter and garlic were a nice touch, and the cheese added a bit of a punch.\n\nMy friend had the mac & cheese with lobster and mushrooms ($20). It was really great. The pasta was cooked al dente, the sauce was tasty and there was actually a decent amount of lobster in there. Very well done.\n\nI had the halibut with a pistachio-pesto crust, oyster mushrooms, and bouillon, topped with grapes and greens ($30). A surprising flavor at first, but it was tasty. I enjoyed it - the ingredients meshed surprisingly well together - but wished I could have tasted more of the fish among all of the ingredients.\n\nThe desserts, well... If you read my blog relatively regularly you know that few places impress me with their desserts (400 Coups and Pastaga deserve a special mention here, their desserts are flawless). Le Hangar falls into that category. The desserts were seemingly inexpensive, so we ordered two thinking that the portions would be small. Wrong! While I appreciate bang-for-buck, there\'s a lot to say about keeping desserts classy. It\'s easy to make them big, overly sweet and generally crude. It\'s much harder to make it the right size with a delicate sweetness and classy feel. The tiramisu sundae ($7) was an interesting idea, but should such a delicious classic be tampered with? Made with shortbread cookies, it was ok, but too heavy. The torta Caprese was also just ok, although the accompanying praline ice-cream (6$) was delicious.\n\nBut one thing left me particularly disappointed: the service. Yes, the courses were timely, but we had three different waiters throughout the evening. That\'s strange. Usually, a table is served by one waiter and a pleasant rapport usually develops throughout the evening... None of that at Le Hangar. Also, professionalism is important, but not when it comes at the price of friendly and personable service. Would it kill you to smile? Like, maybe a little bit? Anything!? Yes, apparently, it would.\n\nThis was the second time I went to Le Hangar, and I have to say, I enjoyed my first experience more. Has the reputation of a difficult reservation gone to the staff\'s heads? Possibly. Is it because of Fran\xc3\xa7ois Louis Marcotte\'s departure? Maybe. Either way, enjoying a meal has as much to do with the feel of the experience as it does with the food. So perk up guys, and drop the "cool" vibe. You have something good going. And based on my first experience, it could be really great.\n\nFood 8/10, Atmosphere 7.5/10, Pretty people 8/10, Music (cantreallyhearit) ?/10, Service 6.5/10.\n\nPictures: http://www.belledenuitmontreal.com/posts/le-hangar/'

S"OMG! A new BBQ place in my hood!  hoot!  \n\nOk, so I was driving around running errands today, and wanted to do something different.  As I was driving down Southern, I saw that this place just opened this week!  I guess they have one other location in Tempe, and this is their new place.  \n\nAnyways, aside from being family owned, its actually pretty good food.  I got the BBQ brisket sandwich on a bun and it was really really good.  I will probably return in the future for more. \n\nBUT, theres a few things that I noticed while I was here.  Please see below:\n\nOk, first the menu is mediocure. I mean, theres the usual to choose from...BBQ brisket, chicken and pork.  Prices are fair and they state that they have lunch specials every day including Saturday and Sunday.\n\nBut, the sides sucked! I ended up not getting anything on the side.   All they had was redskin potato salad and NO mased potatos.  Also, they had 2 kinds of beans and coleslaw...and that was it.  I was kinda dissapointed.  No mashed potatos?  No corn?  ugh!  none!  \n\nOk, and I admit, Im not Martha Stewart (I know you thought I was, but I'm clearing the air on this once and for all that I'm not) but the place looks like it was decorated by a pothead!  Full fledged pothead! Its like cheba hut meets BBQ in this joint!  (no pun intended!)  WTF gives?  I've never been to a BBQ place and seen a life sized Ozzy Ozborne poster hanging on the wall! Its beyond strange!  OMG!\n\nI just couldn't get past the really odd decor! I mean, it was so weird that I actually deducted a star because it was so out of sorts.  Even though the food here was great, and I will be returning, it was oddly decorated."

S'I went here for dinner on a Thursday night.  The place was mostly dead which I liked.  The service was very fast and friendly which was also very good.  The menu is pretty typical for a Chinese type restaurant in Phoenix and so are the prices.  The food was very good especially the hot & sour soup, the sa cha beef, and the fried rice.  We ordered soup, 3 entrees, 1 fried rice, and 1 lo mein and the bill was very reasonable for all that food at only about $60.  If I am ever in the area again and have a hankering for some Chinese food, then I would not hesitate to return.'

S'My wife and I went to Honmachi last night to try their Sukiyaki. We have been enjoying sukiyaki and shabu-shabu for quite some time so we were not rookies in this arena. I have to admit the ambience and interior decorations are great. Their menu is simple to follow yet pretty open with many items to choose from. Our target, SUKIYAKI. I went with Kobe Chuck and my wife with the vegetarian sukiyaki. Our raw items arrived 25mins later... yes... quite a lot knowing that they are RAW!!! Normally it should not take more than 5 mins. Quantity of food was sub-par for the money paid. Service was ok but you could tell they barely opened their doors to the public (10 servers running around, floor managers, greeters, everybody but the chef...). OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Not bad but we will stick to our favorite place in town.. SWISH!!! we have been going there for more than a year and so far the best we have tried (among 3 or 4 others we have tried in vegas). I hope this helps. Thanks! ;)'

My friends ordered the bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun and raved about eating real meat at a fast food place!The food came out fast and it appeared the staff in the back were preparing food while I was paying. So rare to be able to experience quality like this. The restaurant was also clean and tidy. It appeared to be the stomping grounds of older women who were passing time or enjoying time with their friends. I watched Jerry T take food to other customers who had limited mobility. The restaurant truly values it's customers. \n\nThe only odd thing I noticed was that the soda machine was behind the counter and you had to ask to get a refill."

S'What do you want from a noodle bar? A cheap, relaxing place to sit and enjoy your noodles while maybe chatting to a few friends? Pfft how 2009. What the cool kids want is to browse ipads while silently standing, slurping down their noodles by themselves.\n\nWaWa noodle bar is a new noodle joint that accommodates about eight people in total. The atmosphere is neutral. There aren\'t any seats either. Instead expect to eat your meal whilst browsing one of eight ipads. That\'s right, in this noodle bar, you pay not only for a bowl of noodles, but exclusive use of the the new ipad. You basically pay for the noodles and get 30 minutes ipad use included. After that you pay for extra a ipad use.\n\nI really don\'t understand. Maybe it\'s because, unlike some, I don\'t think the ipad will lead us to the promised land and I don\'t really see why I would especially come to a restaurant offering this service. It just seems gimmicky. In an interview with the Scotsman the owners said: "You find that younger people nowadays don\'t just want to eat a meal, they want to do something else too." I find that incredibly depressing. Have our attention spans decayed that much? We can\'t even enjoy the simple pleasures of a bowl of noodles with some friends? \n\nI have to give this place three stars because the staff were really friendly and the noodles were actually quite nice. I also think that despite my own reservations some people will, for some reason, think this is the best idea since penicillin.'

The fixings were standard but could have been refilled. Food was good but nothing extraordinary. My only complaint was we ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table and the fried mushrooms were not done and doughy. Probably because of the amount of things we ordered the fryer was not hot enough. \nThe BEST part of the day was the atmosphere. John, the accordion player was celebrating his birthday also.

We turned to Yelp, of course, in search of fulfilling our BBQ craving and came across this place. The locale is quite small. Service was friendly, but not the best. We had to ask for napkins and utensils after they had dropped off our food at our table. Beside the corn (which was awesome!)  I was not really impressed by anything else. I had the brisket and my sister had the pulled pork sandwich. Brisket was a little fatty, but the pork was decent. The bread becomes so soggy though that you have to eat the sandwich with your fork...which is okay with me, but only when I'm eating an open face sandwhich covered with cole slaw and tons of delicious bbq pork! I like to dig into my bbq using both hands (Mmm, finger licking good!). Not a fan of having to pick up a closed sandwhich with your fork. Will only return if Fritzi's ever closes - god forbid!"

We tried it in person and enjoyed it so much we ordered some online when we got home. That too was/is delicious. The order arrived within a few days (internationally no less!) and the breads and bagel really are awesome even when going from the freezer or frig to the oven. \n\nBest GF croissants ever and the bagel are wonderful!\n\nWhen we travel we always keep a look out for GF bakeries and try them, and during a recent trip to Montreal we were fortunate to find this Gluten Free bakery which surpasses nearly everything else we have ever tried and rivals our international favorite (Mariposa) in San Francisco."

Then I returned there as it came highly recommended. \n\nThe location is pretty bad, not because its in a bad neighborhood, just the neighborhood itself doesn't really fit the place. The little strip block where Beckers is has just a few other businesses next to it. Nobody can see it, and I think that is the reason why theyre no longer 24 hours, no longer serve breakfast, and now they will be closing on Sunday/Monday. \n\nIf I could get some people to know this place existed it may be able to make it out of what looks to be a near-closing future. Upon entering I saw the artwork of Victor Ostrovsky in the entry way, perfect lighting then more double doors greeted by a large center bar, piano on the side and a dozen or more paints by Ostrovsky above the tall back booths. \n\nWe were promptly seated and the service was perfect, quickly set with drinks, those who brought me there couldn't remember which way they liked their chocolate martini so they brought both of them to try and remember, only to find out 'the other way' was better. :)\n\nA simple dinner, and no frowning on the split orders. (wasn't too hungry) and the appetizer, stuffed mushrooms were killer and very huge! The fillet was cooked to order, topped perfectly and the sauces were on the side (always good).\n\nTheir interior was killer, the live music was perfect, the service was key and the food was great.

S'Driving south from Maricopa I couldn\'t help noticing the sign "Grilled Fish Tacos." To my surprise, I pull into the strip mall parking lot to find a dude with a gas powered burner plate. He tells me to pay for the tacos inside, so I purchase two at 3.00/ea.  I give him the receipt and he proceeds to batter two pieces of fish and adds a bunch of oil while it cooks. My first thought is this is not grilled, but fried, but I decide not to make a fuss. When it\'s done he hands me two tortillas each with a piece of fried fish the size of my pinkie finger. I go back inside the coffee shop to show the tacos to the lady at the counter. She responds by directing me to a tabletop area with some exposed condiments, and proceeds outside to reprimand her employee when it (the size/quantity of the fish) was no fault of his. Instead, it\'s the management that decides to charge 3 dollars for about 30 cents worth of food. Never meant to be lunch, but merely a snack.\n\nI\'m sure their coffee and other menu items are decent, but they should stay out of the taco business! Take my advice, if you\'re in the mood for fish tacos and have the unfortunate experience of being in the Casa Grande AZ area, ignore the sign and head further into town to Rubios or some other place that\'s known for fish tacos.'

S"So I ordered a pizza from this place a few weeks ago. It was rather late and I wasn't sure if it would let me order since it was about 10 minutes before they closed but it let me place the order online. I was excited because I was starving! I ended up getting a phone call 5 minutes later from the manager saying that I had placed the order too late and that she had to cancel the order. Dominos would have delivered it to me had I placed the original order through them, but that's beside the point. Anyway, because of the inconvenience, she offered to give me 50% off my next order as long as I called to place the order. I just tried placing the exact order but was told they couldn't honor the 50% off because my order was a special and they couldn't combine the offers. Um? That's not what the manager told me when she offered it to me. I literally placed the EXACT same order but couldn't use it. I asked what I could use it for and was told anything that wasn't a special. I told the guy I wanted the same thing as the special and asked how much it would be... It was the same price as the special. Um? What's the point in offering me 50% off if you're just going to charge me the same price as the special that ANYONE else could order. That doesn't really seem to make much sense or seem fair. I was being given 50% off because of an inconvenience you caused me. That's not my fault. You should have honored what the manager originally told me. I haven't tasted the food yet as I just placed the order so my review is based on customer service alone."

Its quick and easy, and they have a wide variety of options.\n\nThis particular location is pretty cool. The decor inside is fun and it has been very clean both times I have been.\n\nThey have veggie options and use lard free beans. I always get the veggie mondo burro and have not been disappointed at all. They are a great size with great flavor.\n\nAnother cool thing they have is an iced tea machine.

It's located just underneath Carlton hill, inside a beautiful old building. \n\nDespite the great setting the food was a bit of let down. I came here about 3 months ago and ordered the vennison stew with chocolate. Very excited to try this exotic sounding dish we were presented with food, which tasted like it had just been microwaved. Have you ever smelt meat and potatoes that have been microwaved? They have that distinct smell and taste. To add to this, the bread pudding with custard I had, although delicious to start with, was dry in the middle.\n\nThe girl serving our table was very friendly, although you could she was new on the job. She couldn't understand the order of wine we wanted and kept getting mixed up. Also it took them ages to come take our order in the first place and there weren't that many other customers. \n\nI know Howies can do a lot better and I hope this was a one-off thing. Their menu is always impressive and I hope I can write a positive update to this review in the near future."

Seriously, you would think that their entire crew is made up of all managers. Everyone (on the front line at least) are dressed in shirts and ties. Orders are quick and easy. You give 'em your name and they call it out when your food is ready. \n\nOn to the meals...I used to work at Hardee's as a teen, so I used to see what exactly a roast beef carcass looked like before it was cooked. It was not a pretty sight at all. So, I bite my tongue and order one here every once in awhile. They're actually pretty tasty. The best way to go is The French Dip. I don't like my bread toasted because I swear it scrapes the bejesus out of my lips. I don't even use that cup o' grease...I mean, the au jus. I just like the beef and swiss. Arby's sauce and horseradish are a must. Chicken sandwiches are better than Mickey D's or that horrid place called Burger King, but not as good as Wendy's or Chik Fil A. (Zaxbys is king!) Never tried their chicken fingers here.\n\nSides are either fries (pretty good), onion rings (too thick), or potato cakes (meh).\n\nDrinks are self-serve, as they should be. Their Jamocha Shakes are no longer as good as they once were. They taste more like a regular chocolate shake. Forget about the apple/cherry turnovers.

S'... Look... I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)\n\nI have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with "yinzers" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. \n\nWe have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you\'re interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a "U" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It\'s been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. \n\nThis is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the "full" size wings I\'ve had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and "tanned" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it\'s so filling and delicious we\'ve been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend\'s mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) \n\nMy dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I\'ve already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can\'t handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That\'s sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to "hangry" and was afraid I\'d lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn\'t get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn\'t asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).\n\nYes, of course I\'ll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great. The food is amazing. The prices are great. Don\'t let me down, The Huddle.'

S"You could have thought I was a child with a brand new toy last night when Darren, Mom and I stopped here for a quick bite. This is one of those revamped locations. Large flat screen TV, electric fireplace, and lounging chairs! But my greatest excitement came from the soda fountain. It is a touch screen operated dispenser. Push the button for what you want (I got diet coke), and you are given the choice of your soda alone or with one of six flavor additives. Lime, grape, orange, cherry, lemon, and raspberry! I wanted to play with each flavor, but didn't. The food quality itself honestly isn't bad for fast food. Wendy's really has improved! The burger wasn't as greasy as usual and the fries are crunchy and full of flavor! I love the sea salt! They also has a small bakery selection. Darren and I shared an Oreo brownie.

S'The place is called DESERT PEAKS now. I and 3 coworkers went yesterday for lunch. Our company relocated our office off of McKellips. We have been trying to look for a good lunch place. DESERT PEAKS has now been crossed off our list. We must have gotten the hemorrhoid waitress also. She was not attentive to our needs at all. She was more concerned on flirting for tips with her bar patrons. It took 30 min for us to receive our food. (there was only one other table for 2 seated) When she brought our food out to us she placed it in front of us and immediately turned and walked off. She did not ask if everything looked ok or if she could bring us anything else. I actually  did need sauce and cheese for my italian sausage sandwich and my friend needed ranch for her fries. I sat without touching my meal hoping she would come and check on us. The waitress never came back. After 15 minutes my friend finally got her attention to come to the table. I asked for my sauce & cheese and ranch. She took my plate. Then came back said she forgot what the other request was. We told her ranch. She brought back the ranch and my plate. My fries were now cold. One of my friends had pizza. His dough was not baked in the middle. It was very soggy and alot of grease was formed on the top from the pepperoni. It was a HORRIBLE experience. She was a crappy waitress and the food was less than average. This is coming from someone that eats lunch out 5 times a week.'

S'Sows of all ethnicities are welcome at China One!\n\nChina One is a massive Mongolian-Chinese buffet. The restaurant is never too full, in a great location, features reasonable prices and most of the offerings tempt repeatedly. \n\nThere are a couple of issues, though. The service is pedestrian and too carefree; the servers are space cadets and rarely present timely. Drink plenty of fluids ... then drink more ... the food is liberally laced of delicious MSG. As expected, the sushi is old and a health risk with every swallow greatly increases.\n\nThe review reads a little negative, but China One is a sensational guilty pleasure for its price. If you see me at the buffet line, though ... step aside and give respects.'

Don't allow any eating in the vehicle so we ate inside. I wasn't going to eat anything, however they had the BBQ pulled pork on their menu, had to try it out at least once before they are gone. Kids had chicken strips and fruit with milk. I was actually impressed with the pork sandwich, lots of flavor, and the cole slaw added some good flavor to the sandwich. Kids were good, ate everything and wanted more as usual. Service is like any other franchise, it's a catch and go.

Sat in the dining room, and it was spooky quiet; for the first half of our meal, no one else was there, there wasn't music, and the only other sounds came from the next room, which just felt odd.  Atmosphere was bad.\n\nGot the pasta roll, which was absolutely delicious; awesome pasta/pine nuts/spinach under a relatively light red cream sauce.  The salad I had was lackluster, though; wilted greens, dry shredded carrots, and a pepperoncini that was just off; it tasted bitter, which was an all-new, all-bad taste for those.  Ew.  Five star entree, two star salad, maybe.\n\nThere were two waitresses and only two tables; refills on water were pretty quick up front (several times), but we wound up hanging out for five or ten minutes after we were done eating before seeing our waitress again.\n\nTwo and a half stars?  I'd stop in and get a pasta roll for take-out, maybe, but there's a lot of competition for selling red-sauce italian food in the Italian neighborhood, ya know?"

This place is near my home and I had read some good reviews but, unfortunately, it was a disappointment.\n\nI had the open-faced turkey and mashed potatoes. The turkey was mostly dark meat - which I do not like - and it was dry. The mashed potatoes had hardened a bit, like they were left under a warming lamp. The vegetables were dry and tasteless. I ended up leaving most of the meal uneaten. It was a shame because I so love turkey and mashed potatoes.\n\nMy husband had some kind of scramble - eggs, hash browns, bacon, etc. He said it was not very good and he also left most of it uneaten.\n\nOverall, it was just a bad experience and one I will not be repeating.'

I\'ve traveled to Asia number of times, eaten a lot in San Francisco, and explored the Chinese restaurants in Phoenix for a lot of years. I have learned to expect a more "authentic" type of Chinese food--the type of place that is frequented by actual Chinese people.\n\nStill, I love these little family run places so we checked this place out, hoping for the best. I wanted to like it, but I just did not like the food. The crispy chicken chow mien noodles were the type you get out of a can or bag, not the real thing. The other items were pretty standard Chinese-American fare. Honestly, I like Panda better, and it is cheaper. My stepson loved the shrimp though--said it was the best he has had since living in the US, so your mileage may vary. \n\nOthers have enjoyed this place.

S'Taco joint in a strip shopping center. Food is good and cheap. They actually have two menus: the one for the non-Hispanics and the real one. The English menu has all the stuff you\'d expect. The real one has authentic down-home food (brush up on your Spanish, folks).\n\nI suspect they do more business from the Hispanic community than from suburban-types like us. I\'ve watched my share of soap operas I didn\'t understand while eating dinner. Great jukebox (occasionally there\'s a sing-along). Not unusual to be the only English-speaker in the place.\n\nWhile they have a bar, I\'d still call the place family-friendly. Heck, half the time the waitresses kids are playing at a back table.\n\nDownside is they "renovated" a few months back and the place lost some of it\'s "hole in the wall" charm (which may be a good thing- the jury is still out).\n\nFriendly, helpful staff (if a little language-challenged). Running joke is "I know what I ordered, but I wonder what I\'ll get?" We\'ve never felt unwelcome or had what I\'d call a bad experience.\n\nJust simple Mexican fare. Decent quality. Good prices.'

I do not go to this store anymore - after 4 years of going there at least 3 times a week, I had had enough of it.  \n\nSubway is running, apparently, at such small margins that it cannot make things right, even when they are wrong.

Well, it happened but it isn\'t going to happen anymore and hasn\'t in well over a year since I stopped going there and to any other Subways.  I have been a 15 year customer of Subway but they permanently lost my business and this particular Subway had a lot to do with it.\n\nWhatever.

Great place to be able to save enough $$$ to be able to save up for a nice meal at one of the fine restaurants inside MGM.  \n\nOther choices in the food court would almost costing you as much as just walking over to Monte Carlo and getting the brunch buffet there.\n\nThe prices are just slightly higher than normal McDonalds you would find outside of the strip.     They have a 20 piece Chicken McNuggets for only $6  (normally $4.99 at other McDonalds).\n\nThe dollar menu is pared down - but you still get a chicken sandwich for $1.  \n\nThe best deal, as stated by P.T., is the 2 apple pies for $1 -- this is the exact same price you would pay at any normal McDonalds and is great for a light snack should you become very hungry and your dinner reservation is still hours away at any of the restaurants there.'

S"Taco shits? I gotz them!\n\nOk I know its gross, but I literally got sick from the food here! FYI I'm watching the HBO Beyonce documentary and am starting to feel sick again.\n\nSooo this place is like a mini Del Taco, the drive through is usually where we go. Its like oddly placed as well. Sometimes the cashier ladies are nice, but mostly theyre not. They have your typical cheap Del Taco fare, and I always go for the fries. Today though, I was feeling like a renegade. I got a small beef taco and a chicken taco. The chicken wasnt like it normally tastes so I think that may have been the culprit.\n\nWord of advice, the drive thru has a sharp turn, so dont mess your car up!"

S'working in north scottsdale now, i thought i would explore some bars i havent been to and take in some happy hours.\n\nbrennans is a mexican sports bar. but they show more than just soccer. a decent bar area and setup of tvs all around. \n\n20oz football shaped glasses for 3.25 domestic was a little less than a preferred deal, but i do like that glass. \n\nfree chips and salsa is a plus, and pretty good. went with the hot buffalo wings. i consider them average above. not above average, but good for average wings. under 5 bucks. (im on a never ending quest to find a better hh deal/taste than zipps, not that i want to succeed at that)\n\nim debating whether to go back again to try out the other menu items since it is a mexican place and i only got wings. maybe probably someday. \n\ni think the off-track betting room scares the girls away cause i didnt see one in the entire place.\n\nthis place is okay to try if youre bored with everywhere else.'

I got a 1/2-lb. beef combo burrito, nacho cheese gordita, and a large soda.  \nThe name "beef" combo burrito is a misnomer; this thing had 1/4-lb. of sour cream in it, and the rest was refried beans.  There couldn\'t have been more than 5 little granules of ground beef in this crappy thing.\n\nMy order was $7.07 for two items and a soda.

S"I had been before on a date and bumped into some old neighbors (one being Italian was a good sign). It's really a combination of a coffee bar, nice seating area with an atrium feel and a reception room attached to the right. I recalled the food being quite tasty even compared to Italian cuisine in Italy itself. I especially remember the marinara sauce standing out as being right on the mark. It had that little tartness that I love and is hard to find done right at restaurants (in my opinion). I don't remember the service being off the hook, but it was definitely not a negative. Since those meals went well, I figured why not try again, but now with a party of four. This time the service stood out, but not in the best way (we all agreed). I was surprised, as I began to recall the previous visit having been pretty good. Thankfully, two things happened. The first was that another server helped out on a few occasions. The second the marinara sauce was just as I remembered it. The stuffed bell pepper, mini bocconcini with cherry tomato salad and Italian sausage with Dijon mustard were also very tasty and fairly priced at $3.99. The fettuccini carbonara was quite rich and creamy (a good plate to share - as we did). The Baked Lasagna was satisfying (it's bathed in 'the' marinara sauce). Last but not least was the seafood linguini (with white sauce) at $16.99 - a value, filled with fresh right sized shrimp, bay type scallops and plenty of other goodies including chopped garlic. I stated out loud - I would be back just for that stunning dish. Wrapping up a lengthy yet fun late lunch we shared a piece of red velvet layer cake and an apple torte. They were both great with lattes and cappuccinos to wash them down. We all joked that we were still full hours and even a day later. I almost forgot despite all the carbs we ate - the warm crusty Italian loaf was worth the wait. I used it to sop up the sauce on every dish. Oh, yah baby 'the' sauce."

S"Amongst the plethora of downtown restaurants that make heaps of promises to be 'the' destination for after-work eats and drinks, Vertigo is a relative newcomer. Sassed out in a spanking-new tower on the corner of University and Cathcart, complete with a mix of modern steel, aluminium and natural wood (not to mention the central spiral staircase that ascends to the clouds, er, the second floor), Vertigo claims that its steak and other eats are from 'selected' ingredients, holding at least the promise of a decent nosh. \n\nWell, decent is as far as I'd take it. Had the Steak+frites off the lunch menu, while my dining companion had the lobster salad. The steak was cooked correctly (medium-rare, pink on the inside, but hot) but the chef decided to drown the meat in salt. So, all I could taste was the salt and not much else. I understand in this day and age it's difficult to get your hands on grain-fed beef (not really), and so the meat has little taste, but really? Salt? Not much imagination there. The fries were okay, but just that. My companion's salad was bland, despite the fact that it had lobster and the croutons were tasteless. \n\nOverall, a nice vibe and a good premise - not to mention a fabulous lcoation - but the chef needs to step it up if they want to get people to keep coming back."

I should have ordered something with meat so I had at least something to compare it to but no, as I was being adventurous I got the grilled vegetables on tomato-basil. I thought it was was pretty good, but I might have preferred one of the other offerings.  I also got the potato chips.  For some reason I had it in my head that chips made right there would be thicker.  They were however devoid of any staleness you can get with bagged chips.  I will be back again to try something else.\n\nOn the way over there I was thinking this would be better on a Saturday because it is about 20 minutes in traffic each way from work.  Well, the website doesn't show it yet but they are now open Saturdays!\n\nTwo pleasant guys were working behind the counter and had several orders going at once even though I was the only one there.  I was greeted by the cook as soon as I walked in and shortly thereafter the person filling orders and such took my order.  The delivery driver was in and out a couple of times while I was there.   Being a nice day out I sat at the outside tables, there was just enough breeze and no sun on the North side of the building to make it feel much cooler than it really was.  If I had been smart I would have pulled a table and chair out in the sun like another person did while I was eating."

S"L'escargot Bleu was voted the best newcomer of the year in 2009 due to the quality of its service and the range of the ingredients used in the food.  It's contemporary French cuisine made from locally sourced Scottish ingredients.  They also sell horse meat.  Now, plenty of people think it's some kind of heinous crime to eat horse meat because they 'like horses'.   So what if they like horses?  Does that mean they'd happily eat a chicken, pig or cow because they don't like them?  Of course not, they just don't fancy the idea of eating a half-domesticated animal.  Man up!\nEverything on the menu is pretty expensive (especially the horsemeat), but I had the coq au vin which was chicken in a rich red wine sauce.  It was delicious, but cost about \xc2\xa313.  I would certainly come here again as it offers an interesting menu and great service, although the prices do match this quality."

The menu was what I expected and there were a decent number of combinations and options. Prices were pretty good. That is where the good ends though. \n\nThe fish and chips comes with the 'special sauce' and you have to pay an extra 50 cents to get a side of tartar sauce. 50 cents isn't a big deal but really what kind of fish and chips doesn't come with tartar sauce included!? That said, the tartar sauce was decent. There is only outside seating and most of the tables were pretty dirty. When our food came I was instantly turned off by the square fish pieces...it just screamed of store-bought frozen fish pieces. My buddy got the chicken tenders and they looked (and tasted) like an inferior version of the bags of tyson frozen chicken tenders you can get at most grocery stores. The special sauce was sort of a runny ketchup, it was OK but I think I would have just preferred ketchup for my fries. The fish was very bleh. Tasted like old frozen fish. The battering was OK but there was way too much salt that had been sprinkled on top...maybe to mask the old fish taste? \n\nApparently this place has a decent community following, but if you're looking for some good fish and chips I'd avoid this place like the plague. Some of the worst fish I've ever had."

S"Terrible experience! To sum up, bad service, they got order wrong, and food was cooked poorly, read on for details. \n\nOrder on a Friday night at 6:56pm (actually hung up at 6:59pm). Lady on the phone was great in telling me about specials and prices. It was all downhill from there though.\n\nI was told it would be 20-25 minutes on the phone. I was out shopping with my family so it was perfecting timing. I arrived at exactly 25 minutes. I told them my name and paid for my order at 7:24 to the same person that took it on the phone (could tell by her accent), which at that time I was told it would be another 3-4 minutes. She then walks back into the restaurant area only to be seen once going to the table of what seemed to be the only people inside. 9 minutes goes by until another server walks over to answer the phone. When she gets off, I tell her I was told it would be 3-4 minutes and it's been 10. With a bit of attitude she tells me she will go check. She comes back out and says it will be another 5 minutes. I explain how its going past 35 minutes and was told it would be 20-25 on the phone. Her response with still a bit of attitude summed up was, well we're really busy and I am not the one that told you that. \n\nNow my family is waiting in the car so, I think the heck with this and demand my money back instead. She then says she has to go find my receipt. Now the original person that took my order then comes out with the order and starts to argue about how longs it's actually been, showing me she on said receipt she put in the order at 7:02, and that I paid for it at 7:24. And that when she told me 3-4 minutes she thought i was someone else who had an order for the same amount. I show her my phone which says 7:37. (Yes over 40 minutes after I originally called) They ask whether I still want my money back. I do but I'm sure my family is hungry, so I take the food and say I hope its great, cause the service (expletive) sucks. Hindsight is 20/20, I should have took the money. The pizza I ordered was undercooked, and the wings were overcooked, which I didn't even order wings, I ordered fingers.\n\nNow most of my anger about bad service could have been avoided, if I was not left waiting 9 minutes without anyone coming back to say it would be a bit longer, or wasn't getting attitude from other person i ask to see why its taking so long."

S"There are a lot of Portugese rotisseries out there in Montreal. This one is OK. I read this is a family-run restaurant (although I did not check on that). This could explain why two of the staff members were very nice, but the other waiter was not very nice and is the main reason why I'm not that excited about the place. We had a 19-month baby with us and we asked for a baby seat, which we got -- but how come he did not offer it to us in the first place? Portions are quite generous. If you take the chicken, you get half a chicken in your plate--so you might as well ask to split it in two plates if you want to share with another person. One positive point is that they would split it for you so you don't have to worry about doing it yourself at the table. Otherwise, you can bring the leftovers at home; just ask for a box. I agree that the grilled calamari were tasty, and the house red wine was totally acceptable as well. I would not mind going back, but my first choice would be to try another place."

I later looked at the voucher and it had no expiry date and could be used any day of the week, so we decided to use it for lunch last Saturday.\n\nWhen we went in, the staff were all very friendly, i couldn't fault them at all. The menu was extensive, but as i am not a huge fan of burgers i decided upon a veggie option, the cheese veggie classic and my boyfriend had the hot habanero beef burger. As i had never been before, i didn't realise that the way it works is just like Nandos, you order and pay for your food yourself up at the till. However, the staff were still there if you needed them.\n\nOur burgers were both very tasty and good value. Make sure you are very hungry when you go, my burger consisted of two burgers in a bun. My only issue would be the apple chutney that was also in the bun, this was just the filling from an apple strudel and far too sweet. My boyfriend was also very happy with his burger. Once finished we walked out and were wished a cheery goodbye from the staff. Overall, i definitely recommend this restaurant. It is very child friendly and good for a quick bite to eat."

S'I don\'t know. In a lot of ways, it just feels like Feast is trying to hard. Maybe it\'s because of its location (in the heart of Uptown Charlotte), or maybe because it\'s adjacent to a Charlotte "club." I just get the feeling it\'s trying to be something it\'s not, or something it can\'t be. \n\nWith dance music playing in the background and a DJ spinning throughout your meal, you get the feeling you\'re in Miami or in the Meatpacking district of Manhattan. And you\'re not. The decor is too much: shiny, sparkly, flashy. And our waitstaff was composed of emo hipsters. Nothing against them, but it was just a weird dining experience. \n\nThe drinks were good (and strong), and the bar scene was pretty cool (if a little much), but the food was only so-so. There wasn\'t too much selection, and nothing our group ordered really stood out at all. You get the sense that people go there don\'t really care about the food as much as the scene, which wasn\'t how I was feeling that night (hence my pseudo disappointment). \n\nDrink enough, though, and you\'re fine.'

Service was friendly and the food was not too shabby.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  It was supposed to come with honey mustard but they brought me ranch dressing.  Whatever.  I don't care much for ranch but I was not going to argue over it.  I don't use much dressing for my chicken anyhow.  My mom ordered the pumpkin pancake combo with hash browns, eggs and bacon.  I was shocked that she finished her plate.  She tends to be a light eater.  Either the food was simply that good or she was absolutely starving.  My step dad got some other combo.  I think I saw pancakes, stuffed french toast, eggs, hash browns and toast.  A total carb fest with a splash of protien.  Whatever he got he enjoyed.  And both my mom and step-dad were happy to see butter pecan syrup on the table.  I used traditional.  I guess I'm boring that way.  When it came to settle the bill the 20% discount for being a Howard Johnson customer was not applied right away.  The staff were quick to admit the error and ready to fix it.  They were even good enough to bring the new receipt to our table having seen my step-dad hobble up to the counter with his bad knee the first time.  For this level of service, IHOP gets all the credit that is due."

Everything is clean and the service is always good, which is why I threw in the 3rd star, And the lady who owns it with her husband is always super nice.  As for the food, it's just your typical meat and potatoes type joint run by a hard working Greek family in the South.  A bit too greasy, and a bit too much butter on everything, but always served with a smile and always pretty cheap.  There are places I prefer in the area, but when my clients want to eat here, I'm cool with obliging them."

That "cheese by default" sh*t rubs me the wrong damn way. F*ck you, Wisconsin!\n\nSo, they serve up a tasty burger without cheese, and with all the standard toppings it hit the spot.

I thought GREAT, getting somethign fresh... but no...he replaced it with a basin of beefy broth and floating carrots;  then proceeded to scoop the dried out stew clumps into the new hot broth and reconstitue it. SO GROSS.\n\nI chose three chicken chunk items. all cold, all grisley all nasty. There was a huge sign warning people not to take more than they will eat, to please not waste the food. Did they ever consider maybe people took a small portion of things to try and just couldn't eat any of it, it was so foul? \n\nWho calls three colors of Jello sitting on ice a dessert buffet?\n\nDONE. And Never Ever again. Let this be your warning."

S"Impressed. Surprised. Not what it seems. I think all three of those headlines qualify...\n\nPizza-U (you guessed it, right next to Concordia) has space to eat inside, but really is built to be a take-out Pizza place. The twist? All they sell are individual-sized pizzas, cooked on a roller system similar to what you might see at Quizno's. Toppings are generous and the size seems just right - for $7-8 you get something that is right on the mark  in terms of quantity and taste. They have a variety of specialty flavors if you're into that, but I'm really only here to report that the basics - pepperoni, deluxe, hawaiian - are all present and delicious. In particular, they do a really good hawaiian which is a bit surprising given how little-seen they are on the east-coast. Food cooks pretty fast; students shouldn't have a problem eating there.\n\nThe only downsides right now? One is that it may be hard to spot. The business seems pretty new and is on the second floor above a pair of vegetarian gigs. The kitchen and staff work at the back end, so from the outside it appears empty apart from a logo poster on the window. That should probably improve with time. The other? Eat fast. The pizza is a thin crust, individually sized, so you can expect it to get cold within 20 minutes, even in the box.\n\nLong term, I think the only problem for Pizza U is a question of food-per-dollar. There's no $5 options for the students used to hitting the by-the-slice places. But if you have a couple of extra dollars to spend, this is a good lunch-time option."

S'The ballroom, as the name suggests, provides a grand atmosphere for lunch.  But the food is done by University Dining Services -- the same people that cater meetings and events so badly.  The motto could be:  "A dorm dining hall without the dorm."\n\nThe one joy of the buffet line for me is its Midwestern-ness.  I occasionally see jello salads and ambrosia unlike anything I have ever seen on the West Coast.  Miniature marshmallows!   Fruit salad with... is that mayonnaise?  The salad and dessert recipes recall the Better Homes cookbook circa 1952.  But beyond these culture shocks there is little pleasure to be found.  \n\nIt\'s expensive for the quality of the food.  The salad bar is tolerable.  The main dishes range from poor to horrible.  The sandwich bar features limp lunchmeats and tasteless bread.  If you like to snicker at such things, apparently the person who writes the buffet cards is often stumped by the exotic ingredients in some dishes.  This leads to platters marked as "White Soup," "Spring Salad" or my favorite: "Ethnic Dish."\n\nNote that the previous price listed is out of date.  It is now $8.75 for buffet, drink, and dessert.'

When I discovered that this restaurant had a sweet and sour battered tofu I was eager to give it a try. The General Tao tofu, and the a l'orange version, are absolutely fantastic; they satisfy the craving completely and are incredibly morish.\n\nBack down to Earth for a moment, I've been there five times now and the service and food constancy are extremely INconsistent. The sides seem to change depending on who cooks the food, which feels lazy rather than necessary. \n\nWait times at this location are much slower than the Atwater location, but the food tends to be just a touch better. Given the choice I'd usually choose the Atwater location; the slow, slow service at this one is just brutal, and the wait staff is remarkably inattentive. I've waited over an hour before, with no apology, explanation, reassurance, or attention (with a fairly empty house.)\n\nOverall I still go back once a week, but there is definitely room for improvement."

I'm so sorry I suggested to Anthony M and Jieun L that we have dinner here before the event. \n\nThe first thing we notice is that there is no menu on the wall and this is one of those places where you have to order at the counter. I looked over at the tables and notice that the two empty tables still had dirty dishes. I told the lady at the counter that we were eating here so she went to clean off one of the tables. It took her at least 10 minutes to come back to take our order.\n\nAs we walk over to the table she cleaned for us, I notice the cleaning solution spray bottle sitting in the middle of the table. I think she got distracted because she is trying to juggle running the restaurant and also taking care of the two little ones running around. The table in the back corner looks like their office cause it had a computer set up on there. Her two daughters are sweet, but should not be playing and running around the restaurant.\n\nAfter waiting for our food for about 30 minutes, we start to get thirsty. We ordered sodas with our food, but she didn't give us cups for the self-service fountain. We finally get our food after about 60 minutes. Not once did our server come by to apologize for the food taking so long. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Bowl. It did not taste like paradise to me...\n\nI don't think I will come back."

It was times like these I wish there were a half-star rating, because S'Bistro is better than 4 stars, but not quite 5.   I have not had food this good or attractively presented in a while.\n\nIn some ways this restaurant still feels new - although it's been open since Sept. 06.  On a Tuesday night it was just our dinner party and another on a rather barren and eerily quiet part of Downtown Mesa.\n\nThe owners were super friendly and went out fo their way to make us feel at home -- even allowing us to choose the tunes and chill our brought-in dessert in the fridge.  We scored the circular high-backed banquette booth in the back - which made us all feel real classy and shit -- as if the tuscan-paint scheme, candles and chandeliers weren't enough.  I felt they were trying to rush us in the beginning, but that seemed to wear off when it was obvious we were going to be a while.  The rest of the evening didn't feel as pushy. \n\nThe food here was spectacular.  Everything I ate was delicious, seasoned, cooked and presented with care -- all with an edible orchid on top.  The highlight among the appetizers was the portobello mushroom.  Granted all of the appetizers we tried were terrific (including the salmon cakes with dill sauce and the baked brie, garlic and blueberry compote), but the portobello was melt in your mouth tasty - arriving on a bed of sauces.   I mean - it bests any grilled portobello I have ever had.  \n\nFor dinner I couldn't help but go for the Las Cruces Spicy Chicken salad.  Tons of different flavors here- the Southwestern rub grilled chicken, spinach, vinaigrette, blue cheese, fresh strawberries, mango and pineapple completed this and I am NOT a fan of salad.  It was more delicious and filling than I expected - and a steal for $16 I thought.\n\nIt's definitely worth the drive out to Mesa, if you're considering a high-end dinner with some peace and quiet.  \n\nNote:  It's BYOB with a corkage fee because they don't have a liquor license -- yet."

I was hankering for some Thai food and decided on this restaurant as the prices seemed very good too. \n\nWe walked from our hotel which was just opposite the Portrait Gallery, and it took between 10-15 mins, which included me tackling cobbled hills in heels in the rain; but boy was the journey worth it! It was 9.40 when we arrived and we had booked our table. The waiter was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. \n\nI had the mushroom and coconut milk soup for start which was delicious; this is my favourite thai dish so it had to be had! It was wonderful, one of the best I have had. My boyfriend had the same but without the coconut milk; this was much hotter, but very nice. The waiter warned us of the heat which is good if you don't do well with hot food. \n\nFor mains I had the vegetarian thai red curry which was also very tasty, and had a good kick to it.  The boy had the vegetarian version of the dish with the oyster sauce which was AMAZING! I hadn't tried it before as I tend to stick with what I love in thai food, I would absolutely recommend this dish! \n\nA few people came in afterwards, so it was nice to have some others eating late, which is something I enjoy about eating in Europe that is missing from the UK. \n\nI would 100% recommend this restaurant. There were a few Thai eateries in the area and we were both pleased we'd picked this one. A lovely gem in a nice quiet area of Edinburgh."

The flavor of each were fine nothing to write home about, but the actually chicken wings looked more like pigeon wings. They were small, bony and had no meat on them - truly disgusting. It was hard to even look at the little nuggets of carnage laying before us on the table. I am not a person that likes to look at their food and actually see the animal it came from. We also ordered a pizza with sausage and green peppers on half. Can you say bland? There was no kick of flavor at all.\n\nThe thing I find sad is that the owners are so nice. They were very friendly just like you would expect from a Chicago-family owned pizza joint. Their desire to make it a local family pizzeria is honorable, but I don't think they can hang enough kid's sports pictures on the wall to overcome the quality of the food.

S"What an amazing event. After my fantastic first visit to Yonaka, I was so excited to see this opportunity pop up and booked my seat as soon as they were released. We arrived at noon on the dot and were pleasantly surprised to see the sake tasting that was available for us. I have to admit we spent quite a lot of time trying nearly every sake available. This alone was worth the price of admission. \n\nFinally, it was time to take our seats and indulge in a heavenly smorgasbord that was presented to us. They started slow with the chicken yakitori and shishito pepper and mushroom skewers with bonito flakes as an appetizer. Then came our amuse of lemon snow ice with frozen grapes. It was delightful and so light and subtle. Great way to tease our tastebuds for what was about to come. Next was the hamachi which was accompanied with serrano peppers and grapefruit. Nice and spicy but still very refreshing and flavorful. The scallop with melon snow ice was next and it was delicious. Very interesting and innovative dish. The fried bun was insane and blew me away for a bit. This was my second favorite course of the lunch. \n\nThere was a bit of a lull while we waited for our next servings and we took the opportunity to chat with our tablemates and get a few more tastes of sake. Finally, we took our seats again and the next course was presented. The whole Mediterranean snapper arrived at our table and everyone's eyes bulged right out of their heads. We were shocked to see a whole fish for every four people. Fantastic. The skin was spectacular and so flavorful. My favorite dish of the meal. The yucca chips were pretty addictive as well. I could eat these instead of potato chips any day.  Large portions of braised pork with egg, cashews and served with a side of rice and tempura were also served at this time. This is when the gluttony reached a peak. Just when we didn't think we could eat another bite the desserts arrived and they didn't disappoint at all. Green tea snow ice with fried milk, chocolate infused with green tea, balsamic strawberry puree, strawberry paper and milk dust. This was the perfect finale to our four hour brunch. \n\nI can't sing the praises of this event enough. It was beyond my wildest dreams and I can't wait to attend another of these now monthly meals again really soon. Thank you to everyone and Yonaka and Snow Shavery for a lunch to end all lunches."

S"I haven't been to Embo deli in a while, but thinking about their delicious wraps and sarnies makes me want to go right now. Offering a sit in option in fresh modern surroundings or take away if you're in a bit of a rush, Embo is a great place to grab breakfast, lunch or just a quick snack.\n\nThe menu is devilishly good making it hard to make a decision of what to go for. They have an excellent selection of sandwiches and wraps with so many fresh, delicious fillings to choose from. In addition to this they also offer soups, antipasti and an excellent vegetarian range including my favourite Baba Ganoush.  \n\nThe prices are reasonable and the staff have always been friendly on my visits whether I've been sitting in or taking away. An excellent choice if you're looking for a bite to eat in the area. Thumbs up!"

S"We come here on a regular basis, mainly because we can get drinks for $0.79 + tax.  But with a 10% student discount and our bank gives us money back for using our debit, about $0.65.\n\nSometimes we'll get breakfast here and their burgers are decent, some are a little overpriced, but you get a good amount of food.\n\nWe've gotten to know some of the people here and they are always friendly with excellent customer service.  \n\nReally, as far as fast food, this is about as good as it gets - excellent service, clean place (when we choose to eat in) and reasonably quick, as the food is cooked when you order and not sitting under some heating lamp growing stale.\n\nOh, and they always have ice when we need it.  I prefer the bags of ice at Carl's Jr as the chunks are bigger so the ice lasts longer than McDonald's, although the bags are $0.99 here as opposed to less at the McDonald's across the street.  Well worth the extra $0.10 to $0.15.\n\nIt's also in a great location for us, on the way home."

The interior is clean, the staff friendly, the patio could definitely use some attention but you just cannot get past the food. I also noticed that some of their wine was bad (the waitress went through several bottles before finding a good one) and they don't seem to be keeping all their wine/beer in stock as some of it was unavailable after ordering off the menu.  Overall, I give it a thumbs down based on the taste and quality of the food alone."

Now, besides all that, I had a $10 off coupon, and had just got back in town from the beach and was thinking this place had better be good because there will be no cooking in my household today.  I think this place is more of a bar than a restaurant since it's Sunday and the only 2 people here were not eating but watching football.....not a good sign but I stayed and ordered the pork chops, and hamburger steak, both came with 2 sides and a roll.  I must admit that everything was really good:\n\nPork chops-3.5 stars(a bit too much salt)\nHamburger steak-4 stars\nMac n cheese-4 stars\nGreen beans-3.5 canned\nGreens-3.5 canned(very sweet)\nRice-4 stars\n\nI did hear the server say that the cook that was there today was the best cook on staff.

S"I'm the Scott that Jules review mentions. For ~$10 dinning for lunch or dinner I'm not going to fret about not being redecorated; the focus here is on the quality of the food.\n\nFor west & Southend'ers Mynt is a welcome addition to neighborhood. It is definitely a bootstrap operation taking over the previous Allure nightclub space. As such it's still dimly lit and an open space because it does become a nightclub bar later at night. But during the day or until 8pm I can certainly recommend this as a place to get your caribbean fix. The menu is limited but I would say focussed. My green curry chicken came out freshly made, the upside of new place in need of foot traffic nothing is made ahead. The rice is indeed succulent and a nice balance to a curry chicken that is spicy and flavorful without being dominating. The sweet potato fries are notable in that I think they're panko breaded & fried. They have a slight breading you'll see in the picture with a crispness that's distinct. Another thing that references their focus on their food than the building is they plate everything for the appeal of your food when it comes out. That's something you don't find at a meat n' three price point.\n\nThe manager Delroy came out to talk and as I complimented him on the plating he showed me pictures of what they do doing their dinner entrees which are very well plated. One dish was a caribbean shrimp dish that I can not remember well enough to spell. It was unfamiliar to me so he ran into the back and brought me a sample of 3 wings in an unusual red pepper, vinegar and cumin sauce. It's not part of their lunch menu so you'll have to try it when during their happy hour wing special or at night on an entree. \n\nIn summary, the food is great, the space is a little divey, there is a reggae music in the background but you won't hear overplayed Bob Marley favorites and it sure is easier to visit than Anthony's. Parking is on West Summit Ave side."

S'OH wow! I had the meatballs appy last night - just one meatball is big enough for dinner! I don\'t know where to start raving first... the tomato sauce is (and I have to whisper this) - better than my grandma\'s! And that could get me fired from the family... Its nothing like I\'ve had here in Vegas. Its real, homemade, with the expensive tomatoes and its just right. The little dollop of real farm fresh ricotta on the side really makes it - that\'s just the little bit of sweet you need to cut the tomato sauce/meat goodness. They need to double up on that, though. Seriously - ask for double ricotta. Then there\'s the meatballs... OMG. Big as a softball, weighty but light and FLUFFY! Yes, I\'m telling you - fluffy meatballs! They melt in your mouth. I don\'t understand why something as "simple" as meatballs in red sauce can be done so poorly all over the place - but JR\'s sets the standard. I\'m surprised this place isn\'t being written up all over town in the Weekly, City Life, and RJ... its an unassuming little loungie/bar-looking place, but hiding in here is definitely (IMHO) the best Italian in Vegas. \n\nJames the bartender is awesome, too!

Since I didn\'t want the order sitting there for 30-40 minutes waiting for me, I called and asked what to do.  Mike was very helpful and said to send it through and he would see that it was ready at 6:15.  When I got there at 6:10 and asked the counter person, it was not ready yet (expected).  My people waited in the car for me.  At 6:25 when I asked her again, she asked Mike, who apparently put it aside and never started it!  I finally got it at 6:35 and we hurried to our concert.  Upon arrival and opening the food, I found that the salads had no dressing and the "special salad" had no apples, cranberries or dressing.  The chicken marsala was tasy, but dry.  The three "free" cannoli Mike included were okay, but certainly didn\'t overcome the "bad taste."

At all.\n\nPicture this: Take some WW2 nuclear ration canned spaghetti sauce, 3 types of left over hodgepodge noodles, make sure it\'s barely lukewarm and literally throw it all on top of a wood table. Insert fork and knife, a gross salad soaked in Italian and room temperature bread straight from the super market down the road and you have the recipe for my Saturday night. I didn\'t get the chance to order off the menu but I will most definitely not be coming back to test my luck.\n\nI have 3 reasons for my one star. 1) Once again, I cannot give it 0 stars. 2) The bartender was a good dude who served a quick Spotted Cow. 3) The decor was a laughable mix of a pirate ship\'s hull and a 60 year old woman\'s fake art collection.\n\nThis place is definitely the center of some universe but one that I live on and I think later on tonight, my stomach will agree with me.'

S'A perfect lunch or breakfast stop on a work day. Blue Saguaro is definitely a "workers" place - they are not open evenings and weekends and thus have no real neighborhood hangout crowd, but the atmosphere duplicates the neighborly feel admirably. Bright Mexican style painted walls take the edge off the otherwise generic mini-mall interior. A dozen or so 2 to 4 person tables are located inside and some plastic seating outside is usually ample enough to avoid waiting for a seat. \n\nThe menu is somewhat extensive for a small place like this but nothing fancy - sandwiches and a few salads; but there are some nice selections - turkey avocado, roast beef with horseradish, and a good veggies one too. And PB&J. haven\'t tried that yet - maybe next week. No grilled sandwiches. They have a selection of several bagged chips, and side orders of pasta or potato salad. Fountain drinks, bottled juices and waters, and Italian sodas with or without cream. Unfortunately the dessert selection is limited to a few sad-looking plastic-wrapped cookies and cake slices. They close at 2 or 3 PM - can\'t remember which. \n\nMornings they open at 6:00 and the coffee is almost always hot and ready. They do an assortment of coffee drinks. Breakfast fare includes bagels, bagel/egg sandwiches, and eggs with toast, although I\'ve never had the eggs other than in the bagel sandwich. \n\nOverall I don\'t recommend making a special trip to seek out Blue Saguaro, but if you are in the 16th St. and Northern area and looking for a quick and tasty breakfast or lunch in a low key non-chain spot, you\'ll probably enjoy it.'

However, it certainly rises to the challenge, and the food as well the service are excellent.  When you enter the restaurant it feels inviting and has a particularly enclosed atmosphere with a maximum capactiy of about thirty.  The tables are all quite close together and we all felt a bit crammed when I was in, but this just added to the environment.  \nI ordered the lamb bhuna with a garlic naan and plain rice which only took about ten minutes to be prepared and served.  The sauce was amazingly creamy with a good range of flavours in it, and the naan and rice were just the right size to make it a satisfying meal.  The whole thing only cost around \xc2\xa38 which was definitely value for money, and the waiters were polite and friendly \nThe Gurkha also do takeaways and deliveries on all their dishes so, if you're in the area, there's no excuse not to give them a try."

Just needed the caffeen to boost moral! Otherwise I hardly go in here unless I have to use the bathroom which cost 30P or so btw so make sure you have change on hand. Other then that really there isnt much to say about here. Gave the 2-star cause the place was clean and so are the loos.'

S'This place was a godsend (sorry to get all religious...just like the word).  Yeah, we were lost and had no idea where our hotel was.  We tramped all up and down Edinburgh (we had just arrived).  We stopped off at this coffee shop/restaurant to take a break and chill.  \n\nMainly wanted to use there FREE wifi.  But we ordered some yummy sweats, and I had an espresso--both were excellent.\n\nThe dining area was nice and stylish--a good place for a rest.\n\nThis is just what we needed (cuz I needed to take a chill pill from being grumpy).  We were able to get our bearings, and the employees here also squared us as to where we needed to go for our hotel.  Additionally, they also gave us directions to where to get an Edinburgh staple:  Fried Mars Bar (yeah baby, YEAH!).'

S"The boo found this spot! I am always excited when it comes to BBQ or soul food. (Do I say that alot? I get excited about a lot of things... lol) So we decided to give it shot. I was relieved to find out it was fairly close to us. Located in the shopping center across from the Santa Fe Station Casino where a movie theater used to be. That is now replaced by a church. The Santa Fe Mining Company is in that same shopping center, just go all the way to the back. Honestly we would have never found this place just driving by. \n\n Once we got in, we found ourselves to be the only ones there. I don't know why, but that always makes me nervous. Our server, who we came to find out is one of the owners, sat us wherever we wanted. It was actually quite nice being the only ones, meant VIP service ;). So after chatting a bit we found out that there was no BBQ due to complaints regarding the smoke from the smoker. So that left fried foods. I wasn't complaining, I never turn down an opportunity to try fried chicken. (not talking KFC here either) The fried chicken dinner - I opted for white meat which came with a boneless breast and 3 chicken wings. Not the traditional way, but I was going to give it a fair shot. It also came with two sides - I chose mac n cheese and potato salad. The chicken was pretty good. I do enjoy ripping it off the bone, but I found this easy and less time consuming. The breading on the chicken was golden, crispy and delicious! Now as for the sides it was 50/50. The mac n cheese was soooo good. Cheesy, gooey and flavorful. The potato salad was good, but not my cup of tea. I am one for a mustard potato salad and this was a very sweet potato salad. I had 3 or 4 bites and set it off to the side, while I picked up the side of mac and stuck my tongue down the inside of the cup to get the last bit of cheese out. It's so very hard to find good mac n cheese, so hold on to one that you find. I am very much used to getting a corn bread muffin or some type of biscuit with my meal, but this one came with a garlic ciabatta roll. Not bad. I liked the change up. So the ultimate kicker here for me is the desserts. I am probably the biggest peach cobbler fan EVER! I have yet to find that one that will leaving me with late night cravings, so I continue on the hunt. Lucky for me they have it as an option. Sadly not available when we were there. So of course I will be back to try it! We did get the opportunity to enjoy the banana pudding. It was delish. \n\nI left so full, my pants almost busted. I can't wait to go back and try something else, but I do hope that the complainers in this world will let us have some BBQ soon! BBQ! BBQ! BBQ!"

He was put on hold (not even on hold, they just put the phone down) for 10 minutes, all just to be told their is nothing they can do about it. They offered no compensation, no apologizes, no nothing.

S'I\'ve driven past this place numerous times and had no idea there was a Somalian restaurant in the back, off the street.  Thanks to the Levine Museum of the New South and plancharlotte.org for putting on a "Munching Tour" along Central Avenue and exposing about 20 people to new food.\nFor $10, we received a plate called "chicken suqar".  The chicken came with bread that was like crepes.  You tear off a piece and then pick up some marinated chicken and some greens with the bread and pop it in your mouth.  Really really good.\nIt was also served with a banana.  Well, I did some research and apparently this is very often served as a side dish with meal.  Knock knock.  Who\'s there?  Banana.  Banana who?\nI also didn\'t know the extent of Italian influence on Somalia and Somalian food.  I knew Italy had fought Ethiopia and lost (Italian military might has not quite been the same since the Roman empire days).  But I was completely ignorant about the Italy-Somalia history.\nThe woman who runs the restaurant told us that she came to the US about 15 years ago and couldn\'t speak English.  She always loved to cook and when you have her food, you\'ll realize that\'s a good thing for the rest of us.\nThere\'s also a little shop next to the restaurant and they sell all sorts of things like beautiful Somalian clothing, jars of dates, and toothbrushes made out of bark.  Seriously.\nWhat a great find - check it out.'

It was huge and it came with spuds ( kinda like thick cut potato chips with a great seasoning) and also I chose to get the homemade pumpkin bread. It had excellent flavor with a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon and wasn't a slice it was a chunk. My GF got one of the $3.99 specials. It was a scramble with ham, onion, mushroom, and cheese. It also came with spuds and choice of bread. I couldn't believe how much food she got for that $3.99 special. It also was very tasty.

First of all, it\'s always SUPER clean.  I love that.  Second, the staff are friendly and responsive, not to mention the fact that there\'s not a lot of staff turnover.  The staff make good choices - honestly, I\'ve been at other Subways where I\'ll say "just a little light mayo" and they layer it on in a blanket, make a big mess out of it when I ask them to remove some of it, then wrap my sandwich up with their hands a big mayo-y mess so that my sandwich and the papers it\'s wrapped in are a trainwreck.  That would never happen at this Subway.  Also, the staff will banter with each other AND with customers in a very friendly appropriate way.  Another time, I came in to buy gift cards and there was a bit of a snafu with it.

S'I finally found a spot close to work that offers some pretty decent food at a considerable value.  I got take-out from Club Sandwich today.  I received a tip from another co-worker to "call ahead" to order or I would be waiting my whole lunch break for my lunch. So me and another co-worker decided to call and place our order for pickup.  When I got there our orders were mostly done.  They have weekly specials, todays was order any original sandwich and get a cup of soup for free.  They had other daily specials advertised in the restaurant but not on their website.  I opted to get an Original Sangwich Bavarian Style.  They offer your choice of grilled local steak or free-ranged chicken, and the Bavarian comes with onions, pickles, swiss cheese and black forest mustard on a ciabatta bread.  They advertise that they also have lettuce and tomato on them but there was none on mine.  I am not sure if I had to ask for this but seems as though they forgot.  They also ran out of their soup of the day, beef tortellini, so I went with the Texas Chicken Chili.  The meal was only $6.25 plus tax.  Not a bad deal for a home style lunch.  \n\nThe sandwich was pretty tasty, just a little too much bread to steak ratio, but flavors were savory .  The soup strangely appeared to have no chicken.  In fact I proposed the opinion of my co-worker to identify the meat.  Indeed we agreed beef.  Good thing I like beef,  but not sure why they would call it chicken chili.  The chili had a lot of beans and tomatoes in it.  Not spicy, but a good flavor, yet a little oily.  All considered this is definitely a worthy choice for lunch.'

S'This cleverly named little food cart just started setting up a few days a week on John Q Hammonds Drive in our office park in Middleton (well, maybe the cart\'s in Madison city limits, but Hammonds is a short road, so if it\'s there you\'ll find it). \n\nWhile "FIBS" is a pejorative used by Wisconsinites to describe Illinois tourists, it\'s used by the owners to describe their fine Italian beef and sausage. They clearly have a sense of humor and a keen sense of what makes an incredible beef sandwich. All the sandwiches and sausages are named after famous Chicago natives and the cart is plastered with photos of the entertainment and sports legends the city has produced. \n\nI had the "Tony Bennett" beef sandwich. It was dipped in a "gravy" (basically an au jus), topped with the sweet and hot peppers I ordered, and served on a perfect, fresh Italian role with a crispy crust and a chewy inside that absorbed the gravy with perfection. The sandwich was priced fairly and perfectly sized for lunch, but when it was gone I wanted more. More. More. I wanted to eat 10 more. \n\nNext time I\'ll try a different sandwich just for fun, but I will go back to the Tony Bennett many more times. More. More.'

Vegetable dumplings taste like they are full of grass, homestyle tofu looked very old. \n\nI get that they are trying to fill the niche of guilty pleasure, fast-n-dirty Chinese food (a-la Szechuan Express in Oakland), but there is no pleasure to be found here.'

S"I came here after I got an anonymous tip from a fellow Yelper who told me to try out the brisket and ribs.  Since I never turn down unsolicited advice from strangers (I would make a good rape victim), I decided to try it out.  And I'm so glad I did.  I had the 2 meat combo with brisket and ribs and a side of fries (they're not on the menu, but they said they could make it for me) for about $15...it came out to $18 when I threw on a drink and they charged 50 cents for credit/debit.  But no matter...the brisket was delicious, just the right amount of fat and yum.  I found the ribs a little stringy, probably because they were sitting there for a while.  I would definitely recommend coming here for the lunch special (M-F 10am-2pm) and getting the brisket/side/cornbread for $5.99...that seems like a great deal.\n\nThe food is comparable to H&H Hick's BBQ Pit Stop in quality, except I guess this place is a little classier...it's located inside of a gas station (come for the gas, stay for the BBQ)."

S'I love Chick-Fil-A.  I think I love them most when they provide free food.  Even their annual calendars give you regular helpings of food that is not quite free, but it is just about as close as you get - just $5 and you get food all year long, one month after the next.  Other than that, look for new product announcements (Spicy Chicken or new ketchup packets, to name but a few).\n\nThe CFA location at Concord Mills is not the simplest location to get into (and out of), but like most locations, they are very friendly and can even be spotted coming out to refill drinks - almost unheard of at any other fast food location.  You do have to catch them at a slow time, which is unusual in this area, since the mall is always slammed, but it is great when you can get it.\n\nThe verdict?  Eat Mor.  Now.'

S"Okay, a Sonic is a Sonic, right?  Burgers, fries, shakes, etc. That's true here, but I'm sure you knew that going in. \n\nWhat I'm stumping for here is their new Premium Beef Hot Dogs. For fast food hot dogs, these dogs are pretty tasty noms. Seriously.\n\nLet's discuss my favorite: The Chicago Dog.  Sure, they offer a New York Dog, a Baja Dog, and a couple others, but the Chicago Dog is totally the one to get.  It has the requisite mustard, relish, tomato, peppers, and pickle spear, but what really makes this thing worth buying is the amazing, soft, delectable poppy-seed bun.  Y. U. M.\n\nYes, I cannot say enough good things about this gluten-laden delight of a hot dog cradle, because it's so UNLIKE the normal fare you'd get at Sonic. Crushed, mushy buns are pretty much accepted across the lines of all burger joints, but when one of those joints gets a lowly hot dog bun nailed PERFECTLY, well, then that's something.  Add to that the decently delicious ingredients (beef dog, condiments), and it's a winner for me.\n\nYes, I know Ted's is kinda the hot dog king around here, but I gotta tell you, this Chicago dog is worth a try."

S"I'm all for trying out places that have just opened. After all, they need all the help they can get to bring people in. Fortunately, Kafe 440 (despite the somewhat silly name) is a breath of fresh air as far as breakfast places go. I'm sick of the IHOPs and Denny's everywhere; I want to eat something that tastes fresh and has servers that are personable instead of tired and angry.\n\nIt's unusual to find a place that focuses solely on breakfast and lunch, especially one that closes at 2pm every day. With those kind of hours, they must be very confident about the menu. I'm glad they are, because the meal I had was great.\n\nAfter my visit today, I'll be sure to be visiting again. My friend had the Chicken Pesto Sandwich (he said it was very good). I decided on the Wine Burger, which I'm glad to say was excellent. It's not easy to find burgers cooked with high-grade beef anymore for less than eight dollars, but 440 does it. It was a little more well-done than I usually have my burgers, but the wine kicked the flavor up so it didn't taste bland at all. \n\nAlso, I've got to say that I find it hard to dislike a place that offers sweet-potato fries. I have a bit of an obsession with them. These weren't the best sweet-potato fries I've had, but they were still very good. I think the only way to improve them would be to make them a little less buttery. They were still enjoyable, though, and I recommend trying them instead of the regular fries -- it's only 50 cents more. C'mon, you can have french fries anywhere.\n\nOf course, Kafe 440 isn't the cheapest breakfast joint on earth, but you can walk away after a full meal paying about 10 bucks. Not too bad, considering that the alternatives tend to be around the same. The quality of food here surpasses most other places, and the location is nice and quiet.\n\nNo half-stars, so I'll round it up to a five, if only for the friendly service and relaxed atmosphere. Try this place out if you live in the south Tempe or Chandler area. It's certainly worth a visit."

My husband did tell me that the place was clean inside. \n\nFood - so far we have tried the Cheese Steaks, Fish and Chips and Chicken WIngs. For take out food it is really good. I especially liked the honey barbecue chicken wings, great flavor and just the right amount of sauce. Very reasonably priced. \n\nLocation - The restaurant is tucked away in Athem near Vons which is great for us since its 5 minutes away from home. If you live in Anthem you'll understand how great this is since there's not too many choices that close. \n\nIf you like Cheese Steaks I'd say give this place a try."

This was my exact scenario as I rolled through here near my lodging. The signs for the new Cheesesteak melt seemed pronmising, but upon eating the thing we find some form of steak that doesn't even compare to steakumm's in quality and a mess of white cheese folded inside. The sourdough bread was grilled nicely and the fries were crisp, but I will now have to return to the dollar menu where I belong. The extra star is for the mini-pancakes on that menu. Ten silver dollar beauties with butter and packaged syrup - how can you go wrong with that?"

S"In short: Pretty decent Pakistani food, good buffet too.  Service is sometimes not the greatest.\n\nI used to go here all the time for their lunch buffet after a night of drinking, the best cure for a hangover I have found so far.  Another plus is that it's open till pretty late, so you can always grab a quick bite.  While you are siting down for your food you can watch a selection of never ending Indian soaps.  They are just like American ones except with less of a plot and more evil twins than you can count.\n\nThe food is pretty tasty and the portions are not bad for the price.  Don't expect Indian gourmet, but more like Pakistani home cooking.  You can have a thali (main dish with accompaniment of curries) or order separate.  I love their chicken tikka masala, and the lamb or chicken kurma.  Their buffet is pretty nice too, you can find the typical south Asian dishes.  I like the food here better than most Indian restaurants cause they don't go nuts with the spices.  I think in general Pakistani food is less spicy than Indian food.\n\nI do have to note that sometimes the service is sub par, but not always.  The atmosphere is not the best, a bit rundown and weirdly lit, but I usually don't give it much head and enjoy their food."

S"Dear Jerusalem Restaurant.\n\nI love your falafel more than any other in the CLT... but there are a few things missing/going awry that, if fixed, would rocket you to a 5 star rating.\n\nFirst, let me just say that your falafel, in itself, is outstanding. Perfectly fried to a crisp outer shell, yet moist, herby, and soft steaminess await my bite inside. They are the Perfect Size. Don't change a thing.\n\nHowever... I need more veggies in my sammich. I realize you are a roll-up falafel joint, and I am coming to accept that that is the only style of falafel I will eat in Charlotte. But please, please, more tomatoes, and lettuce, and pickles, will round that mother out. Nothing makes me happier than hot, steamy, fried falafel perfectly complimented by crisp, cold tomato, and the bite of a piece of onion. Or cabbage. Red cabbage. \n\nAnd really, must the ubiquitous Huy Fong cock sauce make an appearance even here? Its a pho condiment. Its my favorite hot sauce in the world, but there are places it does not belong (rolled up in pita with fried chickpea balls and pickles, being one of them). Oily, high-heat, toasted chili sauce or super-potent chili paste is what I crave. \n\nYour hummus wasn't amazing, but was pleasing, and beautifully presented. The grape leaves were VERY good, swimming in an olive oil pool garnished with finely minced pickled lemon and (possibly) oregano. I'm making myself hungry, typing about them.\n\nI will soon be back to try your Ganoush."

S"St-Hubert serves food that's easy to please- I mean, who doesn't like chicken right? It's very conveniently located right at Place Des Festivals and always booming with tourists and locals in town for a special event or show.\n\nUnfortunately, the food is rather bland and service is lacking.\n\nTheir classic rotisserie chicken for which they are supposed to be known for is often dry (chicken skin wouldn't peel off nicely, it was all dry and stuck) and portions are extremely small. Not sure what kind of chicken they use, but if I order a quarter leg elsewhere, I see a big difference in size.\nIt's not just the chicken, but pretty much any side you get with it, you'll get very little. The equivalent of a small handful of fries, or if you want rice, looks like they use an ice cream scoop to measure it out.\n\nYes they do have unlimited cole slaw, bread and sauce - but it's only as much as they will serve you. Because service is often slow, it's a hassle to search for your waiter and they almost make you feel bad for asking more.\n\nThere are times where the service is fast, but not in a good way, and this is usually on an evening where there's a big show at Place Des Arts. The staff  is aware that many people will need to be done by a certain time, so they practically chase you out and give you the bill before you have time to ask for dessert.\n\nI wouldn't bother with dessert anyways, the fact that they have an open kitchen, you can see how the food is prepared and they use microwaves to reheat their cakes.\n\nOnce I came with my family, busy like always, they couldn't even get us proper drinks. Soda was flat and warm, the glass was colder than the drink itself.\n\nFood quality is inconsistent, portions are a joke. I never leave there feeling full or satisfied. St-Hubert is only loosely worth it if you go to an Express restaurant where the prices are slightly cheaper and you don't have to tip."

S"Absolutely the worst restaurant in town, I cannot believe it is still in business. The place is so outdated; it looked like a scene from The Shining. All I could smell when I walked in the door was cigarette smoke. When I passed the salad bar it looked like none of the food had been changed in hours, maybe even days. When we were seated the first thing I noticed was a few dead flies in the window sill and about a quarter inch of dust on all the fake plants and the window sill. All the glassware and silverware were covered in smudges and fingerprints, which is one thing if you're eating at your local East Side's but at a restaurant where the average plate is $35.00-$40.00 or more I would expect clean cutlery and dishes at the very least. When the food came several of us had ordered the New York Striploin and yet no 2 plates looked the same. Some cuts of steak were thick and short, some were thin and long, they were all cooked rare even though they were all requested at different temperatures with one being well done. One of my fellow diners had to send her salmon back twice and it still wasn't cooked thoroughly so she gave up and ate the veggies, that quite frankly tasted frozen. When we told the waitress about the undercooked meals she seemed almost offended and was defensive about the issue and reluctant to take them back. Also I should say when the food was brought back to the kitchen it came back with the meat having been re-heated and the sides all cold.  All in all I would say this restaurant was a terrible waste of money and if it weren't for the good company the evening would have been a write off too. I would not recommend going to Golf Steakhouse because it is significantly over priced and the food, d\xc3\xa9cor and atmosphere seem to have come out of a totally different era."

If the stars line up and I'm forced to eat food court dinner, I'm coming on back. \n\nFood: Mongolian Beef. Very spicy. Really sweet. Large slices of perfectly stir fried onions (vidalia?).\n\nDefinitely worth a quick cheap meal."

S"A relatively new addition to the caf\xc3\xa9s adorning Nicholson street, Bonningtons is without doubt the best sandwich bar around. With a huge range of high quality ingredients this is a must for anyone who likes create your own sandwiches. They have everything, dried meats (the serrano ham is almost as good as in Spain), sausages, bacon, about 4 or 5 different flavoured types of chicken, meatballs, ham, falafel, hummus, loads of different cheeses, olives, jalapenos, all the salad you could want and a multitude of sauces. As well as this you have about 6 or 7 different types of bread to choose from. The garlic paste is great, as are the olives with serrano ham and brie.\n\nIf you cannot make up your mind however, the owner is more than welcome to help out. As it is at the end of my road I often stop in for lunch and there have been many times I have asked for something like a club sandwich with a twist (or other requests) and 10 minutes later I have a sandwich masterpiece in my hands. If even this is too uncertain for you though, they have pre packaged sandwiches, which can all be heated if that's what you want.\n\nAs well as sandwiches they have loads of drinks, although there are no Innocent Smoothies any more they have been replaced by another brand equally as nice. Also available are nibbles, and as well as the normal crisps and chocolate bars they sell wasabi peas, a few different flavoured nuts and excellent cakes, including an awesome brownie and rocky road. \n\nThe owner is really friendly and is constantly experimenting with his ingredients, offering advice on what he likes. Currently under refurbishment now, but open again in a few days he plans to install as PS3 and Xbox so people can play whilst waiting for their food - Which other sandwich bars can you say that about. Sandwiches normally cost about \xc2\xa32.50-\xc2\xa33 but with Snapfax you can get 20% off so who can argue with a great sarnie for about 2 quid. Certainly not me"

I ordered a five piece chicken tenders with fries for $9.95 and a cup of water to share with my boyfriend. \nThey give you a pager after they ring you up to come back for your food. It didn't take too long, and when I was called, they were very nice and gave me an extra side of sauce when asked.\nThe chicken tenders were really good. The chicken wasn't dry, like I expect most chicken tenders to be, and their original sauce is good - although... I don't know what it's ingredients are. Lol."

Even standing in the line waiting it took forever for me to get my food ordered. When it was finally my turn the cashier just walks away leaving me waiting there. Then after a few minutes she decides to grace me with her presence and just take my order! How sweet of her right? Anyways I order and I wait another 10 minutes for my food. Well it must have sat there because the burger was cold and it tasted like crap to boot. Then about an hour later I felt a nasty rumbling in my stomach and had to book it to the bathroom. That was the first thing I had eaten that day so there was nothing else that could have caused that. For the burger and drink it set me back $13.00. I am sure that for some it is a good place to get a quick cheaper bite to eat in Vegas but for me it's not."

S"I've enjoyed Harajuku Kitchen's food at Stockbridge market for a while, so was excited to learn that they have recently opened a bistro and was eager to try it.\n\nInside it's streamline and minimalist. With cute and quirky little Japanese trinkets around the place, a large canvas mural on the back wall and Japanese tableware giving it character.\n\nI loved their menu. Differing from other Japanese restaurants in Edinburgh by offering some more exotic and authentic Japanese food along with Scottish/Japanese fusion dishes. From what i've read, the menu seems to be kept fresh by changing according to season/availability of the best produce available. Drinks such as Genmai Tea and Ramune Lemonade (worth ordering just for the novelty bottle) also offer a nice alternative to the ubiquitous Green Tea and Asahi. They do not serve alcohol but do have a BYOB policy, without charge.\n\nI had the Agedashi Tofu and assorted Sashimi (including the catch of the day) with Wafu Salad. The first thing I noticed were the portions. They are generous and a little more satisfying in comparison to other Japanese restaurants in town and are certainly good value. The second was the quality of the fish; fresh, perfectly prepared and complimented by crisp vegetables and a sweet, citrus dressing. Even the notoriously flavour-resistant Tofu had a tasty, smoky flavour and light texture, served in a perfectly seasoned Dashi broth. Having eaten previously from their stall at Stockbridge Market I can also vouch for their appetising Gyoza and Udon dishes.\n\nThe staff are faultless. We were greeted by the incredibly hospitable chef/owner Kaori and served by a waitress that obviously knew the menu and Japanese food in general. Overhearing a number of other customers asking questions about dishes, including customisations, which were impressively accommodated without hassle.\n\nMy only criticism would be the lack of seating. It's in a great location and has been busy the couple of times i've passed and will undoubtably grow in popularity. I don't want to lose out on a table in the future!"

The coffee was damn good, a very good flat white in fact!\n\nThe setting is also cool and very atmospheric with lots of open spaces, open plan and somewhere you could definitely take a load off for a while.

There was enough lighting on the ceiling without the need for additional lamps.\n\n\nThere are stools all around the bar that makes it look a little on the crammed side.\n\n\nI came here once before but only for a Turkish delight ice cream that ended up being real nice, my second time here l came for breakfast and there was things that are new to me that day was the first time l had a smiley face on a plate for breakfast, somehow l don't think it goes, l would have rather see black pudding or Lorne sausage on the plate than fried bread or mushrooms not forgetting the smiley face. A good caf\xc3\xa9 or eatery should promote all things Scottish, sadly these guys did not.\n\n\nThe butternut Squash is a child friendly place and good value for money it' such a shame that silly things let it down.\n\nService         4/5\nFood             3/5\nAtmosphere  3/5 \n\nMy next visit could secure a 4/5"

S"When I craving a good taco and don't want to spend an arm and a leg I check out this place. The Chips are not always the best but the salsas they bring out to the taco are fantastic especially the green avocado salsa but you have to ask for it. I ordered a vegetarian tostada it had re-fried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and fresh avocado! It was absolutely delicious. The only downside is sometimes the menu changes and the hours varies depending on how busy they are."

S'First off, they have no prices on their mailed menus or online, other than specials. And, when I called the kid who picked up was not friendly AT ALL! I decided to order the $16.99 pick 3 special, which I had a coupon for from Hungry Howies. When the rude kid gave me the total he said it was $24.+ . I asked why it was so much and he told  that the price had changed to $18.99 . I said, "well I have a non-expired coupon for $16.99." He then said, "well, the price has changed." I asked to speak to a manager. Manuel (supervisor) got on the phone. I told him I had a coupon and asked that since it was from Hungry Howies and there is no expiration date on it, will they honor it. He, at first said "no",then said "ok, that\'s fine, I\'ll go ahead and give it to you at $16.99. Not a big deal" \n\nI chose not to purchase the "deal" only because I was unsure of what they might do to my food. I did tell Manuel that the kid who I originally spoke with was rude and very unfriendly. \n\nI will no longer order pizza or any other "deal" from Hungry Howies. It was very upsetting to have to argue with staff and manager about honoring a unexpired coupon from their own company.'

When I called back to complain staff was very rude and said no one ever complains and that is what a Philly is.  She was a major bitch and has no idea what customer service is.  I hope they are out of business soon!'

S"It is amazing that I checked this place out on Yelp two hours ago and was sold by Sean M and since there have been to more reviews.  Clearly Sugarbakers is a hot spot!\n\nAnd I bet some more reviews flow cause it really is great.  A great vibe that is colorful and feel good lunchy.  Great menu with great desserts.  All fresh meats on the salads and sandwiches.  Everything has got that home made feel, well, cause it is.\n\nThey do the order then put your number on a table thing so I ended up eating my strawberry cake first while I sipped the obligatory prickly pear tea (visitor to AZ, yes, me).  15 minutes though  the lunch rush later I enjoy my super fresh Sadona Salad (chicken, cranberries, walnuts), and a little gingerbread muffin on the side. \n\nAnd all that sitting outside in the sun in the resort surroundings.  Great price for a great lunch.\n\nOh, and us reviewers aren't the only one going to this place, I waited in line for about 25 min before ordering and looking backwards, the line never tapered, so yeah, worth it, but only if you have the time."

I've never had something from this place that is bad.\n\nThe owner is a nice man who always gets you to smile. (I've worked at this mall for 2 years!) They're always friendly and will help you find something to your liking if you can't choose.\n\nI always find myself craving their pizza. :]"

S"Woooo hooo!  This time i visited it wasn't buzzing with cars, there wasn't a queue to get into the queue to the drive through.  I was able to park the car in a regular space and walk into the store.  oh my it smelt so good! Fresh donuts! oh my! lovely smell!  It has a nice fresh, clean interior and lots of seating arrangements to choose from.  The guy serving me was nice and friendly too.  Really patient with me whilst I was umming and ahhing at what ones to choose from.  I took 2 to take away and one to sit in with.  all were very delicious and i share the T/A ones with the hubby later on - YUM!"

S"Central is on everyone's way home from a night out. By everyone I mean everyone who lives in Marchmont, Bruntsfield and Morningside. It seems my world is really quite small, if you think of it. \n\nAnyway, it's standard. You've got your range of pizzas, which are actually pretty tasty for how incredibly cheap they are, your chips with cheese, chips without cheese, chips with your uniquely (and kinda bizarre) Scottish chip sauce (I really have no idea what they put in it). There's also your range of deep-fried unappetising-looking sausages and blood sausages and fish. I only say unappetising because the thought of deep-frying everything kinda gives me miniature hypochondriac heart attacks. This may be an exaggeration. They will deep-fry your pizza at request. Yes. Your pizza. I may have been living here for a while now, but I still just don't get it. \n\nThey also serve the strangest of desserts. Well, strangest I've ever encountered anyway: Scotland's best. Deep-fried Mars bars. They're a force to be reckoned with. \n\nSo, if you find you can't quite walk straight and should probably line your stomach with grease, Central is a decent, cheap option."
