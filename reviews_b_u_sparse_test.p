S"This steakhouse is a hidden secret, and is spectacular. I would recommend this steakhouse to anyone wanting fine dining at reasonable prices. This is Not a stuffy stuck up location that treats you poorly if you don't order alcohol. We had an excellent meal with great service from Steve Wilson. Thank you for an excellent meal at reasonable prices. The new york steak was excellent, as was the prime rib."

S"Oh boy. Well, the boy actually in this case, because he came up trumps in picking out a place for my birthday meal. Middle eastern food? Somewhere I have never been as I haven't yelped it yet? Oh yes, he knows me well. \n\nSo Nargile - lovely restaurant, if on the chilly side (we were seated in the window so that might have been the problem). Big buckets masquerading as wine glasses. \n\nBeing a Tuesday night, it wasn't particuarly busy read: dead when we arrived, but business was picking up by the time we left, so we had the place to ourselves. Food took a while to arrive, but what can you say when it is freshly cooked? \n\nIf you want a recommendation, then I strongly would suggest that you try the shaksuka - although the menu indicates it is lightly sauteed aubergine but really, it is chargrilled to an inch of it's life, releasing all that delicious smoky aubergine flavours that we know and love. Contrasted with a light dip and deliciously dressed onions, oh, I could have eaten it all day. Other starters sampled included the stuffed mushrooms, sauteed king prawns (with luscious plump roasted tomatoes) and the dana sogush. Not a single complaint arose from the table. I think some amongst our party might have tried to lick their plates clean. \n\nMains: I had the monkfish and prawns on tomato and olive sauce. Now, here I think Nargile fell down, as the tomato sauce was strongly at odds with the flavours of the monkfish and prawn (both beautifully cooked) - both good, but an unsuccessful match, I felt. I also snuck in some creamed spinach on the side, mainly because I love the stuff, and it didn't disappoint here. \n\nThe boy and the mother both ordered the Kuzu Kus Kus - a giant plate of cous cous and root vegetables delivered with a separate bowl of collapsing lamb on the bone and more vegetables. A success from both sides. The father tucked into a mammoth mixed kebab which he struggled to finish, such was the quantity of meat in front of him. But you have to try, don't you?\n\nFinally, although we were all groaning and trousers were a-popping, of course we had dessert. Baklava, the mallow surprise (?) and sorbet were delivered. For me and the father,  the baklava was nice but way too heavy on the almond flavours, that the 3 pieces were too much - one would have sufficed. The marshmallow dessert was a hit with the boy as was the sorbet with the mother. All washed down with fresh mint tea and a bottle of New Zealand wine (The Jive Pinot Noir, nom nom nom). \n\nNargile - I think you are great. Perhaps lose some of your western influences (like the overly strong tomato and olive sauce) - you don't need it - the rest of your food stands strong."

S"I dunno about the food here as I have not attended during normal business hours. Rather, I broke in and robbed the place as a thief in the night. You guys probably saw it on the news. Kidding...well, lying actually.\n\nInstead last year during a business trip to the valley my cousin managed to drag me to this place (he and his boys love this place) one saturday night. I flashed my Texas dl, slipped the doorlady her $20, and was mighty surprised to walk inside and hear the DJ playing some of the hottest R&B and Hip-Hop jams known to man.\n\nOT's on a saturday night is not swanky and posh as many of the spots in say Scottsdale are, so do not expect anything over the top. Rather expect a multicultural urban crowd of twentysomethings simply mingling and grooving to Musiq, Dwele, Kanye West, a good remix here and there, etc.\n\nNothing incredible on paper, but the music was pretty damn good."

The food is all very very fresh and yummy. A more simple, basic menu than Sushi Palace, but somethings tasted fresher in my opinion. Just different, but excellent. \n\nBut another perk about this place, is that the seating/atmosphere is nicer, with the booths, AND its a BYOB, or for me, Bring Your Own Sake, which means serious savings. \n\nWe had a great time, and will very much return if we want sushi. This and Sushi Palace are now my favorites in Montreal."

S"Loved attending LuckyRice Night Market!  My brother-in-law's been wanting to attend a LuckyRice Night Market event for a few years and was really excited that it came to Vegas.  We bought tickets via TicketMaster (love the new Passbook feature for the iPhone!) and were ready to go!\n\nWe arrived just after 8 PM and the entrance didn't have the scanner for Passbook, so a young man was kind enough to escort us to another entrance.  On the way there, we were offered drinks:  Snake in a Glass and Lemongrass and Elderflower Collins.  I really enjoyed the freshness and subtle floweriness of the Lemongrass and Elderflower Collins.  My sister said the Snake in a Glass was her favorite of the two - not overly sweet with just a bit of a bite.  BOMBAY SAPPHIRE EAST GIN was well represented!\n\nOnce we got scanned in we walked around a bit, and decided to try the White Chocolate Curry from POPPY DEN.  I was going to wait because I thought it was a desert, but they encouraged me to give it a try and I'm so glad I did!  It was still warm and had a layer of flavors that added a nice complexity to the dish.  I was especially happy to discover that POPPY DEN is in Tivoli Village, so it's now on my list of places to try.\n\nWe then moved down the Boulevard to try RENE ORTIZ + LAURA SAWICKI'S Angry Bear Prawn with peppers, soy beans, daikon radish and caramelized garlic.  Nice!  Anytime you add caramelized garlic...\n\nNext up, Tuk Tuk's steamed snapper w/ lemongrass.  I now have a reason to visit Austin. Ser-i-ous-ly.\n\nWe headed back downstairs and ASAHI was serving a Kuronama Black - I thought it would be heavy and was pleasantly surprised.  And I got an Asahi t-shirt - yeah!\n\nNext - of course we tried the Bordeaux wines.  They had a nice selection of whites and a Sauternes that I saved for later in the evening (pretty little dessert wine).\n\nHave you ever had a short rib gyoza?  Me neither.  Until we tried it at STK's booth and it was served with wasabi sesame ponzu.  I need more.\n\nAnother great local place - CHADA THAI serving two items:  an artistically created, delicate spring roll and crab curry with noodles.  Sigh.  And guess what???  They serve a lunch with a wine tasting.  Oh yes.  We're definitely doing THAT.\n\nThanks to our Boston friend, KRISTEN KISH (Menton, Boston), for serving lobster with melon, celery and smoked  (yes!) brioche.  And yes, I grabbed a glass of CHAMPAGNE NICOLAS FEUILLATTE to pair with the lobster.  My husband tried the rose and I tried the brut.  Both were nice, but I have to say I preferred the rose.\n\nAnd then there was a woman walking around with cones full of seasoned pork chicharones.  They were really tasty - crunchy with a nice chili-like flavor (ends up it was curry).  Back at the booth they were serving...sea urchin.  Go big or go home.  It was so delicate and so delicious, with a slight smoky flavor.  I had no idea WICKED SPOON was below the Boulevard Pool at the Cosmopolitan.  Yes, another local joint to put on our list!\n\nOf course, we had to wait in line for Endo's famous pork cheeks and chicken on a skewer.  Endo was so accommodating and his food is 'da bomb!  If you haven't been, imagine small plates of a nice variety of meats and veggies, great selection of fresh fish (love the sushi salad).  Must go to try the absolute best grilled tomatoes you've ever had.  Seriously.\n\nWe then headed straight to the bar to try an Eastern Promise & a Professor Plum, which was a lovely lavender.\n\nOver on the south side of the Boulevard we decided to try the sirloin wrapped in cabbage with garlic and fresh cilantro by LEAH COHEN (Pig & Khao, NYC).  The sirloin was tender and tasty, and the cabbage smelled like cabbage.  Lol - the garlic is always appreciated, and the fresh cilantro really freshened it up.\n\nI saw someone walking around with popsicles, and sure enough it was THE NEAPOLITAN serving a variety of adult frozen goodness.  I snagged a watermelon popsicle - it had a dusting of salted chili powder and bits of cucumber.  Refreshing!  Love the Neapolitan!\n\nWe wrapped it up with a barbecue pork taco and a salt air margarita (way to go Jose Andres!) from CHINA POBLANO (Eric Suniga).  Tasty, savory, pork in a soft, pliable wrap.  The margarita was so much fun!  Think margarita with a briney foam on top.\n\nOk, I did try one more tempting drink.  Drunken noodles.  This is the most clever drink I've had, and definitely the most fun (tough competition).  Imagine japanese gelatin flavored and shaped to look like noodles and an egg.  You got it!  A drink that looked like a ramen dish - how cool is that???  There were sweetened, crunchy pineapple bits on top, and the gummy-like fun shapes were slightly sweet.  This was a dangerous, oh-so-good concoction.\n\nWe didn't try everything (we were so stuffed) and definitely felt the experience was well worth it.  We are excited to try LUCKYRICE NIGHT MARKET at the Ferry Building in San Francisco next year and then again in our hometown, Vegas Baby!\n\nExcellent evening!"

Whenever I go I  either have the tuna salad or chicken pesto pasta with red onion - the latter is delicious but the former is better for the hips. The wine is always freezing, which I absolutely love and the staff are friendly.\n\nSo, I assumed that all branches of this restaurant would be the same! But I'm sad to report this particular branch wasn't so great. The staff barely noticed my table and took about 25 minutes to take a drink order. I wouldn't mind, but the restaurant was dead. Their wine, which is usually freezing, was quite warm and the food was burnt. I was really disappointed in the Queensferry overall experience, but it didn't put me off Pizza Express in general."

S"L'Amore D'Italia is a nice family run Italian restaurant. During the week it is great for a romantic dinner for two, the service is friendly and the food is delicious. I enjoyed some nice pepperoni, sausage type pasta here. \n\nHowever. Do not make the same mistake myself and my newly single friend made, and go on the weekend. It turns out on a Friday and Saturday this restaurant turns into some sort of party restaurant. Random, I know. I didn't know restaurants did this, but evidently they do. So it wasn't so much a nice quiet meal, as more of a shouting to each other while the hen/stag/birthday parties around us partied away and sang along to the loud music. It was really quite a surreal experience, I haven't experienced partying while eating a meal before while my company sits almost in tears (over her break up, not the restaurant). \n\nBest done during the week."

S'I am a long time customer of both Laredo\'s and Mi Cocina (Cocina Real) in Middleton (they have the same owners). I went out for dinner last night at the Hilldale branch and had a very bad experience. I was dismayed because it was so atypical to what I usually experience when I visit Laredos.\n\nThe Good:\nThe host, Jesus, was pleasant and friendly! He did an excellent job of seating us and bringing us our chips and salsa. He provided great service and had an awesome attitude. Unfortunately, this is where the good part of my visit ends. \n\nThe Bad:\nOur server, in stark contrast to Jesus, was quite disappointing. First of all, he screwed up my drink order, bringing me a blended Margarita instead of one on the rocks as I had ordered. When I politely sent my drink back, he had a bad attitude about it. The replacement Margarita that he gave me tasted as though it had no alcohol in in. I would not be surprised if this was his way of "getting back at me". This alone really wasn\'t all that big of a deal and I wouldn\'t be writing except for what happened next. My dining partner ordered a steak taco salad. He was brought a taco salad with scallops. We told our waiter about the mistake and asked for a steak taco salad. He the proceeded to ARGUE  with us and said that we did order scallops. My companion is actually allergic to seafood, and I can assure you he did not order scallops. The correct salad was eventually brought to us after about 30 minutes, but not after our waiter basically abandoned our table. He stopped refilling our waters, and he never brought us the refill of chips and salsa we requested. And Lord knows what they did to the taco salad. I actually can\'t believe my companion was brave enough to eat it. We did not leave a tip. Unfortunately, I did not catch the waiter\'s name, but I wrote an explanation on our receipt as to why there was no tip given. For the record, I generally give 15-20% for average service, and 25% for excellent service. I was just so irked that this waiter ruined our dinner that I couldn\'t reward him. Finally, the food wasn\'t up to par. I feel like they\'ve cheapened the quality of their food of late. I might as well have gone to Taco Bell. \n\nI am not sure that I will return to any Laredo\'s establishment for quite a long time, if at all.'

S"I've been here twice now and I'm sure I'll go back.  People have written about the service being horrible, which I can understand.  I would not say that I've gotten horrible service, just that it's been a little slow and that the first time we had to be a little assertive about getting a table.  We walked in and were standing right at the front of the restaurant, clearly waiting to be served (they have neither a Seat Yourself nor a Please Wait For the Hostess sign).  A couple of the waitresses looked me dead in the eye and then ignored me anyways.  Finally, I walked up and asked one of them about getting a table on the patio, and we did, and we ordered, and I ran to the dep across the street, and we had a great meal.\n\nThe second time, service was much better.  We went at lunch in a group of 6, and they seated and served us quickly.  They're not very good at getting everyone's food out at the same time, it would seem, but it was still good.  I like that it's byob, and I like that it's Thai.  I wish they had yellow curry, but I will keep looking around the city for that.\n\nLastly, a word to the wise: the chicken is not white meat chicken.  I don't know about other meats, but I was surprised that in a full-priced meal they served all dark meat chicken, some of which had sketchiness and gristle.  I don't know if this is a Canadian thing, a Montreal thing, a Bato Thai thing, or what, but I do know that I'm not used to getting all dark meat chicken in a full-priced dinner.  Because of this, I ordered a vegetarian dish the second time, and it was delicious."

S'I\'m tempted to wonder why there are only 3 reviews for this place, and why it always seems to get passed up as people walk down carson street in search of exactly what The Real McCoy claims to serve, but then I remember that I\'m part of the problem - the same kind person who walks by every time he wanders down East Carson looking for good food at a reasonable price, and simply says "huh, look at that" as I walk past.\n\nWell today I figured while I take a break from looking for modern furniture that is way out of my price range that I would finally stop in. The menu is simple: about 8 sandwiches, halves are $3(some are $3.15), wholes are $6(some are $6.30 or so). Extra onions, extra peppers, extra dressing is an extra $0.10 per half each. On the wall there are what appear to be artist renditions of what the sandwiches might look like. \n\nThe lady behind the counter took my order and had it ready in a few minutes. She fumbled around trying to fit all of the onions and peppers snug in the cheese sandwich, claiming she hates nothing more than when she gets a sandwich home and has to rebuild it. I paid my $3.21 in cash and left her the rest of the $5 because she was so friendly, she thanked me profusely.\n\nThe sandwich was awesome, the bread and the peppers were perfect, and the onions were thin exactly the way it should be. Despite her best efforts, things eventually did fall out of the bottom of the sandwich, but it wasn\'t too bad.\n\nI almost took off a star because I asked for mayo and they had only miracle whip... But I\'m not going to be the one to ruin the streak. Also, someone donate a table and some folding chairs to this place.'

WTH?  \n\nStir fried chicken and green beans - flavorless. The only saving grace was that I requested for chili paste and dumped the whole dish full to add flavor.  They had this brown sauce on it that had NO flavor.\n\nSea bass on sizzling platter - they poured on a hoisin like/brown sauce with ginger slivers on the fish on a fajita plate.  \n\nThe waitstaff are Chinese and I was told that the cooks are Cantonese.  I want to know where they learned to cook?  This food wouldn't fly in the Bay Area - calling themselves an Asian Bistro.... Pul-lease!!! \n\nThis is NOT Chinese food.

S"Caffe e Cucina is one of those places I tend to forget about, but then I remember and visit again and decide I'll *definitely* come more often, until I forget.\n\nI've never been for dinner, but it's a fantastic lunch spot.\n\nI say this primarily because it is incredible value.  If you go for a sit-down lunch in town, you expect to pay almost as much as if it were dinner.  Maybe about \xc2\xa310/head for something hot.  \nAt Caffe e Cucina you can get a gorgeous warm sandwich or a fabulous pasta for about \xc2\xa37.  \nLast time we were in, I got the soup of the day and bruschetta (four huge pieces with cheese, walnuts, and something red and leafy) for a total of about \xc2\xa38.50 and couldn't hope to finish it all.  \n\nNot just incredible value, the staff is lovely and the food is good.  It's simple and well done with what certainly tastes like quality ingredients.  \n\nMy only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the salt.  My soup and bruschetta were both heavily salted - you could see the layer of salt on the bruschetta - beyond my normal taste.  I don't tend to use much salt and would much rather add it myself.  Having said this, I understand the desire to get the right amount of seasoning on a dish so the diner doesn't think the food served is bland, I just found the salt heavy handed this time."

We were then seated at a table in the very back directly across from the bathrooms...appetizing!  In all fairness she asked if that was ok but we were hungry and had our infant with us so we said ok- the point here is that there shouldn't be a table there to begin with! \n\nTook 10 min to get greeted and 20 min for our food.  Although busy, the allure of a diner is the quick service and cheap prices- which were NOT cheap!  It was nearly $9 for an omelet with any cheese and 2 choices of veggies or meat.  Each additional option was 50 cents.  If you wanted a western it was nearly $10! I think this is a lot compare to other diners like Toms in dormont.  \n\nAfter waiting for what felt like forever, the food was really good.

S"Where to go on a Saturday night, when you are craving some good steak, but Outback is played out, wallet's too thin for Morton's or Ruth's Chris, and the line at Texas Roadhouse is out the door?\n\nLogan's Steakhouse at the Chandler Fashion Center. \n\nI'd never been here before, though it's just a few minutes from my house, but I'm glad we gave it a shot, after driving all the way to Texas Roadhouse (TR) in Gilbert only to learn we'd have to wait at least 50 minutes to be seated. \n\nVery similar to TR (or exactly like it), the place is covered in peanut shells, and there are buckets of peanuts at every table. However, unlike TR, the place was slow, and we were seated immediately. \n\nFirst the service... The wait staff was very friendly and attentive, our glasses were always full, and our server came by to check on us regularly. I don't think I can say the same about the kitchen staff. Not sure where the communication or the process might have broken down, but it took ridiculously long for us to get our meals, though our salads came out immediately. \n\nAs for the food... The salads were alright. nothing to write home about. We just got the side salad (house salad comprised of iceberg and romaine, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, shredded carrots, and some onions). Italian dressing for me, Balsamic Vinaigrette for the boyfriend.\n\nWhen we finally got our food, it was darn good though! I ordered the 6 oz. filet mignon, medium well, with a grilled vegetable skewer. The  boyfriend ordered the sirloin with the veggie and shrimp skewers, and a baked sweet potato. We both really enjoyed the meals. The steaks were perfection. The vegetables could have used a tad LESS seasoning/salt, but still tasty.\n\nWe wrestled with the impulse to order their little Nutter Butter dessert -a mini version of their peanut bucket, full of chocolate mousse, fudge and nutter butter filling topped with whipped cream. It's only $1.99 and TINY. But we didn't order it... ya know, we're watching our figures.\n\nThe manager and our server seemed to have noticed that our order took abnormally long to come out of the kitchen, and we were comped 50% off our entire bill. We still tipped our server on the full price of the meal, as it was certainly no fault of hers, and her service was great!\n\nThe food was great, the service was great, and I honestly think the issue with the delay in getting our food was an isolated incident, not the norm. We'll definitely eat there again."

S'I consider myself truly lucky to live in Arizona, where good Mexican food is very easy to find. Their are a plethora of Mexican fast food places everywhere you look in the Valley, and most of them are miles ahead of any "Mexican" fare you could find in other parts of the country. Alfonso\'s is a solid choice.\n\nOk, you will not be wowed by the decor or the ambiance. But you will be satisfied with the food. On this visit, I went with the California burrito and was feeling particularly gluttonous so I added three rolled tacos with guacamole.\n\nThe California Burritto was spot on - a FRESH flour tortilla, succulent cuts of carne adasa, veggies, sour cream, and of course - french fries. As someone who grew up in Southern California, I can say that these are up to par with the California burritos I enjoyed in my youth. The rolled tacos were also very good, with a heaping serving of guacamole and cheese.\n\nIf I had any complaints, they would be:\n\n1. They are a touch higher than average when it comes to price. ($3.95 for 3 rolled tacos?) With ice tea, lunch was $13. Not crazy expensive, but a bit more that what I\'m used to paying for comparable fare.\n\n2. They don\'t have a salsa bar. They have two varieties - green and red - which they will give you at the counter, but I like trying the different flavors and taking advantage of the jalapenos and spicy carrots that other places offer.\n\nNot huge complaints. Service is friendly and efficient. Free iced tea refills. The food here is solid and I will probably be back.\n\nEnjoy!!'

What can I expect about the food here?\n\nService here was the trouble itself. \nWe,7, ordered bunch of steaks and lobsters.  Food came out pretty late.  That was fine cause we were sorta big group in this neighbor. \n\nBtw how can we eat lobster without cracker? Kidding me? Waiteress brought the cracker almost when we finished. And ordered the rentil soup. Of course she forgot the soup. My dad got the soup when everyone else almost finished the soup.  How lame. \n\nBread.. How come they don\'t serve free bread with butter before the meal? Isnt it the best part of the dinner? Oh they did.  They served the bread for other table, not for us.  I asked gently why we didnt get the bread.  She(vic?) explained i\'m supposed to ask manager to get bread.  Kidding me? I didnt even know they serve the bread before i saw the other table. How the hell i know they serve the bread? Isnt it supposed for them to ask customers whether they want bread or not?? Well, She asked me if i want bread when i\'m about to ask the check. I said "fxx you" in my mind. \n\nOrdered kids meal for my nephew and niece.  They were cream pasta and chicken finger.  They were obviously worst kids menu ever.  Pasta tasted like hmmm. Can\'t even describe it. Chicken finger was very moosh. Btw, Where was the crayon for waiting ?? \n\nshe totally ruined my trip to montreal and would never come back here.'

S"Trapped in Arizona Mills during a drawn-out shopping experience, I had no choice but to make a beeline to the Food Court for some long-overdue sustenance. I chose Suki Hana because I wanted something with seafood in it, and they offer shrimp stir-fry along with other entrees.\n\nI was mistakenly under the impression that since this was Japanese cuisine, it was less likely to be greasy than Chinese fast food. Not only is the food a bit on the oily side, but the chicken stir-fry dish contains chicken meat that should've been trimmed better of the tendons, fat, and connective tissue. I spent some time pulling apart the chicken to remove the largely inedible parts.\n\nIt's not the most unappetizing fast-food experience I've had. The food here satisfied my hunger pangs and kept me going so that I could complete the endless march to traverse the Arizona Mills rotunda (honestly... they could've added one central corridor to avoid having to complete the entire circuit every time). However, if you need a change of pace and some greasy chicken with noodles and rice, you've found your Food Court vendor here."

S'Advertising at Costco really does work apparently.  After a quick run to Costco on a Friday night, I pass by the "Restaurant of the Month" advertisement by the exit door.  A sushi place is being advertised...something about happy hours, live uni, etc.  I grab a brochure/menu and peruse it as we drive off.  \n\nMe: "They offer live uni here..."\nThe BF: "Really? Do you think they have any left?"\nMe: "I\'ll call and find out!"\n\nUnfortunately, they only had one left that day and we had a feeling we wouldn\'t get there in time.  Nonetheless, we decided to swing by for their late night happy hour, from 10 pm to 1 am.\n\nLocated in the Village Square right next to the movie theater, we see a large fish tank and ample seating with the sushi bar along the far back.  We sit up at the bar and notice their huge kitchen space back there.\n\nThe waitress gives us the happy hour menu, which is a bit different from their regular menu.  On this menu though, everything is "Buy one get another one free."  This can be a good and bad thing.  Great for things like nigiri and such, but not so good with the big rolls.  With only the BF and I dining, ordering rolls wasn\'t a huge priority.  We were disappointed to hear they were out of hirame ($4.75/pr) and tai ($4.50/pr).  ("It\'s late Friday night!" claimed Jason, the sushi chef.)  But we did have a couple of orders of albacore ($4.50/pr) and ikura ($5/pr).  The albacore was smooth and fresh.  And the ikura had a decent about of eggs in there.  They also offer o-toro sashimi here too, which is the fattier more expensive toro, for about $28, I think.\n\nWe did go for one roll - the Spicy Scallop Roll ($6.25), which was surprisingly really good.  I really liked the crab and scallop mixture in the roll.  They split up their roll selection into four main groups - Beginners Sushi Rolls with nothing raw in it, the Low Carb Roll with no rice, Crispy Fried Rolls, and Advanced Sushi Lover Rolls.\n\nThey do start you off with a some edamame, which was complimentary.  Tea was $1.50/pp, so it\'s good to know that.  They were indeed out of live uni ($18), but it\'s good to know they do have it regularly on a limited amount though.  They also offer a 3 course lobster dinner that starts with lobster miso soup, lobster your way - sashimi style even if you want, and dessert, I think.  The chef brought our their live amaebi and live lobster so we could see, so that\'s on the plan the next time we go.  \n\nSummer hours are 11:30 am to 2 am now.  They offer two happy hours: 3 pm to 6 pm and 10 pm to 1am everyday.  Sake is also included in the happy hour specials.\n\nLunchtime combo plates from 11:30 am to 3:30 pm include a two item for $8.97 or a three item for $9.97, which includes rice and miso soup or mix green salad.  \n\nOverall, we\'re definitely curious about their other dishes, especially the live uni and lobster dinner.  (This can up their star status too.)  Happy hours are a great pick when you go with a large group, so you can taste a variety of their rolls without having to eat all of it yourself.  Definitely go back with a large group.\n\nUpdated! 09/04/07 - I went back last Friday and had their live uni!  So delicious and fresh!  Oh so good!  Their Yum Yum Scallop Roll was pretty good too - I like their scallops there for some reason.  We also snacked on the Salmon Skin Hand Roll too and tried some of their o-toro sashimi.  And those who know their sushi KNOW o-toro is special.  It\'s smooth and fatty and oh so good!  I also got to see their live lobster served five ways.  It\'s all presented on one dish and definitely looks like a special meal.  I moved their star status to a 4!\n\nUpdate! 10/29/07 - The BF and I are in the neighborhood and are craving live uni.  We already had dinner and were holding dessert (dark chocolate peppermint milkshakes from Cold Stone Creamery) when we walk up to the sushi bar to see if they have any on hand.  They do!  Yes, we had to pull up a seat and have an order of live uni.  Oh my gawd...so good!  We got a fatty one too! \n\n(I added some pics of the live uni in their business profile!)'

S'I\'ll be blunt with this review: I absolutely cannot stand this Domino\'s. I don\'t even mean in terms of the pizza itself. Sure, the pizza isn\'t exactly GREAT, but I don\'t think it\'s particularly bad either. Not fabulous, but ok enough for someone like me.\n\nSo with that in mind, my problem with this location has relatively little to do with their pizza and everything to do with my office\'s universal experiences as customers. Firstly, every month, my coworkers and I order from them for a monthly work event, and almost every time we call they insist that we\'re outside of their delivery range. When this happens we have to tell them that they do in fact deliver to us on a regular basis, and that we\'re located fairly close to them.\n\nThen yesterday, after happily skipping this usual discussion our office was shocked to find ourselves waiting for over TWO HOURS for our pizzas to arrive. We don\'t expect things to get to us immediately after ordering, which is why we\'ve always called in a while before lunch to place our order each month, but over two hours?! And each time we called they\'d just tell us that it was on its way and it would be there soon.\n\nWhen the pizza finally did arrive some poor woman told us she wasn\'t even working that day and they called her in. I felt bad for her, but then found myself feeling dumbfounded when she asked us at the front of our building, "Do you need me to bring these pizzas up to your office?" Well, yes - considering how hot the boxes were, how many we ordered, and the fact that we needed the Dominos delivery bag to take care of these issues...\n\nI don\'t think we were even comped in any way for the trouble we went through, either (and believe me, we called to complain. Repeatedly.). I say don\'t order from these guys unless you really, really have too. Like I said, I love me some pizza, even when it isn\'t fabulous pizza - but when your service lacks this much, even my patience will reach its limits.'

S"This location also has Pizza Pit pizza and ice cream.  They seem to make Pizza Pit pizza if it's a thin-crust order or Pizza Extreme if it's a stuffed-pizza order.  Pizza Pit were a big deal in Madison pizza around 15 years ago.  Then it almost completely disappeared around 1999-2000... when Pizza Extreme and Papa John's came to town.  Pizza Pit has a tasty sauce and distinctive crust.  The toppings and cheese are pretty decent quality.  Pizza Extreme's stuffed pizza is pretty good too.  And it's nice to get them by the slice.  I haven't tried the ice cream or the sandwiches, but it's nice to have that... it sort of rounds out that shopping center.  Chinese food, pizza, sandwiches, and ice cream."

S'Best Boston Market I have been to. No question.\n\nBoston is normally a 2-4 star price-performance selection in my book. This one is a solid 4. I bump this one up to a 5 (which I normally never give a franchise) because of spectacular service.\n\nScore: I don\'t really score franchises by menu item. If it\'s a franchise - you probably like some items or you don\'t. Suffice it to say the half-chicken all dark and sides here are all solid 4 stars to me. Everything has been a 3+ here graded for Boston\'s expected quality.\n\nDetails: What makes this place a 5-star to me?\n\nI rolled through here right after landing in town one day to grab some food for the Fam. Low and behold - they were out of everything I wanted. I arrived just between food-rotation shifts. Durn bad luck.\n\nThe lady running the place mentioned they still had extra of a few items I normally never sample at a Boston (like Meatloaf, and some sides I don\'t get). Asked if I wanted to try them and I said "no", and plus, I couldn\'t wait. So what does she do?\n\nShe hooked me up for FREE!. She had me try the meatloaf and something else....on the house. She even offered the sides on the house (I think they were changing them out anyway). I insisted on at least paying for the sides. I just can\'t justify taking food and not paying for some portion at a place I won\'t do regular business at. I hope this review doesn\'t get the manager in trouble.\n\nSuffice it to say everything was great. My local family members go there often, and I look forward to heading back again next time I\'m in Chandler.\n\nUpdate: I have returned since I wrote this, and still found the service at this Boston\'s to be *excellent*'

S'I am sorry but this restaurant/bar has TERRIBLE food.  I went in for lunch on a Monday at noon and we were the only diners.  One customer came in while we were eating...that should have been a sign.\n\nI ordered a "homemade" pizza.  The diameter was about 4.5 inches and it tasted exactly like the frozen Tottino\'s pizzas that cost one dollar at the grocery store. The sausage was the frozen kind that is really small, and the cheese was definitely from a terrible frozen bag. And, it was $8!   My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and did not have one good word to say about it as well.  \n\nWe also waited 20 minutes for our food, which was surprising considering we were the only patrons.  The bartender was incredibly nice and accommodating, but nothing could help the slow kitchen and bad food on this day.  \n\nI would highly recommend avoiding the Sunset Grill if possible.  If you are in Deforest, then go to A&W.  Yuck.'

S'Worst Port of Subs Ever! The meat was not even thick enough to make it from the slicer down to the sandwich. Then they threw on the toppings like it was a game of ultimate frisbee. Then they cut the sandwich on the wrapping tearing it prior to throwing it in a bag. By the time we arrived at our destination we had to try and piece together our sandwich so we could eat it. Just a lot of cost cutting that sacrificed the quality of the product. This area already has a severe lack of food options, I am sad that I cannot frequent this place in the future.'

S"When you think about it, all sandwich shops are pretty much the same when it comes to menu - theres always a selection of baguettes and paninni's as well as the same selection of fillings. So really what you need is something else to make yourself stand out. Sandwich Express fills this requirement with some amazing furniture - which doesnt sound loike much but it makes a real difference from crappy placsic chairs you get in some other places like this. The result of the chunky wooden furniture is that I would more than happily come and spend a vast proportion of the day sat here eating my somewhat better than average sandwich."

S'FIRST OFF:  I am not reviewing the food.  I have gone to Chandelier about 15 times and never eaten anything more than naan (which is good).\n\nThe location is great for people who live in Silverado Ranch/Henderson area.  St. Rose and Eastern is easy to find.  One tip:  if you prefer a more laid back atmosphere, any night but Friday will be good for you.  Friday night is DJ night and the place turns into a pseudo-club.\n\nAs I previously stated, I have been to Chandelier about 15 times and have been going on a pretty regular basis.  I go to smoke hookah, which is priced at $15 for the first bowl, $10 for each subsequent one.  They are very friendly about what flavor you\'d like and are very attentive when you need a new coal/bowl.  Their hookahs smoke well and are not overly large (like some other places).\n\nThey have a restaurant area in the front with booth/table seating and a "lounge" area in the back with 5 "areas" for you to sit and smoke hookah at.  They only like to allow 21+ in the lounge.  We prefer the lounge as the lighting is dim, the booths are comfortable, and the atmosphere is relaxing.\n\nThe drinks they make are fairly priced and are not weak at all, which is good.  They will often "buy" some of your drinks for you if you are a frequent customer or order lots of drinks/hookah.\n\nSure, you can find cheaper hookah (the Olive) or fancier hookah (Almaza), but I review this place highly because it is the kind of place that will reward frequent customers.  They will establish a first-name-basis relationship with their clientele and make them feel welcome.  In this city, that is sometimes hard to come by.'

S'Machu Picchu actually serves Peruvian food.  Something I don\'t think that I\'ve ever had.  I don\'t know that there\'s anything really odd about it, though it does sound a bit intimidating.\n\nI can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve driven past this place, but it\'s been a long time since I\'ve been inside.  Way back when it was Loafers - probably ten years ago!\n\nNow the outside has been remade, but the inside hasn\'t undergone much more than a paint job and some new light fixtures.  It\'s fairly bright: And made even more so by the fact that they were shooting a commercial.\n\nThe furnishings are somewhat sparse.  They might even be leftovers from the Loafers day.  Nothing fancy at all.  But the staff is friendly.  I\'d give them a big thumbs up, as they try and make you feel at home.  Helpful, as on a chilly night like tonight, the place was downright cold!\n\nLuckily, the food helped in that regard as well.  Everything was tasty, though nothing was really outstanding.  The best thing of the night was actually something ordered by my wife - a steak and rice dish with onions and tomatoes over fries (called "Lomo Saltado").  Excellent.  My own was just average.  See the pics if you\'d like to check out some visuals.\n\nIf you happen to be a Time-Warner customer, be sure to look for a coupon for buy one, get one free.'

They would not answer the phone for 15min, but when they did they hung up.  I decided to drive to the store so I could obtain a refund.  When I arrived the pitchforks were already out.  10 maybe 12 others waiting and steaming.  No one was given refunds as we were told "we cannot process refunds, only the district manager can".  Many of us left fleeced with no pizza and money spent.  \n\nIf you are considering Papa Johns I strongly recommend you reconsider.

Everything was very good, the Salmon was very good and will be repeated, the Scampi wasn't so great, but still a good dish.

It was a Sunday night and there wasn't a wait but when we went in there was a kid about 10ish working the register and then cleaning tables and picking up plates.  I didn't think that was right and seemed odd.  The buffet was kinda small and a lot of the pans were bare.  It seemed like most of the food out wasn't even Chinese at all and of what was out, it was just kinda meh.  If going off the food then I would only expect to it to cost somewhere in the $3-$5 range.  Not to say the prices were bad, but they are comparable to most of the other buffets with either more of a selection or better food.\nAt least the restaurant was filthy looking but there was lots of food/trash on the floor.\nIf I had to go back, I would only end up getting the ice cream which is scooped out of ice cream containers and doesn't come out of a machine."

S'I recently had the misfortune of ordering lunch at this horrible establishment after my wife had finished her little shopping spree at the Bombay Company which is situated right next to this poor excuse for a restaurant.  The place looks like a converted Burger Chef (or some other take out/drive through establishment) and is staffed by employees who seemed, at best, disinterested.   The menu is more or less a series of numbered pictures of prepared plates and the brain dead patrons (myself obviously included) order by advising the counterperson of which numbered picture they desire.  Foolishly my wife, thinking like an American, requested some rather minor and reasonable variations to her order and asked for one item a la carte.  Well, the response we got from the counterperson was a look of both disdain and confusion.  I could not figure out if the counterperson was ignorant, unwilling to assist an English speaker, completely unable to deviate from the ridiculous pictures, and/or all of the foregoing.  As for the food it was mediocre at best.  I could live with the mediocre food, it was the "tooth-pulling" experience of ordering that was unacceptable.  Best to steer clear of this place and if you need a little "nosh" while in the vicinity of the Namur Metro Station try Dunn\'s Delicatessen next door and give Amir a wide berth.'

S"If you don't like having smooth, relaxing craps, and pleasure yourself in hot, anus ripping diarrhea, then look no further- Basha on Sherbrooke and University is the place for you!\n\nThis lovely little toilet nightmare is placed in the basement suite of an old, semi-abandoned office building, sharing its prime real estate with a shady currency exchange store that opens for only 3 hours a day and a Tim Hortons above it that, for lack of a better word, is as pleasurable in dining as is eating the asshole an obese computer technician named Fred.  The decor in this Basha's is lovely:  it features crumbling drywall, piss yellow cracked paint, and an orange trim that is peppered with cigarette burns and ashes from the staff after working hours.  The floor is also missing a few tiles and it's been mopped with outdated cleaning products from the 50's that smell like ass-juice vinaigrette.  The decor and ambiance of a Middle Eastern building in the midst of a warring conflict is achieved in all 5 senses...truly a design award is necessary for this place.\n\nThe food is affordable...some would even argue cheap as hell.  And hell it does seem to exemplify once tasting it.  The hummus is about 5 days old and unrefrigerated, giving it an extra bit of sour mold to for a reduction in taste, while the kebab meats are uncooked, still dripping fresh in its juices when killed when served to you coupled with vegetables from Lobo.  If you're lucky enough, this delicious meal will also include an extra bonus of a piece of fur or bone from the mystery meat you adventurously embark on tasting.  This is truly a wonderful spoof at the poverty some must undergo in the slums of war torn countries and the owners do an excellent job simulating poverty's finest dishes to an elite group of college students.  Truly, this ploy of forcing empathy through taste is a great charitable cause and is noteworthy in decor, ambiance and especially in inducing you to excretion levels so high that your bowels and esophagus will be taken to unseen heights."

S"OK so by now most people know I am a pretty patience guy but every time I eat here it seems as if time slows down.The words fast food can not and should not be used when describing this place. First off let me start by saying that this place while a chain seems to be the broken link. \n\nIn the last three times I was forced to eat here (friends choice) I did not recive my complete order, was over charged, and received food that looked like it was left by a previous customer. Soggy fries, burgers coated in so much grease the bun would have slid off had it not been for all the cheese that held it to the wrapper! Of course this was after the long wait time (clocked at over 12 mins by my friend on one visit!) So why do people still eat here is my question? Maybe they are still stuck on the memories of cold and tasty frosty's. \n\nOr maybe it was the times they enjoyed a biggie drink with free refills on a blazing 110 summer day here in phoenix. Who knows? I think that since they were acquired by Arby's there was no place for them to go but down hill. Dave Thomas would flip in his grave if he could see the tiny dried up squares of cow flesh his customers where offered for their hard earned dollar, and Wendy well she would be in tears!

S'Overpriced & under delivered.  \n\nI had checked the reviews of this place prior to my arrival.  I was going to avoid but some others from my same event had eaten here the day before & said they enjoyed so I decided to give it a try.  \n\nTonight was my 1st of 3 nights at the hotel. I went downstairs to get an order to go so I wouldn\'t have to wait on room service.  I ordered the Birch Crab Cake Sandwich with sweet potato fries ($13), the Tomato Bisque ($7) & the Chocolate Lava Cake ($8).  \n\nThe sandwich was described as "Lump crab cake pan seared & topped with spicy remoulade Served on a Kaiser roll". While the crab cake was decent, it was just barely cooked, definitely not \'pan seared\'.  But the worse part was it was naked on the roll, missing the spicy remoulade.\n\nThe soup was a cup size for what most charge for a bowl.  They didn\'t have any take out bowls so they gave it to me in a to-go coffee cup, which I was fine with but it was cold. \n\nHoping for a desert that would redeem this sorry excuse for a dinner I also got the Chocolate Lava Cake.  Another disappointment.  A lava cake is supposed to have a molten center.  This was dense and dry.\n\nI will not be eating there again at any point during the remainder of my stay.  If you stay here & do not have a car, the Chilli\'s down the street would be better than here or even ordering from Papa John\'s.  The Marriott Hotel Chain should be ashamed and embarrassed that this restaurant is in a building baring it\'s name.\n\nPS- Was told that if you catch the shuttle driver & asked nicely he\'ll drive you down to the light rail station (8/10 of a mile from the hotel).  Take that into Uptown Charlotte for a vast assortment of places that are well worth the extra effort.\n\nUpdate: After sending a link to the Yelp page for the restaurant, including my review, thru Marriott\'s customer service section of the website, I received an email and a follow up with the Manager of Food & Beverage for the hotel, including a fruit basket and a letter of apology left in my room.  While I was impressed with the follow up it didn\'t change the meal.  For the effort in follow up I have upgraded my review to 2 stars. So, if you are going to eat here it\'s at your own risk. BUT if you have any problems ask to speak to Stacey.  She will listen and try to make it right.'

S'The North Bridge Brasserie is part of the Scotsman Hotel - a beautiful, period building that is impressive from the outside, and even more so in the inside when you get lost wandering from the main brasserie, all slick dark wood, to the reception, past some regal looking marble stairs, and then are led down an darkish corridor to a hidden, room that suddenly open up into brightness, light, pastel colours, creams and pink lillies on the table - a room that is reserved specifically for afternoon tea.\n\nI have something of a Victoriana fetish. After reading "A Little Princess" when I was 8, I wanted to be the little princess. After reading "The Secret Garden" I used to hope and pray I would find a secret door in our old walled garden leading to a hidden garden. Whilst it was an age that wasn\'t kind to women, I still have fantasies of dressing up in period dresses, with a morning dress for breakfast in the morning room, a going out dress with umbrella and hat for a stroll in the garden, and then a lighter frock that matches the colours of the upholstery in the afternoon tea room.\n\nThat last paragraph wasn\'t essential to this review, but it gives some context to why I was so enamoured with afternoon tea at the North Bridge Brasserie. The hidden room you can only be led to for your afternoon tea is a delight, and the setting and service is definitely the closest to the old-fashioned style of afternoon tea anywhere I\'ve found in Edinburgh. Many places do afternoon tea, offering the three tiered cake stand with scones, cake, sandwiches and tea. But that\'s just the food. What the North Bridge Brasserie offered was the whole experience.\n\nTHey set up a table for 12 people and took all our orders, accomodating gluten free, vegetarian and no-fish. They then brought us all our afternoon delights. Rather than putting everything on individual, or between two, cake stands, they brought out all the sandwiches, then all the scones, then all the cakes. This was more practical, although did take away from the lovely feeling of \'all my food on one cake stand\' slightly.\n\nI had the gluten free option, shared with Claire L. The sandwiches, well - you couldn\'t tell the difference between the gluten free bread and regular. THe scones, whilst slightly smaller than the regular scones, were equally delicious and you couldn\'t tell they were gluten free. I can\'t really complain about the size of the scones, as there was so much food we got several doggie bags to take home after. 6 finger sandwiches each, a huge scone, and at least 5 or 6 mini cakes which were all very rich. \n\nOn the gluten free cake stand there was the \'dime bar cake\' made with almonds (Claire L tells me you can buy this in from supermarkets and at Ikea), a white fudge, chocolate truffle, cranachan, chocolate brownie, mini meringue with lemon curd... A lot of cakes! I was envious at the lack of carrot cake, and wonder if they could add more \'sponge like\' gluten free options to the gluten free cake stand, using gluten free flour. But again, I can\'t complain as it was all lovely.\n\nThe tea itself was really the only less-than-lovely exprience. Many people ordered earl grey, myself included. It was very weak, no matter how long we let it brew, and was distinctly lacking the earl grey flavour. It was just...weak all over. There is nothing more pleasurable than a sip of scented, bergamot earl grey tea followed by a bite of a scone lathered in clotted cream and jam. It is afternoon tea after all, with the emphasis on the tea. So the fact that this tea was perhaps stale and lacking flavour was a bit sad, and was a noticeable drop in standard, given the rest of it was all exquisite.\n\nHowever, I would definitely return and perhaps get a regular, stronger tea. This would be my highest recommendation for afternoon tea in the city. It\'s central (a 2 minute walk from Waverely Train Station), in a gorgeous building fitting to the tradition, and in a beautiful room with light, open windows, with delicious, home-made food and very attentive, kind service. \xc2\xa316.95 per person for the regular afternoon tea, and \xc2\xa320.95 for a glass of prosecco. Rather splendid.'

S"A group of 8 on a Saturday night.  Where shall we have dinner.  We decided on this place because it seemed like there would be something to please every taste.  You typically can't go wrong with Italian, right?\n\nFirst, I felt bad that in order to accommodate our large group, they asked a couple other diners to move tables.  I've been on the other end of that and its not a fun feeling.  Secondly, the waiter didn't move around the table to take everyone's orders meaning those at the end (including me) had to yell our order out over everyone's heads.  And we were on the outside patio so you can imagine how noisy it might have been.  This also may have been one of the reasons that about 1/2 of the orders came out incorrect and for one of our group, not at all.\n\nI ordered spaghetti carbonara which did come out correctly but it wasn't the greatest.  It wasn't creamy but dry and it didn't have the greatest taste, but I did have some wine to wash it down =)  Several in our group didn't like their food at all."

S"In my opinion, a good sandwich is hard to find. I'm not a huge sandwich person, and I usually prefer sandwiches that are more like a good entree that just happens to be between two slices of bread. The veggie melt ($9) at City Bakery was a lot like that - fresh veggies (tomatoes, red peppers, artichoke hearts, and wild mushrooms) in a really tangy marinade with hummus and goat cheese just happened to have found their way between two slices of foccacia, even though their ultimate destination could have been an antipasto plate or a Mediterranean sampler. Cerebral, I know, but in my opinion, that's what a good sandwich is all about! \n\nMy husband's sandwich, on the other hand, was not really a collection of well-matched, stand-out ingredients paired with complementary bread. It was the Roasted Chicken sandwich ($9). Instead of tasting like chicken pulled off of a roasted whole bird and paired with bread and cheese, it tasted like dried pieces of chicken breast that were practically drowning in goat cheese and then masked with two enormous slices of baguette. Not so great. \n\nThe white bean salad that comes on the side of the sandwiches was one of the best side dishes I've had in a long time. It was seasoned with light olive oil and filled with tangy sun-dried tomatoes. I just wished that it had been a larger portion - four spoonfuls, and it was gone. \n\nI would order that veggie melt sandwich again in a second. But, I hope that more of their $9 - $10 sandwiches feature more than just dry and pretty flavorless meat thrown onto some bread and sent off to the customer without a second thought. For that price, we deserve better."

S"somewhat schizophrenic...\n\nrestaurant has 2 sides...one side appears to be a standard Chinese buffet but we didn't do that side.\n\nWe went on the 'hot pot' side which apparently replicates a fairly common Chinese method of social eating...think fondue.\n\nYou get gas fired cookers on your table, the number of cookers depends upon the number of diners and we had 2 cookers for 6 adults. One was half filled plain type of mixture, I'm not sure it was oil, it appeared to be more like a chicken broth. The other side was spiced with chilis. They provide wire scoops/utensils for putting items in or taking them out.\n\nThe buffet had a variety of fish, meat, vegetables, tofu, crab etc. and you load a plate and put into the rapidly boiling mix and most stuff cooks rather rapidly. The quality of the items seemed to be quite good but the mixtures boil down and have to be replenished and the chili side seemed to get most of the play and somewhat gunked up after an hour or so.\n\nI found I could wrap some mushies and beef inside of some spinach and tofu skin, put it into the spicy side and 2 minutes later, get a really tasty lumpy concoction. Tried the dried blood...not for me. Crab was just too much trouble, shrimp was awesome.\n\nIf you do this, make sure that you get at least a half regular and half spicy pot because I found I had little interest in the plain side.\n\nBut it seems pretty clear that this isn't as much about the food but rather about sitting around and talking and getting to eat some things while you hang. It's less about eating and more about socializing...which I gather is somewhat common in many areas in China.\n\nNever bothered with the desserts but they seemed to be nothing special. I had to take some rice from the regular buffet side (it was really good). All in all, it was a fun evening and I think we spent about 2 1/2 hours there and I doubt I ate enough to hurt them for the cost.\n\nSeemed to me that the 'hot pot' side was mostly Chinese and that caucasians like me wouldn't normally know about this or what to do...but you do...think fondue"

The food was good don't get me wrong. As stated in a review from someone else. It's good not great. My girlfriend also got a Long Island Iced Tea. She said that was awesome. All in all not a bad place. I'd go here again probably."

S"I went to this place the other day because I love Taiwanese food. I really love beef noodle soup! It's one of my favorites. I have searched far and wide going to various restaurants. \n\nSo, my friends and I went and ordered green onion pancake, beef noodle soup, and green onion pancake with beef. I liked the green onion pancake. It was really delicious and flakey. I did like the one from Easy Earthen in California better, but this is pretty good for Vegas. \n\nThe beef noodle soup was amazing! I think it might just be my favorite. The beef is so tender and soft. I love the broth. It was very flavorful, and wasn't watered down. I would say this is best beef noodle soup I have ever had. \n\nService was a little slow here. It might be because the set up is  little difficult to see people because of the huge walls between each booth. I guess they didn't want to spend money remodeling the place. \n\nThe only downside is that they don't have shanghai dumplings. I was so disappointed. :("

The difference here is, that the food is made fresh and take a look... The ingredients are not processed! It's not a sodium-laden frozen food meal you grab at a grocery store and it lasts into next year, this actually is clean-eating. For those of us who care about what we put into our bodies or with serious allergies, that's very important. Tonight I brought my boyfriend here to stock up on the next five days of meals. Why? Well, because we need a little revamping of our diets and why not get back to clean eating and doing what is good for the body? No. A frozen lean cuisine isn't as good for you as you think; read the label:) What I love, besides that it's made fresh , and local, is that you can order and pick it up when your ready and they will adhere to any allergy or dietary needs that you have.

S'Finn McCools is like my own little beacon of hope in the mess that has become the South Side. I try to avoid the South Side most of the time unless I\'m really feeling in the mood to watch under agers and general drunken idiots get "OMG I\'m 21" drunk and fall all over themselves. I\'m ok with that making me sound ridiculously lame but seriously, have you been there lately?\nSo anyway, I\'ll step off my soapbox. Back to Finn McCools. It\'s relatively small, but pretty comparative to the other bars on East Carson Street. The seating in the back - a small lounge area with couches and chairs - is the best thing about the place. Get there earlier in the night and claim your spot in that area and you won\'t move the rest of the night. The music is good and the crowd is laid back. Typically just a crowd of people there to drink and not show off. No random dancing on the bar or drunken bar fights. There are just people looking to drink and socialize and that\'s something I can totally get behind. Bartenders are on their A game and the drinks aren\'t pricey.\n(The only reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars is because it\'s in the South Side)'

S'So in the spectrum of Greek restaurants, I would call Ellada great but not quite off-the-charts. They aim for the upper middle range and hit it just right.\n\nWe had an unusually large group and they opened an hour early for us, which is a particularly remarkable level of service outside the US. The service was attentive but not intrusive and very accommodating. The food was fresh and tasted great. \n\nWe were greeted with a mound of traditional village white bread and olives steeped in oil oregano and rosemary. One person made a comment that they would have liked butter, but kept on dipping, so it probably wasn\'t a big deal. A series of samplers came out in sequence followed by a particularly good Greek salad and finished off with a mixed grill of lamb, pork, chicken and beef.\n\nAfter all, Greek cuisine is about simple peasant food prepared with care. Freshness and seasoning is paramount, any error is glaring. The fact that all the food was spot on speaks volumes! In fact, one of my frequent beefs is greasy fried food due to improper preparation and maintenance of the fryer. We had both calamari as an appetizer and lokoumades  for dessert and both were exceptional in being hot, crispy and not greasy at all!\n\nOne of my little quirks is to check out the men\'s bathroom as a predictor of the quality of the food. Restaurants that aspire to some greatness but don\'t have the resources renovate the women\'s restroom first. Here the WC has some cool design elements, echoing the main dining hall\'s tile and sculptural motif. \n\nThey also had a DJ the Saturday night we were there, but we left before the party got going, so I\'m not sure why he was playing the boring stuff he was playing. The background music during our dinner was way better!\n\nAs you can tell, I was impressed, but To justify the 5-star review (because they are not a "Milos"): they don\'t aspire to a celebrity dining moniker and they are a much better value with food that is probably as good with a notch lower ambience and service. They achieve their dining niche with unusual flair.'

S'I went to Montreal for a work conference, and I was demanded by my sister to try the Poutine in Montreal. I decided to go to La Belle Province as it was recommended by some people I attended the conference with. So once I stepped in the shop I automatically thought Olden Diner Style. (I just thought of Oppan Gangnam Style... Ehhhh Sexy Lady) Teehee!! Anyways back to the review. I ordered the Poutine and took it to the table. It was love at first bite, the Cheese Curds with that Hot Gravy on top of all of the succulent fries, perfectly incorporated to create the perfect bite. It was a large portion, but it better be if its 6 bucks for a Poutine. Montreal (La Belle Province) is definitely a great place to get your Poutine fix, its much better than the imitation Poutines with Mozzarella. Get your French on and manger la poutine.'

S"Well, we made a return trip a week later and I'm even more unimpressed.\n\nThe queen had a nasty-tasting Sangria-Margarita hybrid along with a decent Pollo Fundido. The prince, once again, ordered simple beef & bean nachos (what's with this kid anyway?!?) and a coke. The king got Arroz con Camarones, which is grilled shrimp on rice with a smidgen of queso on top, and a sweet tea. I'm not sh*tting you...a smidgen. May as well not have bothered. It was a pretty lackluster dish. It seriously needed peppers, onions....SOMETHING! I ended up dumping their so-so salsa on top. Speaking of lack of queso, we went with the Gringo Dip as an app again and it was nearly void of queso as well. Is there a shortage of cheese I'm unaware of?\n\nAlso, there was a nest of skanks in one corner who were liquored up and bitching at each other. It would seem that they were all sleeping with the same loser and were just finding out about it (I am not exaggerating). They got loud & obnoxious at times and the staff really didn't do much to keep them in check except to help them drown their sorrows with more margaritas. \n\nWe won't be returning to this place again and I would advise my fellow Yelpers to avoid this place like the plague.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"

S'If you look at my other reviews, you\'ll see I very rarely give a restaurant 1 bubble. And for local places in my community, I will often say nothing if I don\'t have anything nice to say. But this experience was so thoroughly terrible I\'m making an exception. A friend visiting from out of state was thrilled we had a Hungry Howie\'s in our town as this was her favorite pizza chain back east. Since we had not had a chance to try it yet, we gave it a go. First we tried ordering on the web site but it does not allow you to select a flavor for the crust - that seemed odd considering how much they promote this and rely on it to differentiate themselves from all the other pizza joints in town. OK, so we tried calling our order in. We had seen the specials on the web site, but when we asked for it on the phone, a teenage-sounding guy told us they didn\'t have that promotion and it would cost roughly double the advertised price. At this point I started getting annoyed, but I kept calm and ordered on, after all, our friend loves this place, maybe the food will redeem it. Since we were already out and about, we declined delivery and went in to get it. Imagine my surprise when we saw the front of the building was plastered with large advertisements exactly matching what we saw online. There were also posters and stands inside the restaurant showing these same deals. Really?! How could this guy NOT know the specials they offer? Does he come in through the back door every day? Does he never look left when he answers the phone? I probably should have said something, but at this point it was worth the extra money to not prolong any interaction with this person. I paid and left. At home we realized they never offered us a choice of dipping sauces for the bread sticks and that the pizza did not have the flavored crust we ordered. The bread sticks were burnt and tough. We tried to eat a couple but ended up throwing them away, which if you know me is atypical - I will eat terrible food rather than waste it, but this was beyond edible. The pizza was cooked to perfection, but the cheap ingredients and "canned" tasting sauce put it below average. Our friend assured us she has never had this experience at the other stores she has been to, that even the web site is better for other stores, and that we just have a bad one. Until this location brings its customer service and product quality up to the standards the chain apparently sets for its other locations, there is no chance we will be returning.'

S'Oh, American fast food chains.  How large your portions.  How nostalgic you are.\n\nWe were the proud owners of a gift card to Applebee\'s (Christmas gift!) and the best part of this gift was my boyfriend\'s reaction to me later.  He has never been to an Applebee\'s.  Or an Olive Garden.  Or a Chili\'s.  His first time at a Red Lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night.  So he\'s new to these restaurants, which so many of us grew up with.  I\'d only been to an Applebee\'s a handful of times, but I was down to go back - it seems like they sort of have everything, no matter what you\'re hungry for.\n\nSince we\'re spending all our time now packing to move back to Chicago (WOOHOO!), we don\'t always have time to make dinner.  So we busted out the Applebee\'s gift card and journeyed to Edgewood Towne Center for some chain restaurant foods.  \n\nWhen we arrived, this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar.  I missed the finer points of the interaction, since he was talking to my boyfriend, but he basically insinuated that he\'d just sat some large tables, or something, and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didn\'t have the time to serve us, or something, and he didn\'t want us to wait (for what, I\'m not sure) so he was basically like "Can you sit at the bar?"  Which was weird because there were like, at least a dozen open tables.   But whatevs.  The cool kids sit at the bar, and we are the cool kids.\n\nChuck, the bartender, was running this show.  Dude.  He was on top of everything.  Taking orders, serving drinks, answering phones, getting takeout orders, keeping his bar neat and tidy - he was HOPPING!  We were both in awe just watching him.  That man is earning his tips, for reals.  So I\'d recommend sitting at the bar if Chuck is working.  He\'s also cute, so bonus there.  The Applebee\'s bar is kind of a hilarious place - random people having drinks as if it\'s a real bar and not a restaurant, this one lady READING A BOOK WITH A GLASS OF WINE like it was some fancy cafe, some annoying fratty people....and us.  A healthy mix.\n\nI had a Shock Top and my boyfriend had a Sam Adams - mad props for Shock Top on draft, not expecting that from Applebee\'s.  We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, which I believe was half price (as are all apps) during happy hour.  It was served with regular tortilla chips (like from a bag) but the dip itself was pretty tasty.  It was served in a really wide but shallow crock, and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy.  It was served very hot and was pretty satisfying!\n\nMy side salad arrived shortly thereafter, and it was amusingly huge for a side.  Iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crispy croutons, shredded cheese, tangy bottled Italian dressing on the side.  I bought it to balance out my entree, but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy, you know? Like eating crispy water.  With cheese and croutons.  YAY HEALTH!\n\nThen came the entrees - I got an order of wings (which I think is technically listed as an appetizer) with "Sweet and Spicy Sauce" which was listed as the second-hottest sauce on the menu.  They were pretty decent - served hot, juicy chicken, and the sauce was sweet and sticky.  It was a little *too* sweet for me - picture gloopy Chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce, and that\'s what the wing sauce was like - but it still made a satisfying meal.  My boyfriend got one of their "special burgers" from their new New Orleans menu -something like a Bourbon Bacon burger.  They asked him "pink or no pink" which we thought was funny.  He said "pink," and the burger came out with like, a tiny touch of maybe-pink in the middle.  Medium-rare, this ain\'t!  He said it was okay.  Not great.  Just a burger.  I didn\'t taste it, I just nibble on a few of his fries, which were pretty average.\n\nThat all came in at around $30, aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount.  I have no interest in going to Applebee\'s again because I can get better burgers, pasta, chicken, bar food, everything, etc anywhere else, but if I was road tripping and needed a place to stop, this wouldn\'t be a bad choice.  Sit at the bar and hope Chuck is there, and enjoy pretty average versions of American bar food.'

The spaghetti & meatballs were really good.  The marinara sauce was made from scratch, with fresh garlic and basil.  It's hard to describe, but it was subtle, more like something you would expect in a high end Italian restaurant.  It perfectly complemented the delicious and generous meatballs.  The garlic bread was perfectly toasted.  The chocolate mousse pie was just average.  My only complaint is that I asked for parmesan cheese specifically in my online order and didn't receive it with the delivery.  Oh well.

Rutgers!), so I\'ve had more delicious, delicious pizza than some people get in their whole lives. And it\'s because of this pursuit of higher education that I\'m doomed to spend the rest of my west-coast life in pursuit of a decent slice. \n\nAs others have said before, on Yelp, on the news, on bar stools at 3 a.m., decent pizza is hard in Nevada because of the water. But, just like a dog with three legs, Nevada can rise above its challenge and become something different, something unique, something altogether endearing. And since 3 Brothers is legit from Jersey and has that feisty Jersey backing, they rise above with considerable flair. \n\n(It should also be said that my apartment is pretty damn close to 3 Brothers, so I\'ve had it enough times to make a well-informed decision. Because that\'s how people make pizza decisions, right?)\n\nThe pizza\'s good. It\'s not New Jersey, it\'s not New York, it\'s not Chicago, but it\'s good. Sometimes it\'s really good and sometimes it\'s too saucy or undercooked. It\'s one of those places where, even if you don\'t have a mind-blowing slice, you can at least see its value in the Las Vegas Pizza Hierarchy. The other food is sort of similarly inconsistent, but also generally good. I had a TCE (traumatic calzone experience) while dining in there once and haven\'t tried again, but we often get the chicken fingers/french fries carry-out to make our own at-home fat sandwiches (Rutgers!) and it\'s always good. \n\nIt seems -- less than helpful? -- to keep referring to things as "good," but that\'s really what it is. I can\'t say that this is the kind of slice most people would drive all the way over from Summerlin for, but to some people, I think it could be that place. It\'s got just enough of everything I remember from college and New Jersey pizza places to make me want to blow off studying for a final and just eat pizza and watch The Office instead. I think that drive-across-town pizza fanaticism would also be easy to arrive at for people that know the original 3 Brothers. (But, having eaten at the original, I don\'t think you\'re going to be 100% satisfied. Blame it on the water, right?)\n\nI guess what I\'m trying to say is: this isn\'t the pizza you\'re looking for. This isn\'t the slice that\'s going to make you grab the box, hole up in the corner of your Vegas apartment and bark at anyone that comes near you because you\'re found it, oh my god, you\'ve found it, real east coast pizza in NEVADA.\n\nBut, I don\'t know that that pizza place exists here (...yep, the water) and you could do a lot worse than 3 Brothers. It\'s like, remember that time back home in New Jersey when your favorite shop was closed because it\'s family owned and someone was having a baptism, but you still really wanted pizza? And you ordered from a different shop, but it was still good, but not the same? It\'s like that. \n\n(Plus, bonus Jersey perk: depending on who answers the phone/takes your order in-store, you may get a side of thinly veiled apathy/annoyance. It\'s kind of charming once you learn not to take it personally, I\'m serious.)'

S"I was here on Saturday with 4 other people and I have to say that this tiny Greek-African fusion restaurant was such a great find! Plus, it is bring your own wine!\nIt is pretty small and almost empty when we got there at 6pm on Saturday, although it started getting busier when we were leaving. The service was excellent. I know there was nobody there, but the waitress waqs extremely friendly and went above and beyond our expectations by explaining the menu to us in english, even though she was french and struggling a bit. Those of us who do speak french helped her out with some words she didn't know, but overall, she was very capable.)\n\nThe food was fairly priced and so amazingly flavourful. We started with 3 appetizers: Spanokopita, which was just okay and probably my least favourite of all the dishes; Nem Abidjanaise, which were rolls of chicken and cheese and they were so good; and lastly the fried plantains. Delicious! My boyfriend also tried the Pepe soup, which was a fish soup with spice that you add yourself to adjust the heat to your liking. It was great and the fish inside was moist and yummy (with the exception of some annoying bones.)\n\nFor the dishes, 2 people had the Chicken Katoum, which the waitress let us know is their signature dish. The spices and aromas from that plate, as well as the other plates were amazing. I had the choukouya chicken, which again, was so good! I am not sure what the other dishes were, but I know that my brother ordered a lamb dish and the lamb was cooked so tenderly and tasted great. The dishes came with salad (standard but good balsamic dressing), greek potatoes (very lemony and good, which I love, not a huge hit with some others who prefer them a different way) and couscous or rice. The one complaint that my family had with the food was that the couscous and rice were both very bland. (I ordered extra plantains with mine instead of the rice, so I can't complain!)\n\nOverall, there were no disappointing dishes at this place. They all had such good flavour and were very filling. As well, the prices seem fair and the portions were generous. \nI would give this place 5 stars, but there was one flaw: I don't think they have air-conditioning, because I was sweating like crazy and dying of heat, as was the rest of my family. (I would have given 4.5 if possible!)\n\nWhat a great find. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

I finally told myself that the next time I saw them I would give it a go.\n\nCut to this past First Friday- I made a beeline straight to Engine 1 Pizza.  The wait was ridiculous, but the place was busy.  After what seemed like an eternity, we finally got our pizza.  \n\nIt was good, but not anything special- just a decent slice of thin crust pizza.  Hate to say it since the employees were very nice.  But the fried mozzarella was pretty good, and $15 for a whole pie to feed a few people is a steal when compared to the rest of the food trucks' prices."

Wow. That was really delicious, I surrender (yes I'm French, of course I surrender) \nHad a little salad next to it, and I was full.\n\nNot so convinced by the Celery/lemon/apple juice I had, celery was too much present. \n\n\n\nVegetarians, my bad, your food can definitely be good.\n\nBut Talking about rabbits made me want to eat some pat\xc3\xa9 now."

S'Here\'s the Quickie:\n\nService - 5 stars\nFood - 3 stars (doner gyro sandwich), 3.5 stars (chicken kebab plate), 5 stars (the amount of food they give you), 5 stars (freshness and good quality)\nAmbience - 4 stars (clean and simple restaurant)\nOverall - 4 stars for a local joint\n\nI typed this up while I was waiting...\nOrdered take out. Said it\'ll take about 15 minutes. Next time I\'ll call ahead. I\'m sitting here waiting and salivating at the same time. The food smells great. The guys next door from auto shop seem like regulars. Said hello to the owner and picked up their food. \n\nI ordered the doner gyro sandwich for $6.95 and for the lunch special it comes with fries and a soda. I also ordered a small chicken kebab plate for $8.95 which comes with rice or fries. I realized that they forgot to ask me which one I wanted, I really hope they give me rice since I\'m getting fries already. Also, there are no fountain drinks, it\'s canned. Don\'t forget to pick it up in the fridge!\n\nIt seems like they are working on a large deliveries thus the wait. I like the "dude" feel of this place. The cook/owner(?) just abruptly asked me if I wanted everything on my doner. (But when I was walking out, he held the door open for me too. What a cool guy! AND they apologized for the delay.)\n\nConclusion...\nI definitely like the quality of the food. The lettuce is super fresh, the food is grilled on the spot, and the chicken kebab was white meat! The steak fries are tasty too. I wish there was more "Turkish flavor", I felt like the food was too mild. I think this place can get 5 stars if they create a special recipe or sauce that punches my face with some flavor. I\'ll definitely go back for some chicken and fresh vegetables!\n\nFYI: Also, on their menu it states that the hours are 10:30am-8:30pm. There are no other signs posted on their doors.'

I waited for 45 minutes for a bowl of pho, and had to remind the waitress about it because apparently the cook forgot it... 45 minutes!!! FOR PHO!!?? Gosh...\n\nThen when she gave me the food, there was no apologies or anything. The worst of all, it was not even the pho I ordered. So I had her return the dish and ended up not paying for it. A Saturday night dinner with a friend ended up like this, just bad.\n\nI still left her 10% tips despite all this, but she somehow had the guts to tell me I should give 15%...\n\nHow does this place even exist?"

S'Wir kommen gerade von dort. Trotz Anmeldung wurde auf den Geburtstag meines Mannes nicht eingegangen. Schade! Vier Servicekr\xc3\xa4fte, die nicht koordiniert sind, erscheinen mir doch zu viel und verbreiten eher Unruhe, als eine angenehme Atmosp\xc3\xa4re. Am Nebentisch gab es Butter und/oder Oliven\xc3\xb6l zum Brot. Dieses Angebot bekamen wir und andere G\xc3\xa4ste nicht. 1.Vorspeise: Hummersalat. War gut. 2. Vorspeise: Angel-Hecht mit Spargel, ebenfalls gut. Hauptspeise: Rinderlende mit Parmesan-Gnocchi und Gem\xc3\xbcse. Ein rieisiger Reinfall! Fleisch rosa bestellt, grau und durchgegart bekommen. Dazu war ein Teil des Fleisches sehnig - geht gar nicht. Gnocchi ohne Geschmack, was bei PARMESAN-Gnocchi eine Kunst ist. Gem\xc3\xbcse und Gnocchi war in der Zahl ein Witz (4 Gnoccichen, 2 fingernagelgro\xc3\x9fe Karottenstreifen sowie ein ebenso kleiner Blumenkohl und ein Minir\xc3\xb6schen Brokoli). Nachtisch: geeister Rhabarber Schaum mit Erdbeeren. In Ordnung, aber nichts besonderes. Dieses Men\xc3\xbc gab es f\xc3\xbcr 76EUR. Mein Mann ist nicht satt geworden. Weine waren gut und preislich in Ordnung. Evian f\xc3\xbcr 7,30EUR. \nF\xc3\xbcr das Publikum kann das Restaurant nichts. Man schien sich aber zu kennen. Der Atmosph\xc3\xa4re tun Menschen in Tarnshorts und Basecap nicht gut.

I especially like the vegetarian dumplings, but really, it's all good. \n\nThere are three or four buffet bars, so anything you might want is going to be there. There are kind of boring options for the kids and grannies among your party, but there are also fun, weird things on the special bar. Not as many weird things as you'd find at Tin Tin, but enough to make it worth a trip in to check them out."

S'Nun warte ich schon \xc3\xbcber eine Stunde einmal angerufen soll nur noch 10 Min. dauern bin gespannt. \nUm den Beitrag nun zu vervollst\xc3\xa4ndigen: Die Pizza kam dann nicht nach 10 Minuten sondern nach 35 Minuten. Insgesamt waren dass dann mal locker 1:35 h.\nBei dem Anruf wurde mir versichert dass gerade sehr viel los ist und die Pizza unterwegs w\xc3\xa4re. Mein pers\xc3\xb6nlicher Eindruck ist folgender:\nIch hatte die Pizza \xc3\xbcber das online Portal http://www.pizzeria.de/ bestellt. Dort hatte ich schon zweimal bestellt einmal an meinem Arbeitsort Gie\xc3\x9fen, einmal bei einem Event in Karlsruhe und nun ganz privat zu Hause. Die Bestellung klappte auch ganz problemlos, so wie immer.\nBei meinem Anruf in der Pizzeria Pizza Sofort (hatte mir die ausgesucht weil sie am n\xc3\xa4chsten dran war) war wohl meine Betsellung untergegangen, das konnte man aus der Konversation der Telefonistin und des Pizzab\xc3\xa4ckers heraush\xc3\xb6ren. In diesem Fall h\xc3\xa4tte die Lieferung 35 Minuten nach Bestelleingang gedauert was an einem Samstag Abend durchaus akzeptabel ist.\nDer Anlieferer hatte eien Flasche Cola dabei, die aufs Haus ging aufgrund der Versp\xc3\xa4tung. Das fand ich als Entschuldigung Klasse. Der Pizzafahrer erkl\xc3\xa4rte: es w\xc3\xa4re gerade so viel los.\nZum Objekt meiner Begierde: \nBestellt hatte ich eine Pizza Hawai, 40 cm, f\xc3\xbcr 11.50 EUR. bekomme hatte ich genau dass was ich bestellt habe. Qualitativ bleibt festzuhalten. der Belag war \xc3\xbcppig und meiner Erwartung entsprechend. Der Pizzaboden leider nicht so ganz. Er war nur 3/4 fertig. Man hatte sich also sehr beeilt meine Bestellung so schnell als m\xc3\xb6glich fertig zu machen. Schade da h\xc3\xa4tte ich gerne noch 5 Minuten l\xc3\xa4nger gewartet. \nFazit: Wenn die Bestellung termingerecht in der Pizzeria aufgenommen worden w\xc3\xa4re glaube ich h\xc3\xa4tte das echt gepasst. Dann w\xc3\xa4re die Pizza eben erst nach 40 Minuten eingetrudelt, der Boden w\xc3\xa4re ganz fertig gewesen und mir h\xc3\xa4tte es auch geschmeckt.\nAber h\xc3\xa4tte, w\xc3\xa4re und wenn ist eben nicht das Bewertungskriterium.\nSo bleiben mir nur zwei Punkte zu vergeben, denn es war eindeutig zu sp\xc3\xa4t nicht so schmackhaft wie es h\xc3\xa4tte sein k\xc3\xb6nnen. Drei Punkte w\xc3\xa4ren drin gewesen, wenn man mir gesagt h\xc3\xa4tte, wir habens verschwitzt und der Boden w\xc3\xa4re durch gewesen.'

This location is incredibly convenient for me - both for being relatively close to where I live and for being next to an old bookstore, clothes store, and a few other businesses - and has earned all 5 stars for being a bit better than the average Panera. \n\nOne, I've never walked in here and found a shortage in sweet treats, which is a common problem if I want an afternoon bagel in a lot of other Panera locations. Two, the sandwiches here just taste fresher than a lot of other places I've been to. Three, as others have mentioned, the staff are just nicer here - I have no idea why, but I'm not complaining! Bonus star for this Panera because it's actually made its entire interior comfortable and encourages people to relax and use its wi-fi, which is something I can't say a lot of other locations have nailed just yet."

S'Great Honduran restaurant with a menu catered to less adventurous diners who consider fajitas "branching out". I recommend picking out a handful of house specialty apps and an entree or two to split it with friends. You can\'t beat leaving with full bellies, to-go boxes, and an average of ten bucks a person. \n\nI\'m one of those less adventurous eaters who tried fajitas the first time I dropped in. They were good, but pretty greasy--even for fajitas. So, my boyfriend convinced me to return and let him order. Now, the Choripollo will be something I\'ll be craving again before long (see photo). I give it 4 out of 5 stars only because their Mexican is half of the menu but not their calling. \n\nMake sure you check out Las Delicias across the street for chocolate cake or their chocolate mice with almond slivers for ears (they taste like Swiss Rolls).'

S'I was actually sad when I got to this restaurant and saw that sign on their door no longer says  "Anime Ramen" because I\'ve been craving their ramen ever since my last trip to Vegas a couple months ago. But my frown turned upside down as soon as I went inside to see that the waitresses were still dressed in anime costumes and that the place still kept  the anime theme. One of the waitresses said that it was the same menu with added items and just changed the decor of the restaurant. When you walk in you will immediately say to yourself "aw this place is so cute!" And that\'s because it is. From the pretty pink and glitter curtains to the floral lights hanging from the ceiling.\n\nEveryone that works here is so helpful and friendly which just makes the dining experience that much better! Prices are reasonable (bowl of ramen is only $8) and there are a lot of things to choose from. Since they just "opened" they had a special discount which was 20% of all dessert. I got what I got last time, Stewed Beef ramen which was amazeballs. If you like spicy, ask for the chili oil and add it to your broth... So good. I also tried their calamari which was delicious. \n\nI totally recommend this place and trust me, it will be a unique dining experience :) The Pretty Maid Cafe will always be a must for me every time I\'ll be in Vegas!'

S"Ok, I'll admit that Denny's is not even on my radar when it comes to hitting up a place for breakfast. However, walking into this particular Denny's in Arizona had some mitigating factors:\n\n1. We were near Avondale, AZ because we were attending the NASCAR race; we left Scottsdale hecka early, anticipating Sonoma Raceway-like gnarled traffic, which did not materialize so we had time to kill and we were all hungry, so the search for breakfast began.\n\n2. We were gonna hit up Cracker Barrel, but the lines were out the door, so we opted for this Denny's across the street. Plus, our group being, er, frugal, we knew Denny's would be a less expensive option.\n\nNow, no lines out the door when we got there, and it was only a 10-minute wait for our party of four, so that was cool. Our waitress, Isabel, was quick, courteous, friendly, and efficient. She was at our table quickly, brought out all our drinks quickly, kept our drinks refilled, and brought us the check quickly. She got an extra $2 from me, because breakfast waitresses are woefully undertipped!\n\nThey were certainly turning and burning the tables in there; our food was ready in like eight minutes! The food was fine; it's Denny's!\n\nBy the time we left Denny's, it was packed and there was definitely a line out the door! We made it in time to beat the NASCAR and after-church crowds. So, we basically carbo-loaded for our long day at Phoenix International Raceway. A good time was had by all :)"

We ended up just thinking we'd grab something at Cocos and be done.  The service was so slow, it was ridiculous. We were seated quickly, and our orders were taken quickly but then things got bad.   The place was not even 25% full, and we sat there for what seemed like an eternity. We had agreed that if our food didn't arrive in 5 more minutes, we were out of there and it was going to be fast food.  The food arrived at 4+ minutes.  Total wait for food was over 25 minutes.  Once it arrived, it was mediocre at best.  I would never go back.  Too many other options in a town like Vegas.  Not worth the wait."

S"I arrived in Montreal after a 'red eye' flight from Los Angeles, a bit disheveled and pretty tired. Staying with friends, I was locked out of their home after a cab ride from the airport. Stuck, I was getting pretty hungry, and took my suitcase for a walk through the neighborhood to find some lunch ( or with my jet lag, breakfast ). Carmine's.....Thank you. I was a bit stressed, and who walks into a restaurant with a suitcase. They made me feel right at home. Kind and prompt service, and oh yeah....the food....I don't even remember what I ordered, just that I left feeling very satisfied and relaxed. If I get to go back to Montreal, this place is on my list. Thanks Carmine's."

S'I know I\'m not paying for 5 star service at a Taco Bell, but sheesh! \n\nWhen we arrived, there were 2 other people in the entire place.  We stood near the registers ready to order but there was nobody there to help. After a minute or two, a man came to take our order.  He definitely loved his job... not.  After Mr. Ray of Sunshine took our order he forgot to give us our drink cups and walked away.\n\nI volunteered to wait at the register to get the drink cups while the rest of the party I was with sat down.  The girl working the drive through window kept looking over and ignoring me as I stood there trying to get her attention.  She kept huffing and puffing and stomping around.  Finally after looking at me six times (yes I counted) she says "Ugh, did somebody help you?" I mentioned that we did not receive our drink cups.  So she stomped over and goes "here" and slams our drink cups on the counter.  Wow, sorry for making you take an extra 4 steps to help a customer when there is no one even in the drive through line!  \n\nAfter the drink cup fiasco, it took about 15 minutes to get our food.  Once again I know I\'m not paying for 5 star service, but I could probably make the tacos I ordered faster in my own kitchen.  Especially when there are only 5 people in the whole restaurant. \n\nWe finally got our food and started eating. Then an employee still in uniform starts noisily talking on his cell phone behind the counter about how "I\'m getting off work in about 10 minutes, blah blah blah, let\'s make our entire nights plans while being extremely rude to the customers".  Can\'t this conversation wait until you are off work?! This was highly unprofessional... and annoying.\n\nAside from the aggravating customer service, the restaurant was clean and my tacos turned out decent. \n\nAll in all, I would suggest using the drive though, at least then you have minimum contact with the extremely rude employees.  Or better yet, go to a different Taco Bell with pleasant employees.'

They lay out their salad underneath the meat so they can increase their profit margin. \nI understand it's a tough business and they're in Paradise Valley, but I cannot see myself coming back as a customer when I feel cheated on my meal."

S'I\'m not thrilled with Italian food.  A lot of it is too thick and heavy for me to handle.  A lot of the flavors seem to run together, though this may be an indictment of specific restaurants.  Not to mention nearly every Italian restaurant thinks it offers some rare, niche cuisine and charges accordingly.  Come on, you can find the same boring Italian spot in every neighborhood everywhere.\n\nI do like Carmella\'s enough to give four stars.  Reason #1?  No predictable, "we\'re a very, very special Italian restaurant with very, very special food," attitude.  The dishes are basic and tasty.  Not too heavy, not too thick.  The service I\'ve experienced is consistently attentive and thoughtful.  Pricing seems fair for what you\'re getting.  \n\n\nA good example of a family-owned establishment that gets it right.'

S'I stopped in to get a quick lunch with my friend.  We decided to get a full size turkey bacon avacado sub and split it.  Glad we did because they ended up being about 8 inches long each!  The owner(?) didn\'t seem to mind at all either and was very nice and friendly.  \n\nIts a great combination and I thought the bacon was kind\'ve crunchy but very tasteful.  Its not one of those very thin microwavable kind.  However, I thought it was very hard to eat.  The bread is basically sliced in half (so there\'s no "end wall" to eat against), and then meat, tomatoes, onion, avacado and bacon was stacked high in between.  And I mean high.  Its like the kind of sandwiches you see in a cartoon except unfortunately my mouth can\'t stretch out real wide like the characters usually do.  All in all it was the most difficult and messy sub I\'ve ever eaten.  \n\nAlso, I wasn\'t a big fan of putting a whole slice of onion on the sandwich.  I love onion, but I like it kinda split up and spread over the whole thing, not a whole slice in the middle.\n\nAnd I\'m right there with the whole styrofoam/soup thing.  I watched as they do it and was very glad I didn\'t get any.\n\nI think I would come back and try something else.  Its just that I would have to eat it in private...'

We have been to Italy twice this year and eating here is just as good. Many of the customers are repeats, and for good reason -- it's a quality place. It has about 20 tables and a four seat bar, the wine list is adequate and the food choices superb. Seafood risotto, several pasta choices, veal and fresh fish are available nightly, and if you try one of the Italian deserts you will be hooked for sure. If you want a quiet, friendly and very memorable Italian meal, this is your choice in Scottsdale for sure."

S'Well it only just opened this week and from what my fabulous friend who picked up a yummy pizza for us last night stated, " I am happy I came in when I did because if I would have waited 5 more mins, it would have been a very long wait as that place was packed! Not a single table was open when I walked out with our food"  Not bad for the first week huh?\n\nWe had a mushroom, ham, pepperoni, cheese pizza that was cooked to perfection. The crust was thin but not cracker thin like some places. There were tons of mushrooms, ham, and pepperoni sprinkled all over the pizza. The cheese was gooey and yummy (is gooey a word?) As a matter of fact, I had either a piece of mushroom, ham, or pepperoni in every bite. We pretty much finished off the large pizza, which was cut into squares and not slices (which I am a fan of by the way). Very good pizza if I do say so myself. \n\nNow the wings we had, well they were ok, but I will give them another try at later date. I mean they weren\'t bad, but I have had much better. \n\nThey do offer deep dish however they are still waiting for their pans to come in in order to make that dish. (Remember they only just opened this week) They do not offer delivery just yet, but seeing as its lets than 2 mins away I would need to be smacked if I asked them to deliver. I can be lazy if I want to dang it! \n\nSo give them a try if you are ever on this side of town. You just may be pleasantly surprised.'

I think we were the only tourist there.  I liked the restaurant a lot.  Service was good and the food was very good too.  I liked the way the menu was done, no meal would cost more than $40 a person for the full courses.  We had the scallops and foie gras for appentizer and they were great.  I had the Lapin (rabbit) was was good.  My Parents had the veal and cod which was good too.

S"So here's the deal on JITB.  In the 5 years we have lived in Buckeye we have only gone through the drive thru at this location.  We have only gotten the oreo shakes.  (Little tip if you bring them home and put them in the freezer for a couple of hours they are simply awesome you eat them with a spoon)  So yesterday my wife and I decided to stop in here and get some of the food.  The service was very friendly as it always has been. The dinning room was cleanish, but for whatever reason the men's bathroom was closed.  The food honestly was not good.  A couple of cheeseburgers, an order of curly fries, a couple of tacos that I have heard people rave about, and a drink.  The meat on the burgers is obviously a frozen patty that was overcooked and dry.  The fries were ok, but the tacos were not that good, and I cannot figure out why people would rave about them.

Ken and Demi (husband and wife co-owners with a wildly unpronouncable last name) have a small but ample space in downtown Charlotte.  Because of the size of the space it feels very intimate as you are able to see the food being made and get to tell the cook what your toppings are.  \n\nI had one Jumbo Vienna Beef Chicago stlye dog.  For those who are yet to discover the beauty of a Chi-dog, it is topped with bright green relish, mustard, fresh cut tomato's, pickles, sport peppers, fresh cut white onion, and celery salt.  Lots of bright flavors on top of a warm salty dog.  It is served on a warm poppy seed bun.  It's a treat!  \n\nAfter having a chinwag with the owners and downing the dog, I got back on line and got another, this time with spicy brown mustard.  Nice!\n\nNow, there are more things on the menu; Beef Sandwich, Brats, etc. but I just went for the signature dish and am duly impressed. And the 101 health inspecton doesn't hurt either!\n\nEat Well\n\nV-dub"

S'Let me start by saying I\'m brazilian from Rio de Janeiro and I truly know what a brazilian place should be in several different levels.\n\nWe decided to go to Le Milsa and experience some of the food we miss from Brazil. We were appalled to find a place that if not for the tacky Macaus and brazilian flag not to mention the TV sets showing the Carnival parade in Rio we would never imagine this is a Brazilian place. \n\nStraight to the point the food is BAD (WITH CAPITAL LETTERS) and I mean B-A-D ! The side orders are poor and any comparison with a brazilian churrasco is an offense to say the least.  Grilled champignon ? 1 (one) sweet potato ? They\'ve got to be kidding me. No fries ! No yucca ! No Farofa !  Not even the easily found "pao de queijo"  (cheese puffs) were served. That is simply insane !  For the meat we got the famous Picanha (really hard to eat, bad taste, poor cut and bad look), Lamb (seriously ?), Filet Mignon (which was an "ok"  for us). The sausage was good and we didn\'t try the chicken.\n\nWe asked for some chicken heart and the waiter said they did not have that but that we could find it at IGA (which is a supermarket for those reading this review who do not know it). Really ????? All brazilians in Montreal know where to find sausage, Picanha, Guarana Antarctica (I didnt even bother to ask if they had it), chicken heart and (c\'mon !) pao de queijo !\n\nFor dessert they had vanilla ice cream which in an odd fashion came with cinnamon (why ?) and a shocking grilled pineapple with cinnamon too. (that\'s it that\'s all) Are you serious ?\n\nAt this point mentioning the lack of smiles from the staff and the manager\'s refusal to change our reservation from 6:30 to 7:30 (he could move it to 7 only) considering the place was only 5 or 10% full in an optimistic perspective is pointless.\n\nWhat about the spanish music soundtrack ? No wonder everybody thinks Brazilians speak Spanish instead of Portuguese. What a shame ! SHAME SHAME ! \n\nPricewise the tab was 86 dollars (tax, tip included and 2 coca colas).  If not from the Groupon coupon this is a major rip off and if want some tasty homey brazilian food hit Cafe Guanabara on Du Parc Ave. The premises may be simpler but the food is authentic and good.\n\nIf I could do minor changes, I would turn off the TVs and put some amazing pictures from brazil with its nature, cultural aspects and sports sensation. Samba enredo is definitely not the best ambiance for supper and if the customers want to watch almost naked woman they have no shortage of places in Montreal with more privacy.'

S'I eat here a lot, only because the only other "Chinese Food" restaurant in the Fashion Show Mall Food Court, is Panda Express. \n\nThe Chicken is good. I\'ve ordered many different types, no complaints so far. I tried the Blackened Fish once, after many people suggested it. It really wasn\'t to my personal liking. I could only take a few bites... Luckily I saw a handicapped man digging through the trash... I went and got a clean fork, and gave it to him to eat. So it went to good use. \n\nIt\'s a clean place. I\'ve eaten here for years, it\'s always been very clean. There has been many times the Health Department closed almost every establishment in the Food Court, this was one of the few that remained open. \n\nThe service is not very good. I think there\'s a huge language barrier between the 2 women up front, and English speaking customers. \n\n\nI rated this place 3 Stars, because it\'s not a fantastic business. If I was able to give half stars, I would\'ve rated it 2 1/2 stars. Although the food is good, the only protein  they offer is chicken, and blackened fish. There are many places that have "Chicken" in the name, that also offer tofu, and beef options. Also, the service. I\'d eat there more often if they had a better staff.'

This is very uncommon in "China Town" so this is another reason why I will never change my mind about Seoul Oak. They have some of the best selection for a pretty standard price. \nFor the Korean grilling, it\'s $16.99 for AYCE. \nThe banchan changes based on what resources they have but, overall it\'s always good! I LOVE their kalbi, and they even have dessert at the end, which is usually rice punch (MMMMM!!).  \n\nI\'d recommend it to anyone who is a carnivore and is looking for something away from the strip and main China Town.'

S'Make sure you do not say "I\'m craving meat" out loud in the presence of unknown men. Be specific and say "I am craving Maison de Kebab" because this is hands down, the best, THE BEST, kebab joint in Montreal!\n\nDon\'t be fooled by the humble exterior of this little Persian resto that could. With it\'s 8 or 9 tables, usually filled with Iranian patrons, and Iranian satellite TV on,  plain tables and chairs, Spartan surroundings, these people make meat addictive!\n\nFirst off, the one dish you absolutely have to start with is the Mirza Ghasemi, a pur\xc3\xa9ed eggplant dish that must have crack cocaine in it, you cannot stop eating it, it\'s *that* good. In fact when you\'ve scooped up the last shred of it, you\'ll start to wonder if you should order another helping. By all means do.\n\nThen there is the rice, a long, delicate, fragrant variety reminiscent of Indian basmati , but it isn\'t basmati rice, infused with saffron, a clodd of rice with melted butter and topped with a generous helping of dried, tart red barberries ( Zereshk Berries), giving each mouthful a jolt of sweet, tart yumminess. For a $4 charge, you can ask for extra berries and they will give it to you.\n\nThen there is the meat.\n\nDear Reader, you have truly not lived until you have the grilled meat done like the way they do it here. Moist, savoury and done just right, you will develop an addiction. You will crave it  like no other. The days where you suddenly develop a craving, you will wonder if you can jam in a quick visit to La Maison de Kebab. \n\nThis is one of the things I love about Montreal, that small, hidden, dives, with no fanfare, no marketing, no following, still serves better food than some of these more pricier, popular joints where you are paying more for the attitude than the food itself. Who needs that? Go to La Maison de Kebab instead.'

S"The one aspect of this exceptional little jewel of a restaurant on Leith's Constitution Street that never fails to astound me, is the double take inducing reasonability of the prices, considering the quality and outright deliciousness of the food you receive. \n\nYou can eat like a king in every sense, as the food is fantastic, plus there's no need to do anything miserable like opting out of having a starter or desert because you can't afford it. Having three courses plus whatever tipple you're in the mood for will still leave you with plenty of change to spare, which should absolutely be put towards a generous tip for the lovely staff (and compliments to the chef of course). If I was one of these people that had a bottomless pit of a stomach, I would even consider ordering a couple of dishes per course to sample, such is the appeal of everything on the menu. The restaurant's interior is clean lined and immaculately finished, and has a really fresh feel to it \n\nThe proprietor and head chef at Leith Lynx, Brian Donkin, has previously been at the helm of numerous bars and restaurants in Edinburgh and the Leith area, so has many years of food craftsmanship and successful business running behind him. Knowing all this, I felt pretty assured that my first meal here would be far beyond average, and I wasn't disappointed, and never have been since on subsequent visits. \n\nAfter coming here for the first time, I felt so irritated at myself for spending half my bank balance in establishments in the centre of town for so many years, for really standard food in really standard environments, when I could have made the effort to come to Leith and sample some of the tasty brilliance on offer here.\n\nMy most recent meal at Leith Lynx was a lunch time meeting with my brother, and I deliberately refrained from eating breakfast so that I could fill my gluttonous chops with as much as possible. I went for the French onion soup to start, a favourite soup variety of mine, which was entirely flavoursome and came with just the right amount of Gruyere cheese. This was followed by the fish special of the day, which was lemon sole in an indulgently creamy sauce served with mashed potato. The texture of the fish was perfect, and tasted like it had been plucked from the sea five minutes before it was served. All the fish here is amazingly fresh, and there are a great range of seafood options to be had on both the lunch and dinner menu, plus an amazing game pie, and meat dishes including venison and lamb.  My brother went for the smoked salmon with lemon to start, followed by the veal meat dish of the day, both of which he commended very highly.\n \nLeith Lynx is definitely meant to be a place to feel at home at, with its classic and delicious dishes with a twist, and the prices here make it a restaurant you can visit regularly, without worrying about spending a fortune."

S"Third times a charm??? Well, no.\n\nOK the first time was opening weekend, so the service was whack. Our party had ordered Stromboli, individual pizza, and a meatball sub. For starters I had ordered a small side salad and my friend ordered some cheesy garlic bread. The first thing out? The meatball sub. 10 mins later the garlic bread... then 10 mins after that the entrees, and after asking 4 different people I finally got my starter side salad after I finished my pizza! OK, so everyone said the food was decent, well except for my friend with the meatball sub, but he never likes anything so I can't really count him. The individual pizza was pretty good. I had crispy with pepperoni, pineapple and red onions. \n\nSo the next time was during the week for lunch. I called in my order on my way home from lunch. I ordered the same individual pizza again. I had a 20 minute drive from work, so I figured it would be ready. I get to the store to pick up my lil pizza and a 105 year old lady was working the register. It took her 10 mins to ring me up. Srsly!!! Then she was just holding on to my debit card the whole time.. that bugs me for some reason. I actually had to ask 3 times for her to hand me my card back.. apparently she can't hear very well?\n\nThird time's a charm???.. nope. Me and hubby were starving after bowling and decided to call in a pizza to pick up. See this place is like one block from our house, so that's why we decided to give them another chance, plus the pizza is actually decent, just the service is crap. So we called in our order which took 10 mins on the phone.. should have took that as a sign not to continue. Hubby had to repeat order 3 times and was put on hold at least 5 times during ordering ONE pizza! OK, drive 20 minutes to pick up pizza, hubby runs in and waits.. and waits.. and waits. I'm trying to practice my patience skills so I think perhaps I am being irrational, but then I start timing our wait. Yep, 20 mins he's in store waiting... add that to the 20 minute drive and that's 40 minutes for a call in... and they don't look too busy to me. Apparently they sent our pizza out with the delivery guy.. oh, they didn't tell us this... my hubby just observed their behavior. They started freaking out and whispering when he asked the status of our pie. They started shuffling and making a new one really fast. Seems they were too busy playing around throwing things at each other in the kitchen to pay attention to what they were doing with the completed pizzas, this I saw from the parking lot. I called hubbs from parking lot and asked if he had already paid, when he said no I told him to walk out. Screw that! I could have picked up a frozen pizza from the grocery store, properly pre-heated my oven and baked it at home all before getting my already called in order! SRSLY!!!!\n\nThe pizza is decent, but I don't think I'll be back."

It's a very small take out place with about 6-8 dishes.  There are some other things like wraps, etc.  They had a special of 1 chicken dish with rice & naan for $6 bucks so how can you go wrong with that.  I ordered the chicken curry.  The portion size was a little small but the curry was very flavorful.  The naan had been sitting around and could have stood to be reheated a bit.  But overall not a bad place.  Since I'm not too knowledgeable about Indian Cuisine I'll have to bring some of my coworkers here and see what they think.  There are not too many Indian places downtown and Flavors of India is pretty OK."

I've had many mediocre Asian meals since I've moved to Montreal from L.A., but this, by far was the worst food I've ever had in my life. \nThe server truly has no heart in this job. I ordered imperial rolls appetizer. I had to ask for chop sticks- I'm Asian...I'm like, dude, what Asian in right frame of mind would eat Vietnamese food with fork and spoon????\nThe imperial rolls were greasy and bland. All you can taste was cabbage. I also asked the server if they had pho. He pointed out at some chicken noodle soup so I thought I would give it a try.(in their defense, it did not say pho, but he didn't tell me that wasn't pho, he just said that was it) When I got it, it was definitely NOT pho, but some bland noodle soup with cheap cooked chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and carrots thrown on top. The taste? What taste? It had no flavor. Did they forget to put MSG or whatever they use to flavor the soup? \nI don't even know what that was but definitely not pho, and even if it wasn't, it had absolutely no flavor to it. \nI don't understand how anyone can eat here and think its remotely close to being authentic. I'm sure the owners are enjoying cheating & making money off of people who has no clue what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like. This place is a scam! How can they feed such bad food and call it a business? People need to stop giving money away to business like this. If you got money to waste on Ahn-Tai, give it to charity!!"

What light through yonder window breaks, it is the east and Purslane is my sun! \n\nIt was a beautiful sunny lunchtime when we came in here for lunch, and the sun carried on shining on my tastebuds as we had the two course lunch for 12 pounds. What great value for such great food!\n\nWe were made to feel very welcome, and the casual fine dining experience to me is all about relaxed good service with excellent quality food. The service was brilliant and it was clear everyone here is passionate about good food and making every trip here special.\n\nI started with the smoked salmon blinis which was fresh, rich and beautifully presented. The pan fried hake was delicious and has to be up there as one of the best fish dishes I've had. I really did spend the whole afternoon afterwards finding myself just going 'hmmmmm' at the memory of it.\n\nUnfortunately we were under a bit of time pressure, so I'm already planning a return visit with some more time to enjoy a leisurely lunch or dinner at what is now my top picks  Edinburgh restaurant.\n\nAnd the best thing? You get a QR code on a card with your bill that allows you to go and buy Paul and other excellent Edinburgh chefs recipes, so you can recreate the fine dining experience at home with friends and family. What a fantastic idea! I've already cooked the roast rump of lamb with a herb crust for some friends. \n\nBut it won't be stopping me coming back for the real experience of being so wrapped in the sunshine of service and taste that is Purslane."

A lot of them varying slightly from the usual lunch deli fare, with a wide selection of Italian hams and cheeses.\n\nI had a piadine with pancetta, cream cheese and garlic. It was awesome!

St Pat's Party this year brought me in originally and the great experience each time brings me back. I went this past Tuesday for Free Wing night and saw a different side of Jamison's. It wasn't overly busy, which for free wings surprised me, and seemed very laid back. I met up with a friend there and after a few tweets more showed up. This is the the kind of place I can go to kick back and watch a game and chill and then come back on the weekend and turn it up a notch. \n\nNow for the food. Most bars on free wing night tend to downgrade the quality of wings or don't put much effort into it. Not here. Hearty wings and cooked perfect. The deal is you get 5 free wings for your first drink, 5 free for your second drink, and then $.35 each after that. You can easily come out spending less than $20 and I wasn't buying macro beers either. Come with friends and you can have all of the flavors. I had Chipotle BBQ which was sweet and backed more heat than their hottest wing, Garlic Parm which was well balanced on the garlic and parm, Buffalo Ranch could have used a little more sauce but I like my ranch wings sloppy.\n\nOverall this is a gem in Dormont you seriously need to consider and I can't thank my friend enough for turning me on to them. they get 5 stars not for one thing but bringing enjoyment at everything. I've also seen the intense bacon menu they bring and one table ordered burgers that looked immense.  I'm ready to go back now!"

The Shrimp Korma was too sweet and the texture of the sauce too thin - I'm used to some amaaaaazing indian food in my home city so I wasn't wowed, but since I paid less than half of what I usually pay for Indian, I wasn't too disturbed. The basmati rice was passable but plain and the naan was decent quality. \n\nWhat made this two stars for me was the delivery service. I gave them the address to a hotel. The guy showed up and handed me a bag, then told me that he didn't have a way to put a tip on my card that I had provided earlier. Once that was taken care of with some cash, I opened the bag to discover that all I had was food. No utensils, no napkins. When making the order, I specified medium heat. There was none.

S'Update: 10/17/09\n\nWell, now that i\'ve been in AZ a few years, I\'ve gotten to try a few other Cuban places. Havana Cafe is no longer my go-to place, though it\'s definitely not a BAD place. Still 3-stars worth. But if you want something more like HOME (in a Cuban home), you\'ve got to go with Mimita\'s on Warner in Chandler, or Sabor Cubano on Camelback in Phoenix - in that order. \n\nOriginal Review:  I\'m a transplant from la sag\xc3\xbcesera of Little Havana in Miami, Florida, to the Southwest. Sometimes I get homesick for the stuff I took for granted before leaving my home.\n\nHavana Cafe is a decent stand-in for Mami\'s cooking, but most definitely not a substitute. The menu is extensive, and includes some foods from other Caribbean islands, besides Cuba, like Puerto Rico.\n\nI\'ve been here now about 3 times, and always end up ordering the Ropa Vieja, because that is my favorite Cuban dish. One time I got it with the white rice, but because I am always trying to stay on the healthier end of the spectrum, passed on the rice the last two times. I definitely always order a side of frijoles negros (black beans), and a side of tostones (twice fried, squashed plantains). \n\nThe first time I went with a former client and her husband, just after moving here. When she found out I\'m Cuban, they wanted to take us here to get my opinion on how "authentic" this is. Like I said, it isn\'t my mom\'s cooking, but it\'s pretty darn close to authentic in many ways. Some of the stuff on the menu, I would never find on a menu in Miami either because it\'s not Cuban, or because it\'s not something you eat at a restaurant, only at home. For example guava and cream cheese - that\'s a  dessert you make at home. I remember my dad opening a can of Ancel casco de guayaba, slicing up a stick of cream cheese, and even putting a little bit of dulce de coco on top... Yet, here it was on the menu. It\'s all good. \n\nOn another visit, I took my parents who were in town visiting for a week. My father was disappointed and lambasted everything from the food to the "curtains from JC Penney" on the windows. I think he was more upset that his daughter was not as unhappy away from home as he had hoped so that she would return sooner (if ever). My mom enjoyed her food. My husband who isn\'t Cuban enjoyed his food as well. I can\'t remember what they ordered, but everyone was OK except my dad. He even nit-picked about the way the items were all on one plate. He said, "in a REAL cuban restaurant, they don\'t put your meat, rice and beans all in the same plate! You get three separate dishes! this is NOT authentic. How dare they..." He even complained to the manager about this! It was ridiculous, awkward and uncomfortable, and eventually just hilarious because we could totally see that he was just having a hard time dealing with me happily living a bazillion states away.\n\nTangent... sorry.\n\nAs for the food - damn good. Great flavor, generous but not absurd portions. Service a little slow in getting the food out (which is probably a good thing!), but very attentive staff. My glass was never hurting for water (a pet peeve of mine, when I have to flag a server down so I can get  a sip of water). \n\nThe most recent time I went was last month for my birthday. A good friend of mine shares a birthday with me, down to the minute (is that crazy or what?!). So we took each other out for dinner.  She ordered the Arroz con Pollo and I ordered the usual Ropa Vieja. She got Platanos Maduros Fritos and I got Tostones. For dessert, I was going to order a flan, because it just rounds out a Cuban dinner nicely, but they brought out a chocolate bread pudding on the house with some candles on it! It was pretty darn good, too! I would have never ordered that, but now that I know how good it is, I might in the future.\n\nI also noticed a modest set up for a musician near the front of the restaurant and the server informed me that they have live music on Friday and Saturday nights. Nice!\n\nCheck out the website, too - they have tons of events going on: mojito classes, wine tastings, happy hour, mojito mondays, and more. I\'m not into much of that, and would just rather show up when it\'s low-key for a meal, maybe stick around for some music. But as my mom says, "para el gusto se hicieron los colores..."\n\nSo I plan to continue frequenting this place a few times a year when I get so homesick I can\'t stand it anymore. However, I\'d like to try Babaloo and Sabor Cubano before officially declaring any particular Cuban place my go-to here in the desert.'

S'Sometimes you\'re just in the mood for old-school thin crust pizza, and when this mood strikes you\'re not going to do much better than Buck\'s.  I\'m told they\'re a Madison institution and I can believe it.  Their thin crust pizza reminds me of the impossibly delicious pizzas of grade-school birthday parties and post-ballgame pizza parties.  Sweet tomato sauce, crispy thin crust and tons of cheese - this is the stuff memories are made of!\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, I usually go for Falbo\'s or Roman Candle for take-out in Middleton and I tend to prefer the fancy specialty pizzas like the Professional or the Italian Stallion.  But if I\'m feeling nostalgic for a simple pepperoni and cheese (and there will be a lot of cheese, mind you) Buck\'s is the first place that comes to mind.  The place is take-out only and the hours definitely aren\'t for the late night crowd - I believe they close at 8:45 although the menu says 9.  The prices are very reasonable, especially if you don\'t add many toppings.  And finally, I haven\'t gotten this in years and I don\'t know if they still offer it, but you used to be able to get a "ball of dough" for a buck, which you then could take home to make your own large pizza.  It was like DIY take and bake.'

S"Let's all agree that most Madison take-out pizza is bad.  Of course you have Lombardinos, Pizza Brutta, Porta Alba and the like, but I don't classify those as take-out.  \n\nGlass Nickel is terrible (why don't they cook their dough?).  \n\nFalbos - enh (cheap cheese...in WISCONSIN!)\n\nRosati's - cardboard (and expensive).  \n\nRoman Candle - how do they stay in business?\n\nSo on to Bucks...\n\nThe ingredients at Bucks are cheap but the pizzas are not.  If I wanted a cheap pizza I would go to Pizza Hut for $10 with unlimited toppings.  \n\nWhat I DO want is a place that can do simple, good, take-out pizza. \n\nIn addition to the cheap ingredients, their sauce is bad.  It tastes like it came straight from a can (which I'm sure it did).  Also, no cardboard pizza boxes there so be prepared for cold pizza when you get it home.  If I wanted to use my oven I'd make my own pizza or get a frozen one. \n\nThey put the toppings (onion in our case) UNDER the cheese.  So basically the toppings stay raw and stew in the canned sauce.  \n\nAs I write this I'm really tempted to slash my rating to one star..."

S"After seeing their restaurant week special, I couldn't resist and made reservations for four. When we arrived, there were only a few other tables with customers. The rest of the small (40ish seats) restaurant was empty. Our server quickly opened our wine (BYOB) and asked if we had any questions about the menu. She explained that the restaurant week menu included a side salad and dessert. I went with the pork chop for my main entree while hubs opted for the rabbit gnocchi. Soon we were presented with a bread basket and EVOO dip. We gladly munched on it until our salads arrived. The house dressing was the best part of this course. Soon after, our entrees arrived. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, very moist and tender. However, the fruit it was topped with (what appeared to be figs and plums) seemed to be tossed on top in very large chunks albeit whole pieces. I would have enjoyed this much more had the fruit been chopped into smaller pieces. I also did not care for the accompaning peppers. I was able to sneak in a few bites of hub's gnocchi and was much more impressed with his dish. Next course was our option of dessert. Hubs and I split the oreo mouse cake and took home the strawberry shortcake. The oreo mouse cake was definitely my favorite part of the meal. Overall, I would definitely go back to SL in the future if the opportunity presented itself."

It was very unappealing to see them carefully weigh the side portion of potatoes - OMG don\'t accidentally give me one potato chunk too many! loss of profits!!\n\nService was rather friendly on my visit, and perhaps it was because someone seeming to be in a managerial role was working "the line". \n\nProbably everyone has had a slice of sbarro and there\'s nothing special to write home about.  Side potatoes were a little too oily.  Mall crowd is lame, even though I admit I\'m part of the crowd if I\'m there.\n\nI\'m still miffed about the $7 "deal".  I\'ll go to a local place next time.'

To honor this tradition, my mom and sister took me here for my first, "welcome home meal" after they picked me up from the airport. \n\nWhat. A. Disappointment.\n\nService was the slowest i\'ve ever encountered! It was 11am on a Wednesday, and the restaurant had maybe 5 other tables full..

The waitress explained the beers on tap, I went for a Fat Tire, only to find they were out, so I went for a Sam Adams, they were also out.. at this point I just asked her for something wet to sip on...  it took TWENTY minutes to get our drinks.. and we hadn\'t even put in our food order.. I was ready to leave. I am impatient as it is, but shit, sitting in a plane for 5 hours next to 2 5 year old put me in no mood for BS. I just wanted a beer, and I just wanted a pulled pork sandwich. My mom asked me to settle down and suck it up, so I did. \n\nAfter waiting forever and ever, we finally got our food. The sister got the fried Zucchini, The mom got the Apple spiced pork loin, and I got the BBQ pulled pork. The food was just as I remembered, delicious with a good BBQ flavor. That is the only reason I am giving this place any stars, is because of this fact. \n\nI would like to say that I will return, but certainly not to this location.

S'Hidden in an office building with barely any nearby parking, this eatery is easy to miss. Their 3003 N Central Ave. # 118 Phoenix address can be very misleading. There isn\'t any signage or entrance on N. Central Ave.  Instead, it\'s all on the side street, Catalina Dr.\n\nCranberry Hills offers breakfast and lunch for dine-in, to-go pickup or delivery and catering. For breakfast, they offer a selection of omelets, egg sandwiches, baked goods and fruit. Their lunch menu consists of standard items such as cold sandwiches, salads, pasta, pizza, soups and bakery items. \n\nEverything on the menu is extremely reasonably priced. You can walk out the door with a huuuuge salad for less than $7. They also offer their salads in half sizes as well. The food is all around average. The ingredients could be a little fresher at times, and I\'m not too keen on the amount of iceberg lettuce that gets thrown into their salads. However they don\'t skimp on the toppings. Those extras get piled on top. This place is also CROWDED at lunch time. Everyone in that office park seems to eat there daily, and the parking is awful.\n\nMy favorite on the menu is #48 - the Orchard salad with a standard bed of greens, chicken strips, oranges, apples, jicama, dried cranberries and walnuts, served with country French dressing (that I usually switch out for their Roasted Red Pepper Fat Free dressing, just so save those extra calories). \n\nI\'ve also used this place for catering before and for the price it\'s very economical and fast. They will drop off your order and set up a really awesome and professional salad bar complete with all the fixings - salad mix, nuts, cheeses, an assortment of dressings, turkey, ham, chicken, fruit, tortilla strips, etc. I\'ve also used Cranberry Hills Catering for those last moment "oh no I forgot to order lunch and the meeting is in 4 hours from now" situations. They\'ve saved the day for me countless times!\n\nI wouldn\'t go out of my way to get their food for just an individual order. I mainly recommend this place for catering in addition to those last minute office lunch emergencies. They are fast and convenient if you work in the Mid-town Phoenix area.\n\nSince they don\'t have it on here, this is a link to their Web site http://bit.ly/cLvlvG'

S"As a connoisseur of hookah, I can say that this place knows their hookah. They use real lemonwood coals so that you're not getting all the extra carcinogens that are in the self starting coals. The service is fantastic with the guys coming around with fresh coals all the time. They put the coals off to the side so that the tobacco doesn't burn off immediately. You can smoke one packing well over an hour.\n\nThe prices are fair - 10.99 for the basic hookah in your choice of flavors. For a beginner, i'd recommend green apple, double apple (if you like licorice), watermelon, or anything fruitier blended with jasmine.\n\nI gave it four stars because of the lack of gourmet tobaccos, they only use the cheapest middle eastern variety (al fakher or cheaper) which uses decent flavors but crappy tobacco. The higher quality tobaccos are more expensive and thus I understand, but it'd be nice to have the option.\n\nAlso, drinks are 2.49 and you have to buy the bottle because a law in AZ says that there can be no open container at hookah bars.

S"No officer I am here for the pizza I swear. I am writing a review for Peter Piper Pizza?!? Have I lost my mind? Perhaps but that has nothing to do with it. We got coupons at work to entice us to try their new All You Can Eat Lunch Buffet. I took the free one. I won't turn down free food. None of my coworkers were willing to come with me. I think this place has got a bad rap for screaming kids and bad pizza. It was lunch time so there were not any kids. Well maybe 3 kids. There were a few other adults there for the buffet which runs Mon - Fri 11am to 2pm. It is normally $5.50 per person but I had the free coupon.\nNow the place was nice enough. Clean. Not too many video games. Just win ticket games. All kids want to do is win tickets to get crap that is shoved in the back of the closet after the first day but they just have to have it right then. They did have skeeball, air hockey and Pac Man. So that is at least something.\nThe selection on the buffet line was not to extensive. Three different salads and about 8 to 10 different pizzas with bread sticks and cinnamon dessert pizza. But the pizza was not too bad. It wasn't good either but better than some other chain delivery places. The dessert pizza was pretty good too. When I went back a second time for a few more slices they had a few pies that were fresh out of the oven and they were a little better. Pretty good piping hot out of the oven.\nWould I go back again and pay $5? Possibly. For all you can eat for $5 plus $2 for a drink it wasn't bad. Plus they had Coke Zero so extra points for that. Would any of my coworkers go with me? No. Too much of a reputation for bad pizza and screaming kids. They wouldn't believe me when I said it wasn't that bad. Would it be my first choice? Probably not but I might just come back at some point.\nIt is not the best pizza ever but it was better than I thought it would be. Better than some. It was quick and easy and I was back at work in plenty of time. For $5 I might go again at some point when I am craving all you can eat pizza. Give it a try. Don't just dismiss it based on face value and preconceived notions. If you don't like it you are only out $5."

The baklava she ordered was microwaved on the spot, so it was served warm.  There is a nice array of bottled beverages to choose from, including diet iced teas, sparkling juices, and yogurt drinks.  The cook also offered us a variety of healthy chips.  The place is small, and it looks pretty inside, especially the flat screen tv with CNN showing.  I will definitely be back!'

S"This has been the hardest star rating in a long time, wish I could give 2.5 star rating!  This was one of the more unusual / eventful meals out in a long time.\n\nI work nearby and have been watching the renovations of what used to be Rainbow Arch. I went here for dinner before going to the theatre as I was in the mood for oodles of noodles! \nThe renovations here feel like they have been started, and enough done to open the doors to the public and get some cash in the till to then do some more. \nThe drinks stock is very basic and the waitress advised that they will be getting more options in soon. The same must be for the menus as it literally is printed on A4 paper and stapled together! Paper table cloths and no music. The waitress had chunky black plastic glasses on with no lenses in them, fine as a fashion statement or in a themed restaurant but maybe not whilst working? \n\nI opted for tofu and pineapple with noodles and my husband had chicken in a black bean sauce and fried rice. The food was amazing, really really tasty and I was very pleased indeed with my meal choice indeed. Check out my pictures. The fried rice served in a bamboo box was fun and kept the rice hot to go back to. \n\nAnyway, we were three quarters through out meal when a mother and daughter who were also dinning started a disgruntled discussion with the manager that very quickly got louder and more involved, the manager was very composed and asked to discuss aside etc but the woman was now shouting and frankly disturbing every other diner. The just of it was that the mother had gone to use the bathroom and found them not up to standard and after a few shouts of environmental health this and disgusting that, lots of swearing and pulling the managers coat off him....the woman left!  The manager apologised and we were all a bit dumbfounded and looking around at each other. \n\nWe finished our meal and I decided out of total curiosity I had to go and check out the bathroom........wouldn't you?\nOk, so when I mentioned earlier about partly renovated it is the bathrooms that are the main culprits. The gents (the door was wide open, I didn't go in) had been a little updated but a bit grubby.  The ladies is right out of the 1970's with burgundy (alternative to the avocado suite) but rusty plug, taps and overflow. One sink out of order and only one cubicle had a light in it. In need of a good deep clean. Ok then I turned round to see the graffiti covered wall complete with marker pen drawings of male genitals!!! \nIt was so bad that I burst out laughing. I can clearly see why the woman wasn't happy with them but I certainly wouldn't shout the place down.\n\nSo, there you have it.  Great food but needing a lot more work done to bring the decor up to standard.  \nUndecided if I will go back?"

S"Either I'm missing something or the Priory is missing something because whatever it was just wasn't entirely right on my visit to the Priory Saturday night.  \n\nWere we too early?  We arrived just before 6 and left just before 7 so maybe that was the case, but I've never before been in a bar in Edinburgh on a Saturday night and had it effectively dead. I mean, I think there may have been four other people (two groups) before we arrived?  \n\nThe Priory is decorated in that standard way of wood meet industrial meet quirky accents. I like it, but it's not exactly clever anymore is it?  \n\nIt also looked like they had a function room downstairs (the Priory is surprisingly massive) which comedically contained bright purple upholstered booths.  \n\nThe other reviews talk about a good cocktail menu and while I love a good cocktail, boozy drinks aren't exactly on my radar at the moment so I gave this a pass. I did wish they had a few interesting non-alcoholic options as those on offer were pretty bog standard - Schweppes ginger beer, fountain soda, probably some juice, not much else. \n\nFlip side, the boys seemed happy with the small but adequate selection of draught beer and we were able to get a table no problem.  Additionally the girl who served us at the bar was very lovely and chatty. \n\nSo, all in all the Priory was a-ok for getting a pre-dinner drink but with all of the great bars in Edinburgh, I probably won't be rushing back."

S"I'm speechless!  The food, the environment, the staff, and most of all, the service is impeccable!  It's too bad that the Pumpkin Pecan was reviewed so horribly by these other patrons because I've found their reviews to be FARTHER from the truth!  One of THE biggest selling point for the Pumpkin Pecan is the fact that they have two restaurants in one; including President's Pizza.  As a take-out order, the personnel up front took their time to, not only listen to my order, but they took additional time to repeat the order back.  This is a service that's rarely seen or experienced at other local restaurants.  Another big selling point for them is their capability to get an order out in a timely manner AND have it taste as good as it does!  Coming from NY, this HAS to be one of THE best pizzerias that I've been to in all my time out west!  I'm thoroughly impressed with how neat and clean the front of the shop was!  There were a few of the girls cleaning the dinning area wiping down the tables, the glass, and making sure the floor was swept.  For me, this is HUGE!  I'm sold on the level of service and the A+ quality of the food!  By the way, the price is VERY reasonable in comparison to other pizzeria restaurants on the Strip and for the rest of Las Vegas.  Alex, the owner/manager, personally comes out to get to know his patrons!  Ironically, I got ALL of this for the short period of time I waited for my food which took a total of 10 minutes; from the front-end, the finalization of the transaction, and getting my order out to me.  I'm SO happy that I found them and believe me, my loyalty will be to the Pumpkin Pecan while I'm Las Vegas!  From the freshness of the food to the efficient staff, I would HIGHLY recommend the Pumpkin Pecan and the President's Pizza!  Honestly, the staff has to be the most knowledgeable, the most polite, efficient, and most of all, they have smiles on their faces; this IS not a common practice around these parts.  So if you depend on reviews like I do, take my word for it, this IS the place to order from!  Don't go anywhere else!  They have everything you need.  By the way, there was PLENTY of soda stocked in the refrigerator behind the counter AND they're open 24 hours!  What a place!"

S"Well I stopped by the Borgata the other day and noticed Slo Foods Organic Cafe and figured I would pop in for a bite with a friend. Right now, it seems that they are starting with a soft opening and might do a grand opening thing in a few weeks once they get the kinks out. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and will have a market next door where you can buy all the products they use. It's similar to Duck and Decanter, LGO and Herb Box DC Ranch in this regard but the market doesn't look like it will open for a few more weeks.\n\nThe atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing, the place has a nice patio overlooking the a the main square. Since Slo Foods Cafe is new and it was about 1:30p.m it was also very empty. I ordered the Avocado sandwich for and some iced Tazo green tea and my friend had a blackberry or blueberry juice (excellent) and the Turkey Burger. The food was good and I'm sure I'll go back once everything is a bit more set up. The management seems very receptive to feedback and I'm sure if you provide it they would try to incorporate it.\n\nI think this place has potential especially since they are so focused on obtaining extreme high quality organic ingredients. I'll be sure to stop by again."

In my case,  they state on Friday\'s its Free Brownies... I have gone there during lunchtime on Fridays and have never received a free brownie.\nWhen i ask about it i get double talk by waitress stating its only while "supplies last"... a convenient excuse to draw people in while Not honoring their advertizing which is boldly displayed on a large bulletin chalk board outside their pub..\nBe careful folks... they advertize with fork\ntongue...  its a shame that they need to stoup to that level... i dont like being duped and wont be going back... shame on you Murphy\'s Law.... you need to be honest with customers not to mention you are also understaffed and the time to receive meals are really excessive... its clear you cut on expenses in a number of ways that cheat customers.

I went there last night to meet my friend and her husband for dinner.  They are new to Chandler and we were thinking of places to go and I mentioned this place since I always wanted to go.  \n\nI walked in where on the right is the bar area.  There was live music from this guy who was just awesome.  The music wasn't too loud and I was still able to have a conversation with my friends.  Stacey was our server and she was patient and extremely knowledgeable  about the wines.  She recommended a bottle of Pinot Noir for us (though I was hesitate since I am not a red fan at all) and I am now a convert!  LOL, we ended up finishing two bottles. (I think I am still drunk)\n\nWe started off the night with the calamari for the appetizer.  The calamari itself was cooked perfectly, though I could have done with the sauces that were with it.  (A chipolte chili drizzle and a key lime red pepper sauce)  I ended ordering the Panko chicken with spinach, avocado and a side of fruit. (Trying to stay a little healthy)  It was amazing and cooked just right.  My friend had the Garlic Feta Shrimp Wrap that she said was great and her husband had the Tortellini...put it this way I never saw somebody finish a meal that quickly.  He loved it.\n\nI loved the atmosphere was this place...upscale without the pretentiousness.  The company definitely help, of course. I will be back for sure."

S'I wish I could choose no stars. This is one of the worst soul food restaurants ever. The people who are rating high on this place have ovbiously had worse. The prices were too high and the food was unseasoned. I just went today and paid $15 for just the meal and no drink. For that price, it should have included a drink and I was scared to ask for water for fear that I\'d be charged for it. It wasn\'t automatically brought out first like with most restaurants. \n\nThere were only 3 of us dining in today when I went and I walked over to the other table to see how they liked their food and they said their chicken was undercooked, as was mines a bit. Their greens tasted as if they\'d just dropped them in water and cooked them. No flavor what so ever. \n\nMind you..a couple of  their sides include baked potatoes and garlic mashed potatoes. At least that\'s what the menu said... I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes with gravy because I thought I was getting garlic mashed potatoes with gravy. What I got was one of their baked potatoes(skin inlcuded), smushed down on the plate with gravy on top of it. There was no butter, garlic, milk or any other ingredient to mashed potatoes. Apparently, the baked potato is the mashed potatoes...unmashed. Really???\n\nI left and took the two pieces of chicken I had left with the okra and left it at a bus stop for someone else to eat since I didn\'t want to throw it away, but everything else was left on the plate in the restaurant. Waste of my money, but I knew better than to go there based off the fact that there are never any cars in the parking lot. Reding these reviews and based on my own experience, you would think management would ask.. "why do we always only have groups of 3 at a time?"  \n\nWorse food ever and I\'m surprised they are still standing. I don\'t think they will be for long. If people think that is the greatest soul or southern food there is in Arizona, then I MUST open up one of my own, because I\'d make a killing if people are buying that nastiness. You people need your taste buds checked out. If this was delicious, you are obviously missing out.'

S'I visited Fusion a few weeks ago, so maybe my experience was due to the usual new-restaurant hiccups, but I can\'t really recommend it. The server was very nice but she was hostess, server, and apparently doing things in the kitchen. Some people walked in and left because they waited at the door forever without being seated. Many things we ordered were forgotten or brought very late.\n\nI\'m so torn because I had a plate of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde--the falafel was fresh and delicious and basically what I\'d been looking for in a falafel since moving to Arizona. The hummus was also very good. The french fries were also excellent! The pita bread, however, kinda ruined it. Something about the flavor of it was kinda off, but I can\'t quite figure out what it was. Usually I go to a Mediterranean place and think, "man! This pita bread is good. Man! This falafel tastes like it came out of a bag and wasn\'t even warmed up." And this was the opposite of that.\n\nConsidering that the pita innards were delicious, and service can always improve, I think this place has a lot of potential.

There are lots of other options for food on this concourse and I always bypass them all for a sub.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you pay a premium for eating in the airport.  A regular combo costs more than $10. Sometimes I guess it's worth it, though. Especially when it makes you feel sooo good inside."

S'I had a few friends who were fans of Boccacino\'s, but I never really saw what the big deal was. It\'s a chain (with annoying TV commercials, no less), and suffers from the usual chain problems: unimaginative food, predictable surroundings. \n\nThe atmosphere isn\'t too bad at this location, but it\'s still pretty "safe." The service, I\'ve found, can be erratic. One time, I came here in the afternoon and had a coffee while waiting to meet someone; once I got it, the waiter never came back, even though I was the only person in the place (or maybe because I was the only person). Anyway, I got so fed up when I wanted to leave that I threw some coins on the table and took off.'

This restaurant was the best Mexican Restaurant I have ever eaten at.  I would take people here knowing that they would love it.  The salsa and chips were amazing, never had anything like it.  They had chili rellenos to die for.  My two favorites were the beef enchilada and the green chili burrito enchilada style.  The rest of the food at Lily's was really just as good.  I really wish it was still open and we could all still be enjoying their wonderful food.  If for some reason they open back up please let me know.  I will take a 5 hour trip from California, stuff myself and drive back.  That's really how much i love this place.  R.I.P. Lily's Cafe, you are still always on my mind."

I usually hit this location because it's close to the office, they have a good chicken salad and they give me a big glass of water at no charge.  But the last couple times I have been through, they were out of large salad bowls (offering two garden salads with a side of chicken for the same price - um, no thanks) and refused my water request.  Apparently now if you want a glass of water that is larger than a thimble, you have to pay full soda price.  I don't mind paying for the cup inventory but I'm not paying for something I can get from my tap.  And thanks for making me beg for the cup of water which had no ice in it and you didn't give me a straw to drink it with.  Too kind!"

S"Great Chinese/Japanese buffet. I go here for lunch often, and I hear they have snow crab legs at night, but I haven't tried them. Cost for lunch is about $7 after tax, a little more than most, but not bad at all. It's nestled behind Fuddrucker's and once you are inside you feel so far away from the hubbub of the busy Matthews section near 51 and 74. The atmosphere is generally quiet and relaxed.\n\nThe food is great. You have the staples like Lo Mein, Fried Rice, General Tso's Chicken, but also lots of stuff you don't normally find in the Chinese take-out like whiting fish, fried eggplant, sushi (not particularly great, but hey, it's there), fresh mussels, bacon-wrapped scallops.\n\nI do tend to eat late lunches though, and if you're anything like me, get there before about 2:30 or so because after that the food starts to decline in quantity and quality.\n\nOverall, highly recommended Oriental buffet if you are in the Matthews area."

It's over 50 years old, and it's become such a local favourite they're some people who've been visiting for quite a few decades. The name is a little bit dodgy, but the food definitely isn't!\n\nThe restaurant specialises in Cantonese and Peking cuisine, and there's sooooo much choice on the menu it's difficult to decide what to have. Like many chinese restaurants, the desserts menu isn't elaborate and there is something with banana's in it; this seems to be a constant in just about any chinese restaurant I've been to! \n\nOne great sign in this restaurant is that there are actual Chinese people frequently eating there, as we all know its most difficult to please the home crowd."

But it makes me miss Brookline, MA.  Or the east side of Cleveland.  Or Bialy's Bagels, where people have lined up around the corner by 7 am on the weekend to get those complex-carb creations.\n\nBut the bagels are passable if pricey, the schmears are ok and I don't get angry when I eat one like I do when I wind up with a grocery store fluffer thingy that is supposed to be a bagel."

S"This place is located at the business school on the ASU campus. Because of classes at night and no other options except a few things at the MU at night when I had classes, this was the place to be. You can choose from burritos, salads, wraps, and bowls. Somehow each time I wound up spending at least $9-$10.\n\nThe food looks great but when you eat it, most of the options leave more to be desired. What would otherwise sound like an amazing meal, like a Thai Lemon Grass Burrito, always had me wondering where the lemon flavor was. It was aspects like that that left me give a 4 star review.\n\nThe people running the place don't seem too bad. I always caught them between 6-9 at night so maybe that has a factor to play. Every time I walk in they're welcoming, smiling, and ready to take my order. They make their food right there in front of you. You might not be able to pick and choose what you want on everything but you can substitute components, etc.\n\nSome of these reviews are funny because they clearly show that people weren't paying attention to what they ordered and the ability to see exactly what they're doing to make your order (think of it like how you can see what they're doing at Subway). And every single restaurant is unsustainable in some way. They wrap your meal up in paper if you get a burrito or wrap, only for you to toss it away later...who's unsustainable then? I guess some of these reviews are freshman in their 101 classes who are out to change the world."

I decided to go for the Montreal Smoked Meat, served on ciabatta (I think) and topped with homemade pickles. I quite liked this little doggy - you can definitely taste the smoked meat but the sausage isn't overly salty at all. The pickles were delicious and the bread was fresh. Personally, I thought the 'hot dog' was too big to eat with my hands so I grabbed a fork and knife and that was that. \n\nService: Super friendly!\n\nPrice point: A little expensive - one dog is $9.

The parking lot was so packed we almost changed our mind, yet the place was so large we were seated right away. The service was excellent, drinks were constantly refilled and plates were taken away consistently. \n\nThe Mongolian Wok part was really nice in the fact that you get to pick your meat as well as your veggies. They had shrimp, calamari, pork, beef and chicken. I put alot of shrimp and a little bit of calamari, then added some rice noodles and veggies. The Chinese food selection was nice, your standard buffet fare (orange chicken, honey chicken, beef and broccoli, etc.). My kids loved the BBQ pork spareribs. The crab legs were decent the hubby said. I tried the raw oysters and they were good too. My fave had to be the green bean dish and the asparagus dish. They were both cooked to the perfect texture and were so flavorful. They have soft serve ice cream and a selection of cakes and fruits, none of which I had room for. \n\nI googled the restaurant and found a coupon, so do the same if you plan on going. Oh, and they also started charging for drinks, which they used to include in the price of the buffet. The price for adults was 11.99 and the kids were 4.99.'

Not a single person that I have introduced to this place wasn't eager to find another excuse to come back ASAP.\n\nThey only take cash, which is a bummer, but seems pretty standard compared to other places.\n\nYou can actually sit down and order the food like a regular restaurant OR call ahead for a delivery (usually takes about 30-45 min) and pick up. \n\nDining in is great, as you get the Portuguese beer, bread and olives to keep you busy as you wait for your order (grilled calamari is out of this world! but sometimes requires 40min (worth it) to heat up the grill).\n\nThese guys are straight out of Portugal and know what they are doing.

But the picture of a pig with wings and a halo....BURNING IN FIRE....made me laugh. This isn\'t a restaurant. More like a takeout delivery place. We were greeted by:\n"Hi How are you?"  ~ Service with a smile.\n"Good...." ~ Universal answer for that statement.\n"Do you like baby back ribs?"  \n"yea" ~ Universal answer for that statement\n\nSounds of loud blues music playing in the background, and watching the guy in the back on the grill with my sample ribs.\n\nAs I sunk my teeth into these ribs my eyes opened up and mouth watered with joy when pulled the meat ever so tenderly off the bone...\nYes people. As long as I lived. This is by far the greatest babybackribs I have ever had. So I got a rack. Some coleslaw which was pretty good. But I\'ve had better. Mac and cheese - REALLY GOOD. I would say top 5 mac and cheese\'s I\'ve had. \nDude seriously. I had it again for an Easter party. We ordered 4 racks. I was told by old people that these were the best ribs they\'ve ever had.

S"I debated about whether to write this review at all, as I realize that if you can't say something nice don't say it at all, however this is a platform for the good and the bad. And well here, it is just bad. I was so sad I had to come here in the first  place as it was not my choice. I was going to get the chicken salad that they show on their online menu, however salad was not offered. So then there was no chicken sandwiches on the menu, which again is on the online menu. The cashier (possible manager?) said he would substitute chicken in for any of the hamburgers. So I bought the original with chicken instead of beef. Just wasn't in a beef mood. The cost was $8.95 + tax for a sad little grilled chicken sandwich with a underwhelming portion of cold fries. \n\nI would normally ask for hot fries but service was so horrible and I being on my lunch hour knew it would take an inordinate amount of time for me to get any fries that were hot. So I ate the small portion of cold fries. As to the sandwich again, just bad, the grilled chicken was okay, not fresh, but whatever... but my bun was really dry and fell apart. I didn't even take a picture to share because I was just so disgusted. \n\nSodas are also $3, I just got water. I asked for ranch dressing for the fries, they didn't charge me but took forever to get it. The cook put the ranch in the window and the server (using that term loosely) just walked away - I was three feet away from my ranch separated by a counter and I had to wait for the snail pace server to come back to that side of the restaurant. There is a pizza place joined with the Johnny Rocket's and the employees apparently work both sides, so if people are on the other side you are in for a really long wait. \n\nSo sad that $9 and lunch was wasted here."

S"Just so you know, we travel constantly for business and have been patrons at some of the best restaurants across North America. That being said, we are often more critical because we have seen some of the best and some of the worst. Either way, it has been fun!\n\n\nWow! We were walking down King st with no destination for dinner other than check out the local cute restaurants. We went into King street Trio to check out the menu and could have not been more welcomed by Andrew.  Holidays (in this case Family Day) often are slow in higher end restaurants. We have found in our travels across America  and Canada for business that  for whatever reason these restaurants hosts take out the slow day on walk-in traffic making you wish you never walked in because you did not have a reservation or know the secret handshake.\n\nNot here! Andrew asked us if we had a reservation, when we replied in the negative he immediately went into action telling us to pick any table we liked. He didn't just sit us and take off, he spent a few minutes acquainting us with the menu and drink menu.\n\nOur server Ashley was really great. Again, sometimes on a slow night you will get a server that mentally takes the night off and you constantly have to wave them down or they are practically sitting on the table because they are bored. Ashley was neither, she was on top of her game. \n\nAndrew came to our table to see how we were doing and we mentioned how much we liked the decor and the menu he showed us a recent favorable review (which raved about my meal & I concur). He was incredibly informative about the other restaurants within the umbrella of Trio, and explained the differences in menus to us.\n\nMy chicka is an odd gal, she is crazy friendly and chatty. Though show her a dirty restaurant bathroom & she wants us to pay for drinks and move on. She is a big believer in details, and if a restaurant cannot be bothered to keep a bathroom reasonably clean or soap filled... we are gone. Trio... was immaculate. \n\nI  had the Porcini Chicken Supreme. It was incredible. The Chicken was well cooked and tender but not over cooked by being stuffed. The stuffing of cheese and mushrooms was just enough yet not overwhelming or lacking.\n\nMy Chicka had the Pickeral which as Ashley described was a stronger tasting Tilapia. It was incredible! My chicka wondered why this native of the great lake's is not used more. A Google search turned up that this fish has smaller bones which can lead to trouble deboning. This just adds to our love for Trio, they take the time work with difficult fish for excellent results.\n\nAs we enjoyed the atmosphere &  finished our wine Andrew informed us that being travelers dessert was on the house. WoW!!!!!!!!!!!! Please order the desserts, their dessert chef is amazing!!!!!!!!!! To make it even more incredible, Ashley brought out some candied Almonds. Little did Ashley know that my Chicka packs a snack bag of mixed nuts for me to snack on... my chicka was not shy to let her know & laugh at how Ashley was now my new nut supply.\n\n\nSo we were finishing up and signing the check, Ashley brought out more candied Almonds because I must of had huge eyes and my Chicka made fun of my love of nuts. Seriously.... how nice!!\n\nBetween Andrew and Ashley we wish that the owners open up a Trio  in Chicago's River North so we can have an awesome restaurant that is i walking distance."

Even scarier is when the large group is celebrating an important life event, like an engagement party, where you want everything to be perfect.\n\nI will say that this new Milsa location on Ste-Catherine was able to deliver. Everyone got their food, drinks and the bills were all correct. The manager came on our side on multiple occasion to ensure everything went well, and it all did. Thank you for that, our friends had a fun engagement party and the staff was very professional.\n\nThe food in itself is the standard Brazilian churrascaria fair, well executed and delivered, but not transcendental either. You get what you pay for and that's fair.\n\nNow where it gets outrageously unfair is the price of drink 10$ for a Caipirinha,,,seriously ? drinks are way overpriced. I understand it's the name of the game, but there's a limit.\n\nThis minor annoyance aside, I recommend this location if you want to indulge in meat galore."

S'I don\'t normally review fast food places. Raising Cane\'s have been popping up around the valley and since I\'m a sucker for chicken fingers, I decided to try them out. The menu is simple: chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast and coleslaw (and a chicken finger sandwich.) I got "The Box" which included, 4 fingers, Canes sauce, fries, Texas toast, cole slaw and drink. When I got home and opened the lid, I immediately noticed the fingers were much much smaller than anticipated (about 3-4" long) The fingers  lacked flavor, were dry, and had way too much breading. The "canes sauce" had flavor, but very salty. The Texas toast- well it was just a thick piece of bread, nothing special.  So next time I have a craving for chicken fingers, I will go to my old stand by: Culvers!'

S'Im ehemaligen Weinbrenner\'s ist mittlerweile ein Lokal der Besitos-Kette. Und die scheinen ihr Gesch\xc3\xa4ft zu verstehen. Das sehr gro\xc3\x9fe Lokal wurde geschickt unterteilt in mehrere Bereiche. Quasi als Raumtrenner wirkt die wirklich gro\xc3\x9fe und ellenlange Bar. Auf der einen Seite, Richtung Innenhof und Terasse finden sich viele hohe Tische mit Hockern die durchaus auch zum Essen geeignet sind. Jenseits der Bar finden sich auf zwei Ebenen viele Tische in unterschiedlichen Gr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9fen f\xc3\xbcr kleinste und gro\xc3\x9fe Gruppen. Auch eine einladende Sitzecke mit Ledersofas und Hockern sowie ein offener Kamin findet sich hier. Das ganze wird geschickt durch Gel\xc3\xa4nder und Pseudo-Mauerwerk aufgeteilt. Wie ich finde, ein sehr angenehme Atmosph\xc3\xa4re.\n\n\n Im Gegensatz zu meinem "Vorredner" hat mich das Essen auch nach mehreren Besuchen nicht entt\xc3\xa4uscht. Ich habe verschiedenste Tapas probiert und die waren alle wirklich lecker. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Tapas-Bars in Karlsruhe ordert man hier nicht nach "St\xc3\xa4bchen", sondern erh\xc3\xa4lt jeweils einen kleinen Teller mit den Tapas-Gerichten. Pro Teller werden ca. 3 bis 6 Euro f\xc3\xa4llig. Und 3 bis 4 solcher Tellerchen muss man schon Essen um satt zu werden. Macht also 15 bis 20 Euro.\n\n\n Dar\xc3\xbcberhinaus gibt es auch "normale" gro\xc3\x9fe Gerichte. Hierzu kann ich aber nichts sagen.\n\n\n Bei der Besuchsplanung sollte man die "richtige" Uhrzeit ausw\xc3\xa4hlen. Von 17 bis 20 Uhr ist Happy Hour. D.h. alle Cocktails zum halben Preis. Ab 22:30 ist Fiesta Besitos. D.h. alle Coct\xc3\xa9les tradicionales zum halben Preis und alle Bebidas tradicionales zum Fiesta-Besitos-Preis. Und es hat absolut leckere Cocktails!\n\n\n Update 1: Die Bedienungen waren leider wiederholt nicht in der Lage die Tapas denjenigen zuzuordnen, die sie bestellt haben. Sie haben es nicht mal versucht. Das ist sehr \xc3\xa4rgerlich, besonders wenn man in gro\xc3\x9fer Runde bestellt. Es ist dann unwahrscheinlich, dass man das auch isst, was man bestellt hat.\n\n\n Beim letzten Besuch war es zudem so warm (oder eigentlich hei\xc3\x9f), dass wir das Lokal nach dem Essen verlassen haben um uns einen angenehmeren Ort zu suchen.'

I ordered the 2 item combo...my husband did the same. I got a Chile Relleno and Shredded beef burrito, he got 2 Chiles. Served quickly....was actually liking eat except in the burrito no beans...then I bit into a piece of hard plastic!

I like the staff, they're usually pretty friendly and they're all pretty hot. Except for one older woman. She's probably like the mom or something. Tall brunette cocktail server....tattoos....yea she likes to be bit. She told me - she had marks from her boyfriend. NOW THAT'S THE KINDA BARS I LIKE!!!\nDrinks are average. Went to a couple open bars here. This is definitely one of thos late night off the strip places. Right next to Club Paradise - across from Hard Rock Hotel, it's prime location to relive your hair metal days. Yes....Come to Rainbow, have a drink...then trash your hotel room. Now that's Rock....."

S'A friend and I walked by this place after seeing a film at the Cameo and decided to head in for dinner. It was so cute and cosy with a nice ambiance and the staff was kind, polite, and super attentive from the moment we walked in! We split the chicken satay and I had the chicken Pad Thai but it was all cooked to perfection with amazing flavours and beautiful presentation. Portion sizes were perfect. They have a rather extensive drinks menu and I got a very delicious cocktail.\nA little pricey for Edinburgh but an absolutely wonderful and worthwhile experience. Perfect for date night or as part of a nice evening out.'

However, the Sushi was excellent AND very affordable. Though the menu is fairly extensive, we stuck to the basics and had shrimp nigiri (no brainer), 2 lobster rolls (excellent), a Caterpillar roll (fighting over who got the last piece), edamme, 2 glasses of a decent Chardonnay (for me, not my daughter) and finished off with some white rice strawberry ice cream. . All of this was just $48 and tasted great!  I don't think it hurt that we sat at the sushi bar and watched the Dbacks win in extra innings. :) Me thinks this will become a regular sushi hang out for us.

S'The place that I was taking some training from ordered our daily lunches from this sandwich shop. Based on the menu we were given to select from I figured that the school was giving us a limited selection of the full offering to keep things simple when they have to order for a couple dozen people.\n\nAfter looking at the menu online I estimate that this is not the case. Sub Station II seems to be just a simple "Ham & Cheese" type of place. They have a selection of deli meats, a range of your typical toppings, and a few choices or bread or wrap. I don\'t think you\'re going to find a meatball or philly cheesesteak kind of sandwich here.\n\nThe first couple of days I gave the salads a go. The were kind of bland as you get a bed of shredded lettuce with pre-selected toppings and the sliced up deli meat. On the other days I gave a few sandwiches a try. They were alright. No complaints, but these subs certainly weren\'t anything beyond what I could make at home.\n\nWhat I did like about this place was that they delivered each sandwich in its own plastic container with our sides and cookie inside. They also wrote our names on the container so when it came time to eat there was no confusion about which sandwich was which.'

I may have got them on a bad day, but they managed to overcook the pasta to the point that it crumbled in my mouth. In a bad way. Also, don't order a Bloody Mary. They don't understand what it is. I'm fairly certain the last time I did what they gave me was tomato juice with black pepper. And that's it. \n\nBut, as far as university bars go, the Library Bar is the best one. It's also the one that looks least like a hole. It's got lots of pretty old books lining the wall. But beware! You're not allowed to touch. They're such teases. \n\nTo be completely frank, the best and possibly only good thing about this bar is that it's really cheap. You can get a pint for about 2.50. And their range is ok.

We pull up to a place called Vaqueros, small little hole in the wall and I prepare my taste buds for a delicious, satisfying meal.\n\nService was quick, staff were friendly, but the food just did no justice to my carnivorous appetite.  I ordered a carne asada plate w/beans and rice and corn tortillas.  The meat was dry and not seasoned, the beans and rice were bland and I might as well have been chewing styrofoam instead of their corn tortillas.\n\nDisappointing meal.  Being that the temperatures were still in the high 90's and humidity just choking me all throughout the day, a complaint at that point seemed futile.\n\nCertainly glad to be back home in California where real Mexican food is just a stones throw away.\n\nMy rating would have been a negative 1 had it not been for the well mannered staff.\n\nNo bueno Vaqueros."

The husband and wife who own and operate Sushi Mishima handle your entire experience gracefully and could not be any nicer without being too nice. The wife acts as the waitress while the husband prepares all of the sushi. \n\nInitially, the menu was a little underwhelming. The Cali Rolls and Spicy Tuna rolls were about as exotic as it got. However, when we asked about specialty rolls, the response was, "What do you want?" We ended up with a Philly roll, a Caterpillar roll and a Tootsie Roll, all made to order based on our requests. If you\'re not sure what is in a particular roll that you like, you might want to look up its ingredients before you head in so you can have it made exactly as you like it. I was impressed with their flexibility, but wasn\'t blown away by the quality. \n\nAll in all, this place is a great find. The rolls themselves are abnormally large, however, so it might be a good idea to order two at a time until you\'re full. Or just bring some doggie bags home.'

S"Mmmmm La P'tite Folie, how I love you!! If you are in the mood for a delicious French meal, look no further than La P'tite Folie. \n\nSituated on Fredrick Street, La P'tite Folie is right in the heart of the New Town area of Edinburgh and it is just around the corner from the main shopping street, Princes Street, and so it is a convenient place to reach.\n\nI came here for dinner a few weeks ago with a friend and we had a beautiful meal. La P'tite Folie's menu offers a good choice of authentic French dishes including mussels and snails. I had the seafood risotto for my main meal which was truly beautiful - there was monk fish in it which was perfectly cooked and the sauce it was in tasted really fresh and full of flavour - yummy! My friend had the roast duck which looked amazing and my friend said it was really tasty too, and our meal was accompanied with a bottle of white wine. The meals are a wee bit pricey, with most main meals in the region of \xc2\xa317-20, but the portions are a decent size and the food is wonderful so it is excellent value for money. \n\nThis is not a restaurant I would go to all the time, purely because it is a wee bit too pricey for a student's budget, but I would love to go here again for a special occasion meal."

They also have sushi at a great deal... $7 for 2 rolls, $10 for 3 (for the basic rolls.. some examples are shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, salmon. Some also have cream cheese, cucumber, avocado, ect. )  They also have another page for sushi entrees which is much larger and a more unique choice of their sushi.

S'A little cozy restaurant in a quiet neighbourhood. The food is exceeds my expectation. We had cream-legume soup to start, artichoke and heart-of-palm salad, a block (deep fried pastry stuffed with tofu spinach and cheese) as the appetizer, and cous-cous royal and vegetarian for the main course. Bread was fresh baked and served warm. The stewed lamb was so tender and the grilled chicken was delicious. Absolutely a delight dinner on a cold winter night.'

S'Honestly they look pretty bare inside, no frills but they offer an extensive snack bar type menu of Mexican and some Central American favorites/antojitos.  \n\nThey have a limited selection of ice cream and a few paletas, but my  favorite items to get here are the  Escamochas (fruit salad with sweetened cream, like melted vanilla ice cream), topped with pecans, coconut or granola.  My other favorite are the Raspados, a snow cone like treat with fresh fruit syrups (most with whole pieces of fruit) or the Obispo which is a raspado with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  \n\nThese made my summer very tolerable.'

I also got the sweet potato fries.....I am a big fan... So if you are in the neighborhood stop in and grab some grub.. I work in the area, so it is very convenient, and the food is prepared in a very timely manner. The staff is good, I haven't sat down to eat there, but for take out the service was great!"

S'Das relativ kleine und eng bestuhlte Jaipur hinterl\xc3\xa4sst bei mir einen zwiesp\xc3\xa4ltigen Eindruck. Ich war mehrmals beim Mittags-Buffet. F\xc3\xbcr 6,90 gibt es Reis, ein vegetarisches Gericht (Linsen, Kartoffeln, Gem\xc3\xbcse, etc.) und zwei Non-Veg-Gerichte, i.d.R. mit H\xc3\xa4hnchen. Am Geschmack gab es nie etwas auszusetzen. Von einem Buffet erwarte ich aber mehr. Dazu geh\xc3\xb6rt auch Vorspeise und Nachtisch. Aber f\xc3\xbcr den Preis ist das noch OK, solange man es nicht mit einem Buffet beim Chinesen vergleicht.\n\n\n Abends gibt es Essen a la Carte aus der umfangreichen Karte. Begonnen haben wir mit Rang-Brang, gemischte Vorspeise zur zwei Personen zu 12 Euro. Auf dem lieblos gef\xc3\xbcllten Teller befanden sich Pakoras (frittierte Gem\xc3\xbcse), 2 Murgh Pakora (frittiertes H\xc3\xbchnchenfleisch), Onion Baji (fritierte Zwiebelringe) und 2 Samosa (gef\xc3\xbclllte Teigtaschen). Alles geschmacklich keine Offenbarung. Bei Einzelbestellung h\xc3\xa4tte es wahrscheinlich f\xc3\xbcr das gleiche Geld mehr gegeben.\n\n\n Als Hauptgericht hatten wir Aloo Gobhi Masala (Blumenkohl und Kartoffeln) zu 9 Euro und Jhinga Masala (gebratene Garnelen mit Paprika) zu 16,90 Euro. Beides nur wenig gew\xc3\xbcrzt und nur ansatzweise nach Indien schmeckend. Das nicht wirklich g\xc3\xbcnstige Jhinga Masala bestand zum Gro\xc3\x9fteil aus Paprika. Garnelen waren entschieden zu wenige zu finden. So teuer sind die nun wirklich auch nicht mehr. Die Gr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9fe der Hauptgerichte w\xc3\xa4re f\xc3\xbcr einen Mittagstisch akzeptabel, aber als teueres Hauptgericht entschieden zu gering.\n\n\n Wirklich lecker hingegen war die Mango Lassi. Am Ende haben wir f\xc3\xbcr das Essen 56 Euro ausgegeben. Entschieden zu viel f\xc3\xbcr das Gebotene.'

S'I\'ve been to Frederico\'s twice now (both in Buckeye, AZ). The first time I made a major mistake and ordered three tacos and some chips and beans. This was WAAAAY to much food although the cost was less than $10. The meal was excellent, tasty, hot, and filling. I didn\'t eat it all but not because it wasn\'t good ... there was just too much.  \n\nMy second time at Frederico\'s I ordered the #1 (tostado, taco, beans, and rice plate).

Far better pricing and speed than down the street at La Familia which is basically now a loud obnoxious bar, with Mexican food on the side sadly.\n\nFederico's has a lot of daily specials. Check their website for coupons, specials, menus, prices.  Monday AND Tuesday is 99 Cent Tacos (reg. $2.09+) and $1.99 burritos (reg. $3).  \n\nthey have a nice little salsa bar, but also have red radishes sliced  up, jalepenos, onions/jalepenos julienned.  And they don't ration your salsa or charge extra for to go salsa like La Familia does.\n\nI often find that going inside is quicker than the drive through.  Not sure why. I think everything is made to order, so if someone gets something unusual in the drive thru, it holds up the line.\n\nI wish this was close to my work, I'd go there a lot more. Great combo specials, and very good prices. I like the atmosphere inside, TV in there."

The guys that work the counter are friendly and make this place a viable option when it comes to craving pizza.\n\nUnfortunately, though, I'd have to agree with Darren--it's time for new pizza recipes. We already have a huge pizza presence in South Side, and everyone makes pretty much the same pizza. After a night out on East Carson, however, it doesn't really matter how many of the same pizza joints are around, because they're all full, and all of them provide you with the same wonderful, hazy memory the next morning.\n\nI'll miss Blue Grotto, but I also won't complain, because this place still satisfies."

S'I chose this restaurant for Easter because the number of non-asian and non mexican choices on Restaurant.com are limited. I wanted a steak and fish place not too far from home. I had to make reservations for 5:00 as they would not take my gift certificate for the brunch hours.\nLet me begin that our man who was our Server was Excellent. Very attentive.\nThis place is located in a hotel. While walking into the restaurant, we noticed the carpet had Not been vacuumed in the the 2 hour break between brunch and dinner. There were two other tables occupied so it was not like it was overflowing with people.\nThe menu is very limited. The wine choices even house wines were 8.00 and up. A White Haven Savignon blanc is 16.00 a bottle in stores and was 11.00 per glass in this place. Talk about markup.\nMy son and I ordered the Ribeye, my friend order the Sea Bass.\nthe Sea Bass looked fresh and presentation was good. I tasted a bit of her fish and it had a nice outward crispness and inside white and flaky but a bit oily tasting.\nOur ribeye steaks were an embarrassment. I do not understand why the trend to cut nice 1/2 in to 1 in steaks in half horizontally. except to make more money.The steaks were cooked to order surprisingly, but if they were 1/4" thick . there was a lot of fat on the edges that had to be cut off. which reminded me more of the fat you get on a prime rib.\nthe mashed potatoes were gummy. the  best part was the sauteed spinach which was suppose to be creamed spinach. \nAt 22.00 for 1/4""  thickness of a ribeye I will not be returning to this establishment. Good thing I had the 25.00 off the bill. I could have gotten a great steak at Outback for the price.'

S'That\'s a good mutha sandwich! I had one of the in house made roast beef sandwiches and was very impressed. I don\'t know if they make their bread in house as well, but it was some of the best bread I have had for a sub. I have always said better bread better subs. You have to swing in here and check it out. The sandwiches are simple, but shoot if you make a sandwich this straight forward and it kicks this much butt, who needs anything else. I\'m not really sure if the "fresh cut" meats make a difference but it certainly adds to the experience. I think this could really be a five star place if their sides were a little bit better. I tried the potatoe salad and was disappointed as there really wasn\'t much to it and it was just bland. Fries would go great with these subs to.'

S'There are a couple of Vietnamese dishes that I\'ve liked, in the past, but I\'ve usually ordered them when dining with friends, and I can never seem to find them on subsequent visits. As a result, my experiences vary widely. \n\nThis Pho Dau Bo is in a newish plaza, and the restaurant itself is clearly also quite new. The decor is pleasant and modern, but not otherwise mention-worthy. One tip: if you\'re going there in the winter, it can be a bit chilly, especially at the tables near the door. I\'d recommend the inner row of tables instead. \n\nThe food was decent--I had a bowl with a skewer of meatballs, a spring roll and "vermicelli" (rice noodles that are thinner than the usual, udon-like ones, but aren\'t really as thin as vermicelli). Pretty good, I guess. The meatballs were fine--a little dry. They had a unique flavour to them, but it wasn\'t strong enough for my tastes, so I dipped them in various sauces for a bit more flavour. The spring roll was tasty--I quite liked that! The vermicelli was kind of bland--it didn\'t come already tossed in a sauce or anything, so I added to it, from the sauces on the table and the small bowl of sauce they gave me, which they said I was supposed to add to the noodles. It wasn\'t a new favourite, but it wasn\'t horrible, either. I\'ll keep hunting on future visits to Vietnamese restaurants, I think.\n\nMy companion had Pad Thai, and he liked it well enough, though he did say that the Pad Thai taste aesthetic that Vietnamese restaurants pursue seems to be quite different from what he\'s had at Thai restaurants (though there\'s also a fair bit of variance from one Pad Thai prep to another in general, and even among Thai restaurants). He prefers the style made at Thai restaurants, but this was pretty tasty as well. So it was a thumbs up from him. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty busy, of a Sunday afternoon--not super big, but still well-frequented--when we came, there were maybe a couple of tables (in the drafty part of the restaurant) empty, and by the time we left, it was full. Not a table to spare.  So, it may be that this is a local favourite, and I just have yet to find *the* dish that will make me want to keep coming back for more! \n\nI don\'t have kids, but there were quite a few kids there, with their families, and they seemed fairly kid friendly. Or maybe the kids were just very well-behaved. Either way, the young\'uns seemed happy enough the time I was there. I don\'t know about booster seats etc., though, as all these kids were old enough not to need them, I think.'

Since their present dinner formula has worked for them for so long, I do not expect them to change a thing. They seem to aim for safe and good, not fantastic, and I respect that."

S'This location is without a doubt the most awful Burger King I have ever been to, including truck stops.  The employees at this location are the biggest festival of douch bags I have ever had the displeasure of being around.  Let me enlighten you with my two part story.\n\nThe first time I went to this location, I went through the drive thru.  Getting home, I now know the pain of Leo Gets in the movie Lethal weapon 2, and symphatize with him in his stance of how they always fuck you at the drive thru.  I get back home to realize I am a pawn in Burger Kings game of fucking their customers at the drive thru.  I drive back, let them know my order was wrong.  The manager looks in my bag, goes back and talks to the cook.  They forgot about me and 10 minutes later I remind him I am still waiting for my order.  He brings out a bag and drops about 6 inches on the counter in front of me.  Doesn\'t say a word.  I suppose this was my fault.  Pencildickmanager looked at me as it was.  O.K., perhaps they were having a day.  Perhaps I should have looked at my food when I left.   Regardless, I hope the manager is reading this.  If you are, your a dick (yes, you.  The fat guy) \n\nPart two, which I have entitled: Tempting fate, I decide to go back to this restaurant once again.  I should have stuck with my intuition, like when a dog knows it is about to storm and starts barking and acting weird.  Sitting in the "dining room" this time (although the amount of garbage in the room resembled more what I think the threshold to hell would look like)  I think the only place that didn\'t have garbage in it was the trash cans.  My food was not only incorrect, but tasted like what I can only describe as, well, for a lack of a better word..... dogshit.  I think my hamburger patty was awake longer than I was and had the texture of a belt.  I wouldn\'t even let my dogs eat this trainwreck of a "meal."  I told the kid who reminded me of Rainman working the counter that the burgers were pretty bad and he might want to cook some fresh ones.  He just started at me like he saw a pair of tits for the first time.  I don\'t think this kid will strive to be a member of the space program.  \n\nI will never go back to this store and I hope someone who works there reads this.  Although I doubt that.  I think they are spending more time standing around thinking of ways they can piss off their customers and be generally non-productive.  I can only become religious and pray that if I ever have kids, they are smarter then the staff at this burger king.  \n\nMuch like the old lady in the movie Poltergeist, I give you a warning, Caroline.  Stay away from here, this is Satan\'s Burger King.'

Great thing about their chicken is that you can chew it for days without it breaking down and you don\'t feel too bad about eating an animal since no chicken shape ever served at Panda Express resembles any part of an actual chicken.\n\nThere are not words to fully describe how much this place, and the "food" they serve sucks. I cringe when I see the huddled masses in line to purchase it. I think every time... have any of you ever tasted chinese food? Anyone? The irony is that there used to be a fantastic chinese/thai restaurant in the same shopping center that was bought out and changed around. That place would be 1/2 empty while panda express would have long lines.

Michael's is a paradoxical mismatch of high and low end dining.  \n\nLet me give you the good news first:  Incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and attentive staff.  Large menu with lots of tasty choices.  Generous, well prepared portions and reasonable value.  Healthy options and some imaginatively indulgent ones (Crispy bacon wrapped liver anyone?)\n\nNow the bad: Ambiance; we were the only one's in the non smoking section, which was hit with 2nd hand smoke wafting over from the lounge side.  Their was an office attached to our dining area, only separated by fabric hanging down from the ceiling so we heard lots of loud business phone calls.  The kitchen was also extremely loud, and even though we were sitting in the furthest possible point away from it, the banging and shouting emanating from it was distracting.  Last, there was a very bright fluorescent bulb affixed against a wall directly at the guest's eye level.  It was placed above a side table to help the staff write notes, but it was blinding to look directly at, which was unfortunate as it was uncovered and placed immediately in front of me.\n\nHeavy on service and food, but light enough on overall atmosphere to still make for a sub-par experience.  If it was a casual pizza shop or deli I would expect the noise and look, but with $20-$30 entrees, Michael's creates higher expectations of a fine dining experience than they live up to."

S"A healthier alternative to greasy pizza after a night out!\n\nAtmosphere: The place is often crowded after 1am; not the ideal place to go for dinner unless you're starving after clubbing.  In the afternoons though, the place is much quieter, arabic music is often on, and you can really enjoy a meal outside (weather permitting) and bask in the sunshine.\n\nService: I have gotten to know the family that owns this franchise; 3 (of 6!) sisters. The ladies run the place in various shifts, but have always been very pleasant and courteous.  They know that the restaurant is their livelihood, and thus work very hard to keep their customers happy.\n\nFood: The Amir menu + some surprise dishes cooked up by the franchises depending on the mood.  Given the heavy footfalls in this area, the chicken and beef shawarma racks are constantly fresh.  In the evening, just before the clubs unleash their patrons out onto the streets (3ish) is the best time to grab some grub.  At that time, it's fresh (in anticipation of the onslaught of inebriated people), so it's the best time to grab some :O)\n\nFood is good, the people are even better"

Maybe it's because it's still fairly grand, with a lot of open spaces between the tables, that makes it feel slightly cold and lacking in an atmosphere you can pinpoint, but you can't deny that it looks good. The staff are really nice and keen to accommodate whatever you want, so I always rate the customer service, plus the cocktail list is fab, so I would recommend steering your eyes towards that first of all."

Yes, their specialty is water and Filipino items from the dried, canned or frozen.  We were pleasantly surprised with all the different items that had stocked in this little market.

They have a revamped menu and while a lot of the old standards are there, they have some new items too.  I *really* like the option to turn any burger into a turkey burger (or veggie, or 2 thin beef patties) and had that twice last week.  The potato soup was very good and my BFF was living on their chicken enchilada soup while she was sick and she said that was very good too. \n\nI have to absolutely commend the daytime bar-area wait staff.  I think the one gentleman's name is Adam, who has been there forever and has always been a shining star, and there is also a woman working in that area (can't remember her name - ugh) and they are rock stars.  Drinks never go empty, plates are cleared, sweeteners are brought, etc.  Seriously - they are amazing and should be given gold stars or raises or whatever it is that Chili does.  The food has improved drastically, but the wait staff that can get us fed and back to work in time is what is keeping us coming there.  \n\nGreat job by this Chili's to turn it around.

S'ALL ABOARD! THE MARRAKECH Express has arrived in Phoenix!\n\nHIDDEN GEM ALERT!\n\nThis is a tiny but exotic Moraccon Restaurant with only four inside tables and four big bench tables outside. Much of the food they serve are slow braised meats that mostly come with couscous. It\'s like what your grandmother would prepare for you if she was Moroccan. The male owner was just like my grandmother. I kept telling him I was full but he kept bringing us more food. Pricing is very low and portions are very large. (currently they offer a $5.99 lunch special)\n\nWe entered not knowing what we\'d order and then the owner introduces himself and makes light conversation with us. He tells us to sit down and he said he\'d just bring food to us to try. \n\nWe started with Date Shakes, Moroccan Mint Tea, House made Lemon Cured Olives, Fresh Baked Bread and Moroccan Carrots. It was all good and it was all fresh!\n\nNext came a soup. It was thickened with Garbanzo Beans and had noodles. This was a goat based soup.\n\nA BIG generous dishes of slow braised fall off the bone tender, beef ribs, and lamb arrive, a dish of stewed potatoes followed by a plate of tender flavorful dark quarters of chicken on a platter with more couscous and an assortment of vegetables.\n\nWe also tried tasting style chicken bastilla. That\'s a puff pastry stuffed with their really good and tasty chicken, cinnamon and powdered sugar. \n\nWhat a FEAST!\n\nAnd it ended with house made Moroccan Desserts!\n\nPricing was very low and potions were very large.\n\nA current grade "A" Maricopa inspection is posted.\n\nThe Restaurant Front is Rough but it\'s a Gem inside.\n\nParking might be difficult. (I parked next door)\n\nGet your Couscous on at Couscous Express!\n\ncall them for their hours of operation  Hours at this time are M-F 10:30-5 and Saturday 11:00-4'

Scharf ist dabei meist schon auch recht scharf. \nBisher gab es nicht, was mir gar nicht geschmeckt hat.\n\n\n Die Atmosph\xc3\xa4re im Restaurant ist Schnellrestaurant-typisch. Sauber.

I used to live in the area  when I was a kid and after a trip here recently I find that somethings do not change. The family that owns this place has been cranking out affordable yet great tasting food for three generations now. That is over 30 years experience in a building the size of a bedroom. \n\nWith that tradition comes pride in the service, and food they serve. No this is not P.F. Chang's (over rated and not really that good in my opinion) or one of those nasty buffets that make you wish you had just decided to eat at home. No, this is great food the way it is supposed to be. Calling this stuff good would be an understatement. It is more like additive! Not sure of what they put in it but one bite and you will be hooked LOL. Seriously try the shrimp or pork fried rice and you will be going from a pint (their smallest size) to a quart (their largest) of the stuff. \n\nThey also serve sweet and sour chicken, egg foo young, three types of soup, egg rolls and Pepsi to drink (sorry no coke products here). Also since this is a small mom and pop place I do not remember them excepting credit or debit cards so bring cash. They are not expensive a $20 should buy more than enough for a family to eat and leave you will a few dollars in your pocket. The thing that makes this place great is that they are family owned meaning that dad is in the back cooking up your order while the oldest son watches and chops the veggies. The mom is still in the front taking orders from customers then yelling them to the back while the younger son does his homework or is told to go and sweep out in front of the store.\n\nWith all the chain places popping up these rare gems are becoming harder to find. They represent hard work, dedication, and in my case the past. Support them.\n\nCase Closed"

You can select an assortment of fish, mussels, clams, octopus, choosing just a few or a bit of everything. The chef cooks each perfectly then brings out several sauces to complement your options. I have to say, the flavor was so good I didn't add much in the way of sauce. I also didn't add any salt, which for me is unheard of. (I went with my mother who is not a fan of salty foods and she said it was perfectly cooked too, so I promise it's not too salty.)\n\nThe server added fresh lemon zest, and was generous in pouring the wine.

It's seasoned well so I don't know why others complain that the food here is bland. I was there tonight and saw that they're running a special - $1 tacos. I ended up cutting the burrito in half.

It is a Chipotle style restaurant that you order as you go down the line and pay at the end.  The variety was awesome but the sandwich was a little soggy by the time we got to eat it.  The place is large and super casual but very bright and lots of fun for the kids too.  Will come back for sure to try more soups and salads.'

It seems these people have no interest in quality anymore as they are riding on the coat tails of their established name. The meat was fatty, chewy and overall unpleasant. I had an Elatos Gyro the same day to compare and it was remarkably better and cheaper. Time for places like this to step up or just close down.

S'When this place was brand new, I was so excited to try it out.  It\'s very local to my office, sushi is my favorite, and I love giving my money to small businesses vs. large chains.  The first two times I went, the service was a little slow...attributed to being new, I\'m sure of it...but the sushi was fabulous!  And the ginger salad dressing is the best I\'ve ever had.  Not that sweet creamy stuff that I despise.  That said, I was eager to return today for more delicious sushi!\nToday, however, was NOTHING like my previous visits.  The waitress brought soup for my friend and then....nothing.  We had to ask her to get our drinks and also my salad...she forgot.  Ok, it was busy before we came in, she\'s just gathering herself....no problem.  I ordered my usual shrimp tempura roll add cucumber with eel sauce and sriracha on the side. The sushi chef gives me one side of eel sauce, sriracha, and spicy mayo ALL MIXED TOGETHER.  I told the waitress that I can\'t eat mayo, it makes me very sick and can I please have the eel sauce and sriracha in their own small containers.  She does this.  Then I got my roll.....without cucumber.  UGH.  She gives me a side of cucumber that I fumble with to eat on top.  Crisis averted.  Then I bit into the roll....this is where it gets weird.  So, usually the shrimp tempura roll is one shrimp stretched straight and deep fried.  This was not that.  This was a MASS of BABY SHRIMP that was deep fried and put in the middle.  Now, I wouldn\'t have cared if it tasted the same.  But it didn\'t.  Have you ever over cooked those baby shrimp?  They turn into chewy hard pieces of rubber.  Well, that\'s what this was.  Chewy hard rubbery meat with too much greasy batter.  So, I speak with the manager.  I ask him if there was a change to this roll lately.  He says to me "No.  We typically use the one piece of long shrimp, not the baby shrimps.  I don\'t know why the chef did that.  I will speak with him."  I told him it was not good and I could not eat it.  He apologized and walked away.  I got my bill.  The (uneaten) roll was still on it.  I spoke with him and told him that I didn\'t eat it, it was not good.  He said that the most he could do is discount the check 10%.  Here\'s my problem....I said to him....I have no issues paying for anything at all.  But this is a customer satisfaction issue and it wasn\'t even edible.  I would gladly pay for the cali roll I took to go and my salad, but I don\'t understand paying for 90% of a roll that I didn\'t eat.  He said "I\'m sorry for the inconvenience"....but that is all.  10%....which totaled about $1.60.\nI\'m not sure what planet this guy was from.  He TOLD ME that it was made wrong.  AGREED.  Then STILL CHARGED ME FOR IT. \nSo, I won\'t be back.  That\'s a shame because it was so convenient.\nLet me say also that had the manager said, "I\'m sorry your food was wrong and inedible.  I took that $6.25 roll off your check and I hope you will give us another chance to get it right in the future".  I would have said, no problem....things like this happen. And then I would have been back over and over.\nIt\'s sad that a manager with no customer service skills killed this place for me.  Oh, and I\'m in Human Resources for my company with 135 coworkers.\n\nI sure hope this place gets their act together.  $6.25 was a small price to pay to get many return visits. Horrible business decision on their part.'

I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and was promptly warned that it would be 10 minutes to get it since it would  be made fresh.  My wife ordered the caesar salad and said the dressing was good but thin. The Ravioli that my wife ordered sadly was not well drained so the sauce was a bit thinned down which was a bit dissapointing. The Fettucini Alfredo was good but it did not knock my socks off. The noodles were a bit more al dente than I would prefer and the sauce was was less creamy than I have come to expect. Overall the service was good and I will be going back to try other dishes.'

Had a quarter roasted chicken dinner with rice and roasted potatoes.Not sure if the patatoes were fully cooked, but they kind of tasted raw (they were served hot from the deep fryer I believe so I wasn't 100% sure if that was how they were supposed to be served or if they were  not cooked enough). Had a piece of the blackforest cake for dessert. The cake was okay, but it was a little stale. I don't fault Lisboa for this as it's hard to find a fresh piece of cake served by the slice at many bakeries & cafes around town unless you order and buy an entire cake.

S"I was with one of my friends and he looked up Cuban Pete's menu and read that they had:\nCuban Pete's Cigars / Cigarros Cuban Pete 7.00\nTwo cannoli shells dipped in chocolate ganache and\nfilled with Gran Marnier whipped cream, served\nwith a scoop of vanilla ice cream and finished with\ncandied orange peels.  \nSo- we zip in there to check it out, it sounded delish!  They served us stale, refridgerator empty cannoli shells- with bagged whip cream, you could tell because it is shiny looking, they didn't even fill the shells, they just squirted it in the ends.  It was a disaster.  Where are my candied orange peels? \n\n I would completely write this restaurant off, but the Cuban sandwich on another reviewers pic, looks really good, so I am going to give it one more try, but I won't be ordering the cigars."

I\'ve not come across an orange lemon before, have you?? And for the fact that it looked like it was cooked in fanta, tasted like nothing at all... \nThe "shrimp with cashews" were frozen shrimps and also didn\'t have much flavour...\n\nThe ribs, for the amount of sauce they were drowning in, had absolutely no taste either...\n\nThe mini shrimp in the fried rice were again of the frozen variety and were fairly unpleasant.. \n\nShould really have stuck with tried and true than tried somewhere new on this occasion.\n\nAvoid!!'

S"After living in the area for so long and never trying Chan An, I decided to give it a go a few weeks back. Glad I did, because I'm now a fan.\n\nIt's definitely better than Phong May House (see my review if you want to compare). I think my initial reservations about going here revolved around what it looked like from the outside, and to some degree what it looks like on the inside as well. It's in the Crafton Ingram Shopping Center and it looks like a dive. But it's a great dive. There are tables for dine-in eating, but I'd say more than 90% of Chan An's business is take out. They don't do delivery.\n\nBut that's no big deal, as the food is always ready in about ten minutes, unless they're really busy, in which case it'll be twenty. So what's good here?\n\nWell, for starters, I love the wonton soup. Chan An uses a dark broth that is actually packed with flavor, unlike all the other Chinese eateries in the area which stick to a chicken-based broth, which is always flavorless for the most part. I don't get how that happens. Someone please explain it to me. The lack of flavor, not the base, that is.\n\nI'm a fan of the sweet and sour pork here, as well as the cashew chicken. I've noticed Chan An likes to use lightly battered dark meat pieces of chicken with a darker sauce when it comes to some of their dishes such as the cashew chicken. It can sometimes be a little salty, but most days it's right on the money. Plus they also throw in water chestnuts, which I love and wish more Chinese restaurants would do.\n\nThe egg rolls are really good. Not greasy, not overdone, but just right. The fried wontons are good and the beef on the stick is amazing. It's not your usual beef on a stick. Well, it is, but then they wind up deep frying the beef before skewering it, and I've never had it like that, but it's really tasty. It bring out the sweetness of the beef really well.\n\nThe people who run the place are super friendly and they'll do their best to accommodate your tastes if you want something made a little differently. The prices are good and in line with other affordable Chinese restaurants. So don't let the look of the place fool you. Chan An does a lot of business and I'd say that's mostly down to the quality of their food. Convenience is nice, too, but that doesn't always make for tasty eats. So give these guys a try if you've been on the fence about 'em like I was. I dig their vittles. \n\nUPDATE: 12/22/2014\n\nI'm upping my review of Chan An's to five stars (from four). It's become my regular go-to stop for quick and tasty Chinese food. The whole place is like one big happy family between the employees and the clientele. Everyone who goes is pretty much a regular.\n\nA couple nights ago, I went and after I came in and placed my order, a small army arrived behind me. It got rather crowded quickly with everyone standing around waiting to get their takeout. At one point, the cashier was trying to tell one of the customers where the various sauce packets were and saw that there was one packet of soy sauce left in the bin. I offered to help him restock, and he directed me to where they kept all the packets. I was soon refilling the bins as fast as I could. It was amusing. It's that kind of place.\n\nI returned again last night and te same guy and I talked a bit while I was waiting for my order. He had gone to the Strip District earlier in the day and bought some cheese. So we started discussing our mutual love for cheese, and I directed him to Wheel and Wedge and their great cheeses. He sliced off a piece of his Strip District cheese and handed it to me to share. It was tasty. I know this has nothing to do with Chan An's food, but it's this sort of laidback and enjoyable experience that keeps me coming back as much as the vittles."

The drive-thru concept is unusual for this kind of establishment....but it is efficient. The staff is very friendly....and the place is very clean as well. They always have specials and deals for the entire family....rather it is just for two....or an entire group. I guess though it has lost some of it's appeal from the older Boston Markets I am used to.....and that is why I gave only 3 stars. However it is a good place to eat....and the prices are not to bad.

They were very oily and seemed old. The chicken tenders are like ones from the frozen section at the grocery store. \n\nWill give them another try for a different flavor of wings. I got the honey hot which is my usual wing flavor but they weren't anything special here. \n\nYou can dine in or order to go. There was no one eating in when we went to pick up our order. \n\nI wasn't very impressed with the upkeep of the parking area. I know it isn't solely ATL Wings duty but maybe they need to notify someone of all the garage in their parking lot."

S'i ordered the meat sampler-pulled pork,beef brisket & hot links w/hot bbq sauce $8.95\n\n\nthis place is truly a hidden gem. a small tavern that smells of bbq smoke from blocks away. very clean & the waitress/bartenders are terrific, very friendly & helpful. even if you don\'t like bbq, 5 minutes of sitting here and smelling that delicious smoke will make you hungry. check out their site by clicking on any image for the full menu. the beef brisket was super tender & juicy with a great smoke flavor. the pulled pork was the same and the links were really hot, maybe a little too hot for some. the sauce is served on the side & both the hot & sweet were some of the best sauce i have ever tried. the portion was very decent for an appetizer. the entree portions are very large. they also serve the famous "sin city" microbrews here. this has been voted best bbq in las vegas several times and i have no doubt why. the place was dead though only 2 other customers which is a shame because alot of bars only survive on their gaming and several bars in the neighborhood have closed in recent months. hopefully this place will still be around providing some of the valley\'s best bbq. i highly recommend this place for great food, fun atmosphere and wonderful service. the bartender, beth is smokin hot!!! not a phony vegas barbie but a real lady!!'

I definitely try to avoid Asian restaurants that make more than 1 country's food.  However, my friend brought me here, and because I was being polite, decided to try it without laughing.  Especially since she told me their Korean food was good.  I needed to find a good Korean restaurant in Pittsburgh!  \n\nThe food was surprisingly good!  It was a Tuesday, and they had some sort of sushi special going on, something like $1 per nigiri sushi - what a good deal!  And the kalbi...  yum!  Not the best that I have had (that is reserved for Korea House in San Jose), but decent.  The best that I have had in Pittsburgh, actually.  And they had a decent selection of ban chan!  That alone made me happy.  \n\nThe staff is very friendly.  I would definitely come back here again!  No more laughing as I drive by - in fact, now I usually wistfully gaze at the restaurant and think about kalbi."

S'I\'d always thought knishes were starchy piles, tough on the outside, doughy and potato-y on the inside and only to be eaten when thoroughly hung over. Today, I had my perspective broadened, thanks to Gleiberman\'s. Buttery potato, zucchini puree surrounded by toasty, light puff-pastry. Wow.\n\nThis awesome little kosher enclave sits pretty far out off of Providence road, in the Providence Square shopping center. A diner-esque restaurant adjoins the store\'s space. A deli counter full of classics is to the left as you enter - egg salad, kugel, kosher meats, chopped liver (and today, a huge tray of zucchini-potato knishes. Yum). Aisles full of kosher products, canned, jarred, bagged, boxed. Things I had never seen nor heard of before. Rad.\n\nFridge and freezers full-ish of kosher entrees, cheeses, tofutti, etc. Familiar brands like Tabatchnik and Ba Tampte but many, many others. Kosher wine. Shelves were a little bare- since I had stalked the place via their awesome webpage, I had expected to see more "bounty". Maybe Sunday was to blame.\n\nPeople were smiley to me as I wondered, poking and prodding various wares. The diner\'s menu, although not extremely veg-friendly, looks interesting enough. For Israeli imports and kosher products (there\'s a whole freezer full of weird, vegetarian "cutlets") this is the place. Hallah.\n\nNote: closed Saturday, open \'till 5 Mon-Thurs, late on Sunday.'

S"This small family-owned restaurant opened about 6 months ago and being the bbq fan that I am, I had to try it.  I really love baby back ribs and I was craving some good 'cue so my co-worker Kris and I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe moment we walked in, we became inundated with the incredible aroma of BBQ.  The place is clean and has country style decorations up everywhere.  They even have a TV on the wall.  I ordered the 1/2 order of baby back ribs for $12.95 which comes with 2 sides.  You can choose from baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad, or mac and cheese.  I chose the later 2.  It also comes with corn bread w/ honey butter and shak fries.  Basically you get a ton of food for a great price.  You can even add a hot link to any of the shak dinners for an additional $3.  \n\nThese ribs are fall-off-the-bone good.  I've been trying to find ribs like this forever.  They use a dry rub on their ribs instead of a wet mop and you can definitely taste the smokiness infused in the meat.  They have 2 or 3 different kinds of sauce that are available in small cups for dipping.  They have and original blend, a spicy blend, and another I can't remember.  Both are really good.  The side dishes are great, but nothing I would write home about.\n\nMy co-worker is a huge brisket fan and being that she is from Texas, is very picky about her bbq."

Upon entering, we stood there for about 5-10 mins. before anybody even noticed that we were there.  There was a big table w/ about 20 people, so I guess the waitress was busy.\n\nAfter we were seated, it took a painfully long time to order and even get our water.  I was getting so impatient that I wanted to leave.  We actually walked down strip mall to grab a menu and check out  Amena Bakery, and FINALLY when we got back the waitress was giving us our drinks.\n\nI think they realized that we were getting impatient so they started bringing out our appetizers and were quick with our order.  Once the food came it was very good.  You couldn't have asked for better grape leaves, hummus or baba ganuche.  The falafel was a little dry, but they gave us a free order of tabbouleh, so that made it a little better.  I was pretty stuffed after the appetizers, but my companions were raving about the food.\n\nI would have given Lily's four stars, but the wait really put a sour taste in my mouth.

I had to find out what\'s going on behind those doors.\n\nFirst off, this place is near Concord Mills Mall, the other side of the Burton Smith Blvd back behind BJ (appropriate choice of reference for a place called Suck Bang Blow haha... oh I crack myself up!!) and all those things.  It\'s not easy to spot since it\'s at the other end (not by the street) of a new brick strip mall.  \n\nThe space is just a big rectangle, with a bar on one end and pool tables on the other and booths in between.  It was pretty empty on a Tuesday night.  Yes, there is a BAF (Big Ass Fan) on the ceiling.  Let\'s get down to biz-ness, the food.\n\nI ordered the beef brisket sandwich with a side of baked mac & cheese ($7.99), and a bottle of miller lite ($2 special) to wash everything down with.  My friend got the pull pork sandwich special ($5.99 last night) with a side of onion rings and it came with a little slaw. \n\nFood was solid.  Pull pork was moist and tender.  Beef brisket has a good bounce to the meat but not tough at all.  The house sauce has a mesquite smoke taste to it along with the tanginess.  The portion was good, I saved half for another meal.  Mac & cheese at first taste was a little bland, but it got better as I digged in.  And don\'t underestimate that little cup, when I dumped them in my to-go box, it\'s quite sizable.  Onion rings were yummy, and best part... it didn\'t come apart when we ate it, the onion stayed put.  I give the food my thumbs up.\n\nService was great too.  I know it was empty, but that never seems to guarantee anything.  Our waitress was a young girl who kept the sweet tea coming, made sure I didn\'t need another cold one, told us about the dinner specials and the upcoming labor day event, and even offered to give us to-go cups for the tea.  And she did all these with a smile... take that lousy waitresses at Mac\'s Speed Shop! \n\nSo, with everything said, I\'ll definitely and gladly going to Suck Bang Blow again and again...  haha (told ya the name is awesome!)'

S'I automatically love a place where the owner playfully gives me grief for "walkin into a beef place and orderin a grilled cheese". Cuz thats what I did.\n\nYes, Mama\'s has an italian beef/ vienna beef dog heavy menu, but they also have salads, and sandwiches not including italian beef (just in case youre not in the mood for it like I was).\n\nThe two guys behind the counter were very nice. They struck up conversations w/ all the customers (its nice when people actually try and get to know their clientele), and gave some of us grief.\n\nTheir prices are decent especially for the amount of food you get. My grilled cheese however was meh. It wasnt the melty deliciousness I was craving, though I have a little to do w/ that though since I chose 2 cheeses. Next time, one cheese will equal melty perfection, Im sure of it.\n\nParking for this place is minimal. Youll be lucky to find a place on the street in front or a space in the small lot in back (uncovered). Id beware of parking in the Tempe feed lot as all their spaces have signs specifically for their customers.\n\nAll in all, Mamas is a nice little lunch spot.'

Took our coats and bags. \nWe were asked to choose which table we wanted. The place is small (20 covers max). The wall were covered in dark brown textured wallpaper. The lighting was minimal, but well placed. It oozes class and sophistication. \n\nWe were duly introduced to the menu, the specials and  the missing  / replacement dishes. The wine list was small but well sourced. I also liked the fact that they had 9 wines by the glass (3 red, 3 white, 2 rose, 1 prosecco) \nThe bread was served with oil & vinegar dip and 3 kinds of butter, one of which was a very tasty hazelnut butter. \n\nafter ordering we got served an amuse bouche of josper grilled fillet steak & celeriac foam. That. Was. Delicious.\n\nWe decided to share a starter. We selected the Lobster Tarragon Ravioli with Thermidor sauce. Very tasty and outstanding, though possibly a little thick on the edges.  It went well with their prosecco. \n\nFor main we had the same: Rib-Eye steak Medium-Rare, with Green Pepper & 12yo Scotch sauce, Skinny Fries and a side of Bone Marrow.\nwe asked for mayonnaise, however they didn't have that so they suggested to use a Bearnaise sauce for our fries - interesting yet tasty alternative.\nMy steak was cooked slightly rarer than I would have liked, but it was good. \nYes 'good' - not 'wow', 'outstanding' or 'fantastic'. Good. Definitely in my top 3 for a good steak. Missing was the charcoal flavour (like we had on the amuse bouche fillet) it was possibly too subtle, same issue with the sauce, again I like my flavours a little bolder and this was again slightly too delicate. I am sure the chefs are very accomplished, as you could tell by the way all was presented and prepared. \n\nWe had some espressos afterwards. \n\nIt took a while for our bill to be presented and in turn trying to pay - they did apologise for that.. \n\nIn all this was a very successful date-night!"

S"Ring in the new year. Bring out the Thai Take Away from Silver Bowl. On our day of post NYE celebrations (i.e. tired, lethargic, lust-less..) it was decided that we let some other do the cooking. Unfortunately our 'normal' Thai place was closed on this day. Alternatives were needed. We found an old takeaway menu and we logged in online to see if anything had changed. It was still the same. \n\nWe ordered for delivery at 5 online, however it came to our attention (only later when we called) that only open at 5 but they already started on our dishes. And sure enough those arrived 20 min later. \n\nMy personal favourite is the Tom Yum - this time with Gai (chicken). It was so packed with flavours and proper ingredients. I could have had 3 more and called it a meal. \nMy other dish was a spicy chili beef and cashew, side order of beansprout soft noodles. I was less impressed with this dish (I contribute this to the Tom Yum I had only finished minutes before). It was tasty, but not as flavour or spice packed I wanted it to be. - Oh well, nothing that cannot be saved with some chili oil and white pepper. \n\nIn all they are now firmly in my top 3 for ordering Take Away."

S'I noticed The Purple Pig was popping up a couple weeks ago, and recently went to visit the newest addition to the Tollcross cafe scene. \n\nI came with high hopes, and found myself to be very disappointed. There are very many great things about The Purple Pig. It\'s clean, new, and the staff seem friendly enough. \n\nHowever when I approached the cafe, I wondered if it was even open with the lack of light inside. This left me in the dark (haha), are they already trying to save their electricity bills? It was a grey day, and even with the white walls, a little extra artificial light might have helped. My friend and I even noticed they had no lights on their ceiling? \n\nWe were quickly approached by a semi-awkward waitress whom said something along the lines of "waddaya want?". It was more difficult than expected to acquire a menu to browse our choices. When we insisted we needed to see it to make our decision she was reluctant to give it to us. \n\nOnce we received our coffees (flat white and cappuccino) they were very disappointing. I had the cappuccino and it reminded me of the coffees from the machine at my uni. I don\'t like to be wasteful but I didn\'t drink more than half. \n\nAt this time, we didn\'t want to test our luck on the (dark) desserts. \n\nOverall, i wont be returning soon, the coffees are quite rubbish compared to many other cafes nearby!'

The restaurant itself really isn\'t anything special, they have booths and a tv in there, but it\'s definitely a take out kind of place. Their food, however, is really good. I am not a huge wing fan, but I absolutely love the wings here. They are almost a bit crunchy and the sauce is unlike any that I have ever had before. The perfect kick, but not too spicy for my sensitive stomach. They have great lunch specials and dinner deals too, so stop in if you are craving some "real" pizza and not just the quick production pizza hut stuff.'

S"I'll start by saying we really like El Pollo Loco and go here often. However, I'm tired of dealing with the same issue at this location and if the owner doesn't fix it I'm going to quit going here. Also, witnessed another disgusting issue here last night that others should be aware of.\n\nFirst, the issue that I experience every time we go here for dinner. We arrive around 6pm which is prime time dinner time. EVERY TIME the largest portion of the seating area is blocked off and everyone is jammed in the little section over by the drinks. There were so many people last night that customers were bypassing the blockade they put up so they would have a place to sit. I've never been in this location when they don't have the largest side blocked off. Why would they close off the largest section of seating area at dinner time with 5 hours until they close? They also turn around the garbage cans and only leave one usable at the front door so you have to carry your garbage through the entire restaurant to throw it away. This is just laziness so the employees don't have to clean the entire place at closing.\n\nThe second issue, which appeared to be done by the manager (heavy-set Mexican woman in red shirt), needs to be addressed immediately. A customer ordered a family meal that came with tortillas, the customer took their meal to the table and started eating their meal for about five minutes and then noticed they were given the wrong tortillas. They took the tortillas back up to the counter and asked for the correct tortillas. The manger got the correct tortillas and gave them to the customer and took the returned tortillas that had already been handled by the customer and his wife at their table and set them down on the back counter where they assemble the meals. She passed a trash can where she could have thrown them away but made a conscience decision to reuse the returned tortillas. I was standing there waiting on my meal and watched the entire thing. The manager then was assembling a to go meal and picked up the returned tortillas, looked to see how many were in there and then put the returned tortillas in the to go order and walked the order out to a car waiting in the parking lot that had been told to pull around from the drive through window.\n\nThis really needs to be addressed by the owners and until it is I'll not return to this location."

S'I have read the previous reviews and thankful that we have not had the "server all complains about"  and had no issues with any of our orders. We have been to this location for  a few times and have had pretty good experiences for an IHOP. I mean we have gone during late morning hours, so maybe the service goes downhill from lunch to those coming in at graveyard shift. Not just IHOP, but other restaurants have been slack in the wee hours/right before closing. Anyway, prices are good for the quality of food and level of customer serivce you receive. One gripe about this location is that payment can only be taken by the cashier station. We went again this past Labor Day and the poor girl could not multi-task. A customer with an infant was placing her indecisive order and the line was backed up by seven people. I could not believe there\'s only one register!!  So irritatiiiiiiiing. She should have tried to get as many people checked out while the young lady was deciding what she wanted. I can talk a little smack because I worked as a cashier many moons ago in a restaurant and grocery store.  If they fix this, then maybe I would give another 1/2 star. :)'

And they're all really fresh rather than a lot of those bought-in sandwich fillers that so many places use. Also, they make all their smoothies from scratch too, with proper chunks of fresh fruit... the mango/banana/pineapple yogurt smoothie comes highly recommended!\n\nIt's really cheap too. A sandwich with any of their filling combinations (smoked salmon and cream cheese is always a winner, but the chikcen piri piri is also realy good!) will set you back as little as \xc2\xa32.35! \n\nYou can't really go wrong at that price!"

S'Our workplace was slightly abuzz about this new Mexican joint down the street. Everyone heard about the "free" chicken or steak bowl or burrito deal. I say "free" because it\'s free with the purchase of a drink and chips. How much do said drink and chips cost? A non-trivial $5.82!!!\n\nI won\'t complain too much. That\'s a good price for basically a full meal. I just think it\'s trickery. Anyway, the steak bowl was pretty darn good. Very fresh tasting and delicious overall. Unfortunately, the horchata I had was sub-par. I\'m not sure how most places make horchata, but theirs seems like it comes from some sort of powder mix. I felt like I had gulps of undissolved horchata powder. So much for 100% Natural.\n\nAs for the chips, no wonder the meal almost costs $6! They give you a humongous bag of tortilla chips. Taste-wise, they were pretty standard. I went through the drive-thru, so I\'m not sure about their salsa bar situation, but if I had known they would give so many chips, I would have gone inside and gotten more salsa.\n\nI suppose I\'ll give this place another try some time down the road.

S'I know Jimmy John\'s is all about "super freaky fast" service, but their manners are also pretty freaky.  I\'m usually sympathetic to unmotivated or cranky employees (after all, there\'s nothing glamorous about working at a fast food place).  Unfortunately, the college kids who work here are particularly resentful--and they don\'t mind taking it out on your sandwich.\n\nI came in by myself to pick up dinner for friends.  When I tried to place my order, the girl working the register (who was obviously new) struggled to punch in each item.  No one seemed interested in helping her, even though 4 other people stood behind the counter.  She finally started yelling at them...still, they just stared blankly at the cold cuts in front of them (maybe they were stoned?).  \n\nAfter they made and wrapped my subs, they placed them on the counter in front of me.  I asked if they could bag them since it would be awkward to carry all those sandwiches on my own.  One employee pointed to a stack of paper bags and told me I could bag them myself, if I wanted.\n\nThe sandwiches are all just variations on a theme: meat of choice, watery mayo, tomatoes, a modest smear of avocado, and too much shredded iceberg lettuce.  The taste is much improved if you add their tasty hot peppers, but I very rarely crave a Jimmy John\'s sandwich.\n\nFor fast food sandwiches, I vote Subway.  The only benefit of Jimmy John\'s is that they deliver.'

S'Delicious, Hot, Mexican Goodness! For being a small shop, they go BIG at Don Tortaco. I\'m not gonna lie, I can barely walk right now. The burritos are epic and stuffed full of meat and veggies, and the sauces provided inside (haven\'t gone through the drive-through yet) are exquisite. The gal who took our order spoke perfect English and was very friendly.\nNow my one gripe is with their chicken burrito. It tastes great, but they for some reason take two big pieces of chicken breast and just stuff them in there, which makes it very difficult to eat! If you order this I strongly recommend asking them to slice that chicken up a bit first.\nThey have ala carte items that range from $4-$6 or combo plates (very filling), of which most are about $8 after tax. Very modestly priced because the dishes are, despite being a fast-food type joint, easily $16 restaurant quality.\nUp to this point I have seen what appear to be some very unfair reviews, and I must say that I strongly disagree with them. If you are a good person with a positive attitude who just happens to live in Southern Highlands (maybe by accident? fate?), and you like Mexican food, this place is worth a fair shot.\nBut if you are one of "those" people, just go to Taco Bell... Its right next door. ;)'

The portions are not huge, which is a plus to me: I'd rather have quality than quantity and the prices are more than reasonable for what you get.\n\nThanks to whoever posted the menu in yelp; incredibly useful as it seems to be the only web-accessible menu."

While the bill was around $250, and the food small portions, the atmosphere was great, the wine excellent, the food well prepared and tasted great, and the staff was very attentive.\n\nIt's a casino-fancy restaurant, which to me is basically when you can expect to pay a lot for something nicer than the bar and lower level restaurants in the casino, but it's not really on par with its price tag."

S"Instead of writing a review I'm going to write a warning. Avoid this place at all costs. If you want a lesson on how to run a successful Mexican restaurant do not come here. From the kid at the hostess stand to the sub par food this was truly a horrible experience.\n\nOf course you start with complimentary chips and salsa. Chips were room temp and not a single grain of salt. Both salsas, one mild chunky and another hot and smooth were both lacking salt, garlic and heat, essentially tomato sauce with some red pepper flakes added for good measure.\n\nWe ordered a quesadilla with green chile ($6.00) and what they call a Hal's Sampler For Two ($15.95) which is a sampling of all their house specials. Pollo Fundido, mini chimi's, flauta's, tostada's and a green corn tamale served with rice and beans. Sounds promising and a no brainer.\n\nAs soon as the quesadilla arrived we knew what we were in for. The green chile's were of the canned variety and from the first bite, of the old variety. While the cheese was melted the quesadilla was just above room temp and the tortilla was more dried out then actually crisped on a flat top grill. Each bite being worse then the last as the barely melted cheese coagulated around the wet mushy diced chile's. No amount of salsa could save this one, it was d.o.a..\n\nThen the sampler arrived, if there were any high hopes of melty cheeses and tastes of thick guacamole they were squashed just as soon as the plate arrived. The plate of beige, had cheeses but were barley melted and like the quesadilla, everything was just above room temperature. Let me tell you, there was nothing redeeming or delicious on this plate. Just a sampler of dried out, deep fried food covered in cheese and some hyper green, bland version of guacamole.\n\nAfter a few bites of this and that we asked for the check and made our way for the door. When I asked our server for a to go menu, she seemed genuinely shocked that I may have thought that the food was good enough to order again. I only needed it to make sure I got the information correct when writing this review. The owner's should be ashamed of themselves. In a market where there is decent Mexican food abound this kind of crap just doesn't fly."

S"For a change of pace, we stopped at a Sonic rather than, well, any other fast food place.  I don't usually think of Sonic when I think fast food, so it wasn't an entirely bad choice, because I like variety - even if it is of the fast food kind.  What's more is that Sonic has breakfast, and I'm a big fan of breakfast.\n\nUnfortunately, they don't do it well.\n\nWhile the staff is very friendly in the drive-in format (missing only the roller skates), they are probably one of the worst for putting up a picture of something on the menu board and then delivering something that looks about as far from that item as possible.\n\nI ordered a breakfast burrito of some kind and what I got looked nothing at all like what was on the board.  It had all the ingredients, but there is no way what I received could ever have been made to look like what was on the menu board.\n\nIt might have tasted the same, but it looked like slop.  Very disappointing indeed."

Well here's one: how about trying to serve up actual food rather than the laminated, 'made from powder', tasteless schmap that you're currently slapping down in front of people.\n\nFood does not get worse than this and the coffee is not recognizable as coffee. Enough said.\n\nIn an area of tourist traps serving completely un-thought out offensive over-priced rubbish, Cafe Jacques takes it to a new level. DO NOT EVEN WALK PAST! Actually, on second thoughts, avoid Grassmarket altogether. There's great food in Edinburgh, but it's nowhere near this place."

S"After having the Edinburgh Larder Bistro's most amazing sample of chocolate ganache at the amazing Yelp Winterfall Wonderland event, my interest was piqued and I couldn't wait to try the restaurant itself. I was sorely disappointed. First, during Yelp's Brunchy Munchy, I thought my pancakes with bacon tasted ok but were quite overpriced for two itsy bitsy pancakes and a lack of friendliness on the part of the staff. The restaurant was attractively decorated and they did accommodate our large group, but without much grace as many others really didn't like what they were served.\n\nAlthough I really wanted to like the Edinburgh Larder Bistro because of their mission to serve good quality food made from locally-sourced ingredients, I was on the fence after the brunch about whether I liked this place. I wanted to give it a second try, so my boyfriend and I purchased a groupon for a two-course lunch here. Since I work from home and his work is also flexible, we had brought our backpacks with our computers with us so we could work from New Town in the afernoon. When we showed up at our appointed time for our reservation, the staff looked us up and down and led us to the back room (they obviously wanted to hide us in the back!). At our table, the woman looked us up and down again and, after a long pause and looking disdainingly at our bags, said that other customers would be coming in and sitting next to us so could she take our bags to the other room since they would need the space? She could have framed this much more tactfully and asked if she could help us by relieving us of our bags by taking them out of our way!\n\nAlthough things had a rocky start, I liked the simple menu of just a few items that were the fresh specialties of the day made from in-season, local ingredients. We both had the mushroom soup to start. The soup was good and better than a run-of-the-mill cream of mushroom soup but it wasn't too special or memorable. Since we had heard about the Larder Bistro's great bread and thought that bread would be the perfect addition to our starter, we were a bit sad that we weren't served any. Later, during our main course, we were frustrated to see other customers were served bread with their soup while we had not been!\n\nFor my main, I had the fish. While I was expecting a flavourful, locally-caught fish, I was underwhelmed by the dish. Although it scored high on presentation and looked quite pretty, it's taste wasn't on the same calibre. To make things worse, when I was over half-way through my meal I found a hair in my dish. I didn't think it was mine but then again I wasn't quite sure. I ate a bit more from other parts of my plate but that was the not-so-perfect end to our lunch.\n\nEven though the Larder Bistro might had wanted more posh customers and we didn't seem to meet their expectations, they should have treated us just as well as the other customers (the two older ladies sitting a few tables away, or the couple sitting behind us -- and, no, there was still no one actually sitting at either of the tables next to us!). The other customers were welcomed warmly, had their coats kindly taken out of their way and received bread with their soup. We aren't slobs and we were a bit taken aback by the poor service and underwhelming lunch after hearing such lovely reviews prior to our visits here. In the future, I hope that the staff become more friendly and caring and that the quality of the food matches the prices they are charging for it."

S"5: Food- Tuscan Kale Salad at an airport? \nI'm on board! I don't see this type of thing often... but when I do, I usually go for it. \nIt was almost on the verge of being too sweet, but felt like a good choice rather than a cookie or a big bag of nuts... \nTuscan kale, berries, pickled onions, shaved fennel, diced green onions and ummm.. a sweet vinaigrette hit the spot! \n\n5: Customer Service- a few sweeties behind the counter prepping food and taking my money. What a treat. There were no kale salads in the cold case in the front, but they made one for me. Yea. \n\nThere was bit of a line around dinner time, but it worked, because Southwest gave me time to eat in between flights. Yea. \n\nWould I return? Yep. They had a cashew butter and jam sandwich, the simple salad looked good too and hmmm... \nI know there were other options I would have shoved in my mouth in a heart beat, just give me some more time and I may update this review. \n\nK.

S"I love this KanBai. I love the prompt, funny, helpful service. The folks who work here will seat you seriously and then give you a little smile and gently fill your beer glasses as you down the kirin or tsingtsao, and they will even crack jokes quietly about how spicy it is and how much food you're ordering if you get a little friendly report going with them. \n\nLast night we ordered: the spicy red pepper fish filet (which previously I ate with people who like me thought this was a soup and wondered why my eyes were weeping hot oil and my insides crying. Turns out it's not so much a soup: eat the fish and mushrooms and peppers out of the oil, don't drink it unless you like weeping burning oil tears and lighting on fire from the inside. Either way it's freaking delicious.) We also ordered the house fried rice, the spicy cabbage, and the eggplant with minced pork. This was a perfect amount of food for 4 people and with beers and tip was close to $100 total so that's nice. \n\nThe restaurant is tucked up on a dim block of Clarke, around the corner from the pretty lights of the heart of our small Chinatown. It's up a few steps, it's a warm nicely decorated room in red and black and gold with one big window, clean and comfortable and an excellent way to (h)eat up the winter."

S"I think they should change their name to anything else but Mongolian Grill. I've had much better experience with Mongolian Restaurant in different cities, and I think it's a bit misleading to call it that if you are not going to stand up to its standard. I am not trying to be a hater here, but I believe that everything authentic tastes much better than the wannabes. I mean, I would be so sad if I were a Mongolian to find out about this place.\nFor example, the rice doesn't taste good, and rice is a staple food in most Asian cuisine and every Asian restaurant should know how to cook good quality rice (seriously, I never complain about rice ever.. and how hard is it to cook decent rice?). The taste of the meat that you pick and got cooked over a big circle grill?? Dissapointing with a capital D. THe sauce choices were so Americanized, and even the soy sauce tastes weird. \nIn addition to those, I think it's overpriced, and you have to keep paying extras for additional meat, etc."

S'The husband asked for McD\'s tonight so I humored him and agreed to go. I figured DT wouldn\'t be a problem since they are normally pretty fast. The car infront of me at the speaker was placed on hold for every bit of 5 minutes. They ordered a single cone. Now it\'s my turn, I place my order with the unfriendly crew voice that clearly came across the speaker. Of course after I placed my order and pulled forward I realize I didn\'t order everything. I figured that I\'ll just pull around and go in and order the forgotten items. The young man at the cashering window apologized to the car in front of me for the wait. I pull up, he takes my money, returns with the change (without a receipt) and tells me to pull forward. No apology for the wait when I waited forever as well. My double digit order was obviously less important than the $1.08 cone in front of me. Now I feel slighted, upset and undervalued. I pull up to the window, the young gal verifies two items of my order and begins the hand out process. I check the bag for the receipt, it\'s  not there. I ask the gal for a receipt, she asks "he didn\'t give you one?" If he did why would I ask for another? Hello? Really now!?!  I pull around, park and head inside to see a single line with 7 people and a lone cashier that was not happy. I begin to wait (I\'m not so patient at this point) and wait. Two people in front of me walked out due to the wait. There were no smiles, no personality from the counter cashier or the manager who finally decided to open the second register and take an order or two. Each guest was asked for their name that was then written on the receipt in an attempt to personalize the service. A friendly smile would have gone so much further. Finally it\'s my turn, by now there are two people behind me. I place my simple order of 6 doubles plain, and begin to wait again. the time stamp on the recipt was 7:05. Every guest that was ahead of me was called for pick up. I\'m thinking my wait would finally be over. Oh heck no! It wasn\'t that kind of visit. The two guests behind me received their orders before me!! I continue to wait, really upset by now. I was finally called, the time is now 7:15pm. 10 minutes! This on top of the 10 minutes in the DT trail. Once again no apology for the wait. The store was obviously understaffed, the interior had numerous dirty tables and many trays stacked on the garbage receptacles. The staff was completely underwhelming and in my opinion rude for not offering an apology for the extended waits at both the DT and the counter. I will not be returning to this location as it is not fast and they certainly didn\'t value my patronage. I certainly don\'t need the aggravation and honestly I work too hard to spend my money where I\'m not appreciated!'

S"This is not a great McDonalds. Thats saying something.\n\nTo be honest, when I go to McDonald's I am really going for one reason: sweet and sour sauce. Its tangy, its sweet, it clearly has heroin in it because when I don't eat it for a few days I start feeling like bugs are crawling under my skin. Everything I get there is just a delivery vehicle to get the SSS (sweet and sour sauce) into my mouth since apparently you high society types frown upon me using a spoon or straw. This means generally I am getting a lot of of chicken nuggets or fries, though I'm not above putting some SSS on a mcflurry...\n\nThe major problem I have with this place is that despite me saying I will pay extra for SSS and them charging me for extra sauce packets they basically never give me the desired number of sauces. I get you don't want to give away huge numbers of sauces anymore cause neoliberalism but... come on give up that sweet golden brown goodness. \n\nChicken nuggets at this place have been pretty consistently bad- not super hot, not super crispy, all around meh. \n\nLastly, this McDs is slooooooooooooow. The drive through line is frequently quite long and slow moving which is terrible for a fast food restaurant.\n\nLuckily between work and home there are 3 McDonalds on a 10 minute drive- America."

S"Okay, I'm surprised by Baja Fresh.\n\nAlmost a dozen years ago I remember going to my first Baja Fresh, when it was still a Wendy's concept in Illinois.  Arlington Heights, I believe.  The food was good.  \n\nAt the time, there was no Chipotle to feed that quick, upscale Mexican hunger.  So in many ways they were the only game in town.\n\nAs I mentioned in my recent Taco Cabana review, a lot has changed.  If feels like Chipotle is giving Starbucks a run for it's money in terms of new locations.  And, that food chain has only gotten better and still is the darling of Wall Street.  \n\nNow Wikipedia has created a website, listing all the Mexican fast food chains.  Take a look and see how many you have been to:  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fast-food_Mexican_restaurants  You'll get high marks in my book if you've been to a Taco Time and Taco Del Mar.\n\nHere's the skinny, Baja Fresh does a nice job with their food.  I want to like them more than I do.  Their Baja Steak Burrito is really good and fairly priced for $6.99.  But as you explore their menu items, it becomes somewhat, un-interesting.\n\nMy suggestion would be to knock out that half wall that separates the kitchen from the front, so the customers could see the employees preparing the food.  Similar to that , er, other Mexican concept across the (FLW) street.  The employees here are exceptionally friendly and offer free chips as you wait.  Nice!\n\nThe food is good, but the restaurant with all that white, is kind of sterile.  The next time you get some coupons in the mail, give them a try as we did.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nEnjoy!"

S"We recently went here for a high School get together with about 40+ people on a Friday night, my usual review night. They were informed of our intentions and gave us a room dedicated to our  group.  We gathered at 5pm, the crown drifting in over the course of an our or so.\n\nThere were lots of chips and salsa in squeeze bottles.  The salsa was actually the best part of the night.  It was hot enough without being overbearing and the chips were fresh and in a big enough basket we were not dependent on our disappearing waitress to have them replenished.  \n\nIt took quite a while to get the waitress to take our drink orders and even longer for the dinner order to be placed and eventually served.  There were only two waitresses, one of which was elsewhere most of the time as the other was running her tail off.  \n\nSadly, we were sitting with our backs directly against the entry to the kitchen and there was lot of noise.  This added to the clumsiness of the staff who dropped multiple plates on the floor and shattered glass and food all over the backs of our legs as they came out of the kitchen.  As if it took long enough to get one meal out, now add this to they delay.  \n\nOnce our food finally arrived, about 1 hour and 45 minutes into the time there,  it was a sad disappointment at best.  Phil ordered a Chimichanga which looked like it was deep fried in dirty oil for 3 times the normal cooking time.  It was so dark brown it looked like it was covered in Mole'.  Rosealyn's Cheese crisp was anything but crisp, more like it was soaking in an oil bath before arriving at the table.  My Green Chicken Enchilada's were seemingly tasty at first but I paid for them in the bathroom the following day for hours on end as they ran through me like a scoop of Draino.  I love Mexican food and can handle the hottest but his recipe's did me in.  \n\nGetting the check was another delay.  It was 8pm when we finally got out of there, not a moment too soon.\n\nThe bottom line here is it was good to see and meet some new and old friends but I would have rather done it somewhere else.  The restaurant was ill-prepared for our arrival, the food was sub standard and the after effects were more like a visit from Montezuma, something I would prefer to do without.

I've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes for food even when there's a line out the door.\n\nThis E'NP (which is listed as being in Bellevue, though it's actually in Avalon) was the hang out spot for the teens when I was in high school and still appears to be so judging by the number of kids that flood here after football games.  Think The Max, but with less magic tricks and far fewer dance-offs.  The wait staff will yell at kids if they get too crazy, and in some cases, kick them out.  Much appreciated.  The Avalon cops also hang out here at night, so it never gets too rowdy.\n\nThe food here is diner food.  Not much else to it.  Don't order the steak and you won't be disappointed.  There is a pretty big salad bar at this location, and the food changes based on the time of day.\n\nOne thing that I love about this particular location is the speed at which they attack take-out orders.  Again never a more than a 20 minute wait.  They also have fresh bakery items in the case, which I love since not all E'NP's bother with that.

S"A nice diner.  Nothing more, but nothing less.  There is nothing fancy about this place so temper your expectations.  But that isn't to say it isn't good.  The place is clean, the staff is friendly, the food arrives quickly, hot, and tasty.  The prices match the quality of food and that is fine.  Places don't have to be extravagant to be good in my book.  \n\nI would definitely recommend the place for a quick breakfast, or a casual lunch with many options.  Just don't expect anything to blow you away.  But for the price of the menu items that is fine by me."

S'We had been to this restaurant once for lunch, and enjoyed it enough to decide to go a second time for dinner. We had relatives visiting from overseas and decided to bring them to this restaurant because of the nice atmosphere of the location (Prince-Arthur). We had one of the worst experiences restaurant wise. We waited for more than 2 hours (literally) for our food, and once our dishes showed up, they were cold and over cooked. We have to mention that the restaurant was very busy, but still... We even had to ask 3-4 times to get water or bread (and at one point, early on,  they ran out of bread). We asked twice to talk to the owner (who we knew was on site) and he never showed up; which shows how much they cared. The poor waitress did apologize many times, but a lot of the issues were out of her control.  I would never go back to this place.'

S'Saturday night, no reservation, my choice was to wait 45 minutes for a table or take a table in the bar.  I opted for the bar.  I should have waited or went somewhere else.\n\nI had eaten at Roy\'s in Philadelphia, which was an awesome experience.  I expected that same in Scottsdale.  Didn\'t happen.\n\nI started out with my favorite drink, an Original Hawaiian Martini.  They are not cheap with the alcohol in the drink, it\'s very potent.  For dinner, I opted for choices on the Prix Fix menu.  My starter was a Hawaiian Crunch Winter roll.  It was great, made with shrimp tempura and avocado.  For my entree, I selected the Panang-style tiger shrimp with vegetable coconut curry and jasmine rice.  Very good combination of flavors, but could have been served a little warmer.  Dessert was the always awesome "Roy\'s Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle".  This dessert is always to die for.  It\'s the best  dessert I have ever had anywhere!!\n\nOther than the slightly cold entree, the thing that amazed me about this restaurant was the fact that the staff didn\'t intercede when a nearby customer managed to annoy me all evening long.  This guy was in the restaurant bar, supposedly waiting for his brother.  Well, I was there for over an hour and the brother never showed up.  Go figure.  But, in the meantime, this guy managed to annoy me, tell me strange stories, sit at my table (until I asked him to leave), go back to this table, remove papers from his bag, bring them back to my table and spread them out, (until I asked him to leave again), used my cell phone to call his brother, mother, sister, god knows who else.  But at least while he was on my cell phone, he wasn\'t bothering me.  He even begged me for a ride and helped himself to some of my food.  You get the picture.  I can not believe that the staff allowed this to happen.  It\'s outrageous.  Other customers noticed, I guess I should have demanded to speak to a manager to have situation resolved, but I didn\'t want to make a scene.  I couldn\'t believe it was happening or that is was allowed to happen!!!  I even had to sneak out a side door when this nut wasn\'t looking, so he wouldn\'t follow me.  Completely nuts.  I think a restaurant of this caliber has an obligation to protect it\'s customers.'

S'You want real Chinese food?  Go to China.  On second thought, that might be a little too exotic for the faint at heart.  In which case, what you want is the American version of Chinese food.  So if you find yourself at Red Rock on a Wednesday evening and stop hitting "Repeat Bet" long enough to realize you\'re hungry, a trip to the food court may be in order.  And that\'s when, faced with an array of less-than-exciting choices, you could decide to dig in to Panda Express\'s offerings.\n\nSure, you could pay a few more bucks and get the same - or better - quality Chinese food at the buffet, but then you\'ll pig out and hate yourself in the morning.  Or sooner.  While Panda is overpriced for what you get (Note:  most of the food court places seem to have raised their prices recently), you can choose to eat less of it.\n\nI used to order the two-item combo plate, but it really was too much food for me, so I\'ve switched to the bowl.  Last time I got a new item - Angus steak and shrimp - and it was actually pretty good, though I didn\'t notice that it was a buck extra because of the shrimp.  So that little bowl of food - with way too much rice, but enough of the main, was over $8 with the tax. \n\nStill, it was a passable alternative to starvation, and the diversion actually saved me a few bucks at the machines.'

S"Tucked away on a quiet block on St-Dominique, at the northern end of Little Italy, I heard about this restaurant through word-of-mouth, and decided to give it a try last night.\n\nFor authenticity, the menu is completely written in Italian and presented on a large chalkboard - one on either side of the restaurant. Don't worry if you don't understand Italian, or if you're having trouble reading the handwriting; your waiter will explain every item on the menu in great detail.\n\nYou must realize that the restaurant caters to providing a 'dining atmosphere' rather than an 'eat and run' atmosphere. I make a point to say this, because I've read other reviews of this restaurant on other sites, (I'm surprised I'm the first one Yelping it) where people had complained about slow service. The service is not slow; the waiters are simply giving you time to talk amongst yourselves - something that we don't do enough of anymore.\n\nThe restaurant is ridiculously close to the Jean Talon market, and the waiter did tell me that the menu can change seasonly, depending on what's available at the market.\n\nThat being said, this restaurant is apparently famous for their Risotto. Personally, I've never been a fan of Risotto, but the people I was there with did say that it was among the best they've ever tried.\n\nThey have some very interesting items on the menu - this is not your typical Americanized Italian restaurant. Depending on what you order, some of the portions are small, but I wasn't hungry when I left. I had very good lobster ravioli as an appetizer, followed by lamb chops for my main course. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly.\n\nI got to sample (from one of the people I was with) the calamari and shrimp in a tomato broth, which was good, but I would've gotten sick of the tomato taste had I ordered it as my appetizer. I also sampled the lobster, again, served in a tomato broth. Again, good, but I would prefer it without the broth. One thing though; they say they use 1 to 1 & 3/4 lbs lobsters for that dish, but trust me, it seemed smaller.\n\nFor dessert we shared the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake with espresso sauce. They were both good, but I would go with the lava cake over the tiramisu next time.\n\nIt's not a very large venue, but it did fill up by 8:30/9:00 on a Saturday night, so I would recommend reservations. All in all, a very nice experience, and I would go back."

S"Well you shouldn't really expect too much from airport Chinese food, honestly. It will be expensive, it will be filled with grease, and you have to be really careful with picking what to eat because most of the food available will not taste good.\nI got fried rice, mixed vegetables and green beans. The fried rice was bland, the veggies were edible, but I thought that the green beans tasted quite decent. Granted I love green beans, it's really hard to mess them up, and I hadn't eaten anything for over 10 hours and I was starving. Ended up paying a little over $8 for all of this. \nI didn't think it was too too bad as I didn't have high expectations in the first place, but I wish I had read the yelp reviews beforehand; I'd have gone too BK or chilli's."

So with 10 minutes left until the start, we happened to find some seats here to watch the match.  It wasn't packed but had a good crowd that looked mostly like locals, nomming away on food with a pint in hand.  \n\nThe beer selection was fairly decent and the food options were extensive.  Having not eaten lunch, I was pretty peckish and so I ordered a plate of bruscetta which surprised me by having fresh tomatoes as its topping!  One of my companions had the fried calamari which was decent but had a wonderful dipping sauce which tasted highly of garlic (yum...garlic).\n\nI only saw 2 waitresses but they were handling the room quite well and our waitress was great at keeping our drinks full and making sure we were quite taken care of.  She even offered to bring our bill before the end of the game so that we wouldn't have to wait after the game when everyone was trying to get theirs in."

S'If I wasn\'t staying in Edinburgh for a week or so, I probably wouldn\'t have tried this place but I\'m so glad that we had a craving for pizza on our trip. Pizza Express was unique enough for me to try and they certainly made my night enjoyable ... food wise that is as this location had crappy service. \n\nI\'m deducting one star for bad service as everything else was great. Our waitress was the classic "I so don\'t want to be here" type and I sensed our doomed service from the first 10 minutes! Oh well, the manager did step in from time to time and he was the polar opposite. \n\nAlright down to business, the pizzas were awesome! The categorize them in four styles. The classic is a regular crust pizza, the romana is stretch thin and cooked on a wire mesh, the Theo Randall is made with Gaziello extra virgin olive oil, and the leggera is unique in that it is thin crust pizza with the center missing and a salad put in its place! These pizzas are about 500 calories so I can see why some people would try it.\n\nI had a Theo Gamberretini pizza with is described as a delicate marriage of brown shrimps, grated zucchini and garlic, with a cr\xc3\xa9me fra\xc3\xaeche and tomato sauce. Finished with grana padano, fresh parsley, lemon and chilli oil on the side. Yumtastic I tell ya!\n\nThe antipasto platter as a starter and the gelato for dessert was good start and end to the evening. This restaurant is situated in a very nice area by the Leith docks. I\'m sure to try this place again if ever in Edinburgh again. In the meantime, I\'ll look for something similar here in the Chicago, the city of the deep dish! I know ... wishful thinking!'

This is also the first place I've been to in Wisconsin that not only knows what a proper skirt steak is, but how to make it. \nAlso what they make is an avocado sauce, not guacamole.  Also the best I've had in Wisconsin. \n\nThe service was great, the people were extremely nice and the food came out timely. I also spoke with the owner for a bit which was nice. He explained how he actually flew to Cali to research before they place opened. It's awesome to hear the passion in his story. \nThere is only one con though. The only reason I didn't give it five stars has to do with the portions. Back in So Cal if you spend as much on a burrito you get something twice as big. I'm sure if the portions get a slight face lift then they would have the poor college kids flocking. At 7 or 8 bucks, you should have a burrito big enough to take some home.\n\nAs soon as I get downtown again, I'll be back for sure."

S'I came to Montreal with the intention of ONLY eating Canadian food during the brief few days I was there. This meant: Poutine and anything made from animals.\n\nThis extensive list obviously excludes Asian food, for which I have high standards of authenticity (as opposed to most Western food, which just needs to be delicious), and which feels silly to seek out when one is not in New York or California... or Asia.\n\nUnfortunately we found ourselves starving on the extremely touristy Rue Sainte-Catherine. I don\'t mean museum-touristy, but shopping-at-American-Eagle-touristy - a far more grim situation.  This section of the street is lined with Thai and Vietnamese restaurants. Finally I gave in, giving some internal excuse of "Well Vietnamese food has heavy French influence considering the colonization and all... maybe via syllogism, the Vietnamese food won\'t suck." \n\nWe randomly chose Thai & Pho because reading "soupe tonkinese" everywhere on such a cold day was making my mouth water, and because it was on a corner and it\'s always nicer to dine on a corner. Yep, some precise decision making. The intent was to just get something small to share before moving on to bigger and better in a different neighborhood. \n\nWe ordered a roti canai (because I love the stuff and it was a cheap app, $3.95) and a pho (large size was $6.99; they only have "small" "large" and "XL"). \n\nThe roti canai was a disappointment. If you have ever had roti canai, you would know that it is supposed to rise several inches in the air and be a fluffy, flaky, chewy paradox. Thai & Pho\'s roti was four tiny pieces of fried flat bread that were obviously pre-frozen. The curry sauce had a nice mild spice to it, but was way too salty. Avoid this one.\n\nAnd on to the important part - the pho! Noodles were soft, didn\'t clump, and were overall good. The broth was good as a broth, but didn\'t have much distinctive pho flavor. The beef we had ordered raw but the slices were not pink at all, but they were sliced extremely thin. I will say that a $7 bowl of noodle soup went a long way toward feeding two people. I am also a fan of the huge ladle provided to slurp up the goodness. The pho did not come with the usual raw bean sprout/lime/basil leaves... but there were Sriracha and Hoisin already on the table, so fine. \n\nOur food came within 10 minutes of ordering. I had no problems with the waitstaff, either, who were prompt and generally young and spoke fluent, barely accented English. Another reviewer seems displeased that the waitstaff didn\'t speak English - as opposed to French, or an Asian language?\n\nThe interior is modern-looking but the restaurant itself doesn\'t necessarily give off a "new" vibe. They seemed to have a healthy crowd in the vast space for the awkward time of day (3pm) and it looks like they could handle large groups easily. They are connected to Tokyo Sushi next door, so you can order from Tokyo Sushi\'s menu and/or a la carte sushi as well. \n\nAs expected, the meal was reasonably priced. Nothing really stands out about this place, so I\'m not sure how this review became so long. TL;DR? Avoid all the roti. The pho was definitely satisfying but reminds me of a Chinese pho place in Queens that I frequent when I am feeling too lazy to get to a real Vietnamese place.'

S'It was this past Saturday, on a very hot Las Vegas night that I attended a very cool Yelper\'s UYE. It wasTetsuro\'s Sayonara, Aloha Going Away UYE at Japanese Curry Zen. Tetsuro, the controversial bad boy of Yelp was setting off on a new journey to focus full time on a Doctorate in Psychology.\n\n  Inside the Yelp bad boy Tetsuro was a soul with a heart of gold. He is Ron. This 5 star rating is my tribute to Ron. I am privileged to have shared a Yelp turned to real life friendship with Ron. It was a friendship that developed from my posting of Buckingham Fountain in Chicago ("Married With Children" theme song). I had been following his reviews. They were works of genius. They were brilliant, funny, useful, and what some would regard as controversial. Controversy creates interest! As Tetsuro developed in Yelp, his reviews entered a new frontier: inspirational. In his Zion National Park Review, Tetsuro let out his soul. It was one of the most touching reviews that I ever read. The writing was on the wall for Tetsuro to develop into Ron. As my Yelp friendship with Tetsuro (Ron) grew, I was seeing through the writing. What I was seeing was a very sensitive person with a sense of humor. His pictures showed an admiration for nature and wildlife. He was a very giving Yelp friend that made public check-ins more fun with his votes and comments. He supported my and many of his his friends reviews, tips, and pictures. It was obvious that Tetsuro the bad boy of Yelp was going to yield to his antithesis: Ron.\n\n  Ron did too good of a job with Tetsuro. With Tetsuro came some controversy. Coming into the UYE there was some threats of trouble going down in the UYE. As we know when it is scorchy outside, crime escalates. I pictured the images in Barry Manilow\'s song "Copacabana."  Instead the night was 5 star Yelp camaraderie. Drama was replaced by optimism. Over delicious food in Japanese Curry some of my Yelp friends transformed from the digital screen to real life. They included Amanda. M, Ife. A, Lon, Roger. T, Samantha. G, Shawn. H, Tetsuro (Ron), and Vegas. J. If I forgot anybody, p.m. me and I will buy you dinner. I also developed Yelp friendships with Dalton. H and Eva. B. Although Tetsuro was misunderstood by some Yelpers, it was obvious that all the Yelpers here adored Ron.\n\n  When I drove into the Las Vegas night near two in the morning, I felt good for Ron. His personal friendship lives on. He is keeping his Yelp account. I am optimistic that he will return to Yelp as Ron, or The Yelper formerly known as Tetsuro, On account of his work he will not be able to show his picture. And then it dawned on me, "What if Ron attains a Doctorate in Psychology in Yelping and Social Media?" Tetsuro I will miss you, Ron I will be shooting you a text soon.\n\nThe Daniel.

S"Vivaldi is a bit in the middle of nowhere but definitely stands out as one of the better restaurants in the area - or in the West-Island. Right off of Gouin blvd between St. John's and Des Sources. \n\nIt's a decently sized restaurant with high ceilings and a comforting atmosphere and decor. It can get a little loud, it's always busy! That being said, make sure you make reservations in advance or be prepared to wait (maybe polish off a bottle while waiting for a table??). You can also watch the chefs do their thing as the kitchen is customer facing. I always like being able to see where my food is coming from.\n\nThe food is very delicious, as good as you'll find in the West-Island (hence the 5* rating) and would put up a good fight against some city Italian joints. Your typical Italian cuisine; veal, chicken, pizza, pasta, seafood. \n\nMy suggestions:\n\nAntipasti: \n\nBruschetta with goat cheese, fried squid, tomato & bocconcini, fried zucchinis, or grilled sausage.\n\nMain: \n\nVeal scallopini with lemon, marsala, or dijonnaise. \nMussels (dijonnaise or marinara). \nTortellini la contessa, oven baked pastas are pretty good for a restaurant (will never be like Nonna's but most places I don't like them at all). Their Penne arrabiata is good also as a side dish with your main instead of veggies or spaghetti. \nTheir thin-crust pizzas are great as well, I like Numero Uno but there are plenty to choose from so take your pick!\n\nDesserts:\n\nNot a big dessert guy so you're on your own for that one!\n\nI've been here several times and the service has always been on the money. Friendly, prompt, and always around if you need anything. The owners are quite involved as well, you can see them clearing tables and socializing with their guests. Never had any issues with the service here.\n\nBYOW - I love bring your own wine restos, why pay a premium for something I know I can get cheaper elsewhere - and that I will like? Major points for this (although I wouldn't care if it wasn't, just a bonus!). It's also another reason why it can get loud :)\n\nIf you're looking for a place in the West for larger groups, Vivaldi is a fantastic place for groups (birthdays, anniversaries, parties, etc.) and doesn't break the bank!\n\nIf you're in the West-Island, Vivaldi should definitely be on your list of places to check out.\n\nhttp://www.totalmtl.com/food/vivaldis/"

During the last trip, we decided to go there because (we always stay at Sam's Town) and my husband was starving.  He got the steak and eggs special for $5.99.  It was an amazing piece of steak with nice potatoes and toast....I mean, good looking food, not just grill food.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich and the fruit plate and it was the most awesome and succulent fruit I've had in a long time!  This month we went back (three months later) to celebrate our anniversary, and once again got hungry late at night.  I ordered the turkey sandwich and it was a very generous portion of turkey and a great sandwich, with a pickle spear and chips.  Too much for me to eat!  My husband had the steak and eggs again.  The staff is very attentive, the cook came out at one point when he had no orders to make and checked to see if we were all okay.  The only downside is that they don't refill your beverage for free, but hey, I can live!  This is a great place to eat!"

I had a sampler plate of pork rib, fried chicken wing, and fried tilapia with collard greens and mac-n-cheese for sides. The fried chicken (very light batter if any at all) and fish (cornmeal) were just great. The rib was falling off the bone tender, but I didn't really care for the house sauce and the rub seems non-descript needing some sauce. Collard greens were awesome with a little sweetness to go with the saltiness. Mac-n-cheese was not very interesting.\n\nIced tea came from a Nestea can, so beware.\n\nOverall a good experience, but order carefully."

It feels like a delicatessen inside with plenty of continetal breads, fillings and some inspiring decor.  The staff are welcoming, friendly and know about all of the good foor which they sell.  \nMy personal favourite is a turkey panini with loads of salad and salad cream - tastes amazing.  Further, it's all served in generous portions with plenty of exactly what you ask for.  You can get a delicious sandwich with a drink for just \xc2\xa33 which is a decent deal. \nLagermans is ideal for a cheap, filling and tasty lunch if your in the area."

It was ready exactly on time, and juicy rather than dried out.  If you order their meat kebabs and cut them in half with a pair of heavy duty scissors they are perfect party food.  They're a family business and deserve support, considering the dominance of super crappy fast food in this town.  I pray that they don't close.  Their location is crappy, and the interior is kind of offputting, so much so that we didn't want to eat in the first time but took out instead.  The owner insisted on giving me a free piece of semolina cake even though I just had a falefel because he saw me eyeing it.  It was very touching to me because I'm a Asian woman and not all merchants are that warm to me in rural illinois, if you know what I mean."

For a really high quality Korean dining experience, there are better places.\n\nOverall, we said: "I enjoyed our visit to Caf\xc3\xa9 Andamiro, but the food didn\'t quite win me over.

S"I used to frequent the Midtown Sundries located on Pineville-Matthews Rd until they closed rather suddenly a few years ago. When I saw there was going to be another Midtown opening I was thrilled. \n\nThe restaurant is located in a shopping center and the space was formerly occupied by the constantly changing Carolina Bistro. Not much has changed on the interior since converting to Midtown except maybe some additional TV's.\n\nWe have been here six times in the two months since they opened. I am disappointed with the results. Now keep in mind we have been there SIX times. So it obviously doesn't suck or we wouldn't have gone back. The problem is inconsistency. On a good day, you are going to get excellent food. But sometimes they fall a little short. For instance, we went around 8pm on a weekday evening. I ordered mac & cheese as a side. It was terrible. They scraped it from the bottom of a pan and the noodles were tough and/or crunchy. How do I know it was scraped from the bottom of the pan? Because my wife had ordered it too but only one order came out. The guy then said it was the last bit and he likes it burnt like that. Well, you're in the minority slick. That shouldn't have been served. \n\nAnother time we went and everything was great except for one flaw. The hush puppies that came with the fish basket were tough. I guarantee they had made a bunch earlier and rather than throw them out, they just threw them back in the deep fryer to get them hot again. They were so hard that you literally could not chew them. We sent them back and fresh ones were brought out. And you know what? They were great. But it's unacceptable to serve old food like that. From those two experiences we really felt a pattern forming. I hope the owners read this and get their act together. If you have old food, then just let it go. Don't be cheap.\n\nAlso, the salads? Serve them in cold bowls so the lettuce doesn't wilt. \n\nIt sounds like a lot of complaining. But I would call it tough love. I really really want this place to succeed and be at their best at all times. There is no reason for poor service when the waitstaff is meandering about. \n\nNow for the positives. Their food is excellent. The burgers get a thumbs up. The wings get a thumbs way up. I am hooked on the barbalo. The sides are all good. Seriously? This place deserves four stars. Hopefully they get the kinks worked out and I will re-review them as a 4-5 star establishment. Something tells me that this is going to be my spot to take in the NFL games this fall."

S'If you\'ve lived in LA within the last five to six years, you\'re familiar with the whole Pinkberry craze and all the knock-offs that have followed suit. Generally, these places are more hype than flavor but they\'re fun places to stop by with friends.\n\nWell, I know of Pinkberry, Yogurtland, Red Mango, and alot of the other "berry" fro-yo places, but I\'ve never heard of this one. It\'s pretty run of the mill as far as these spots go: topping selection, et al.. It\'s nothing to break an arm over but it\'s defintely not as bad as most of these reviews have made it out to be. It\'s worth a shot and you should really swing by to try it for yourself. I hope more fro-yo places open up in the Valley, because God knows we need them during the summer.\n\nPhoenix has a reputation for being a little LA without most of the bad things that label the City of Angels. Phoenix tends to borrow LA fads or staples (for better or worse) such as: In-N-Out, Krispy Kreme, Sprinkles, and now this. I can only hope that one day Phoenix will open up a Roscoe\'s Chicken and Waffles somewhere in the 602 area.'

But of all the crappy restaurants at Westgate, this is possibly the worst.  \n\nWe went a week or so after they opened and it was moderately busy.  Nothing crazy, but busy enough.  Went inside and told the hostess that we'd like to sit outside.  We were seated on the patio and saw a couple waiters roaming around the patio area so we figured that we were good to go.  10 minutes later, I went back inside and told the hostess that we hadn't received any service.  She apologized and told me she would let them know.  5 minutes later, after watching another waiter walk by us, I went back inside and grabbed him and told him we had been waiting.  He told us that we weren't his table and walked off.  We left after that.\n\nWe tried it again a few months after that.  We sat inside and figured we would have better luck.  While our waiter did actually show up this time, the food took forever and he brought out appetizers and meals at almost the same time.  The food is decent so it gets an extra star for that but with service this bad when the place is slow, I can't imagine what it is like when a football or hockey game is going on."

S'A better name for this place would be "Schizophrenic Pizza".  Seriously.  I walked in about a month back and ordered a simple medium pepperoni pizza.  Waited a bit, got my food, and was good to go.  Got home, was treated with the freshest, most wonderful doughy (in a good way) pizza I\'ve had in my eight years in Vegas.  I was so happy.  Finally!  I have found a good pizza place in town!  And it\'s half a block from my new house!  \n\nAbout a week later, I once again decide to get pizza.  This time, I call ahead.  Medium pepperoni pizza, as always.  I notice the box is different this time around, but think nothing of it.  I get home, open the box... and it\'s a completely different looking pizza than before.  It\'s like they took the typical every-fucking-pizza-in-Vegas cardboard awful garbage pizza, threw it in a generic box, and handed it off like nothing was wrong.  I took two bites and thew away the rest.  I was so fucking mad I almost went back to throw it at the employees for sullying the name of what should be a great pizza place.\n\nMy girlfriend went there last night, and she walked in to order.  And she got.... a pizza much like the first one I had there.  Amazing, fresh, doughy, incredible, awesomeness.  I destroyed my half in about 0.00005 seconds.  It was wonderful.\n\nIn summary, this is apparently two different places operating out of the same location.  Don\'t call ahead.  Don\'t get delivery.  Just walk in, order the pizza, and leave fat and happy.'

S"My friend took me here for dinner on Saturday and I was absolutely blown away.\n\nThe Concordia House is a German Beer Hall and basically looks exactly the way you would expect: dark wood, crests aplenty and all sort of stuff painted on the walls. Plus, the servers wear dirndls!!! \n\nWe were seated by an elderly German man (I think the owner) who told us that we should both sit facing the middle of the room, so that we can watch the dancers. Apparently, they have a live band on Saturday nights and people dance! I am SO EXCITED at this point. \n\nIt only gets better. I order a pint of beer and instead, am served 0.5L of beer! Metric beer! \n\nMy friend orders the chicken schnitzel, and I order the Concordia Platter: 1 small schnitzel, 1 smoked pork chop, 1 Oktoberfest sausage, dumplings (basically stuffing in gravy) and sauerkraut. I drove 2 hours through a snowstorm to get there. I was leaving there hungry.\n\nThe meal was good, not the BEST I've ever had, but definitely very tasty. The schnitzel was great as was the sausage. My dining partner was very happy with her chicken schnitzel, which was basically took up half the dinner plate.\n\nFor dessert, we split an apple strudel, which was homemade, but not quite sweet enough. \n\nDuring dessert, we were treated to a two man band featuring a guy on drums and a guy on the accordion and keyboard, as well as a bunch of seniors ballroom dancing across the floor. It was pretty spectacular.\n\nThis place gets 3.5 stars for food, 3 stars for service and a billion stars for atmosphere. I will definitely be back, and with friends!"

S"This is a delightful, rustic wee Patisserie offering some very tasty, authentically French bites!\n\nI stopped by mid afternoon for a latte and some snacks. Although they still have some freshly made croissants and pain au chocolat on offer, I tried one of their panini's. I decided to break out of my Mediterranean eating habits and ordered a sweet Thai chicken filler. Not only was it really reasonably priced but it was also delicious! The tangy, gently spiced chicken was appetising without being too overloaded with sauce. It satisfied my hunger cravings without bloating my belly up.\n\nI got mine to takeaway since it was quite full inside, but if you choose to sit in and arrive at the right time of day, it's a very mellow yellow environment. The walls are painted a gentle, creamy yellow, and its bespoke design and slightly bohemian feel is very appealing. You could almost believe you were in Montmatre!\n\nThe staff were friendly and I can happily report their sweets were delicious. Aside from doing healthy smoothies, they have a lovely selection of cakes. I had a macaroon swirl and not only was it a tasty sugar rush, but it also cleansed my palate. Tres Bien!"

Turned down Wendy's, In N Out, and Burger King for the kids. Big Mistake.\n\nService was bad and the food was cold. \n\nMy advice: find another McDonald's if you must have it or go some place else before you go to this place. Plain terrible. Gave me the wrong burger and it was cold. The fries were also cold. They must be trying to see if they can be the worst fast food restaurant in the area. They are number 1 in terrible."

While you wait you can gamble and drink at Red Label!  \n\nHOWEVER, Delivery STINKS!  I had friends over to our house (4 miles from the restaurant) and decided to order in.  When I called to order no one answered - ever.  So I called the Red Label bar and asked to place an order with the restaurant, it sounded like the chef was sitting at the bar! The chef does not speak English well at all and he's a one man show (takes the order, cooks it and delivers it), so all in-house orders go first and anyone wanting delivery just has to wait...and wait.....and wait.  We placed our order at 8:15pm and called three times to check on it.  An hour and a half later we received our food (actually it was almost 2 hours).  \n\nThe guy makes some mean Thai and I will continue to eat here - I will just never get it delivered again!  He maybe needs a delivery person or a new business plan?"

S"My hopes weren't too high- it's a hot dog chain, they have good prices, and I was in a frankfurter mood. \n\nHit up the drive thru and service was quick but a bit brusque. Received my 2 mustard dogs for $2, and went on my way. As I unwrapped my first dog, it rolled out of the wrapper and splattered mustard all over my work outfit. I wasn't trying to juggle the darn thing, I wasn't multitasking, it was a disaster. Even the second one, which I was more careful with, was a gigantic mess- mustard everywhere. I don't understand what the staff is doing with the wrappers if the mustard is getting all over the place.\n\nAlso, even for $1, my expectations were a little better- when you specialize in a niche product, it should be better than what I can get for the same price at a gas station. It's not. The junkyard dog will still be my go-to, but I'll be hitting up another location to get my fix... somewhere that won't require me to do my laundry after getting a simple snack."

They can't make money on their 350% markup of alcohol, so they really have to do well with the food.  This restaurant did not disappoint, both in service and taste.\n\nThe inside is very small which makes this a pretty intimate place.  My girlfriend and I were clearly having a date night, but there was a row of tables lined up next to us that was set out for a large party.  It's nice when a restaurant can be small enough to have an intimate atmosphere, yet still accommodate a large range of group sizes.   I had the prix fixe menu, which was a LOT of food (so the price tag wasn't unreasonable at all), and every portion of it was delicious.\n\nIf you're visiting Montreal, GO TO THIS PLACE.

My wife was nauseated by her dish to the extent that it spoiled the afternoon. My brussels sprouts tasted and had the texture of having been on the cooker for the last 6 hours, which I suspect was actually the case.

S'Let me clear something up straight away... Taquito is more of a Taco Bell rather than being Edinburgh\'s answer to Chipotle or Moe\'s. Now that that\'s out of the way... \n\nI stopped in here for a quick bite at a cheap price... and that\'s exactly what I got. For just under \xc2\xa34 I had a decent chicken burrito and a canned fizzy drink. The burrito was good (for Scotland standards). While the chicken and rice were great, it could use some improvement on having more fresh ingredients. For example, I\'m pretty sure the jalape\xc3\xb1os (chills) were the kind from a jar, which is odd because I think fresh ones are actually cheaper than buying them in the jar. Also, I didn\'t notice much if any cilantro (coriander), which is one of the things that usually sticks out to me when I have fresh Mexican or southwest food. At any rate, I would by no means be planning to compare it with a burrito you might pick up in Mexico or the USA. \n\nThe service had much to be desired, but I must remind you that the window says "Mexican Street Food." Taquito reminds me a lot of a taco truck that might be parked on the side of the street, and with that in mind the service is quite similar. They take your order, eventually ask for your money (which could be a few minutes later), and not really much to say other than that. it\'s actually a bit confusing when it comes to figuring out where to queue to order and also to wait for your order, so if it\'s a bit awkward you\'re not the only one. \n\nThere really isn\'t much seating. It\'s not the place for planning to sit down and enjoy a meal with friends. The seating suggests exactly what I believe is intended... either you\'re eating quick and then on your way, or your getting it takeaway. I was on my own and just wanted a quick lunch, so Taquito was perfect. \n\nYou may be wondering with my review why I\'ve given it 4 stars. The reason for this is that you can be out the door for less \xc2\xa33.50-4.00 and when I compare that to what I could get elsewhere for the same price, it really can\'t be beat. Until Chipotle breaks out of London (and cuts their price in half), I\'m happy to go to Taquito.'

I didn't hate the place but I didn't love it. The setting is lovely and the service was great but the food was, well, eh at best. I had the crab cakes which didn't tast particularly fresh and I though the portion was very skimpy for the price. My mother had their california roll salad- big mistake! The salad came on top of a rice ball which was cold, hard and dry- like it had been refrigerated for days- unacceptable! The rest of the salad was a let down as well- few shrimp and not many other ingredients on the plate. We had a pitcher of sangria which was ok but overpriced. The best thing was the lemon cake cookie. \n\nDon't get me wrong- it is a cute little lunch place- but not all it is cracked up to be by any means."

S"My husband and I have visited Boswell's a few times now, and each time I've really enjoyed what I've ordered.  The space Boswell's is in has gone through a few different incarnations over the years, and Boswell's is the best establishment by far.  They have a variety of sandwiches and burgers, as well as salads and soup.  It's not often that I crave a sandwich, but the Grindhouse is definitely craveable!  Though not a vegetarian myself, I'm intrigued by the vegetarian options on the menu - there really is something for everyone.  I'd love to try dessert, but I've never been able too - I've always been too full after finishing my meal!  The only reason Boswell's gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.  Sandwich prices are $9-ish, which means we'll probably only visit for dinner...there's no lunch menu that I'm aware of.  In any case, you do get what you pay for - these sandwiches are worth the price!  We'll definitely be returning soon!"

S'What a horrible experience. Besides the food being totally awful, the \'manager\' on duty was rude to every employee working.  The cashier (Almaz) was very nice, and pleasant. Immediately after I placed my order, the manager yelled to her \'dont take any more orders and go take lunch\'. \nThen the phone rang, and the manager answered it \'Mike, i\'ve got a line and cant talk\' and promptly hung up.\n\nNow, they appeared to have a new employee working the other register. After the rude manager gave me my order, he went over and pulled a basket of fries out of the fryer. I was trying to get their attention to get some ketchup and she proceeded to yell at him for pulling the fries and then told him to help me. She then proceded to pull the fries out of the \'serve bin\' and dump them back into the fryer.\n\nOne customer (as i was walking away) made a comment to the manager "perhaps if you were a little nicer to them they\'d listen better" (referring to how she was treating the  employees).\n\nIt would have been nice if they provided salt/ketchup without having to ask - but the point is moot as I will NEVER go to this location again. I\'ll eat at the pizza place next door or the Paradise bakery down the hall. I have never tried them, but they have to be more professional and have better food.\n\nSTAY AWAY!!'

There is 1 small table inside for 2 people sit at if you really need to but I think it's more of a take out place. I had the chicken gyro which was flavorful and seasoned perfectly.

Not much else to say, except from the first bite I was so happy. I got the fava bean dinner and my counterpart the steak dinner. Both were amazing. He added some of the sauce from my beans to his rice, but other than that, perfect. The steak was seasoned, and was very good. Both dishes came with a side salad, which was great because I swapped out bites of my meal with bites of the salad to 'cleanse the palate' and then each bite of fava was equally yummy.\nI was too full for dessert, but plan to go back many, many times!"

With today\'s deal from My Personal Meals by Bistro Mobile, fork over $59 and receive the My Choice package: five days of meals delivered to your front door (a $130 value). You\'ll get your pick of four fresh, delicious options each day, including heartier meals like Voodoo Spicy Chicken Pasta and pork chili verde; lighter snacks like fruit and cottage cheese; and strawberry cheesecake for dessert. Say goodbye to planning, shopping, and cooking when you pick up today\'s deal."\n\nI thought their concept was good, BUT their communication on their end wasn\'t clear. They have two different websites up that are conflicting in messages.\n\nBistro mobile has the 400x plan, which consist 4 meals a day under 400 calories. When I first looked into this offer, I was directed to this website: http://www.bistromobilelasvegas.com/menus_4.html. I bought the offer thinking it was a pretty good deal, for healthy food. \n\nThan I looked back and was directed to this website: http://mypersonalmeals.com/zgrid/themes/10463/intro/index.jsp\n\nI didn\'t think much of it, since both websites are the same company... Or is it?\n\nThe Food: it was pretty good, but most meals run 530 calories and TONS of sodium. Needless to say, that my blood pressure was shooting to the roof and I felt crappy, groggy and tired after eating my lunch; not very healthy. Note: the meals I chose for myself were described grilled, veggies, or included brown rice. \n\nTo sum it up, they need to be more descriptive and clear. food is delicious, but if you\'re selling healthy conscious meals, make it very clear with your statement. Please go in-depth with your website (maybe including calories with meals) and have clear communication.'

Sauces and fries lend themselves more to personal tastes, so even though I sneaked some off my wife\'s plate, I won\'t comment on them but I believe pretty much anyone who had the chicken I had would give it the highest marks. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Price was $1.09 per piece and in my opinion worth it.'

Well when the food came I noticed that my chicken looked a little weird. As I cut into the chicken it didn't cut like normal chicken. I took a bit & it tasted spongy; the texture and taste were really gross. So I asked my husband about his chicken & he said it was also weird. Needless to say we both could not eat it. Now we have been to this chilies before & we always get some kind of chicken dish and we have never had this problem. I asked the server if they changed their chicken & she said no. But something was definitely off. Here's my tip to you, if you go here do not get anything with chicken breast. I'm not sure if they changed vendors or what, but the chicken has definitely changed."

It is small and the average age was 63 and this was on a Saturday night at 830pm. The food was just OK, although I will note that my steak was cooked perfectly but lacked salt, therefore, lacked flavor. I believe our assorted steamed veggies were frozen and possibly microwaved. My plain mash was that - PLAIN. I was hoping that it would have a little bit of flavor but it didn't. The onion rings were not fresh or homemade. I could have purchased the same quality at Sainsbury's. Not impressive to say the least. Would have rather gone to Wildfire, even though I have never been there. At least they would have had a modern restaurant for me to marvel at instead of the radiator with food crusted to it.\n\nDress code is casual. This place is nothing special as far as look and feel (and our concierge did advise us of that but this was below that set expectation)."

Besides the tasty soups, you'll find a wide variety of sandwiches built around a variety of cheeses, from Parmesan to Stilton. The cheese is fantastic, the cold cuts are high-quality and the bread is always fresh from their bakery.\n\nThe place is super small, so on days when it's too cold and wet for them to open up the terrace, you might have a hard time getting a seat, but the turnover's pretty good and you can easily take your meal to go.\n\nAn extra recommendation goes specifically to the Carpaccio sandwich on baguette: roast beef, lemon juice, black pepper, olive oil and a generous helping of parmesan cheese make it less of a sandwich and more of an experience. Awesome."

Upon entering for my families 1st time trying this spot for take out it would be our last.  I was in total shock seeing the cashier handling the register then placing lids on the tartar sauces used for the meals.  At no point was any washing of the hands or using gloves ever attempted, mind you dealing with the register.  As my families meal was brought out, I see a line cook stuffing his face with no gloves on just his bare hands.   I said to myself, this is unsanitary practices being used here.  I then ask another worker to call the managers attention who\'s behind her and she gets into the "deer" mode, acting as if who\'s the manager. I finally make eye contact with him as he knew I was right and went to the kitchen to possibly tell the guy stuffing his face, you got caught.  The manager was looking all dirty himself too, no name tag, no indication that he\'s the manager.  I asked for a full refund, I was not spending my money here.  I then ask for his name which he pulls out his a$$ and says it\'s "Mr. Rapport".  Well that\'s the name I\'ll use when I compile a letter to the corporate office.

S'I actually don\'t mind the Arby\'s chain; I certainly don\'t go to one on a regular basis, but when I do I usually enjoy the treat that is a nice giant sandwich and a side of curly fries. Usually what I get from an Arby\'s is an a-ok fast food variety sandwich that, while greasy, is still very tasty and doesn\'t leave me feeling sick to my stomach.\n\nThat said, I never enjoy the food I pick up from this particular Arby\'s. Firstly, often when I\'ve placed an order in their drive-thru I\'ve found that I\'ve had to sit and wait for my "fast food" for 10 to 15 minutes. After waiting for my food - on the days that I didn\'t leave the line in frustration before placing an order at all because I couldn\'t even do so in a reasonable amount of time - I\'ve found that what I\'ve gotten has been mediocre compared to what I\'ve experienced at other Arby\'s. Common issues I\'ve come across include the lack of sauces when I\'ve asked for them, overcooked food, and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart AND after eating I begin to feel sick to my stomach.\n \nSorry, guys. I may not expect a lot from a fast food joint, but this Arby\'s just doesn\'t impress me.'

Our waiter initially came off as a pretty boy, but within seconds he had me impressed with his knowledge of the ingredients and food in general.

S'I found out about this place by accident as I stopped to get gas at the next door station and noticed menus for El Ranchero so I took one. I noticed that it is a taco shop located adjacent to the gas station and after browsing the menu I made note to come back.\n\nMy sweetheart and I were in the mood for Mexican food one night so we stopped here to give it a try and we also got 10% our tab for checking in on Yelp!\n\nThe food was super good, fresh, authentic, generous with great prices!\n\nWhat we ordered...\n\nshredded beef burrito which was stuffed with tender meat, green peppers and onion!\nrolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, hand stuffed and rolled!\ncarne asada soft street tacos, full and delicious!\nCalifornia burrito, jam packed good!\n\nThe place is clean and the staff is Amazing. You can dine in, take out or use their drive thru window for on the go grub! We decided to dine in on our last visit and it was a nice and comfortable experience.\n\nThey boast about being Authentic and they are! I have to say they have the best homemade frijoles (refried beans) I have ever tasted!\n\nWe will be back again for sure, and lucky for us they are close to our home!'

S'It is always a HUGE compliment to me when the staff of an Asian Restaurant does NOT ask if I would like any utensils other than Chop Sticks! !! !!!  I did not notice until I was almost finished that ALL of the tables ONLY had Chop Sticks!  They did NOT ask here... YAY!  I\'m White!  Real white (almost transparent) so I\'m always glad when they assume I have skills!  \n\nMy first dine was lunch and I was served VERY Fast!  Four of the Staff stopped by my table to serve or bring more water... ALL were very FRIENDLY and helpful - None were shy about making suggestions and understood my poor Korean Language skills (I have None)!  Also I easily understood almost everything they said!  They encouraged my Photos and made suggestions!!!  Fantastic!!!\n\nAfter five dines here (one Lunch and four Dinners) I feel comfortable saying this place is more than Service Focused it is SERVICE DRIVEN! !! !!!  The staff that do not walk very fast, RUN!  This place is one of the best examples the Service TEAM model!  One server is SuperBoy on Korean (the Ultimate Rod0 Service Award and compliment)!\n\nKorean Dishes and Chinese Dishes with Korean Influence - They assured me that no matter what I chose it would have Korean style and I said GOOD!!!\n\nEgg Flower Soup is similar to Egg Drop Soup and I liked it a little better!\n\nGan-jia-jang: Pork and Onions in a Black Bean Sauce with Noodles (my server mixed it at the table).  Before I ordered this my server warned me that it was NOT spicy!  I asked if it was Bland and she said no it is flavorful just not "hot spicy"!\n\nKorean Style Barbecue Ribs, served on a sizzling Iron Plate, White Onions underneath, garnished with a little Green Onion and Sesame seeds, Kiwi Juice in the House-made sauce, these are real good!\n\nA lesson in eating Korean with no Utensils by wrapping the food "Bul-go-gi"  Marinated Beef, served on a sizzling Iron Skillet with Rice and a Bean Paste in leaves of Lettuce (I did use chopsticks to load the food on the Lettuce).\n\nMongolian Beef, Korean Style - Very Good!  This is one of the Best versions of Mongolian Beef I have eaten!\n\nDumplings are a popular Korean Dish - Here you have the options of: Fried, Boiled or Steamed - I ordered mine Fried and they were good though it is not a dish I would want everyday (You still have not seen "OLD BOY" I can tell).\n\nBeef Lo Mein with Korean flair, more Garlic and Sauce than the typical Chinese version and the vegetables were perfect.\n\nKimchi made with Cabbage and another "Kimchi" made with Cucumbers (they called it Kimchi with Cucumbers). Both were very nice and perfectly spicy!  These are my favorite of the extras served with Korean Dishes!'

For my fairness, the next time I tried to come in the bartender informed me I could no longer receive food or drink at their establishment as he had almost been fired and the mother had been upset.

Our "nice" dinner quickly (or should I say, very slowly) turned horrible.\n\nWhen we walked up, we were greeted by a nice hostess who promptly seated us.  This was the last pleasant moment.  We ordered an appetizer, which took 30 minutes to get to us (mind that there were only 3-5 other couples dining).  I eventually had to tell the manager that we had yet to receive our appetizer -- 30 seconds later he returned with it.  I will mention that our server walked by us approximately 20 times during our wait, without making eye contact or apologizing at all.\n\nAbout 1 minute after finishing our appetizer, another waiter (who we had not seen all night) brought us our entrees without even removing the appetizer plate.  The food looked horrible, as if it had been sitting in a steam tray all day.  I had ordered the Hong Kong style noodles, which were thrown in a cheap, green-tinted pyrex serving tray and looked like one giant glob of noodle.  The sauce was bland.  The shrimp had a nice flavor to it, but that was about it.\n\nMy fiancee ordered Egg braised tofu with abalone sauce, and it essentially was fried tofu slathered in a disgusting looking gravy on a bed of creamed cabbage.\n\nBoth my fiancee and I have traveled the world extensively and have eaten fare from numerous countries and this was by far the poorest "authentic" cuisine we had ever tasted.\n\nSteer clear, don\'t waste your money (or your time) here.\n\nFood:          D\nService:      F\nAmbiance:  B+'

When the girl totaled it up and told me it had been $5.47  I said whoa, something wrong here and tried to  explain the cost couldn't be right she looked at me like I had just explained Einsteins theory of relativeaty to her. Another worked pointed out she had punched the wrong buttons on the computer and would need a supervisor to cancel. Here come the shift supervisor, once more I explained what I wanted and what happened, she did the magic and now had to refund the difference of $5.47 to $3.28 to me. She handed me $1..50 so I asked what is this and her reply the difference between the order total and what we charged your debit card. Now I am getting frustrated so I asked her if she had recently taken any math refresher courses because she needed to. Out comes the I-phone and she uses the calculator on it to figure the refund, good job, carry your brains in your hand, you will get really far in this world with that keen talent.

S'Even though we had SO many great meals on this trip and this one\'s been totally overshadowed by others, I have to be fair and give it four stars as any other time in any other place, it would\'ve been a pretty memorable meal. BYOB, of course we were running late so we went to the restaurant first, asked them about the closest liquor store (SAQ on the corner of Duluth & St. Denis) then RAN back to the restaurant. It\'s been a few weeks so my memory\'s hazy (and they don\'t seem to have a website to refresh my memory) but I believe we had foie gras torchon and escargot for appetizers then duck breast and lamb leg confit for entree. The escargot appetizer was quite memorable, unlike any other preparations I\'ve had, with creamy sauce and fresh vegetables or herbs. Great mix of texture and flavor. Highlight of the meal. The foie gras torchon was also excellent. The entrees were also very good, but perhaps not as memorable as the appetizers as I can\'t seem to recall much about them other than the fact that they were delicious! I had floating islands as dessert (good, but I prefer my meringue crunchy on the outside) and my husband had something that I have no recollection of other than the fact that it tasted very strongly of alcohol to me -- but then I don\'t drink at all and can taste alcohol in the most miniscule amount. He loved it and proclaimed it a very "adult" dessert. Overall a great meal, not sure if it\'s a destination-dining sort of place, but most definitely a solid neighborhood spot. I know I would totally frequent it if I lived in Montreal! Also a very nice waiter, we even shared our wine -- which he happily drank!'

S"Been here many times when it was La Collina and have been here since it has changed names over to Carmine's.  As long as they have my Rigatoni LaCollina (rigatoni pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ham, peas, mushrooms, diced onions), I don't care.  I have turned so many of my friends on to this pasta dish I should be getting royalties.  My twist is that I have it with linguine instead of rigatoni but hey, to each their own.  The place is a good size place with a nice view, prices are reasonable, and parking is easy."

S'So I went here for brunch with my fam before heading back home to Orange County.  The location is like past the little Las Vegas Chinatown area on the same street.  Plenty of parking since it\'s in a huge sort of shopping center I guess.  It\'s located at the very end of it.  What I found was hilarious was that it had a "Drive Thru Pick Up" sign on the side of the building because I don\'t think it actually has a drive thru.\n\nAnyways, the place is clean and they have pretty high tech equipment for a pho place.  I\'ve never seen a pho place with touch screen computers to place orders, but hey, that\'s just me.\n\nI forget what number it was on the menu, but I ordered  vermicelli noodles, egg rolls, bbq beef, cucumber slices and shredded lettuce, and all that yummy side accessories that comes with most Vietnamese meals with a nice cup of freshly squeezed (so they said) orange juice.  Haha, I had no complaints about it.  It was good and I was starving from drinking all night on an empty stomach.  It came in a huge bowl and it was very filling and gave me enough energy to drive home.  \n\n*edit* - The Vietnamese name for the meal I got is called bun thit nuong cha gio\n\nFrom what the rest of my family said, they enjoyed their meals for the most part; well three of my cousins didn\'t because their meals weren\'t served the way they wanted it.  They ordered the same thing, with certain specifications to their meals, but the server didn\'t get it right so they just dealt with what they got.  \n\nThe thing I hated about this place was the service was TERRIBLE!  One of my cousins didn\'t get his meal til almost the very end!  When the guy (who wasn\'t the one who actually took our orders) came out with a bowl of pho, we asked what it was because we weren\'t sure what it was; he looked down at it and gave us a shrug and said, "Uh...I don\'t know."  Funny reaction, but not really the response we were looking for.  But yea, when it came time to getting our meals, some of us had to wait a while.\n\nOverall, yea, I guess it was a pretty decent place.  It wouldn\'t be first on my list because of the service, but the food is pretty good to just deal with the service.'

S'Ghastly Experience\n\nWe were traveling in Montreal with another family. We had visited the Atwater Market (excellent) earlier in the day and snacked on wine, cheese and bread in the late afternoon before attending the Sound and Light show at Notre Dame. Since there were nine of us in total, we made a reservation at Graziella. While it was a bit more upscale than we were expecting, we settled in. \n\nWe informed the waiter that we were looking for a light meal and he made some suggestions for sharing of particular dishes. Oddly, a particular wine we were interested in which was on the menu by the glass (happened to be the most expensive one) was not available by the bottle. Even more strange was the waiter\'s comment, "We only have it by the glass because we don\'t have that much of it. Anyway, it is a little young, I\'m sure I can help you find something better." Hmmm... The most expensive wine by the glass on the menu is bad, eh? The warning bells were ringing.\n\nWhat happened next blew our minds. The manager approached and informed us that we had not ordered enough food. That each person in the party must order at least one dish - despite the fact that there were younger children in our group and we had early on indicated we were looking for a light meal. This place was not cheap, we had ordered at least a couple of hundred dollars of food and were definitely interested in a nice bottle of wine. It was also nearly empty. Needless to say, we paid for our San Pelligrino and left. We have eaten at hundreds of restaurants all over the world and never experienced something like that. With such poor business practices as this, I would be surprised if this establishment existed a year from now.'

S"First off this place is getting five stars mostly based off customer service from my last two years in vegas. Obviously after coming here frequently for those 2 years not all my meals were perfect and I've had typical fast food issues like messed up orders or messy tacos or whatever but it's expected from all fast food but all issues here were handled greatly. Idk if it's because Every time I ordered my drink I said bah-jah but they always recognized me and were happy to see me which made my visits nice wether I was getting off work or drunk at 1am. They have some really\nGreat people working there and I hope they are all fortunate to move on to bigger and better things, restaurant can be cold if you dine in and bathroom had no mirror which are the things I noticed. Some new guys working there seem zoned out but they perform the job adequately. All in all please continue to serve fellow military members with the same service I got and people will love this store as I came too.

S'Very solid Chinese restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal at the intersection of Rue Notre Dame and Sainte Helene--a block or two away from the Hotel Gault where I recently stayed.\n\nVery good lunch specials during the week. Probably the best General Tso Chicken I have had anywhere with high quality chicken breast, fried rice, corn soup with crabmeat, and a spring roll as part of the lunch special. The sauce on my my chicken was rich and delicious--high quality Chinese food, not fast food--and a little bit, but not too, spicy. I would like to come back and try their Shrimp and Scallops in Garlic Sauce. Definitely worth a shot--surprised by the earlier review.'

This location is attached to the US airways Centre and can be accessed outside. They have another  Carls jr inside but it's smaller. It's bright inside. This location is a decent size,  and the prices are very affordable! \n\nThere was a covention going on when i went so there was a long line. I don't drink soft drinks so  i was about to order the chicken tenders alone which come with 5 pieces for $4.79. But the combo meal coves with fries and a super large drink for  $5 so i said what the heck I'll just order the combo. \n\nGot my order quick, huge chicken tenders really hot. But it was kind of bland so i got the bbq sauce and honey mustard than i was good. \n\nBut what really impressed me about this place? The staff. That very day, somehow all and i mean ALL the staff working that day were all female. One of them was pregnant too. I was so impressed by their sense of urgency,  awesome quick service and team work. I've never seen anything like it. They weren't rude even if the customers were. Kudos to you ladies. I've never seen an awesomely run fast food place especially by an all female staff!  Thank you for the great service \n\nWould recommend and come back because of the experience"

I ordered the House Salad for $10.  Yes, I know $10 for a salad - but this is one of the best salads I've ever had!  Green, sprightly leaves combined with this wonderful balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  It's a meal size salad.  For my entree, I ordered the Carpellaci Spinach and Ricotta with Fresh Tomato Sauce for $16 - a nice plate of pasta so simply put together yet so tasty.  Carpellaci is something like a ravioli except slightly bigger - looks like flat wontons, really!  \n\nThe rest of my party ordered the Spaghetti with Meatballs - really, really good sauce and nicely ground meat in the meatballs.  The special pasta of the day was the Seafood in Marinara sauce.  Also, quite good.\n\nWhy did I only give 4 stars out of 5?  Well, it was quite difficult to flag down the waiter.  When he did turn up, we asked him to get us chilli flakes but I wanted it for my dad but he gave only to my sister and dashed off before I could tell him we wanted more round the table!  Go figure!"

(Ordered extra sauce too) How does this happen since I know Rocky Rococo requires that they measure their ingredients? The place was empty, so I know that they weren't busy with different customers. The most insulting part however was paying $22 for a large pizza, returning the whole thing, and not even getting offered a refund or a coupon. As a former employee, that's just not the way it's supposed to happen. Rocky's is a pretty good place to eat, but this is a location to avoid at all costs if you want your order correct !!!..

I have lived in the valley for 28 years and to tell you the truth, I have never found any restaurants that have wonderful chinese food for a fair price.  WELL I HAVE FOUND IT NOW!!!!!  This place is located near power on Superstition Springs Blvd.  The building is very unassuming, but when you walk in it is nice ambiance, pleasant staff, great service and the food, absolutely top notch for very reasonable prices (most of the dinner entrees are $9-$11 and lunch specials from 11:30 am - 3 pm run $6.50 to $7.50.  My son ordered the Garlic Chicken and I had the Mu Shi Pork.  I was impressed with the variety of vegetables in the chicken dish and the Mu Shi Pork was perfectly done with beautiful presentation. Their menu says they do catering, they have family dinner pricing with the full meal deal in options, and they do take out.  (Check out their website).  They have a wonderful assortment of dishes and even have a kids meal...\n\nFor years my family in UT have had a tradition of going to a place in Roy, call the ABC Mandarin.  I have always lamented that nobody in Arizona was as good as that restaurant...I now have one here I can treat my family to, and for the prices, I can eat there whenever I want!!!!  SSOOOOOO EXCITED to find this place and hope they are discovered and get a following quickly so they will stick around for a long long time...\n\nGive it a try, you will be absolutely amazed...I sure was!'

The ramen was below average for a $10 bowl but it\'s a mall sushi place after all. Their "designer sushi" was pretty interesting. Tried out one of their Hako sushi and it was actually pretty good.\n\nThe only complaint I have with their prioritization skills. I group of 4 ordered the 60-piece giant platter right before me during the lunch rush hour. Just b/c those people were fine with waiting 30-40 min doesn\'t mean the rest of the people in line were fine with it as well. They ended up assigning all 3 sushi chefs to making the giant platter instead of doing a 2-1 split. My ramen came in 10 min and I had to wait another 30 min just to get my 6 pieces of sushi...'

And even those were sometimes handicapped with the shootings that closed it from time to time.\n\nSo when I saw last week that they were opening one at the Epicentre (GO SIT IN THE CORNER!), I knew I was going to venture over for lunchtime goodness.\n\nThe place is still new and there was a line around almost the entire interior of the restaurant.  This lead to about a 15 minute wait for me to place my order for a Joey Bag of Donuts (I usually go with a Homewrecker).  I think my order was transformed to a Homewrecker since the only real difference is the cost of sour cream and guacamole.\n\nIt was just as tasty as I remembered.  Fresh-ish ingredients, good amount of steak, slightest tinge of spice to their guac.\n\nIt was a semi-register friendly meal, too.  With a side of queso and a drink only ran me a touch over eight pesos, making it one of my cheaper lunchtime, uptown meals. \n\nThere IS a bottleneck after check out though.  This revolutionary soda machine is baffling to some.  Boasting 100 flavor combinations, its an all in one Coke machine.  With only one spout.  So if someone is perplexed by the five different flavored Coke combos, you can get a logjam, quick.  I went with a regular Coke, raspberry Coke, cherry Coke combo that wasn't too shabby, and the future diabetics of Charlotte would look back on such a drink fondly.\n\nSeating is an okay mix of two tops, four tops, booths and bar along the windows.  Once the excitement of being new wears off, this will be easier to deal with..."

We practically ran out of gas and noticed it across the way. we\'ve been here twice and were surprised that the food is much better than the environment might suggest.  Spacious but In need of a good scrubbing and loving care we were served items off the menu that were really good.  The homemade albondigas soup is worth returning for.  If the way a place looks is important to you get over it, their homemade food is just that.

The only failing grace of the Memorial Union is the disgusting food served at the Lakefront Cafe.  The Chinese place is inedible and will make you nauseated for at least 2 days.  The pizza is bland and often undercooked.  The salad bar is not readily maintained and usually a mess by 12:30... and if you want to wait 15 minutes go ahead and get a disappointing flavorless wrap.  \nThe Lakefront Cafe does get an A for effort; the design and decor of the Lakefront Cafe is pleasant and perfectly climate controlled. Usually there is plenty of room to sit and tables in which to spread out your books for studying.  Fortunately, you can get something edible elsewhere and bring it to eat here.'

I am not a vegan myself and I was quite worried that I would end up eating some boring salad with taste-less cucumber. Well, it turned out that I ate one of the best meals I can possibly remember: the food was superb, really tasty and filling, though light and impeccable in quality. It was presented well on the plate, in a manner that resembled a work of art. We have even been able to order raw organic ravioli, which were not on the menu, on facebook by contacting them, who were very willing to always try new recipes. The pudding (pecan pie with coconut icecream) was the cherry on the icing. The menu changes frequently, another indicator that, despite my misconceptions, raw food can never be boring at all.\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, it was a pleasure to chat with them.

S"Pas pire pentoute, comme on dit en bon qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois. Pourquoi seulement 3 \xc3\xa9toiles? Car leur riz n'est pas excellent. Je suis un maniaque d'excellent riz.

S"Finding healthy eats is challenging these days unless you're willing to pay a premium price.  Restaurant Nilufar bucks that trend by delivering simple and healthy middle eastern cuisine at a great value.\n\nSmall and unassuming, the restaurant is a no frills establishment within walking distance of Concordia. The owners are friendly and prices start at less than $2 for a wrap.  A satisfying lunch with a drink can be had for less than $6 and a massive amount of food can be yours for less than $10 bucks.\n\nThe vegetarian falafel wrap is some of the best food you can get in Montreal for under $2 bucks. Two crispy on the outside moist on the inside falafels wrapped in a flour tortilla filled with shredded lettuce and then topped with tahini sauce and add hummus, babaganoush, or another spread for a bit extra.\n\nIf a wrap isn't going to cut it for you, then go for a hearty plate of rice, nan bread and a variety of middle eastern sides and mains, many of which are displayed in the deli counter and look delightful.  \n\nThe focus here is on great food at a great value, everything else is just a distraction."

I just wanted to sit and grab a coffee and turn my brain off for 15 minutes between meetings so I tucked into the first cafe I could find near me on Yelp. It took the waitress a while to walk over to me at the counter, she was sorta surly and the coffee reminded me of why I've been gradually turning into a careful coffee drinker (read: snob, I guess.) Tasting a bit of burning and a bit of stale, I drank a third of it and bailed. Reviews suggest the food might be yummy here, and the staff I chatted with on the way out were low key and friendly so I might find my way back here again, but then again, I have many other cups to sip, and promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep..."

We had lamb kabob, chicken kabob,  vegetarian sampler, lentil soup and baklava.\n\nThe kabobs are all meat, no veggies like onions, peppers etc.  Served with a choice of rice or french fries.  One person chose fries, which we made fun of until they arrived and we saw that they were homemade, not frozen ones.  The meats are marinated in a tasty sauce that doesn\'t overpower the meat.\n\nthe Baba Ganoush, Hummus and Falafel in my platter were all tasty, with the hummus retaining some texture and not just being a watery smooth paste.\n\nIt was obvious that is is mostly a regulars place, as all the other patrons that night walked into the kitchen (which is visible from the dining room) and greeted the owner/chef by name.  Not being regulars, we were still given the same treatment.\n\nI highly recommend the Shug, and addicitive blend of oil, crushed red peppers and cilantro served with thick fluffy pita to dip it in.\n\nThe baklava was drier than others i had, and should have been served at room temperature instead of straight out of the cold case, but was tasty and flaky none the less.\n\nI stuffed myself the night we ate here, but it  was worth it.'

S'I really wanted this place to be great so I could have a high-end Mexican restaurant in my backyard. Unfortunately this wasn\'t the case.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I immediately noticed that, like Zento sushi before it, Pitaya closed off the 2nd floor of this massive location. I guess they had the same hard time drawing a crowd. In their defense, it\'s a pretty low-traffic location on St Jean. My +1 and I were greeted with a smile and a "We\'re about to close the kitchen. You can dine if you can order right away." That wasn\'t something i was expecting to hear an hour before closing, but that\'s fine as long as it means prompt service.\n\nI excitedly ordered the fajita. While I normally avoid fajitas, having them prepared by a Mexican chef is a whole different story. What I received was a very generic dish of slightly bland grilled veggies and less-than-choice cuts of chicken strips. While the portions and food quality put them a slight notch above Jack Astors, it wasn\'t enough to justify the price.\n\nThe tortilla chips were quite tasty. They seemed freshly mad and came with spicy & mild salsa. The spicy was actually a very nice, authentic kick I was expecting from a Mexican kitchen\n\nThe waitress was telling me about how it\'s their family business and the only other location is in Mexico. They just went through a bad chef and now hired a new one. Cool story, bro, but that doesn\'t put the pico in my gallo. I\'ll give them another try in a little while to see how they\'ve changed before I totally write them off. Again, this is a place I would really like to be well established in the west. I just worry that the challenge is too much for them.'

S"Ginger is definitely one of the better sushi restaurants in Montreal. Many people are completely enamoured with this place  and sing its praises every chance they get. I like it, but it don't think its the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to. To begin, the place is fancy and ultra-modern in design; its not the typical faux-Asian design. It is Asian fusion modern which suits the place well considering it is a Japanese-fusion restaurant. The crowd is decidedly Montreal chic--yuppies, students, older Montrealers with some money to spend--and the prices reflect the audience. They offer fresh and MASSIVE rolls (usually 5 piece in a roll). This place is not cheap. Rolls are typically $12+ and entrees are not less than $20+ each. Miso soup, while large and chalked full of tofu, is $8. Ok ok doesn't sound THAT expensive but I'm used to cheaper rolls in Toronto/Vancouver and am always astounded by what Montreal restos charge for sushi, especially when you're only getting five pieces. I've lived here for five years and am still bothered by the price discrepancy. Having said that, the quality of the rolls are on the mark. They're probably about the size of 8 regular sized rolls, so fear not you hungry foodies! The alcohol is way over priced so be aware of that before ordering a round of drinks. \n\nI had the 'dynamite roll' which was pretty bad actually--clearly not a speciality of Ginger. But my friends (who are regulars) introduced me to some of the other rolls which were far superior in quality and taste. This is clearly a place where you can't order your 'regular order,' you have to go out on a limb and order one of the fancy, totally original, and totally un-authentic rolls. This is what I like to call 'white people sushi' but of high-grade and in a beautiful environs. Nothing wrong with that but be prepared for lots of mayo, cream cheese, cooked fish, etc. etc. \n\nAlso the service needs work. Gurrrl, like a lot of work. I was brought my sushi and than had to wait 10 minutes for the rest of the rolls of my fellow diners to arrive. And then they proceeded to 'lose' my order for teriyaki. And than they had to wait for me to get my entree. I mean this is restaurant etiquette 101: serve all diners at once. And they were really unapologetic about the whole situation. I understand well-crafted food takes time but at least hold the orders until they're all ready and don't make me stare at my food longingly waiting for the others to be served. Be prepared to wait over an hour for your food--at least--on a friday. They usually have 1-2 servers working the room and the kitchen is clearly also understaffed. \n\nAll in all a good alternative to the generally awful sushi restaurants in Montreal but the service is bad, and the food is overpriced. A nice night out nonetheless."

There was only one thing we were able to see and it was on the kids menu.  We ordered and the food wasn\'t bad, but quite expensive.  My salad however was supposed to be mixed seasonal greens with heirloom tomatoes.  It was Romaine lettuce with some flavorless tomatoes which was pretty disappointing.

S'Buddy and I were out Saturday night looking for Verdun eats, trying to find a place neither of us had gone to but at the same time, not too overpriced. Neither of us wanted to pay for a $20 hamburger.\n\nLo and behold, we stumbled upon Les Delices. It turns out their specialty is the food of that tiny island in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius. Because of the island\'s history and closeness to both India and Africa, the cuisine of Mauritius has all these different influences. Curry, coconut milk, rice, saffron, lamb from the Indian and Muslim presence on the island. Octopus, ox-tail, beans, fish cakes, Cajun, Creole from the African influence. Throw in a Chinese, Old Dutch and French, and that\'s Mauritius for you.\n\nWe spotted a complete dinner menu including appetizer, main and coffee/tea for between $16-$12. What really stopped me dead in my tracks was this included curried lamb shank for $14. Seriously, where on earth can you get lamb, done very well for under $30 in this day and age?\n\nThis is one thing which upsets me about ethnic dining in general especially when trying out the foods from smaller, poorer countries which are usually off the foodie radar screen. Very often, they are run by recently arrived immigrants who are trying to start out a new life. They usually don\'t have a lot of money to put into decor and making it look chi-chi. It\'s usually the bare-bones school of decor. Instead they put their heart and soul into the food. People look in, judge, get turned off and the place is then not open for very long. Judging a book by it\'s cover here, will make you miss out on the treasures to be found within, that\'s for sure.\n\nWe were warmly welcomed and seated. Stickers citing this place from all sorts of guides and guidebooks were plastered all over the front door. Within a minute of being seated, we were given an "amuse-bouche", a pre-appetizer of deep friend cabbage fritters. I never had anything that was so simple and yet, very tasty. Dowse it with the choices of hot pepper, garlic or mint sauce sitting on your table and you\'re set.\n\nNext came the fried calamari and fish balls. Both were great, the calamari was made with a batter that clearly had some fresh herbs in it.\n\nThen came the lamb shank.\n\nOMFG! It was falling off the bone, it was that super tender and flavorful. You have your choices of sauces which you\'d like your meat to be prepared in, like Curry, Cajun, Creole, Saffron and others which i can\'t remember right now. I chose the curry sauce and it was amazing. It came with a heaving serving of rice and salad. By the end, neither of us could barely move, it was that rich and that filling. The owners and servers were extremely friendly and attentive.\nThey even gave us a free desert, a selection of cheesecakes. Bonus, this place is BYOB.\n\nI am definitely going to go back to at least try out the octopus and ox-tail stew. This place is a gem in the rough, but a gem nonetheless.'

The inside and limited outdoor eating areas are kept clean.\n\nThe food, well....  Ok, so far I've only gotten cold sandwiches and while they've been ok, they aren't anything special.  I always get the wheat bread and it is wonder bread soft every time.  If only I liked that sort of thing.  I prefer a bit more substance, but for some folks I can imagine this would be awesome.  I will say that one of these days I'm going to have to try one of their pastas.  Maybe on a cold day.  But as a devoted al dente girl, I'm hesitant to try pasta from a sub place.  \n\nAt $8 for a whole and $4.50 for a half, I'll most likely be grabbing lunch here more in the future as I work in the area, but if I didn't I wouldn't be going back any time soon."

S"There are very few Brazilians in Edinburgh. And we also have a habit of thinking we're the only ones in the city. Because, I mean, why would anyone in their right mind want to move to somewhere as cold and grim as Scotland when we Brazilians could remain in the warmth and sunshine of South America. \n\nI feel I should be reviewing this place simply because I'm Brazilian. And as such, I should know if this Brazilian cuisine is any good. But here's the deal: 1) the lady who runs this place is from a different region than I am and 2) that doesn't matter at all. The food is still pretty delicious. Even though it's not the kind of Brazilian food I'm used to. \n\nLunch here is pretty affordable. Before I became a veggie I used to always get the chicken and prawn sandwich. Now I get the black bean sandwich or the cheese and jam sandwich. Which are also tasty. Back in the day, I took my now ex-boyfriend there for his birthday and we had bacalhau that was to die for. \n\nThe woman who runs the restaurant with her husband also dances for the Samba School and there are portraits of her with the rich and famous peppered around the cafe. \n\nOh, oh oh! Have their chocolate banana cake. It's mouth-watering."

We always get take out and this last time we were waiting and the chef sent over a plate of fruit for us! That was really nice! My only big complaint is that we will order a roll that doesn't mention anything being deep fried in the roll description(I am not into deep fried sushi) and one or two rolls always ends up having something fried in it.

That said most everyone enjoyed their meals, I'm just kinda picky. And critical. \n\nWith dinner we were able to stick around and not pay cover if there was one or wait around. Frankly I don't think u have to wait if u go thru the hotel portion of the venue as they'll assume ur a guest. \n\nThe food: I'm not sure what a supper club is, maybe it means u have few menu options? Only 3 apps, 3 mains, and 2 desserts to choose from. It looked like a wedding menu. Servers r extremely nice. But not that on point since they'd forget little things like utensils for dessert etc. Also couple of the servers were kind of stinky.  Please shower. \n\nFood was not bad. Ordered the beef tenderloin rare and it came out perfectly medium rare.  I'm a genius. It was very good. The rabbit billet app was described by the waiter as a pate and supposedly amazing. It kinda sucked. Well it tasted exactly like cooked tuna fish from those cans (chicken of the sea), so if u like well cooked chopped up tunafish u ll prolly like it. Not my thing - that said I finished the whole thing as I was hungry. The carrot soup others had was not bad.  Dessert was pretty good. Drinks have strange variable pricing - Crown Royale is $7, Chivas is $11, so drinks can be cheaper if u know what to order. \n\nLot of bachelor parties here.

S"The restaurant is fairly new and located in the ground floor of a old Bond Warehouse just off Constitution Street.  They have made use of the double height ceilings and put in a mezzanine level, creating a small area ideal for large groups of people and providing more table space.  We received a warm welcome and were seated at our table near the large arched windows.  The interior is clean, simple and especially liked the candles in red coloured glasses dotted up the stairs.  Giving to space an almost zen-like feeling.\n\nAll the staff were authentic Spaniards which felt reassuring.  I love tapas and so this restaurant did not let me down.  The menu is broken down into 3 sections, 'From the orchard', 'from the sea' and 'from the farm'.  We ordered 6 tapas between the two of us, wondering if it would be enough? Thankfully it was plenty, the dishes were small but tasty.  Do try the pork and mushroom cream sauce and Monkfish, prawn and squid in tomato sauce.  First time I've eaten squid that isn't rubbery, it just dissolved in the mouth, lovely!"

Fatoush heavily overly dressed with vinaigrette, to the point where it really wasn't edible.  Kebbeh was heavily spiced (almost too much)....

Well, there are a few select items I enjoy, but I usually end up feeling greasy, heavy, and bloated after I consume them. And that goes double for the likes of most fast food joints that specialize in tacos and burritos. But there\'s some magic happening when lunch time rolls around and someone suggests Taco Time. I am always, always, always in. Heck, I\'ll even be the first to offer to go pick it up.\n\nFirst of all, Taco Time never smells like burnt beef or grease. Every one I\'ve visited has a clean, pleasant scent. And I\'ve never had to clean my own table before I could sit down. But the menu ... ahhh. Allow me to suggest the chicken crisp burrito, a slightly crunchy flour tortilla gently cradling chunks of all white meat chicken, cream cheese, and green chilies. Or the veggie burrito, accented with real aged cheddar cheese and a sprinkle of sunflower seeds. The seeds, at first, sounded like a terrible idea, but they offer quite a unique flavor and texture to the burrito.\n\nMexi Fries ... are just seasoned Tater Tots. But boy, are they yummy. They even offer stuffed Tater-- I mean, Mexi Fries. And, this location in particular even offers a huge smoothie menu, with such add-ins as protein powder and vitamins.\n\nOh boy. I just ate breakfast, so I probably _should_ wait at least an hour or so to declare "lunch time."'

Build your own or culinary masterpieces (if salad is allowed to be considered in the masterpiece category of course) ranged from meat forward to cheese forward and fruit in between. I picked a Man Salad. Plenty of meat including bacon, heaps of vegetables including avocado and a caesar/ranch dressing. I know, it doesn't sound like anything unbelievable when I utter the ingredients, but there's something about how this salad is made -- perhaps with love? It won my heart as I crunched all to greedily on perfectly proportioned -- hefty bowl -- of lettuce and veggies. If you come hungry, you'll leave satiated and feeling healthy!

S'Cafe Oso is one of those cool places you take friends or biz associates when you want them to know You Know the insider\'s scoop on what\'s cool and local and "best kept secret." This is the learning cafe for Phoenix College\'s culinary students so service at the beginning of the semester is not as spot on as near the end. But, you can see they are trying and it is kind of sweet to be able to give them some advice "like don\'t say \'free\' dessert with an entree, say \'complimentary,\' instead." Plus, Ives is the front of the house guy who has been training them forever so Chris\' review below about service made no sense. \n\nI dropped by a few times about a year ago when it was still the old Culinary Cafe. Hello -- the 70s wanted their bland menu and boring white tablecloths back. A complete renovation to the cafe and its menu has created a place where some really creative fare is delivered at good prices. The crispy skin salmon entree (with roasted garlic spinach and cilantro holy land couscous, often called Israeli) at $10 was a bargain -- you pay twice that in any restaurant plus they serve a complimentary asparagus   A large piece of fish was done perfectly. Dessert came with the entree. I saw they had a chocolate churro so I thought it would be light ending touch. Churros are usually dry, cinammon/sugar sticks. Instead, I got three huge chocolate spears oozing with a rich chocolate filling. Just in case it wasn\'t sinful enough, it comes with a chocolate milk shake of homemade ice cream. Honestly, I\'d come here just for this dessert. If if you didn\'t order a main entree, the $5 - $7 for the homemade desserts is worth the diet damage.\n\nI saw three really big tacos with pile of slaw heading to one table. The menu says $6. Meal salads are priced about the same and there are wraps and soups. There is no debate in the reviews that the food is very good and creative here. \n\nHidden gems often have caveats and what you need to know is that Cafe Oso is only open from I think 11 am - 1 p.m., Tuesdays - Thursdays and only when the college is in session. So, call ahead, because sometimes they are completely booked by those in the know.'

All were new songs to my palate and I'll admit that this music was high on the charts.\n\nI'll confess that the first time I had the shrimp brochette I was taken aback as I had to rip the head off and fight with the carapace before being able to sink my teeth into it's delicate flesh. It wasn't until later that I learned that you're actually SUPPOSED to eat the head as well - a thought that made this lo-fan a bit uncomfortable.

(And we like our wings very saucy.)\n\nThe hot wings were great at first bite. The sauce is really, really good. It is actually hot - the perfect amount of spiciness and kick. But the sauce made the texture all off. The wings were almost soggy.\n\nMajor props for the damn hot sauce. Definitely very, very hot. And with a delicious flavor.\n\nThe wings themselves were quite good. Good size and meatiness, and good quality.\n\nThe ranch and blue cheese were above average, but not great. And neither went very well with the sweet chili garlic and parmesan. (And wings, for us, just must be dipped.)\n\nThe fries were excellent. Shoestring-style that were cooked just right. The chili was ok - decent, but I probably wouldn't get chili on the fries again.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable and they actually have all-you-can-eat wings, which, of course, is a great deal.\n\nAll in all, great wings, but not great hot wings. I will definitely be back again when I have a craving for non-hot wings. The texture of the parmesan wings was fantastic. Very different from other wings I have had and very enjoyable. \n\nBut, alas, I tend to always crave hot wings. And while the hot sauce was good, it destroyed the great texture and the dipping sauces weren't up to par. So the search for excellent hot wings near our house continues. \n\nBut again, really great regular wings - so we will be back for those."

They have something called Heroin Chips. Enough said. It took my drunken stupor to a flat out High. \n\nThe decor is Rock Luxe. Velvet couches, stripper poles, leather tables, an antler chandelier- and a sexy private VIP section hidden in the back just in case you wanted some down time with the band later on ;)\n\nTop notch service, with an air of that speakeasy style we all relish so much.

I have to say that the place gives you the feel of a small town mom and pop restaurant and the staff is very friendly.\n\nThe first time I ate here my friend found a hair on her pickle...hahaha...that just sounds funny for some reason.  Anyway she notified the waitress and she promptly took it away but never returned with another pickle :-)....hilarious!  Our food was ok on that visit but neither of us were really impressed.\n\nThe other day I came in and ordered the club samich and fries.  The club was ok but the bread was dried out and just crumbling all to pieces.  The fries were pretty good but then again those are a little tuff to screw up.  I think one problem that this place has is that the menu is just too big with way too many items on it.  Unfortunately I dont think I'll be returning for strike three at Johnny's!"

S"Odd to find this place unlisted on here but then as it had been closed for a good while (despite it apparently being somewhere you can't go wrong with by Bite magazine) a previous listing may have been culled. Either way it has reopened under new management and with a bit of a facelift so it starts with a clean slate. The redecoration has been well done & manages to maximise the views across The Forth to Fife. The same positive note, however, cannot be struck for the service in the bar. In mitigation I think I wandered in on possibly the first night of opening but none of the staff seemed to know whether they were serving at the bar, waiting on tables, stocking the bar, taking dinner bill payments from customers or what. Consequently the bar area became a bottle-neck, diners were heard to be complaining about a number of issues and getting a single pint took about ten minutes. The menu though looks inviting so I'll happily revisit in the Summer and see if things have calmed down. Having now revisited for the purpose of having dinner I can safely say that things in terms of service have improved & our waitress last night was very efficient. My companion & I both ordered steak from the (probably necessarily) limited evening menu and we both felt that the serving was slightly overpriced for the size but had no complaints about the cooking itself. The brioche bread & butter pudding was of ample size & moreish, if not exactly a summer dessert. Some work still to be done then but for the time being things seem to be adequate."

They don't normally have a dinner menu, so the only choices you have are between the afternoon tea (served until closing time) or the Taste Montreal menu.\n\nI really enjoyed the meal:\n\nTheir Signature Soup: a cream of butternut squash with curry and coco milk, tofu, soya bean with coriander.\n\nMain dish: Ricotta ravioli with swiss chard and spinach, fine cream with white wine and brunoise of sauteed chorizo and red beets.\n\nDessert: A variety of verrines.\n\nMost of the reason my rating for them is so low is because of the extremely slow service. It wasn't bad service, but it was agonizingly drawn out. I can only assume this is because tea service is served all at one time and dinner service is ongoing, something they might not be accustomed to. \n\nI'll be going back for the afternoon tea...

I would have given them five stars, but the service isn't great. It is basically what do you want, they take your order, and walk away to make it. There wasn't a thank you through the entire experience. However, the pizza is great. I got a 16 inch with half just cheese, and the other half pepperoni and tomatoes. Wonderful. It is a little on the greasey side, so you are going to need a few napkins. They also had calzone's, salads, and pasta dishes on their menu, but I only ordered pizza.

A few of us ordered the catch of the day, which was the red snapper. However, it was so flavourless and tough that it tasted like the catch of yesterday. The parsnips that came with it were tasty though. Two people ordered the hanger steak, which presented beautifully and looked delicious, but they both said their meat was cold. \nSome of the waitstaff were nice, one seemed very inexperienced and a couple of others seemed snooty and apathetic. One served my salad in front of me, then without asking if  I'd ordered it, took it away and gave it to someone else. I even stopped him to ask him why he was doing that, yet he ignored me and continued on serving it to the other individual. They only offered us coffee and tea after we were almost through dessert. \n\nI'll be recommending to my colleagues and friends that they go elsewhere.

I think she saw the look of nasty on my face and tried to stir everything up but it was too late. \n\nThe sweet girl working was like once you taste this you\'ll want to come back once a week. Hmmm maybe if things were fresh! \n\nThen when I got my drink there were lids in the lid dispenser that were filthy! They were brown- I was like "did someone step on these and put them back?" \n\n5star service\n4 star taste\nNegative stars for freshness\nNegative stars for cleanliness\n\nI probably won\'t be back unless they make some serious changes.\n\nToo bad bc it was cheap and pretty flavorful'

S'The place looks attractive from the outside and the inside. It was not full but a bit noisy on a Friday night, so we sat down on the (quieter) heated patio. The meal started well, with good bread and fresh salads. It went down from there. Overall, serving smaller portions of higher quality food would be the way to go.\nWe had spanakopita as a starter. Three pretty large pieces -- glad we ordered just one plate for two. It looked like a "pocket pizza". Too much "cream cheese"; I don\'t think it was feta. I missed the light layers of phyllo crust we should have gotten. \nThen we had the regular (beef) gyro and the chicken gyro, served with potatoes and rice. Potatoes were more like fries. I did not feel like having something that fat, I ate just a few pieces and was disappointed. The rice was not impressive--and the chicken gyro was not either. My husband liked the meal better than I did--I think he had read reviews of the place beforehand and his expectations were not too high. The service was good, the pace of the meal was good too. But I don\'t think I\'ll go back.'

I'm not a clean freak by any means, and there's no way I'd let my kid play in that playground.  It looked filthy, can you imagine how much shit there is that you can't see?  And I mean that literally too.  Garbage cans overflowing, drink station with trash all over the place, dirty tables, etc.  And to top it off, I could tell that my sandwich had been sitting around for hours because it was almost like eating sandpaper.  I ended up throwing it away, and throwing food away is not something I do very often, that's for sure.  French fries were good and fresh though, at least there's that."

S"I will start by saying each time I visit the Bridge Inn I am never disappointed, however it also seems to change it's format rather frequently.  This has two effects, each review may have been written when the menu or venue was different but I prefer to focus on the fact that despite the many drastic changes I keep coming back and I enjoy myself each time!\n\nA new feature (at least I think it is new) is a separate bar and restaurant menu, the bar menu ends at 7pm.  As you can imagine the bar menu is very much bar food, (burgers, fish and chips etc) while the restaurant menu is a lot more involved (steaks, fish, roasted pork dishes).  My very kind waiter allowed me to order a starter from the main menu and a main course from the bar menu even though it was after 7pm.\n\nI am a sucker for scallop dishes and this blew me away!  My started was a fresh black pudding with pan fried scallops and a carrot pur\xc3\xa9e.  It was absolutely brilliant, the flavours complimented each other very well.  I would have happily had a second and third portion.\n\nMy main course was a simple bar burger however this was no cheap burger patty.  A very nice steak patty full of flavour with some salad and nice strong cheese.  \n\nAfter dinner the dreaded bill arrived but even then I was surprised.  Not the cheapest bar food but worth every penny!\n\nDrop by if you are out in the west, you won't be disappointed!"

S"Upon the other Yelp user's reviews, I went to Smell, No Taste! today for lunch and as stated the food was delicious, the woman behind the counter(who was really sweet) suggested the Potato Greens and Rice, and told me if I was unsure about the spice she could put the African hot sauce on the side. The Potato Greens came with a MOUND of rice...so be sure to go when you are hungry. I was thankful the hot sauce was on the side because it is a slooooow burn, a great addition to the greens but yes it's hot, kinda like Wasabi, not the same taste but if you are familiar, the heat is definitely a delayed reaction. All in all I enjoyed my food and I'll be going back to try out some more food. It was quiet when I went in there, a random patron struck up an nice little convo with me, and that was nice. The establishment itself was just a standard, store front restaurant, very clean nothing snazzy, it's on 36th Street off the Plaza so you know you aren't in walking into the most beautiful surrounding but the food...the food was GREAT."

I would highly recommend the staff ALWAYS bring napkins when they deliver the food (who wouldn't do that).  I had to learn the hard way that you have to tell them everything you want on your burger.  However, we were so hungry, we ate them without condiments (just the burger and cheese).  The iced tea was a bit watered down.  However, their milkshakes and iced drinks looked good on the menu...it was too late to try all of that.  The kids had a few bites and were out for the night.  I ate the tater tots delivered with the kids meal and gave my fries to the little one.  She was able to eat a few before she fell out.  In any case, this is a good spot for late dining when everyone wants something different.  They had a small, but pretty good selection on the $1 menu as well."

Ken was nowhere in sight and her squeaky, chirpy voice asked us if there was anything we wanted.\n\nWell, silverware is awesome.\n\nWe got our drinks (albeit the water refills were a little slow on the upswing), and waited some time for the food.  The food arrived, but, uh, no silverware.  How does one eat hash browns if not with a fork?  "Oh!" the waitress shrieked.\n\nThe couple behind us babbled loudly in Spanish and ate their food with their silverware while our biscuits, eggs, and hash browns grew cold.  Cars passed by.  A cop car pulled into the parking lot and a ghetto bird flew overhead.  Finally we got some silverware and attempted to dig in.  My friend Patty made a face as she bit into her fries.  Soggy, soggy, soggy.  She slathered Tabasco sauce on them in an attempt to revive them from their soggy slumber.  My biscuits and gravy were pretty typical; I wouldn\'t have expected more from a Denny\'s.  The hash browns could have been more crisp, but they were okay, I guess.\n\nThe waitress slammed things on the counter as we left after I paid her 10% for her nonattentive, non-cup filling, non-silverware dispensing service.   Classy.\n\nP.S. Patty would like to note that her boyfriend got food poisoning and spent the night puking.  Just sayin\'.'

S"When the mood for pizza strikes, I sometimes let my mood and my preferences for the perfect pie get in the way of my cravings. \n\nI'm not fond of frozen grocery store pizza. I never got the by-the-slice pizza craze. And while I have eaten a few amazing thin crust pizzas, something feels wrong about eating them on a patio with a beer, serving them to friends who helped you on a move, or snacking on a thin slice of pie while staring down a blank page when you are way behind deadline.\n\nLa Frita Pizzeria get its right, and meets my different moods every time. It is the Songza of pizza: pizza for entertaining cool friends, pizza for studying, pizza for unwinding, and even pizza for waking up gently. \n\nThe crust is thick and bouncy, like memory foam, but with a hint of tasty charring. The tomato sauce they use is thick and spirited, with a hint of coquettish sweetness.\n\nThe cheese is melted over the top of your pie, perfectly fusing the ingredients therein and holding everything securely in place, ensuring each bite captures every flavor and your toppings don't topple and slide off each slice. Each slice also oozes with just enough grease, making each bite deliciously unctuous, and not unpleasantly oily or slimy. \n\nTheir pizza is equally good in the morning, cold and slightly congealed, which is another benchmark I have for the perfect pizza. While I do prefer my pizza hot, I have been known to turn leftover slices into an impromptu early morning breakfast, and their pizza does the trick."

S"Stayed at Holiday Inn in Madison West as we visited friends for the weekend. Upon arrival to the hotel, wanted to grab a bite to eat so decided to try out George's Chop house. I ordered a Porter house and my wife ordered the shrimp and scallop with red sauce. The steak was just ok. I thought it was under seasoned. Nothing to be wowed about. The shrimp and scallop was actually pretty good. Over all experience was ok. But would probably not go back there again."

S"Now I love KFC in general, their original recipe & their crispy strips. Every time I go to this particular location close to my house, it's filthy, all the tables are dirty, the employees don't seem to care about anything. My biggest complaint is, now this is the second time this has happened to me at this location, I order a 12 piece crispy strip meal. I get home and there are 8 crispy strips and 4 boneless chicken with some breading that's spicy & my kids won't touch. Did they run out of crispy strips & just threw those in there knowing I wouldn't find out until I got home? If I wanted boneless chicken then  would have ordered it. From now on I will be going to the KFC on Silverado Ranch & Maryland Pkwy. The place is immaculate & the employees are efficient."

S'This is the place to go for omelets when in Las Vegas (unless you\'re getting comped at one of the hotels!). An abundance of food, and the "spuds" are the best chip style potatoes I have ever tasted! The omelets are made from a half dozen eggs. Both the pumpkin bread and the banana bread are excellent as a choice (although I think I prefer the banana bread). And the best part of all, they are not at all overpriced for the amount of food that one gets on their plate! If you can\'t choose among the 38 different omelets they offer on the menu, you can bring the whole family and order the "Flatlanders Special" (#33-A). Their menu does have a second side with lunch offerings (not open for dinner), some of which I\'ll try for in the future. BTW: 2 for 1 coupon in the Entertainment book - Even Better!'

I believe this course has to be the only golf course in Arizona where you can hear elephants on the third hole.\n\nThere is a lot of elevation change on this course.  Many holes require you to hit the green to avoid rolling down a 50 foot hill into a gully.\n\nIf you don't want a real serious round, just want to practice your short game (you will encounter some interesting chip shots), and just want to stay close by, Rolling Hills might be a good option for you."

S'I really really hate to accuse a restaurant of serving microwaved food, but that was what I was thinking all the time while eating my three course combo there. The kababs and samosas that were the entrees tasted decent, but the samosa skin was too thick  and had absolutely no crunch to it. It reminded me of those poorly made General Tao chicken that had too much dough and hardly no chicken meat inside. However, my easy-to-please dining companion gushed after the last bite of his kabab, "Satisfied." I thought to myself, okay maybe this wouldn\'t be so bad.\n\nThen came the main courses: butter chicken, lamb curry and spinach curry. One quick look at the butter chicken and I knew I wouldn\'t be coming back here too soon. Too orange. But for something with such a strong colour, the taste was so weak. It was very faintly the taste of butter chicken that I have come to know and love. I was more sad than disappointed. The other curries were also passable.  We asked the lamb curry to be made extra spicy, but we got nothing of the sort. \n\nThe palao rice was also bland, again to my dismay, as I adore palao rice. The only credit is that they didn\'t overcook or undercook the rice, so at least the texture was very nice. The naans weren\'t that great either, and I felt that they had been out of a frozen packet.\n\nThe dessert, which was a little donut like ball with sweet syrup, was very nice. It was probably the most flavourful out of everything I ate there.\n\nService was very attentive and warm, so they got all high points there, but given so many good Indian restaurants in town, I would not be going back.'

S"The Saint is pretty new on the Stockbridge scene, but its location in a basement on the eclectic St Stephen Street, and its quality food and cosy ambience, have already made it a popular destination for night time bantering. There are two sides to The Saint, with one section filled with tables for diners, and the other section used as a bar area, with a fireplace and a bit of a luxurious, regal, fur look going on. Monteiths up on the Royal Mile has the same owners, but as much as I like the vibe there, I prefer The Saint for a more chilled out, less-on-show experience. \n\nThe last time I was in for food, my friend and I sat in a little, candlelit seat by the window, which we decided was absolutely one for the lovers, because of its location and looking into each other's eyes feel about it. The menu has a mix of modern, but classic fare, and I've sampled very decent risotto, pasta and lamb dishes every time I've been in. Booking a table if you're planning on heading along at the weekend might be worthwhile, as The Saint is quite miniature, and so quickly fills up with locals."

S"i'm no 'cue expert, but I like food, so I'll toss in my two cents. I had the rib tips (a special) last night. They were dry and a little overcooked, yet still miraculously tender. They were sauced to perfection - not glopping off with every bite, but yet a good counterpoint to the dryness of the meat itself. I ate every last bite with enthusiasm. The sauce was sweet and tangy and dark and everything I want from barbecue sauce - again, perfect with the meat. \n\nThe special came with a side of rosemary tater tots, which were fantastic. I accidentally dropped one into the paper container holding the remainder of the ribs, and let's just say it was a happy accident - the sauce and the tots got along just fine. Dipping a rosemary-flavored tater tot into delicious BBQ sauce - it's just like I invented Silly Putty up in here! \n\nAnyway I was filled and very pleased with my meal for $6.50 - I can't wait to try the pulled pork, but from what I could see the different specials looked pretty amazing... So who knows what I'll order (and from that, concoct!) upon my next visit.\n\n@ritewaycatering on the twitters, by the way"

S"I read the review about this place from fellow Yelper Joel M. and thought I would give this place a try.  We ordered pad Thai ($5.99), Thai fried rice ($5.99) and the red curry chicken ($5.99) to go. The fried rice and the red curry chicken were quite tasty but the pad Thai lacked flavour and it was all clumped together.  Not sure why this was, could it be that there wasn't enough oil in it (I asked for less oil) or was it missing some sort of sauce?  I don't usually order pad Thai so I am not sure what was missing in it.  The lady was nice enough to give us some free spring rolls to go and Thai tea to drink while we were waiting for our orders.  \n\nAlthough the portions were a bit on the small side, nothing really to complain about because their prices are pretty darn cheap.  I think this place probably gets most of their business from its surrounding industrial community during lunch time.  I was told their grand opening is on Oct. 5 and they will be BBQ-ing outside of their restaurant from 6 pm to 10 pm.  You can drop by and sample their food at that time.  Go ahead and check this place out if you are in the neightbourhood.  \n\n3.5 stars from me."

We however didn\'t get any more bread but I\'m not exactly sure if "free refills" is something that they do.  The bar looked awesome but sadly we don\'t have very much money to get wasted.  Note to self: must order the White Chocolate Martini and White Chocolate Brownie when funds are abundant.\n\nBF ordered the Kobe Beef Burger.  It came with the standard lettuce & tomatoes as well as fried onion strips.  It tasted pretty good.  BF ordered it medium but he usually orders beef medium rare.  I don\'t understand the switch considering it\'s Kobe.  Anyway, it was good nonetheless.\n\nI ordered the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich.  Let me tell you... I have had several french dips in my life... a lot.  It\'s my favorite freakin\' sandwich.  This was probably THE BEST french dip sandwich I\'ve had to date.  The beef was oh so tender and the bread didn\'t rip the roof of my mouth.  There was something different about the au jus but I can\'t put my finger on the flavor and I can\'t even really explain it.  I just know that I liked it.  \n\nI would love to come back some day.

We got there around 8 & the place was pretty empty, only 3 other parties were there but that could have been because they close at 9. Our server was Demmo himself, nice guy! I have to say the decor is very dated, it looked like someones grandma brought everything in from the gaudy window treatments to the floral tablecloths! \n\nWe decided to order a couple cocktails since they had a pretty interesting list. Hubby got the pomegranate marg & I got the bubble blue lemonade. Both drinks were so good! For an app we ordered the lahame calzonedilla which was what looked like a quesadilla with lamb & mozzarella & it also came with an amazing dipping sauce called taz-ho. After our app came out we got a basket of bread, it was kinda cold but pretty good. My hubby loved it & finished off the whole thing. For our entrees hubs ordered chicken parmesan & I ordered the pick your own pasta with penne, alfredo, bacon & spinach, both meals came with a side salad & bread. We both enjoyed the pasta dishes, not the greatest we've had but definitely good. The salads were ok & the bread was yummy as well. I had to order dessert so I got the chocolate/butterscotch pie & 3 mini canolis to go. I had the pie & it was pretty good, didn't care for the crust though, hubs had the canolis & loved em! He only wished they were bigger because they were only about 2 bites each. \n\nOur total, minus the $25 g.c., came to about $35, not bad but a tad more than I expected it to be. Overall we liked the food & cocktails, but it is pretty far from us so we won't go out of our way to return, but would definitely come in if we are in the area."

They manage to make them crispy enough not to get soggy but without being burned and you get a really big portion. They always seem to rotate in new burrito styles and some of them are new favorites. I have never had a problem with small portions, bad food or anything else ever at this location. The one thing I wish they would change is the drive through speaker. It sounds like they're yelling at you from 1952 through a tin can."

S'I only had to deduct a star for the prices and convenience, which I will explain. Now, not all of the store is overpriced, and the Wild Oats brand items are just as tasty and wholesome as the other, top-name products they sell. Wild Oats only carries items that are either organic or all-natural. Organic foods are certified that there are no fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics, food additives, etc. This even extends so far as to what things end up in the soil the food grows in, or what feeds on the grass that grows from that soil, due to runoff. Certification is quite costly, though. Many farmers, though their foods are certifiable, simply cannot afford the documentation. Wow. Back on track here, sorry. Part of the reason organic foods are more expensive is because the farmers need to cover the costs from the foods they lost because their foods aren\'t pumped full of hormones and pesticies. And the convenience thing I promised to explain: due to the fact Wild Oats is strict on the wholesomeness of the items they carry, this is not one-stop shopping. For instance, you won\'t find Crisco here.\n\nBut enough about all of that. I love this place. First of all, whenever you walk through the doors, you\'re greeted with the aromas of fresh fruits, handcrafted soaps, incense, and the floral department. Which makes me a happy shopper. They carry a wide variety of artisan breads, vegan cookies (they\'re actually good!), coffees, fruit & veggies, and meats, fish, and poultry. This is the best place to find fresh, not frozen, ground bison. They have a bulk food section, and the unsulfured, dried papaya strips they carry are awesome.\n\nThe cafe is a fun, unique way to enjoy a wide variety of items, from pizza to curried chicken salad to stuffed grape leaves. The coffees they serve are excellent (Frank Sumatra!), and their smoothies are the best. The "Velvet Papaya" is my favorite.\n\nThey carry a lot of cool soaps, too. And the people who work the natural living section are always friendly and knowledgeable.'

S"I received one of their coupon deals via mail. It was for 25% or 50% off the entire meal. I can't remember which. Anyhow, you get into the restaurant and find out that the deal is not for the whole menu, but rather certain sections of the menu. Of course they tell you this after you sit down and are ready to order the most delicious looking meal on the menu, only to find out you can't get a ridiculous discount on it. Should've read the fine print I suppose. \n\nThe service was ok at first. You never really know until after you've sat down at a restaurant such as this whether you have a competent waiter or not. It turned out our waitress was not a great one. We ordered our food, and it took quite a while for them to cook it. We got in there right about noon on Sunday, right ahead of the Church crowd. Yet it took them about 30 minutes to get the food out to us.  The food was very salty, and the waitress neglected to refill our water.  My family just didn't enjoy the experience. It's funny because I told my brother I was going to take my  parents out to eat at Ruby Tuesdays and he warned me against it saying the food's not that good. But I told him that the deal was good so might as well. If the food was bad and the waitress was good, I could consider going back and chancing it again. But since neither  was good, there's really no point in me going back there again. I would advise against this particular restaurant."

S'I remember when Charley\'s Grilled Subs first opened on State, back during my earlier college years.  I remember that when it first opened I was extremely  happy, because for whatever reason I was in a major Philly cheesesteak phase.  It was something I\'d always order at restaurants and even make special trips to the West Towne Mall food court to hit up the Steak Escape.  I\'ve never even been to Philadelphia and I probably wouldn\'t know a good cheesesteak from a bad one.  It didn\'t really matter - that is what I yearned for, and my wishes were answered when Charley\'s opened.\n\nBack then I went all the time, usually getting the regular Philly with fries but basically trying everything on the menu.  I probably came here at least once a week in between classes or after a session at Memorial Library.  I\'d have to say it was my favorite restaurant in Madison at the time.\n\nFast forward five years and I\'m living in Middleton.  I haven\'t been to Charley\'s since college, but my friends and I need to grab a quick bite before the UW Hockey game.  I\'ve been basically out of town for the better part of a month and I get the sudden urge to see if Charley\'s is as good as I remember.  Short answer: yes!  The Italian Deli sandwich was delicious.  I skipped the fries as I never was a huge fan and went with a large sandwich.  Long answer: not quite so much...  It turns out I\'m not used to eating this type of food anymore, and the heartburn became intense around the second period.  I shared this discomfort with my friend, and we both spent the remainder of the night saying "Oh, there goes the Charley\'s again."'

I don't go super hot but they have a good range of heat and some honey hots and other good stuff - I say mix it up a bit and try em all out.\n\nThe scene is the same though I will say this location has some talent as of late.

Don't get me wrong, there are others in there but just typical those dudes are in there. \n\nThe girls are super nice... obviously.

At first I was skeptical seeing that it was a food truck, but don't let that fool you.  Highlights are the fish sandwich, which is available on Fridays, and the bacon double cheeseburger.  The daily double is great if you're going for breakfast, although it can be a bit on the heavy side.\n\nIf you like fish sandwiches, you will love the one at Derald's.  If you like your food on the spicy side, ask for the cajun fish sandwich.  It's the standard with a dash of cajun spices and hot sauce.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.\n\nPrices are very reasonable and comparable to what you would spend anywhere else on campus.  There are daily lunch and breakfast specials which are a great deal as well.  On top of everything, the owner, Eric, is a very nice guy and great to talk to.\n\nSide note: Derald's has a diner on First and Green, and while I haven't been there yet myself, I've been told they have fish sandwiches everyday."

S'"Greasy" as it applies to pizza is directly tied to quality of cheese and meats used in its preparation; high quality mozzarella will exude it\'s delicious juices after baking. \nWe\'ve dined several times at this casual establishment.

Plus, it provides the "tweens" a chance to practice the table manners they\'ll need on a date and a company dinner.\n\nGennaro\'s is an excellent place for a family meal. Comfortable seating, excellent service, reasonable prices. The pizza? It is superb, some of the best in the valley. Meatball pizza? You\'ve not lived until you\'ve tried this one. And, it will be prepared exactly as you ask for it. Well done? No problem. Cold beer on tap and a few wines.\nAlso, where else do you get fantastic eggplant parmesan in the east valley? Gennaro\'s version is thin sliced and delicious.\n\nYes, local businesses should be supported and these folks are one of the few left standing at this intersection after the Fulton Ranch home community shit the bed. Not because they\'ve been the only restaurant on the corner, but because their food is darn good, besting the likes of Marco\'s pizza, Cheezburger-Cheezburger, Garcia\'s, Carino\'s Italian food, etc.\n\nGive Gennaro\'s a try for pizza or pasta, you will not be disappointed.'

Always get it on the cheese bread. \n\nQuiznos quality varies a lot from store to store. I'll return to this one. The shop at the Denver airport is great too.\n\nMy health kick continues. At least I didn't take a pint-of-Hagen-Dazs sleeping pill like last week."

There is such a small choice of sandwich fillings/other options that it wouldnt suprise me if you didnt see anything you fancied at all.

S'YEAAAAHHHH! Super pizza specials and fresh ingredients? YES PLEASE. I tell all the guests where I work to give Toppers a try because they deliver quickly, have friendly service, and great food! \n\nMy personal favorite is cheese and mushroom pizza as you can\'t ever go wrong with that. A large is around $10. If you\'re looking for a specialty pizza, be sure to try the philly cheesesteak pizza. It might sound gross, but I assure you, it\'s delish! The ranch based sauce adds a nice flair to it.\n\nI\'ve heard that the subs here, called "grinders" are really tasty.\nSo, if you\'re ever in the University area and need a pizza delivery place, Toppers will never let you down.\n\nThe only negative aspect is that there is no seating or pizza by the slice, otherwise this place would get five stars.'

There's so many people and some of the bartenders there do not know what the hell they're doing. So if you go get a drink.....be prepared to wait in line for a while. Unless they've gotten their shit together. Personally I don't think the setup is that smart. The bar is off to the side - so while you're waiting in line there's obstructions of trees and stuff in your way so you can hear a concert and not see it.

They even made a special small pizza for the wee one! \n\nThe people working here really fussed over our daughter which was a breath of fresh air. Most places don't really interact with children in this way. It really sets a positive good dinner atmosphere for a family. The owner even surprised wee one with a free ice cream dessert!

S'We loved this place!  \nWe\'d been wanting to visit for a while, and finally had the time.  It\'s set up as a "make as you go" and you can choose if you want a pita, rice bowl or salad.  Then you get to choose your protein and toppings.  Everything is super fresh, from scratch, and absolutely delicious.  \nOh my goodness, it was delicious!  I got the soup, the kiddos (and I!) shared a huge rice bowl and my honey got a gyro rice bowl.  Oh, and we couldn\'t resist the fresh fries and a side of hummus.  \nFirstly, the meat.  The gyro meat was tender and moist, yum!  The chicken was also tender and seasoned well, we all enjoyed that.  We all got the rice with lentils as our base, and it was also yummy.  The pitas were grilled and the hummus was a little more lemony than other places but just tasted very fresh.  The fries looked like they were burned but tasted just fine and were tender in the middle.  We all got the yogurt-based tzatziki (you can choose yogurt or sour cream based) and it too was great.  Overall we ate tons of food and left feeling very satisfied.  Not the "oh god I ate too much and I\'ve now got a brick in my stomach" but rather "Wow, I feel awesome!  That was good and fresh and I just feel...good!"  And best of all?  We didn\'t get MSG-snowed at all.  (With the rice and soup I figured if it was going to happen it would have, but nothing!)\nI would go back any day.'

The place is small and typical neighborhood bar where they made extra room for the Friday night fish fry crowd.\n\nThere is a good selection of fish specials including beer battered cod, perch, blue gill and walleye.  I had the walleye and my fiancee had the perch.  She had baby red potatoes and I had the fries.  It was all fresh and crispy without being greasy.  Both had great flavor but nothing amazing, just your rock solid Wisconsin Friday fish fry.  \n\nService was prompt and though the beer choices were fairly limited, we enjoyed it and will keep it on our return list and I would recommend you put it on your list as well!'

I had a Braddock Smash which was nice but not something I'd sit around drinking too much.  Now, the Whiskey Sours were well poured and very good.  And the wife's Vodka Tonics were very good, according to her.  And the homemade tater chips were excellent, and very addictive (and us on diets!! Geez).\n\nHowever, the food could have been better.  We ordered off the Brassierre's menu, scallops for me, filet for her.  The scallops were ok but I've had better.  The polenta was a bit cool so not much to say about that.  The wife's filet looked good, had good texture, and was cooked right.  But it didn't appear to be seasoned.  Plus, the bearnaise was awfully thick, or at least thicker than what we're used to.\n\nOverall, a good place to drink.  And although the food we ordered was off the mark a bit, I definitely wouldn't mind going back and trying a burger off of their menu (if it wasn't downtown, that is!!).\n\nUpdate -  went back for drinks and dinner with wife and her brother.  This time I had something called the Pittsburgh Ugly sandwich, basically a Reuben with a sliced sausage link on it, topped off by a potato perogie.  What are these perogies y'all eat here?  This one was like trying to eat the cotton ball from a bottle of aspirin.  Yuck!!!  And the sandwich was so dry I could hardly chew it. Did they forget the Russian Dressing?  I'm taking no stars away from my original review but only because I like the bar.  Will not eat anything else here but the homemade tater chips."

So was not expecting it to be excellent because delivery by its nature just can't be so. \n\nTime for Delivery - Took 1.5 hours to arrive and when it did it was terrible. \nSesame chicken - He said it was OK but I think it had too much batter but at least it was sort of crispy still considering it was delivery. \nWonton soup - no flavor what so ever. Thick wontons partly cooked.\nPan fired noodles - tough, under cooked. Horrible brown sauce but meat/shrimp quality was sort of OK  as far as I could tell under the brown sauce.\nPork fried rice - What pork fried rice? What we got was 3 containers of brown rice The  Sesame Chicken  platter  was supposed to have pork fired rice which was not to be found in the bag.  But there were many containers of the gummy yet tough how does that happen brown rice.  Even I can cook brown rice better.\nEgg Rolls - Horrid! Enough said on those other than one was supposed to be a shrimp one and I never saw or tasted any shrimp.\n\nI am from Denver and we have lots of good Asian food there. China Gourmet was no comparison to what it should have been even with the most mediocre Chinese food found in Denver."

I ordered a low-carb wrap today as a change, and it was ok, but nothing stellar. It pains me to say this, but aside from the addition of sprouts, these don't taste much different than a Subway sub does (to me), and I'm sure they're anything but healthy... \n\nPrices are fair, the staff is great, the food is maybe 2.5-stars at best.

My friend and I have dined in Paris and San Francisco this year and we both agreed that this meal experience was one of the top meals of the year!  The young man who was our server was helpful and charming as well.  We started themeal with Maschio "Ciao" Prosecco wine from Veneto, Italy.  It was delightful and celebratory and put us both in a great mood for the meal.  Our appetizers were perfect, our main course selection (Mushroom Strudel with wine sauce) was moan worthy, and the deserts were to die for.  The owner of the restaurant was, as usual, attentive to every detail and came out to say hello and assure we were happy.  We both decided to go with decaf coffee because it was late and they brewed a delicious cup of Columbian decaf.  I cannot imagine how people ever have a negative experience here.  It is about the 10th visit for me and I am always pleased.  This time I was more than delighted!'

I asked around and no one had heard of this deal. So, we ventured to Kitty's Cafe and tried to see what they had there. Lil guy was starving by now and needed to eat.

I remember that when they cook hamburgers, they always have to have a few on the grill, even when it's slow so the customer doesn't have to wait. Once they have been on the grill for awhile, they put it in a holding pan and use it for chili. It has almost a rancid grease smell to it in the pan, but once it is boiled down, it tastes fine and is virtually grease-less. Once it hits that pan, it should never be served.\n\nWe went about 3:00 in the afternoon and ordered 5 single combos. Three of the five tasted like they took them out of the chili meat pan, the other two tasted ok, although dry. Did they have only two burgers on the grill (and overcooked)? Did they take the other three out of the chili meat holding pan? I guess we will never know for sure. I never complained to the restaurant manager, but did email corporate. I never heard back from them.\n\nAvoid fast food, but...AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!"

My friend ordered a big thing of wings from them once, and I had a few, they were pretty good, but I prefer their pizzas. \n\nThe cheese they use is great, I don\'t know how they turn a profit at that price as all the ingredients are WAY better than what you\'d find at places with similar prices. It\'s true, the area isn\'t that great (I live nearby) and it\'s small inside, but are you trying to rent a room there, or get some food?'

S'I have lived in this area for the last four years and have been desperate for a locally owned restaurant to break up the monotony of the major chains that are so prevalent in Mesa.  Josephine\'s is definitely NOT the answer I\'ve been looking for.  \n \nAtmosphere:  It was a decent looking place.  It\'s in a small storefront in a strip mall, so I would not expect it to be extravagant.  It looked recently renovated and relatively clean.  My order was to go, so I didn\'t spend any time at a table.  \n\nService:  Service was lacking significantly in the restaurant.  There was no designated "to go" pickup area, so I waited by the hostess station - which was empty.  I literally stood at the front of the restaurant for 15 minutes before anyone came up to talk to me.  The restaurant was half full, and I did not see any of the other diners get their food while I was there either.  I was told my order would be 40 minutes to pickup, but it was more like an hour.  The waitress who brought me my food apologized and told me that they were bu, which I thought was bizarre, as the restaurant was only half full.  I think they were a bit understaffed.   \n\nFood:  I ordered the chicken parmesan for me, chicken alfredo for my wife, an order of cheese bread, and a slice of cheesecake.  \n\n-Chicken Parmesan:  I ordered it to go, so I was not expecting it to look like a work of art by the time I got it home.  I\'m sure it would have looked appealing on a plate.  The chicken was obviously frozen.  The breading was slimy and the chicken was tough.  The pasta was overdone.  But my biggest issue?  The sauce.  It tasted like it came right from a can.  It had no seasoning - no garlic, oregano, or even salt...just pure, unseasoned, tomato.  \n\n-Chicken Alfredo:  you would think that chicken alfredo would be a nice, seasoned slice of grilled chicken sliced and served on a bed of pasta with alfredo sauce, right?  Wrong.  It\'s the same chunk of dried, unfrozen chicken that they put on the chicken parmesan.  Again, the biggest letdown of the dish was the sauce.  My wife couldn\'t eat more than a few bites.  I tried it, and again, it tasted like the sauce was taken directly from a can.  \n\n-Cheese bread:  Bread was not toasted through - it was OK, but I\'ve had better.  \n\n-Cheesecake:  Cheesecake was OK, but I doubt they made it from scratch.  It tasted store bought, which I guess is OK for cheesecake.  \n\nWe literally could not finish the entrees.  I could have stomached the chicken parmesan if the sauce was palatable.  I don\'t know that there was any way to save the chicken alfredo.  \n\nIn short, the food was less than mediocre, service was slow, and the prices were exorbitant for what was served.  I do not believe this restaurant will be around for much longer unless it changes the food it serves.'

I didn't mind the layout so much but make sure you get a map of the course from the pro shop if this is your first time around because there is a lot of blind shots. This course is targety and has many split fairways that end in desert. The greens putted really nicely, very fast and smooth. I wasn't super impressed with the starter who questioned me about my HCP like I was being interrogated by the police. I guess he was concerned I wasn't a low enough handicapper to play off the blue or black tees which is silly because the course isn't tough from any tee. He also told us to speed up because we had a hole and a half ahead of us but when  we teed off we never saw a group ahead of us and people weren't waiting behind us so he did the typical ranger power trip and ended up disturbing myself and my group by making us speed up when we didn't need to.\n\nMake extra time to play the putting course out front, 18 holes and very fun.\n\nI payed $30 for a cart, round and all the practice I want, not a bad deal for this time of year I guess if you like a drive out in the middle of no mans land."

Everything started out well enough...Drinks and orders taken, drinks brought out in a timely manner...That is where it ended really.  Refills on my soda were slow coming. The guys ordered Beer and we watched the beers hit the bar counter and waited for over 5 mins maybe even a few more before the girl brought them to us. At that point everyone complained they were hot. I thought the food was really good, pricing was okay. One remark was that the shrimp tostada should have avocado on it not an add't 1.50 as a side. The service was really poor. Our orders came out so sporadic we didn't eat as a table. And when asked for the avo, she cleared our table and did other things so that by the time she came back with the avo he was half done with his food making it almost pointless! Had to ask for salsa and chip refills every time. \nWe started out as a table of 4. Then 2 other peeps came as we were waiting for our tabs. Because we all knew each other they slid another table up to ours and made us a table of 6.  Boy wasn't that convenient for our server who then felt she had the right to add a 15% tip to our tabs. I was shocked when I saw our tab! appalled that she had the huevos to do that! Honestly she forced us to all to over tip her. I saw no excuse for the lousy service we received so I felt she didn't deserve the tip she gave herself!\nAs we are STILL waiting to get the tabs, they brought in a band. All I can say is that they were to many members playing the stage! The music would have been pretty good at a different venue.

S'At Grand Cru I had one of those dining experiences that was all round pretty bad, but with enough Fawlty Towers style comedy to make it enjoyable, making giving it a score quite a tricky task.\n\nFirstly, some of the reviewers clearly have the beer goggles on by describing it as "posh" or "stylish". On our visit the drinks menus written on a sheet of A4 paper, grubby tables hastily painted over, and toilets straight out of Trainspotting suggested otherwise. All this wouldn\'t have mattered a jot if the standards were good. They weren\'t great, but there was a few saving graces in there..\n\nThe menu isn\'t too exciting, but quite competitively priced at about a tenner for a main course. However, some things just don\'t work when you charge a tenner for them, and edible as E-Bot\'s seabass was, there was an obvious dip in quality from the many places where this fishy friend occupies the highest price bracket on the menu. Her potatoes were raw as well, which was equal parts shocking and totally hilarious.\n\nMy ceasar salad was alright, but lacked the anchovies it was meant to have on the menu, which were also the main reason I chose it. It was still tasty enough to gobble down every last morsel though.\n\nA perhaps minor, but notable success was that Grand Cru did dish up the best glass of Coke I think I\'ve ever had. Served in a tall, thin, frosted glass with proper crushed ice and a bit of lime squeezed in to give it some unexpected zinginess. It did suggest that Grand Cru might be a better bar than it is a restaurant, a sentiment seemingly reflected in the other reviews.\n\nIt was disorganised, chaotic, and in gastronomic terms, below par, but what a way to serve up a soft drink. It\'s at times like this Yelp needs half stars, consider it a very low 4.'

All the dishes are cooked really well, they are nicely spiced and flavoursome. The duck and lychee curry is excellent, as is the Pad Thai. Pretty much all the dishes are available with chicken, pork, beef, king prawns, duck or vegetarian at varying prices.\n\nAdmittedly Spice Box is not too cheap, but if you think about it, most Thai places in Edinburgh are pretty pricey. It can seem deceptively cheap, but then you have to add meat onto the base price of each dish. Also if you catch them on weekends then the wait is frequently up to and hour. But the food is really good, and worth it. If you're bored of the same old Chinese rubbish then this is a really good alternative."

Tasty roll. \n\nBonus: You get a molasses cookie with your meal!\n\nBonus 2: They have amazing pie!\n\nOn top of the cheap drinks (tYMMV, but my old fashioned was delicious) and tasty fish you also get very attentive wait staff that are all super friendly. \n\nI am so glad i live a few blocks from here because I don't know if I would have ever experienced it otherwise.

The atmosphere was the same, with a patio and indoor tables and a long bar in the center, but I could appreciate the bar more since I am now a grown man.  \n\nThe music is on an internet jukebox, which I always love, because most places like this don't know when too much Lynrd Skynard is too much.  The bartenders were all young and beautiful and this explains why there were so many married men here who left their wives at home.  \n\nThe inside and the back porch were filled with folks my age as well.  I made friends with the only brother in the place when I dropped some old school ATliens on him, which kind of shook up the older heads, but they got over it.  I would visit this place again, because a poor man can't beat one dollar draft even if it is Natural Light."

S'Hello Friends,\nToday I found myself hungry before an appointment off the 51 and Bell Road.  I remembered a small coffee shop right nearby and drove there to see what was in store.  Little did I know, Mocha Bianca, has much in store for those with an appetite for good food and drink!\n\nOutside, Mocha Bianca is very unassuming.  It is within a small shopping plaza, but their sign will stand out to you from the road.  Upon entering I was immediately greeted by their staff.  Their establishment has a very cozy coffee shop feel - complete with sofas, dining tables and local artist\'s artwork on their walls.  They also offer free wireless Internet.\n\nTheir menu is plentiful!  At Mocha Bianca, one can order breakfast or lunch.  They have a complete coffee bar, where they can make specialty coffee drinks for you.  I went with my usual standard of late, The Caramel Machiatto.  All I can say, DELICIOUS.  Generous caramel and what seemed to be an extra shot of espresso, I find myself flying this afternoon.  :)  They sure can give Starbucks a run for their money!  If coffee is not your standard, you can also purchase tea frappes, coffee-free drinks, or smoothies made with real pureed fruit.\n\nFor their food menu, they have bagels and various breakfast sandwiches for their breakfast customers.  For lunch, one can choose one of their various hot or cold sandwiches, as well as their Chicago Style Hot Dogs.  Salads are also available for those craving a lighter fare.  On this particular day, I opted for one of their daily specials, a bean and cheese burrito with green chilies.  The burrito had just enough "kick" to it, along with it being a modest serving not to be overwhelming.\n\nTheir staff is most accommodating and friendly.  If only major chains like Starbucks would take a lesson from Mocha Bianca.  They know how to do service with more than a smile, heartfelt service, and delicious food and drink.  I look forward to dining at Mocha Bianca again very soon!'

The soup was delectable, and the coffee was quirky and tasted fresh and just different enough to be interesting, while still smooth and full.\n\nThe building is small and cozy--currently 5 tables and a couch.

S"Burgers are kind of my speciality. I love burgers so much I dream about them. I come from a city where burgers, especially gourmet burgers have exploded on the scene (Burger Priest anyone? Toronto whaaat). I was thoroughly impressed when my friend and I stumbled upon Hamburger Heaven one Saturday afternoon.  We were hungover and walking along Broughton Street looking for somewhere to soak up the jaegerbombs we ingested the night before. We smelled something, something delicious that consequently changed my view on the hangover food situation in Edinburgh. Hamburger Heaven is really heaven. It's the heaven I want to go to when I die. This is a place Anthony Bourdain would frequent. We both ordered the cheeseburger with bacon and fried onions (I can't remember the real name of the burger). Wow. I think we both sat there stunned. You can tell someone put a lot of effort into the patty. So juicy and flavourful. I think I had smile on my face while eating it. The only downfall on the overall experience was the bun.  The bun needs some attention.  Some would say that this is a big deal but I think the meat, the actual important piece of the burger overrides this small defect. \n\nThe waiter who served us was a handsome Polish fellow who increased our dining experience with his impressive banter.  He treated us like we were regulars and made an effort to get to know us (not in a flirtatious way, he swayed more for the other sex). A note to point out is that Hamburger Heaven and the Blue Moon Caf\xc3\xa9 are connected and both establishments utilise the same toilets.  Additionally, you can order burgers from the Hamburger Heaven menu if you're dining at the Blue Moon Caf\xc3\xa9.  Definitely give this place a shot.  It has the power to cure your hangover!"

S'I had a good, but not great meal here.\n\nThe "menu gastronomique" on this night consisted of three items:\n-A fantastic French Onion soup (but really, you better not screw this one up if you\'re a French restaurant), that was loaded with bubbly cheese and a rich broth.\n-A relatively bland portion of seared duck breast that looked a little bare on the plate and was a little dry for my taste.  Note: one of the other diners had the duck entree, which she was extremely enamored with\n-A tasty elk medallion, prepared au poivre, which was perfectly cooked but really did not pack the peppery punch I was expecting.  Fortunately the plate had enough other flavor on it to complement the meat well.  This included foie gras, as well as some roasted new potatoes and a vegetable medley which were both very nice.\n\nI can\'t for the life of me remember the name of the bottle of wine we had, but I was fairly unimpressed with a boring cabernet that lacked any real flavor.  This was a $45 bottle at the restaurant that could not have fetched more than $10 at a grocery store.\n\nI should mention here that when the check came, they billed the prix fixe as $52 instead of the $42 that was listed.  Keep your wits about you.\n\nIt was a good meal.  Given that French restaurants on this adorable cobbled section of Old Montreal are more densely packed than Montreal bars are with underage Americans, I will probably not be back to Le Sauvagine, even should I find myself back in this neck of the woods again.  But unless you have some insider info, this place\'ll do.'

It\'s fast food, hello! It\'s not gonna be awesome. I mean you are paying less than a buck for some of the stuff on the menu. I doubt anyone goes here unless they are broke, in a hurry or drunk. \n\nI have to give this location props tho, they are super nice and friendly. Always a "Hello, welcome, how is your day going?" when I pull up to the drive through. Big smiles when I get to the window. Then the topper, "Have a great day, come back and see us soon!" I mean seriously, they are great! I am usually there once a week, usually after a long day and they always seem to perk me up. \n\nAfter the less than two words spoken and sour faces I get at Wendy\'s this place is awesome.

The burger in the kids meal was a full sized burger so there was a lot left over, no complaints about the pulled pork and the brisket was so tender you could cut it with a spoon.

S'We dined at Corona Cantina with friends last night based on a recommendation from other friends who had been there for drinks and a couple appetizers.  We should have done the same.  The restaurant is a pleasant surprise considering the center it\'s located in is in need of a facelift.  The evening started off fine, although our waiter didn\'t visit our table often.  The appetizers weren\'t amazing, but were good.  But here\'s where things went downhill FAST.  We waited an hour and a half from the time we ordered dinner until our meal arrived and our waiter visited our table once during that time, he didn\'t even check to see if we needed another round of drinks.  We were patient because they\'re a new restaurant and we were catching up with friends.  Two of the people in our party ordered the "Diablo Burger", another the chimichanga, and I ordered the chicken fajitas.  When the food finally arrived, we all started laughing.  Although I rarely eat fast food, the burgers AND fries looked exactly like what you would order at any fast food joint, but not the good kind.  They obviously had been sitting out a long time and were like eating rocks.  On top of that they were missing three of the toppings described in the menu and they were not the promised 1/2 pound burger that was described.  The chimichanga looked like it has all life sucked out of it, had barely any meat inside of it, and had no flavor.  The fajitas were sparse and flavorless.  But let\'s get to the BEST part...we couldn\'t stop talking about how bad this meal was after we left (we literally had bets on which fast food restaurant they bought the burgers at), so when we all got back to our house, my husband (an attorney) called the restaurant and got the manager on the phone to admit that half of their kitchen staff was absent and that they had bought the burgers elsewhere.  At first we were elated that the manager actually admitted it and than furious that we all paid $11-$15 dollars for meals that were probably worth $4.  The manager said that the next time we came in he would "take care of us," but I don\'t think someone could pay us to go back to this place.  This restaurant lacks integrity.  I would have appreciated them a lot more had the manager come over to our table and told us after our appetizers that they were experiencing problems in the kitchen and they wouldn\'t be able to fulfill entree orders, but gave us coupons for a future visit or credited one of the appetizers on the bill.  Instead they lied to us, made us wait, and overcharged us for horrible fast food.  I would avoid this restaurant because they clearly don\'t have the appropriate management in place to deal with problems and who knows who was in their kitchen cooking last night to cover the missing staff.  I\'m just praying we don\'t get sick...'

S'A great chip shop that can be found in the Main Street in Portobello. \nRun by Italian husband and wife team serving freshly prepared pizzas, jacket potatoes, I even spotted a battered ribeye steak in the hot display cabinet as well as the famous fish and chips that are cooked to order, for me that is a really good sign of a well run chip shop where the food is fresh and not sitting in a hot box for ages. \nCrispy batter and cooked just right. \n\nI did notice that a plastic sheet A5 size was placed on top of the fish to stop it from sticking to the paper what a great idea, this shop is a must for anyone passing by'

S'I\'ve been to this place a couple times and I\'ve constantly been blown away. It\'s a bit small and unassuming, but this restaurant is big where it counts.\nThe freshness of the ingredients really shines and the prices are great.\nI recommend you try one of the "specialty" items for everyone in your group and ask them to serve them to you back-to-back so you can share. They\'ll bring you one item at a time until you finish it, at which point another even more delicious dish will be brought out! This way you can try more food, enjoy more flavour and it\'s a great sharing experience. I\'d also recommend having some papaya salad and spring roll to whet your appetite before your feast.\nI love this place!'

S'Ich schreibe jetzt einfach nicht viel weil schon alles gesagt wurde: Nur so vielich kann mich eigentlich allen Kommentaren anschlie\xc3\x9fen. Ein echter Geheimtipp im Moment in Karlsruhe. Eine wahre Oase in Mitten eines Industriegebiets. Preise moderat, Essen sehr gut und Ambiente unschlagbar. Zwei Kritikpunkte: Als wir da waren, wurde wohl gerade eine neue eingesetzt? Ansonsten k\xc3\xb6nnen wir uns nicht erkl\xc3\xa4ren warum unsere leeren Teller auch nach 30 Minuten noch nicht abger\xc3\xa4umt wurden und wir diese demonstrativ auf den Nachbartisch stellten. Wir wurden zwar von der Bedienung schief angeschaut aber egal, dann hat sie auch mal reagiert und war willens neue Getr\xc3\xa4nke zu liefern. Sie war zwar allein im Dienst, aber 10 Leute die alle drau\xc3\x9fen gesessen sind sollte man auch alleine hinbekommen?!? Trinkgeld gab es jedenfalls sehr wenig. Und zweiter kleiner Kritikpunkt: Als ich zu den Toiletten runterlief roch es ganz leicht nach Bahnhofsklomir ist das nur aufgefallen weil es das perfekte Ambiente bissl gest\xc3\xb6rt hat. Die Toiletten selbst ein Traum, da geh ich sogar hin wenn ich gar nicht muss :D Fazit: Au\xc3\x9fer der Bedienung uneingeschr\xc3\xa4nkt zu empfehlen'

S"Started out with one of the longest waits I've experienced for something as simple as bourbon chicken. One of the appeals of Chinese food is the quickness with which the order is normally completed. This wasn't the case here. For the lunch special being only 5.95 (including a drink) it could be a good deal - but only if your time isn't valuable. For me, waiting in excess of 20 minutes and still not having the food yet is a bit much.\n\nThe food was about as good as you'd expect an unimpressive Chinese food place to be. If you've never had truly good Chinese food an are used to a mall food court, it will probably taste acceptable.\n\n5.95 for a drink, two semi-okay crab Rangoon and a dish is the draw."

S"Over the years, Al-Taib has expanded beyond belief. Hitting every corner of the Concordia Quarter, they've done quite well for themselves! However, with their success, they have lost much quality in their output. Not only have prices risen dramatically due to popularity, but they don't seem to care very much about the quality of the service and food. I've lived in the area for about 23 years, and have seen and experienced the drastic changes take place.\n\nThe service comes off dull and there isn't much 'friendliness' in the factor; now sure, their job requirements don't include becoming buddy-buddy with customers, however, minimal effort to be friendly and accommodating would at least make the experience more enjoyable. They always seem to be talking amongst themselves and respond monotonously to the customer's order. On rare occasion though, you'll get a more 'focused' server.\n\nAs far as mana'eesh goes, I'd recommend: Feta, Zaatar, Cheese, half Zaatar/Cheese, or the Lahme B'ajine. Adding toppings will cost you extra, but a few of them are good, such as: Mint, Olives, Turnips, or Tomatoes. The food quality is not bad, it tastes good when fresh, but sometimes the dough can come out real thick, original toppings may be scarce, added toppings may not be the most fresh, and other times your pizza or mana'eesh will be dripping in oil... \n\nNowadays, I'd rather go elsewhere and get something better that costs less too."

Part croissant and part donut, it's sweet on the outside with buttery layers inside.  Yum.  I'm also pretty happy with the sprinkled cake donuts and pumpkin cake donuts that they make in the fall.  And then there are the kringles and cookies.  During the summer, they had outdoor tables so you could enjoy your donut outside in the sunshine, which was great.

S'Welcome to Yuppieville!  Desert Ridge reminds me of most shopping centers in Southern California, i.e. Irvine Spectrum.  We got into Phoenix a little late on a Friday night to start our spring training weekend and I didn\'t want to fuss for dinner.  Since I am deprived of Island\'s in Nor Cal, I decided for the three of us.  \n\nWe were seated immediately and our server took our drink order.  I hate to say that almost 2 years after this Island\'s opened (see Jenny K.\'s review) the service hasn\'t improved.  I think our server was on another planet.  She brought two of our drinks and said she would be back with the beer. As she set down the two waters she looked at me and "oh, you ordered an iced tea, huh?" Yup, sure did.  So she brought the beer, then the iced tea.  Three trips for three drinks. Two trips and two reminders of more salsa. We all had one taco left in our baskets and she was trying to clear our places.   The service is not the most perceptive. It was quite amusing though.'

S"This has become my favourite place to eat and enjoy an evening in New Town over the last six months. It's relaxed, cosy, welcoming, simple and scrumptious, and is the place we are always sure to recommend or take our visiting guests to.\n\nWe recommend approaching it in the following way to get the absolute best out of your visit:\n\n1. Get a treat and have a bottle of prosecco (same price as a bottle of white and even more fun)\n\n2. Get a sharing platter and maybe some of their special crostini to start - YUM!\n\n3. Ask them very very nicely if you can share all your main dishes... \n\nThe sharing platters are so delicious that we've got into the habit of having one and then sharing their main course dishes in a 'tapas' style - it makes for a really fun evening and means that you get to taste a little of every delicious, Italian inspired dish. They put the food, some salad and their lovely homemade 'chips' in the centre of the table and you have little plates and simple explore it all!\n\n4. Go eye up the homemade desserts at the counter and order the tirimasu or chocolate mousse (my favourites), or basically anything else as it's all good :-)\n\n5. Have a hot chocolate with locally made marshmallows\n\n6. Fall into a happy food-coma\n\n7. Come back on the last Sunday of the month and enjoy it all again whilst listening to their acoustic music night (5ish to 8ish).\n\nYou don't have to do it this way, you can also pop by for a full dinner or just a lovely glass of wine/piece of cake, either way you'll enjoy it - but we've carefully honed this to be our favourite way to dine there! \n\nOverall, their ingredients are really interesting and the dishes taste fresh and comforting. The atmosphere is lovely, relaxed but stylish, with considerate staff, and last but not least, they're welcoming to all ages (including babies and dogs!). \n\nLovely stuff and thumbs up all round."

S"I'm always on the look out for new continental bakeries; as a modern european languages student, I need to act the part! This place is extremely authentic in terms of simple, quality French bread and pastries. The smell that greeted me as I entered the building was absolutely incredible, the staff were friendly, and I knew I had to order something quickly!  Though the bread looked amazing, I ended up getting an almond croissant and a cappuccino. The croissant was fantastic, and the filling tasted homemade, unlike those processed fillings found so often in supermarkets.\n\nThe only downside to this place is the size: it's really tiny! There are two tables, and I would kind of feel awkward about staying too long and hogging them. That's a shame, because I love buying a coffee and then hanging out to read or study in a place for hours. For this reason, maybe this would be a better place to take away."

S'Drunk munchies at 4am? I\'m not about to throw down some double digit dough on food I\'ll probably vomit later. Imagine my surprise to literally stumble upon the only Burger King on the strip being called out by a "little person" announcing beer pong at O\'Shea\'s. Beer pong was our first thought, but after realizing just how intoxicated we were figured some alcohol absorption was a better bet. Sure it\'s expensive for a fast food joint, but when you have to have it, cost really isn\'t an issue. An oasis in an overpriced food market and literally in the middle of the desert, this location gets 4 stars just for being what it is, where it is, when you need it.'

S"XLB in the hizzy! This place is clean and humble. Plus, our server was attentive and friendly. We were having difficulty narrowing down what to order; when the server suggested the xiao long bao as the way to go, we didn't hesitate and ordered it right away. \n\nThe XLB (Xiao Long Bao/ Shanghai soup dumplings) $6.95 weren't too shabby. I've certainly had better, but I also have no other place that I can compare it to in Vegas. Although they were a tad bit bland for my personal taste, there was plenty of warm broth in each dumpling. You need to make sure to eat the dumplings with the provided black vinegar ginger sauce - it compliments and helps season it up substantially. Flavor rating: 3/5\n\nWe also tried the chili oil & peanut butter cold noodles $6.95. It's a big heaping bowl of spaghetti type noodles topped with minced beef in a thick chili peanut oil sauce. I honestly felt that the menu description was a little misleading - there is nothing peanut buttery about the noodles? Plus I couldn't taste peanut butter or sesame ingredients for the life of me. I suppose the dish wasn't terrible after we doused it with soy sauce, more vinegar sauce, and chili oil to wake it up. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\nIf XLB is what you're hankering for, I would suggest giving this place a try; you may find them to be satisfying."

S"Came to Montreal for the Jazz Festival and got a recommendation from a friend of my daughter to go to Cho.  I thought the restaurant was out of the way but it was actually a short cab ride from the venue.  The atmosphere was upbeat and the food was excellent. Our party of four had two rounds of drinks, a whole bunch of appetizers and three entrees for $75 a head, which was just outstanding value for what we ate.  I loved the way they have adapted dishes to their fusion style such as the shrimp tartar and the calamari salad.  Simple sides like edemame and rice were dressed in new ways I hadn't seen before.  They took the Quebec poutine (fries, cheese and gravy) and turned into a meal unto itself.  Presentation was upscale and service attentive.  If you're willing to stray out of downtown, it's an innovative experience well worth it."

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that it's small. Really small.\n\nBut, this is also a huge plus. With only a few tables and a couple of staff, you get the sense that you're really being looked after, and that each dish is something special (rather than one of a number being churned out by a huge kitchen).\n\nThe food itself is excellent. Fresh, high quality ingredients are combined in a way that allows the individual flavours to shine through. Even the spicier dishes are delicate and quite distinct - there's no generic Thai spice here. Seafood seems to be a bit of a speciality - which is fair enough, given the location and style - so fish-lovers will definitely have the best choice.

You have to get there early for it though, because they will run out - true story!  One time, I was with my wife and a friend of ours at Ikea and I threw out the words "Copper River Salmon".  We made a beeline, of sorts, out of the store and headed over to Rockfish, all the while salivating for the feast that awaited.\n\nWhen we got there - they were fresh out of the prize we so desperately wanted.  I cried a little bit, then I wet my pants to show my disapproval.  It didn\'t get me any Copper River Salmon, but it left me drenched and sad.  We still ordered the other salmon on the menu, and it was good, but it didn\'t feed the need for the good stuff (*twitch, *twitch).  But have no fear, we returned the next week, early, and partook of the buttery goodness, then we left, bellies full and with a false sense of triumph.\n\nBut, I am a legend in my own mind.\n\nSo, check it out, get the good stuff, and just imagine how awesome the seafood will be in Arizona once that massive earthquake separates California from the rest of the nation.'

So when the restaurant I intended to go to was closed in observance of Passover, I decided to make a mental note to come try this place in the near future.\n\nFast forward about a week.  I walked into a mostly empty restaurant that was decorated as if you are dining in an outdoor courtyard, except you are indoors.  It has some Mexican themed decorations, such as the hanging dried chilis.\n\nSince this was the very first time I have been to this restaurant, I didn\'t realize that it was actually part of a small national chain (this being the third location and they have one in Utah and I can\'t remember where else).  Their main thing is the burrito with sauce both on the inside and outside that they called Burrangos.  I tried to describe it to my friends and they said that it is similiar to the Cafe Rio Wet Burrito (I will take their word for it, as i have never been to Cafe Rio).  There are a variety of meats to select from (I  opted for the grilled steak, which was very tender) and for vegetarians, they have grilled vegetables.  You have your choice of three different beans, two kinds of rice (tomato base and lime rice), three sauces (mild, medium and hot - the medium wasn\'t really spicy) and finally cheese.  After it is assembled, the burrito is placed on a conveyor that moves it along while baking it (think Quiznos or something like it).  Overall it was a decent burrito presented differently.\n\nJust FYI:  The "regular" size burrito is actually their large, and it was a decent size burrito.  They have a frequent visit card, which I assume will give you something for free after 10 visits/purchases.\n\nThe staff that works here are friendly and did not mind explaining the menu to new customers.  That is always a plus.\n\nA-OK!  Three stars.'

S"I've been here twice and my experiences were night and day. The first time I went for lunch. I shared the dumplings with friends and the beef ramen as a main and fried bananas for dessert. All were good. The fried bananas were the star of the meal.\n\nThe second time I went the appetizer trio was fantastic. I had the duck wings, the cucumber salad (divine) and the julienne salad. I ordered the beef ramen again for dinner because I remembered it was good from last time and wasn't feeling adventurous. It came to the table in an incredibly large bowl. Filled with noodles, about 5 bok choy leafs, some green onion or scallion and a decent amount of beef. Unfortunately it was incredibly salty and smelled and tasted of eggs. There was no egg in it (sometimes a restaurant will put half a boiled egg in their ramen but this one had none) so I told the waiter. He argued with me, and refused to just let me pay for my appetizer and leave. He argued with me twice over, telling me I didn't know what japanese ramen is and that it was how it was supposed to be. I have had ramen before, even at this very restaurant and I don't think it's right to argue like that.\n\nIn the end he wouldn't let me just pay for my appetizer so he gave me some stir fried noodles and I got them to go because I had already been there for nearly an hour waiting for my soup. I got home and tried the noodles and they are also incredibly salty but luckily they do not smell or taste of eggs. Honestly I WOULD have gone back again because it could have just been a bad day for the chef but my INCREDIBLY poor customer service experience will cause me to not return and never recommend this place to anyone."

Its been KFC for the most part but she wanted to take a shot at fish and chips. We were at the Crown and Anchor not too long so a coworker informed me that RR had the best fish and chips he had ever had so I thought what the heck.\n\nI just picked it up to go but I was kinda surprised how packed the place was.  The menu is insanely unhealthy for the most part.  I hope families w/ kids don't come here too often.  The F&Cs were decent though..just about the same level as Crown and Anchor.

The food was great, we had garlic bread and two different pizzas that were both great! We have since bought gift cards for friends, would definitely recommend.

Oh well.\n\nBack at my computer and not at the mercy of my "smart" phone.  This location is always pretty busy - that\'s why I was so surprised that it had not been reviewed yet.  I didn\'t even get to check in either.\n\nBack to the review.... the dining room is usually clean and they have a Ballantyne theme going on with some golf decor and pictures of the various holes on the golf course.  It does make the place feel a little out of it\'s element... it\'s still fast food with nice decorations.  I did also notice that the registers are pretty new-it has a monitor so that you can see what the cashier is entering for your order.\n\nBig Con is the parking lot... it can get a little congested... add that with Charlotte drivers and BIG SUV driving suburban soccer moms... doesn\'t bode well for the diner who is looking for a good burger with little distractions in the parking lot.'

Frankly, it's prety well hidden so if you don't already know it's there, you likely won't stumble upon it by accident. It's fairly spacious and has private rooms for small groups; there's a hole right under the tables so you give off the illusion of sitting on a tatami but you're not. Sneaky! \n\nI've only stopped in for lunches, and have had good experiences each time. The fish is fresh, the presentation is good and prices are very reasonable. You can order \xc3\xa0 la carte, or go for one of their Bento boxes, which include a variey of rolls and other tasty items. \n\nIt's usually pretty busy at lunch so get there early or call ahead to book a table."

No one in the place but us.Stood at the counter about 10 minutes before someone finally came up to take our order. Then had to wait another 15 minutes for the food, like they were open but not ready for any customers.\nAlso, Wendy's really need to revamp the way they refill drinks. You have to go back to the counter and wait for some one to refill your drink in between filling the food orders. Why should you have to stand there and wait when 99.99% of all fast food chains have a self serve refill station or two. I stood there waiting while some girl was filling orders. I know she saw me standing there, but never offered me a refill. Finally got a refill from another employee.\nC'mon Wendys, get with the times and install a self serve refill station so customers won't have to stand in a long line waiting on refills."

S'I came back here, after my first visit and review last year. And it\'s still a completely middle of the road 3 stars. But visiting the Yelp page again and reading Chris M\'s review made me realise it perhaps is the happier end of 3 stars.\n\n"Wonderfully inoffensive" is perhaps a good way to put it (thanks Mr M!) Like that nice boy you dated for a semester in 2nd year at Uni, who was a bit meek but quite sweet. He\'d remember your favourite type of cookie, and bring it to you on that day you forgot your assignment and it was due day. Sweet. But then didn\'t really have much chat and you were never that keen on seeing him more than once a week. Yeah, that one. Nothing wrong per se, but nothing right.\n\nPerfectly fine (is that an oxymoron?) I think the reason I warmed to it a little is it was 8pm on a Tuesday, it was pouring rain, me and my friend wanted somewhere to continue chatting after eating at Pho Vietnam (a teeny tiny restaurant where they needed the table, and it was so delicious we were happy to oblige) but didn\'t want a drink. All the other chains were closed, but Mondo was open till 9. And with it\'s big comfy sofas, slightly worn but all the comfier for it, and outdated decorating we didn\'t have any qualms rocking up here in yesterday\'s jeans, lounging out and nursing a cup of peppermint tea for an hour.\n\nSo when you\'re having a perfectly fine evening and are looking for a one-hour layover before home, Espresso Mondo serves a purpose. In a street of 5 star restaurants, gastropubs and then 1 star chains, you need the middle man and the reliable, if slightly unexciting, 3 star independent. So, keep up the average work Espresso Mondo -I probably will be back.'

But, there are a few gems in the rough here, and one of them is the Suburban Pantry.  We had a minor SOS going, trying to figure out how to make the Scotland England rugby game from Blackhall, which the charming lady at SP tried to help us figure out. \n\nThe SP looks like a cafe, a deli and a restaurant - I am not sure what it is really. But it does serve some rather pleasant food. I had the cullen skink, which was presented very prettily and was delicious to boot. My sister tucked into cream of tomato soup... for me, it paled in comparison. We also each had the prawn, apple and gin marie rose sandwich. Nice bread, somewhat tasteless sauce though - I did like the idea of combining apple and prawn though - nice idea!

I'd never really understood what people meant when they talked about food being 'lovingly prepared', but you can really taste, see and smell how much Annabelle's love serving up gorgeous home-cooked food.\n\nYes, the windows have lace curtains draped across them, and yes, there were quite a few older people in there. But they've got the right idea: if I still live in Edinburgh when I'm a pensioner, I'll be doing exactly the same thing."

Called back about 5 mins later & it was busy (most likely because the phone was still off the hook). Waited 10 minutes & called again. Again I was asked to hold & the phone got set down. & again they forgot to come back. I wouldn't have called back a third time (& shouldn't have) but it was late & I really didn't want to cook. \nSo finally after the third time calling, they took my order. One of the items I asked for a side of Mac & cheese but they were out. Not that big of a deal. Anyway I drive to pick up my order & they tell me that one of the meals I ordered for my husband was discontinued. He said they just sold out of the last batch. Wtf?! It was stuffed French toast that was just put on the menu for the holidays.  They didn't even offer anything for my hassle & their mistake. \nNot eating there anymore. Such poor service!!"

S"I gave Le Peep 4 stars because they have great smoothies!!  This is one of 2 breakfast places I frequent on the weekends.  They have been going through some tough times lately because of the light rail construction, so busy times are hit-or-miss.  Generally around brunch time on the weekends its not too bad, but every once in a while you will hit them at their busy time.  \n\nGenerally I get really good service at Le Peep.  Lately however it has been slow, bad, or not at all.  I used to see the owner there working every time I went in, but haven't seen her in several months, so I don't know if it was sold to someone else or what.  After I stopped seeing her there  is when I started seeing the servers come and go and the service get worse.\n\nI find the breakfast food pretty good, and like I said the smoothies are great.  I have not had anything for lunch there.  I can recommend the french toast or the mini veggie omelet which is awesome!  They have pretty good coffee and their prices are reasonable.  To top it all off, they give you punch cards good toward free meals.  \n\nLe Peep seems to be going through some tough times right now, but I'm sticking with them for my weekend breakfast and I recommend them to anyone in the Central Phoenix area looking for something better than your other choice.....IHOP."

Too bad it was not working when we went.\n\n-The servers were friendly and checked up on us frequently. \n\n-Food was a little slow, but that's probably because they were a little busy.\n\n-Servings are GENEROUS for the price IMO.\n\n\nWhat to eat\n-Had the Salisbury steak with peas, caramelized  onions and rice. It was a little under seasoned, but the meat was delicious, otherwise it was just OK.\n\n-Also had a breakfast dish that had 2 eggs, peameal bacon, hash browns and breakfast sausage. It was again, just TYPICAL breakfast food you'd find in a diner.\n\n-Cheeseburger was DELICIOUS, I'd say one of the top burgers I've ever tried. They were very generous with the amount of cheese and the patty itself was very juicy. \n\nThis is just a restaurant you should try once and to enjoy the atmosphere, but the food is just ok."

S"I couldn't be happier to see another Bndz location! It's great to not have to trek through South Park to get one of my favorite burgers and fries. Furthermore, this location seems to be more open and spacious.\n While out and about in Mt. lebo, I called in my order and took my food to go. I immediately began to compare the new Bndz to my beloved South Park location. Overall, the food was spot on. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and delicious. My only gripe would be that they seemed to skimp a little on the fries. When you add on the fry and drink combo it's another $3. The burgers are already about 10-12$ each so, a little pricey to start. Therefore, if I'm paying 15$ for a burger and fries, I do expect to have a good size helping of those delicious fried sticks. \nFries aside, my favorite aspect of Bndz is the emphasis on quality, hormone free meat. The ingredients are always fresh and of a higher quality than most. Have you tried the chicken bacon burger? Yes, it is diced chicken but, it's much tastier than the typical, dried out chicken breast most places call a burger. Overall, I'm thrilled to welcome Bndz to the growing restaurant scene in Mt. Lebo."

I remember nothing but good things about Miracle Mile. I remember being excited to come eat here. \nSo one night while shopping at Arrowhead with a friend, I got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing. I was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu! I didn't have to special order it!\nIt was a good size sandwich.  Big enough that when cut in half, you still have to use both hands. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. Not that it was bad. It's just that I had fond memories of this place and I was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the #19 at Langer's in Downtown L.A.....or at the least Like Gandolfo's in Tempe. Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant.  It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor. The coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch. The flavor of the coleslaw was not strong, but still masked the flavor of the pastrami. I will stick with Jason's or Heidi's next time I have a hankerin' for another deli style sandwich."

So, that was something.\n\nEgg rolls were a hot mess. I forgot about that until I was crying over the ton of money I wasted on my lunch today.

I can't exactly remember since I saw more Sonic Drive-Ins in 3 days than I have my entire life in California, and since I am one of those fortunate enough to be teased by Sonic commercials constantly repeated on cable television, I had to try this place (similar to my situation in Cleveland with White Castle burgers, but in that instance I did not have the appetite for tiny burgers and totally regret my decision to keep on driving). I was utterly surprised with Sonic's and was left wanting more. I only had a cranberry slush, but the consistency was the same throughout my drink (regular ICEE's will become more icy with less concentrated syrup flavoring) and the tiny ice particles added to the refreshing factor.

S'Visiting Pittsburgh and was seeking a local place for a snack.  I found Italian Bread Place Deli and Catering in an article in a local paper.\n\nWhen I stepped in the door the smells of fresh bread instantly peaked my appetite.  \n\nSince I was to have a late lunch I just wanted a bowl of soup but on this Sunday they had two soups to choose from and I just could not choose so I ordered the small portion of both.  The Wedding Soup was exactly as it you expect real Italian Wedding Soup to taste.  This hearty soup had large pieces of pulled chicken, very tasty mini meat balls, spinach (green), and chicken broth.  Speaking with one of the owners she told me they cook the chicken fresh and make their own broth.  I believe this because this soup was full of taste not salt.   I enjoyed my small portion and wished I could have had the large serving.\n\nThe second soup I tried was a Spicy Sausage.  It was in a tomato base.  I enjoyed this soup also and found the bottom of the cup much too quickly.  They are generous with the sausage and it was full of bold flavor but not too hot.\n\nThe soups came with a perfectly round white roll.  The rolls (I had two, one with each soup) had a firm crust and soft interior.  They were perfect to dunk in the soup.  I am sure I violated every educate in eating but the rolls seems to be made for dunking.\n\nTheir bakery was full of every type of bread product you can imagine.  I watched a number of patrons order sandwiches made with Boars Head meats.  Each sandwich looked well portioned. \n\nWhen I decided to buy dessert they were just bring out a fresh tray of their pepperoni rolls... I had to try one since they were fresh.  They were so fresh you could not handle them.  Their dough was very good, I do not think I got the full enjoyment of this little treat because I was too impatient to let it cool.  I found most of the pepperoni on one side of the roll but that was OK because the fresh bread was good on its own.  I would suggest letting these little rolls cool a good 15 minutes before trying to consume them. \n\nI did buy two desserts, Scooter Pie, and Boston Creme.  The Scooter Pie was sold in twos and about the size of the tea cup saucer.    The cream inside the chocolate dessert was fresh, sweet and cold as these treats are kept in their cooler case.\n\nI could only eat half of one pie because it was rich, not too rich, just I was still planning a full lunch later in the day. \n\nI have not tried the Boston Creme yet but it looks great.  Tomorrow I shall find out about the taste.\n\nThey also offered brownies (I heard these are famous with the locals.  One local was complaining while I was there that they stopped making the Cinnamon bread sticks he used to love, he was lobbying loud and hard to get them return them to their menu), and cookies of all varieties.\n\nThis deli really is a carry out establishment.  The only seating is a counter facing out the front plate glass window and a few bar top tables (without chairs, as a I recall).  There are few full height freezers and refrigerators full of Italian frozen pastas, and soups.  They also sell all type of Italian dry goods and sauces.\n\nNext time I am visiting I will plan to eat a full meal here.\n\nIf you are close I would suggest you stop in.  I am impressed that they donate all unsold bread at the end of the day to charity.  If you buy bread at this bakery you now it is fresh!\n\nDoug F.'

S'Not much notable about this particular location except that it is really, really difficult to get in.  You can see it easily enough from the street, but actually getting into the store is a real challenge.\n\nSure, it is easy enough if you are walking, but who walks?  Recently the Charlotte metro area was ranked the second highest gas-guzzling city by Forbes, and surely we did not get that ranking by walking everywhere, right?\n\nSo if you are driving, you can either park in the driveway area, and hop up a couple of steps, which is probably the easiest access, or you can swing around back, and then down the alley-like hallway to the entrance, which is not obvious, but is probably the way most people will take, since parking in the driveway may not be the best approach.\n\nAs to the store itself - nothing out of the ordinary.  Service is average, food is average.  It is generally fairly clean.  Nothing else of note.'

S"I have walked past the Pink Olive for years, thinking it was a terribly expensive French Bistro. How wrong I was. \n\nSituated just round the corner from the University student's playground, George Square, Pink Olive is a great place for students to go to for lunch or dinner. \n\nIt was only fairly recently that I first visited this place and realised what I was missing. I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with their lunch menu as it had a good selection of different meals available. I had the carrot and coriander soup to start which was home made and had the freshest ingredients in it - yum! I had an aubergine pasta dish for my main which was even more tasty than my starter. \n\nThe portion sizes were really decent, as were the prices with most main meals priced at around \xc2\xa36-8. There is also a pre-theatre menu available which costs about \xc2\xa310 for two courses, which is again very reasonable. Sunday brunches are available, which are served most of the afternoon and include fully cooked breakfasts, scrambled eggs and, best of all, pancakes! \n\nPink Olive is probably not the kind of place you would go for lunch every day as it would get super expensive, but once in a while, it is a great place to go for a very delicious meal at excellent prices. Definitely worth a visit."

S"You need a good Chinese delivery wherever you go. This has become ours, in Madison. \n\nWe tried 3 or 4 others - including Rubys - and none of them could pass our litmus: it must be able to produce a decent General Tso's Chicken that isn't too sweet or gooey with a modicum of heat, the egg rolls must be fried in clean oil and we should never see canned vegetables. \n\nSo far, they have satisfied. The General Tso's is by far better than anything we have come across in Madison - and no, the chicken has not been spoiled for us. The battered coating before fry is not too heavy and the sauce has a little bit of heat. Personally I would like more chilis, but I realize that is an acquired taste. \n\nMu Shui style pork with plum sauce and pancakes has been fine, not dry and overcooked, and no sight of canned vegetables. Cold sesame noodles were the lightly dressed vinegar kind, not the peanut butter sauce kind. But they were fresh, not gloopy. Looking forward to trying other dishes on the menu but so far, it's been good. This has made us very happy, since we have always enjoyed Asian cuisines wherever we have lived (San Francisco, New York) and Madison seemed to have been devoid of decent Cantonese/Hunan/Szechuan style Chinese food. \n\nSure, it isn't Wu Leng Yi but it is quite adequate for those long work days when you get home and just don't want to cook. Delivery is always within 20 minutes even though they say 40."

S"when I'm in the mood for fake Chinese food this is the place to go.  Unfortunately they no longer serve pork so the char siu is no longer on the menu.  So disappointed about that.  i'm not sure why they no longer sell it because the employees don't seem to know themselves.  I do love the fact they offer free samples so you can see if you will like it before you order it.  I do wish the prices was a little cheaper but you can get 2 meals out of a 2 item combo.  Other than the no park, they seem to have good customer service and are very friendly which is a plus."

S'This place is horrible. I\'ve been in here a few times and every single time, the service is unacceptably slow and the customer service is really lacking. I went in there another time and not a single employee in sight. Wtf? It was in the afternoon so it\'s not like they were closed.  I could hear people in the back talking. I called out for someone to assist me multiple times. I waited there for 5-10 min for someone to come out and not one person answered me or even bothered to come out. What the hell is up with that?! Hello...I\'m about to spend money on your damn food and you ignore a customer?  Ridiculous. The owner needs to find some better employees because these people suck. I ended up leaving and taking my business elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE: I tried calling the store to see if I could get a hold of a manager to speak to.  The phone rang for a while before the phone was finally picked up...the person on the other line didn\'t say anything.  After I said "Hello?" the person just hung up without a word.  Seriously?  RUDE and UNACCEPTABLE.  How do you expect to run a profitable business with crappy employees like that?'

S"Time 4 Thai is a very decent Thai cuisine experience, in modern surroundings, and is also very conveniently located right in the centre of town, just off George Street, so you don't have to go far for your Thai fix if you've been loitering around the city centre shops.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and accommodating on my first visit here, and actually, at the time, pre visit to Thailand and consequential love for Thai food, I wasn't really that au fait with Thai cuisine at all. The eternally smiley waitress duly recommended what we should sample, so we ended up with quite a few different dishes, through wanted to try lots of different things, but also, mostly, because I generally have eyes bigger than my stomach. The Tom Kha seafood soup went down a treat, love it, and the Phar Goong king prawn salad was also tasty. \n\nThe specialism here is seafood, although there are several other options, and depending on what time of day you're in, you can choose from a 3 course lunch, business lunch, order from the a la carte menu or share one of the Thai banquet set menus. The interior of the restaurant is polished and immaculate to a tea, so this is very tasty Thai food, in an equally as delightful setting."

S'okay so I haven\'t yelped in a while and let me tell you I have a lot to yelp about!\n\nMy boyfriend and I went here on Sunday and got the worst service ever!!!! I actually called and complained about it to 2 different stores because when I called this Bell road store to complain they said there was no manager and the girl who answered was the girl I wanted to complain about so DUH I wasn\'t going to tell her my complaint so she could pass it on to no one so that is why I called the other locations which No one ever called me back soooo... we will never be going back here. \n\nSo on Sunday we went here and yes they were a little busy. Our order was taken within a few minutes and then we proceeded to the salsa bar which either the person before us made a huge mess or the thing hadn\'t been cleaned in a while. My boyfriend and I ordered the EXACT same thing... chicken taco plate, flour tortillas, mild salsa, add onion. Simple right??? Okay so the taco plates comes with a small bag of chips.... I asked him if I could get a small side of guac for my tacos- he then asked "do you want the 8oz size with chips"... and I told him NO... my meal comes with chips I just want a small side. (which I have gotten before and I think it was like 1.50 or so.) So me not paying attention to the receipt didn\'t realize that yes indeed he did (even though he asked me and I said NO) charged me for the 8oz with chips. Now like I said I just wanted a little guac for my tacos. Which not to mention the guac isn\'t really all that great. The tacos are good, the service is bad. \n\nSooooooooooooo anyways after we get our salsa we then sit down at a table to wait for our food. Pretty much every single open table was dirty too. Almost immediatly after sitting down a plate comes up in the window and is put under the heating lamp. About 5 minutes goes by and that same plate is still sitting up there. Okay so now the girl working puts that 5 min old plate in a bag and sets it there on the counter. And now about another 5 minutes goes by and a plate comes up in the window and she gets it and puts it in the bag with the old plate. And of course... my luck... it\'s our food! Okay now like I said before... we ordered the EXACT same thing! So now why did one come up in two minutes and the other take 10???  \n\nSo trying not to be rude but KNOWING that that 10 min old 5 minutes sitting in a bag food was going to be COLD.... I asked her "why did the one come up so fast and the other take so long and they are the exact same thing... isn\'t that one going to be cold since it has been sitting in a bag for like 10 minutes".... and she so rudely said "I DONT KNOW".... I don\'t know???? really????? are you kidding me... that was her answer. So I said again "isn\'t that one going to be cold"... I\'m sorry but I don\'t go out to get cold food... and she said again even more rudely "I DONT KNOW". Uummmmmmmmmmm I think that should have been the point where she had them remake the food so it would be hot or something. \n\nOkay so then back to the guac.... So like I said I had realized that he had charged me for the 8oz when I only wanted the small side...  So I then mentioned to the RUDE girl that "hey you guys charged me for the large side when I only wanted the small side".... and she said "WELL IT\'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME"... ??????? what really???? it\'s totally not the same. You guys are now charging me for chips when my meal comes with a small bag. yes it was a lot more chips then we usually get but the point is... We didn\'t want them! So then I mentioned to her that my meal comes with chips and that I didn\'t want to buy extra chips and then SHE TURNS AROUND... GRABS THE TWO SMALL BAGS OF CHIPS THAT THE MEAL COMES WITH, BASICALLY SMASHES THEM IN HER HAND WHILE SHOVING THEM AT ME, AND PRETTY MUCH SAYS... HERE\'S YOUR CHIPS. \n\nLike I said... the tacos are good - BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO COME BACK AND BE TREATED LIKE GARBAGE BY SOME GIRL. I am a paying customer that doesn\'t like to pay for cold food, be charged extra for something that I didn\'t order, call to talk to a manager and be told that there is no manager, call and complain to not one but TWO different locations and be told by TWO different locations that a manager will call me back and have TWO different locations NOT CALL ME BACK! \n\nWILL NEVER GO BACK!'

S'Located in the Orleans Hotel, this classy and colorful dining spot is a refreshing change from the endless buffets that seemingly connect one end of the Vegas Strip with the other. The cuisine is more traditional than nouvelle, with long-time Italian favorites cramming the menu. Among the dozen or so pasta options, penne with chicken, spinach, artichoke hearts, and tomatoes in a Parmesan cream sauce is a real standout. House specialties include eggplant parmesan, veal marsala, peppercorn rib eye steak, and a variety of pizzas in solo or family sizes. Portions are on the large side, and prices are very reasonable.'

Guac was alright but not enough to help the flavor of the tacos. The beans were incredibly salty and I probably wouldn't have been able to eat them besides the fact that the rice was incredibly bland and eating them together balanced them out a tiny bit.

S'Worst McDonald\'s ever. They will make you wait in the "Reserved Drive-Thru Parking" every time. What\'s the point of a Fast Food Drive-Thru when you have to pull over and wait afterward? This has always been an issue with THIS particular location. Supposedly, as legend has it, you are being made to wait in the reserved area so they can prepare \'fresh\' food....as car after car after car behind you drive-thru and patrons receive their food with ease? Think about it this way...when was the last time you could remember noticing a special waiting area at the drive-thru at McDonald\'s? Exactly, they aren\'t built in to all the stores. The fact that this McDonald\'s has multiple drive-thru waiting areas should be a huge red flag to anyone in a hurry. Keep driving, there\'s a better McDonald\'s just a little further down the road on Alma School and Guadalupe.'

S"I took my family here while we were staying at Great Wolf Lodge one night strictly based on the other 3 yelp reviews at the time (one 5 star and two 4 stars). The prior reviews are completely off base.\n\nEven though there's a kids menu, this place is not kid friendly and we should have known that when the high chair isn't tall enough to reach the booths. We were greeted by a less than enthused bartender/waitress who made us feel like she would rather be doing anything but serving a table of 7 (4 adults 3 kids) at 7 pm. This place is pretty much a straight up bar even though they have a food menu and tables/booths and the crowd that was slowly assembling there was there only to drink. \n\nThe signs outside said best wings and best burgers in Harrisburg. This town must not have any other quality restaurants because I don't know how they got these ratings. Granted I didn't have the wings, and they smelled ok, we all had a burger or fried seafood. The burgers were hockey pucks, dry and tasteless. The bread was grilled to the point of being almost stale and the fried shrimp was overdone and too crispy. We didn't bother complaining because we just wanted to eat and get out of there. I also ordred the onion rings as suggested by another yelp review, I wish I hadn't. The onion rings were greasy and almost all the batter had fallen off between the trip from the kitchen to the table.\n\nIf you are young, have no kids, and only want to drink - then this place is for you. \nIf you want a decent affordable meal then skip this place and head over to Concord for Quaker Steak, Cookout, or Jim and Nicks."

The selection is pretty good, and the caramel latte I tried was very aromatic.\n\nWhat differentiate Hestia is the service and the friendliness. It is rare these days to find companies that will be so focused on welcoming their clients in a warm matter. They take the effort to explain to you right off the bat, instead of you asking for information. Even saying "have a nice day" at the end does a lot of difference.\n\nAlso, they handle promotions like experts. While waiting for my drink, they gently talk about their buy 10 get 1 free drink deal and their free drink on your birthday.\n\nAlso, it\'s a cozy place where you can sit down and study or have a talk with friends.

S'Cinco de Mayo - you have to eat or do something Mexican on this day.  The BF and I headed to Viva El Taco to satisfy this Mexican craving.  \n\nI would say Viva El Taco is similar to the Roberto\'s Taco Shop chain.  The pictures and menu on the wall are mirror images.\n\nI went with the #5 Combination Plate (Beef Burrito & Cheese Enchilada) for $5.65.  However, I substituted the Cheese Enchilada for a Pork Tamale.  It also came with rice and beans.  The rice was kinda dry, and remain untouched, but the refried beans were pretty good with  melted cheese.  My beef burrito had chunks of tender beef oozing out along with peppers and the BF wouldn\'t stop eating my order.  The tamale was on the dry end though, and it\'s covered with cheese and sauce to make up for it.  I didn\'t bother finishing the tamale.\n\nThe BF had three Al Pastor tacos at $2.15/each.  He thought they were pretty loaded compared to what he gets from Roberto\'s Taco Shop.\n\nThe self service "salad bar" had fresh cucumbers and radishes to neutralize the heat from the chipotle sauce, green hot sauce, jalapeno peppers, carrots, and onions, and fresh green onions.\n\nThe gigantic horchata was pretty good too and is a must with all Mexican food.  \n\nOverall, Viva El Taco is another chain among the chains of Mexican food in Las Vegas.  It\'s definitely better and more authentic than a Del Taco or Taco Bell any day.  It\'s casual enough for a quick bite as well.\n\nSidenote:  They have coupons offering $0.99 bean burritos, three rolled tacos, beef tacos, and chicken tacos.'

The first time, the English muffin part of it was just about burnt to a crisp and inedible (leaving me hungry until lunch).  The second time, it was barely toasted and the cheese was cold (giving it a much much much less desirable flavor).  This mixed with kinda rude staff (for those I've dealt with) on both occasions and I'm not going to make the same mistake a third time."

Anyways, I know this isnt exactly fancy dining but I saw another person review it and I couldn't stand by and not have a word on this place. EPL is cheap and delicious, two things I love in a meal!!! Ive tried numerous items on the menu and almost all have been delightful. My favs are the pollo bowl with flour tortillas, the chicken tostada salad, and the chicken with a couple of sides. Their tortillas are really good, soft and warm. If you are going to get their sides, get either the pinto beans, mac and cheese, rice, or corn. I had the coleslaw a long time and remember it being dry and flavorless. Their churros are really good as well if you are looking for something cheap and sweet. Additionally, they have a salsa bar and all of the salsa's are very tasty. I especially love their house salsa and the verde avocado salsa. Other entree items that are good are the chicken taco's (though pretty greasy) and the green chili quesadilla. An item not worth getting: the classic chicken burrito. Kinda dry and sad. Haha. Anyways, if you have not tried EPL, you must!!! Its not at all like KFC and the food is fresh and delicious."

S'Salsarita\'s is by far my favorite of the "fast food, prepare it in front of you Mexican chains" (Chipotle, Qdoba, Moes, Taco Bell (if that one even counts)).  The Cotswold location is the closet to me so that\'s where I\'ll go if I get a hankering for their amazing chips and some tacos. \n\nThe food is always good and consistent.  I like the soft tacos (one chicken, one pork) and I love that they give free guacamole (lookin at you, Chipotle...).  The service is always pleasant and friendly.  I\'ve had their catering at church events and it is on par with their fresh preparation.  \n\nAlso, the new vinaigrette they have is INCREDIBLE!  I can\'t remember the title of it, but some sort of honey lime or something?? It\'s so good and adds so much to the tacos. \n\nOverall, I would pick Salsarita\'s over any of those other chains any day.'

S"The wife and I enjoy Carmine's Little Italy, and we've always been fans of Villa Pizza (which was started by Carmine and his family). After driving by this place quite a few times, we thought it was time to try it. We didn't dine in, but I did pick the pizza up. The dining room is clean, small, and cute and has a TV at every table. The staff was really friendly when I was picking up the pizza, and they even took the time to crack a couple jokes...which is always nice. \nWe ordered the vegetarian (minus the mushrooms). I was a few minutes late picking up the pizza, but when I got home it wasn't soggy and was still piping hot. The ingredients seemed very fresh; the tomatoes were very flavorful as were the onions, bell peppers and olives. What made the pizza stand out to me was the crust. As Clint mentioned in his review, it was thinnish, crispy and stayed crunchy throughout our dinner. I like crunchy crust, and typically only when I order thin crust do I get it. This was a nice exception. What surprised me is that the pizza doesn't taste like Villa pizza. Granted, since it has been many years since Villa went under new ownership, I thought maybe there would be similarities. Other than fresh ingredients, it was a totally different pizza...which was nice."

I like that you can get as many of any flavor as your want without an extra charge. My favorite sauces are the jerk and tequila lime.Their sides and burgers are really good, too. \n\n{EDIT} We went to wing night again last night and got onion rings. I can't think of anyplace that has better onion rings. They're not frozen, obviously hand-dipped. They even give you the fried crumblies. Holy moly, they were so good. \n\nNice staff, nice place.

The staff are really helpful and the ambience is great, very chilled.  There's a good range of types of spirits, beer, cider etc.  The place itself is bright and sunny, but for me the real winner is the food.  In a city with so many excellent restaurants, the Orchard stands out as one of the best.

My new meal (there just aren't enough in the day to try all these amazing places!)\nAnyway I was plesantly surprised by the unassuming outside and the contrast inside where it was actually quite nice.  The gaming area is totally seperated so that when you are eating you don't feel like you are at a gaming place with food, but rather a restaurant with some machines (if that makes any sense)  The food didn't disappoint either.  The waitress was attentive enough to notice that one of my friend's was killing his diet coke every ten minutes and always kept him supplied well enough.  The spinach and artichoke flatbread pizza was nice and light with a very unique twist of flavors for my tongue!  The Steelz brownie originally came out without any ice cream and we had to ask the waitress and she had to double check the menu to make sure that the ice cream did indeed go on it (minus one star).  However as soon as I had my first bite I could see myself having cravings for the super indulgent mosit chocolatey goodness that was coating my mouth.  I had trouble sharing it with my friends and almost ordered myself another one.\n\nThey were playing the football games of the day going on on multiple screens around the place.  I can't see it ever getting too busy and yet it should be with the unassuming exterior and fantastic food.  I think that once they get to know their own menu a little better the rating could've easily reached a higher star level.  (note this is not a date night place, but more of a sunday afternoon kick it with friends type place.)  fifteen bucks later my stomach and I are quite happy campers!"

The quality and taste if the chicken salads are extremely good, as is the pasta salad. On the negative side, this very attractive place won't last unless they keep their stock up to the demand (they were out of several types of chick salad, and could not sell any by the pound due to limited quantities). In addition, they were very slow, it took about. 20 minutes to receive my takeout order even though the restaurant was nearly empty.

Cheap prices, friendly service, and big heaping servings of comfort food.  \n\nMy favorite sandwich is the Club Classic, a triple-decker turkey club made with real roast turkey, not cold cuts.  Awesome.  Order a sandwich "deluxe" and it comes with a cup of soup (just get the chicken soup) and your choice of side (choices include friggin spaghetti with meat sauce!).  Otherwise they have great breakfast food all day, and big huge awesome looking cakes and pies.  \n\nExtra points for the bluehairs that seem to be in there every time I go there.'

S'Order to go!  Definitely authentic and they don\'t speak much English.  But the service is friendly.  They even let me try the barbacoa when I asked what it tasted like while looking over the menu.  The flavors in their tacos really come through.  Chicken tacos are spicy all by themselves, and the guacamole is very simple, mostly avocado and lime juice.\n\nBut I will throw in a few dings for the table seating which consists of metal fold up chairs, booth seats that are all torn up, and there was even a rusty nail sticking out of the side of one of them.  But the booths are still the best way to go if you insist on dining in.  \n\nThe cuts of meat could be a lot better.  This is not going to become a regular place for me because I\'m picky.  But I\'ll mark it down as an interesting experience and recommend it to anyone who wants to give them a go.  "You should try it, but it\'s not for me..."'

After fasting all night and into the morning, I am prime for some hot coffee and a great sandwich (sausage, egg & cheese mcmuffin)!  Service is always excellent and the store typically has a pretty good rating.  I understand (at least previously) staff members received a bonus every time they etched out a 100 or better.

S"Ti Amo is one of a few Italian restaurants in the Southside Newington area. Like Ciao Roma down the road, it attempts to pull you in with its use of classical/renaissance aesthetic, but this time with a contemporary, smarter, maybe more sterile, touch.\n\nThis restaurant offers a  fairly standard Italian fair food wise. The menu is large, but the food appears to be fresh. In all honesty I've only ever tried the vegetarian pasta dishes at Ti Amo, all of which have been decent, reasonably filling, but occasionally not as portionally large as other similar Italian restaurants (though my standards on this front are quite high). All the pizzas that my fellow diners have tried looked very appetising (and quite big) and I've only heard good things.\n\nI think I prefer Ciao Roma down the road. The place has an extra charm, particularly the staff, whilst at Ti Amo they are perfectly friendly and polite but lack a certain enthusiasm.\n\nOverall the place is definitely fine. And as others have pointed out, the meals never come to very much, even for multiple courses."

S"Zizzi's is an often overlooked Italian restaurant group, particularly with the dominance of this area by Pizza Express.  I visited their restaurant on Fountain Quay a couple of year's ago, and had a very enjoyable evening.\n\nThe location is the first aspect of this restaurant that is striking.  It is situated at the canal basin that marks the end of the Union Canal, which links Edinburgh to Falkirk.  This area was developed relatively recently, and befits the fashionable image that people would now associate with the Fountainbridge area of Edinburgh.  The building that houses the restaurant is primarily glass in construction, and this affords diners a great view of the canal basin and the moored boats.\n\nThe food is particularly good.  Prices are comparable to its competitors, and the quality of the food is great.  I was there as part of a large group, and never at one point did I feel that anything was taking too long, or did I impatiently have to catch the eye of the waiting staff.  The kitchen feels like part of the restaurant, and if you're looking hard enough, you can actually see your meal coming together.\n\nThis is a great restaurant.  It's a shame that it doesn't get more attention, and I would recommend it as a great meal out along the same lines as Pizza Express."

I guess they also forgot the something else.\n\nMy friend and I had been visiting our old haunts and taking pictures of each other in the lobby of the high we had graduated from in 1964. As we talked we harked back to Smoked Meat. We were not up to driving downtown, so we opted for this location, instead of the aforementioned Schwartz'.\n\nMy friend had the large smoked meat lean while I had the smoked meat platter Medium Fat. People don't order smoked meat lean! It can be dry and has nothing to do with execution, its just that!\n\nUnlike Heather the fries were piping hot, the coleslaw tasty, and the service non-pareil. The service alone almost pushed this up to a 4 Star.\n\nIf you have time go to Schwartz's or to Smoke Meat Pete's in Vaudreuil, but if you are in that area of the city and you need your fix, this will do well."

Their selection is modest but done well, and hits the spot.\n\nThe staff are qutie chipper and for something quick and easy, it's worth a look.

S"Baker's has been around for 26 years, and although I've driven past it many times when I lived there, I had never visited.\n\n\nUpon reading positive reviews on Baker's Cove, I made a reso for a Father's Day late lunch.  It's a small, cozy restaurant. The aroma when we walked through the front door was lovely.. garlicy with the scent of sea air.\n\nKarolyn, the owner, greeted and served us. She was friendly and had a bright smile. The menu is quite impressive, I knew what to expect from my research. Despite the great choices,  I knew what I wanted to order.  Classic fish and chips.Turns out our table all wanted the same thing, so we ordered the family fish and chips and ordered the battered mushrooms as an appie.\n\nFirst of all, you know when you've had really terrible batter? Or worse, you can taste how old the oil? Well not the case here. Batter is made in-house and is so light, and tasty. The oil was not an after taste in our mouths.  The fresh batter and deep fried shrooms are served with an in-house made dijon/dill sauce that was a perfect accompaniment.  \n\nFish platter came, it was awesome. FRESH delicious, light and not greasy. Not one drip of oil on my plate. Served with mushy peas and coleslaw.   The french fries were decent.. not the best I've ever had.  I would have loved to see them serve fresh-cut with skins on the ends. Like fry trucks, you know? The tartar sauce was fresh, homemade and in a squeeze bottle. Perfect for peeps like me who have no shame in covering a large portion of their plate in sauces and condiments.  \n\nOverall, I will definitely be returning and trying the maple fish with lemony potatoes and other delights on the menu. The seafood platter looks awesome too.\n\nKarolyn has a little hidden gem in this little mall and you should go check it out if you want quality seafood that's fresh and obviously cooked with love."

As the other guys have already said the spring rolls are terrible, but surprisingly the duck spring rolls aren't actually that bad. I have no idea how there is such a difference but Chinese takeaways are often a mystery to me. The noodles are average and for an extra 10p you can have them in sweet chilli sauce which is actually quite nice.\n\nOverall the food is pretty average and what you would expect from a takeaway but the thing that ruined it for me was the service. The young guy there is ok but the older woman is really rude and comes across as being really patronising. This was compounded by the fact that when I got home I realised she had written down my order wrong and I had a mix of what I wanted and another rogue dish. Grumble grumble"

You just don't know what you're getting with that stuff, and its really not worth putting your life on the line to find out.

Of course there are many other items on the menu from crunch-wraps to cinnamon twists, but the best part of taco bell is that this great variety of menu options is offered from 2 in the afternoon to 2 in the morning!\n\nSo if you want good, cheap, filling, food, you know what to do - RUN FOR THE BORDER!"

Okay, I order something else heavily modified because the lack of ingredients.  Again a few minutes later she comes back and says they were also out of that.  (It was a holiday themed meal, it's the holiday season, so now I'm a little miffed.)  So I order the same thing as what my husband has ordered, not really knowing what's in it, only knowing it has turkey and that's what I want.  \n\nThe food comes out in little spurts because now the cook is really confused, so says the server.  We split the first sandwich and by the time the second comes I'm done.  It was just too greasy for me.  Later on after waiting a while for the check we just get up to pay seeing if they could print out the check up front.  They were able to but it was wrong, still having what I had first ordered on it.  The hostess begins to fix it and at this time the server comes up and they proceed to get into an argument about it because of the mix up the server doesn't want to charge me at all and the hostess is just not going to let that fly. \n\n I didn't  care either way, it was nice of the server to try, but it wasn't like I was completely void of a meal.  Still eighteen dollars for two sandwiches seems steep for me especially at Denny's no less.  It's okay, this trip was a little off, but I've had better here before so I will probably be back."

S"Something terrible has happened to my little Tu Do. They once had the BEST food...now, it is embarrassing. I used to love their curry chicken soup. I would even make the drive just to get it when i lived far away. With memories of that curry chicken pho making my mouth water, i decided to go back again. I was a bit uneasy as I sat near enough to the kitchen to see that things here had changed. \n\nWhen i was near the kitchen before, i always caught glimpses of gleaming white floors and shiny aluminum... now, it looks dingy and disorganized. I tried to order my soup, and I'm not sure if they were out of the ingredients, or if it has been removed from the menu, but the result is the same. I didn't get any. \n\nThe meal i did get was horrible. It was swimming in oil, the vegetables were old and tinged with brown, and the meat wasn't even edible.\n\nI wonder what happened to the nice family that used to own the place.  It is so unlike the way it used to be that I can't even imagine that they are affiliated with it anymore."

S"Local biz? Check.\nFriendly staff and family operated? Check.\nHouse recipes and product made in-house? Check.\nQuaint interior that isn't over the top? Check.\nEven an open kitchen so you can watch roll out your pizza dough fresh! There is a cooler out front with a gratuitous amount of pastries. One thing I thought was awesome was the beer cooler. Plenty of single bottles and 6packs! Also, they have to-go lasagna. Take and bake at home. How cool!\n\nRullo Di Pasta has the potential to be something great and I believe they can get there with a few small tweaks to their pizza and wings. Where I'm a huge fan of any local place that makes their own dough, a feat not easily accomplished, it does come with some difficulties in the kitchen. Also, I'm a firm believer in a well-done pizza crust. \n\nWe went for a half four cheese and half veggies. It smelled amazing, it looked amazing, but the first bite was tell-tale for need of improvement. It lacked that well-done flavor. It wasn't even really cooked fully, in fact. The veggies were still raw, the cheese didn't have time to meld together and the crust was still entirely too doughy. The simple fix? Just leave it in the oven longer! I firmly believe that this would have changed the landscape of the pie tenfold. I'd definitely order this again if it were cooked better. The flavors are there, but just needs a temperature boost.\n\nThe wings...sub par. Again, I think these could have been cooked longer as well. They were a little limp and lacked all of the crunchy bits on the exterior. Also, the bleu cheese was pretty weak. Not sure if they make in house or not though. \n\nAll in all, this place has a great story and I look forward to trying them again in the future. I think with those few small tweaks, they can be cranking out great pizzas and wings! Cheers!"

S"I wonder how many of us remember the golden days of Soto in Montr\xc3\xa9al.  Before it opened a chain of catering business (which ultimately led to its demise), Soto on St-Laurent was the forefront of avantgarde sushi in Montreal.  It's been already ten years since then, the former chef from Soto is back here with revenge--- even more equipped with his ever so imaginative array of repertoire.  Better yet, the former kitchen chef from Sakura has also teamed up with him at Japon possibly to make this Ville St-Laurent restaurant the best Japanese eatery  in the city.    Their dishes (we had omakase for three) which included everything from kobe beef sushi to succulent ama-ebi shrimp nigiri, from mango sprinkled spicy tuna to the traditional codfish saikyo-yaki, are at least as imaginative and mind-boggling as Nobu in NYC or Sushi Ran in the Bay Area.  Japon certainly lives up to its name---fiercely modern take on contemporary Japanese cuisine."

S'I was downtown doing some record a shopping at Revolver Records and killing time before a Suns game when I remembered that Phoestivus was going on at the Phoenix Public Market.  I had been meaning to make it down there, but due to my career choice of Wage Slave (not as glamorous as it sounds) I hadn\'t been able to make it out to Food Truck Friday.  Food trucks are so hot right now.\n\nAfter perusing my choices of sustenance (BBQ, Hot Dogs, Po Boys) I found myself in front of a white and orange sparkly GMC.  It was the Sunshine & Spice truck.  I was intrigued with the options of stuffing rather traditional Asian fare into a burrito or taco.  The idea of teriyaki beef, or curry chicken in a California style burritos sparked my interest, but I settled in on a mushroom burrito, a pink lemonade, and apple pie wanton (oh, they joy).\n\nThe burrito was a decent size for the price, but it was when you started maowing on it that you discover that it is a hearty wrap of tummy stuffing awesome.  You know how sometimes you get a burrito that contains rice, that turns into a rice burrito?  Not the case here.  Plenty of killer to the proper amount of filler.  Speaking of filler, the mushrooms worked as flavor sponge for the soy marinade.  Tasty town.  The home made guacamole had a nice way of pulling it all together.  The wasabi sauce was really what drew me in to ordering the mushroom burrito in the first place.  It added a very interesting flavor that set it apart from anything in the burrito/wrap lineage that I have ever put inside me.  It was awesome... except for one bite where it kicked me straight in the sinuses.  If you have gotten a bonus glob of wasabi when eating sushi, you know how it will wake you up.  Woah.  Other than the one bite that went rogue, it was good gastro-times.\n\nThe pink lemonade was pink lemonade.  Wouldn\'t deserve a mention if the fiery redhead who took my order didn\'t ladle a few strawberries into my beverage.  Nothing makes you feel more like a man than fruit in your drink.\n\nNow we come to the best part of my food ingestion experience.  Apple pie wontons with whipped cream.  There isn\'t anything that you can fry that I won\'t eat (I proved that on a sex tour of the orient a few years back).  If a crab wonton raped a McDonald\'s Apple Pie from the 80s (not this baked crap they have been trying to pass off), this would be the love child.  Evidently, Goldschlager would be the god father, because this baby sparkles.  No, literally.  There was gold sparkles on my dessert.  I felt so opulent.\n\nIt reminded me of a Chappelle show skit.  I told the aforementioned fiery red head that they needed to add a tagline to the apple pie wontons of "it\'ll make your dookie twinkle," but I fear she dismissed my genius marketing.'

S"Big plates with lots of salad options and pretty tasty. The price is very good for the value. There is a lot of meat on the meat plates, and they do allow some customisation.\n\nIf you are gluten intolerant, be aware that they cook the rice with some noodles. They will let you swap it out for another salad, though.\n\nI like that their take out containers are recyclable. I always feel guilty throwing away styrofoam. And when I ask for no utensils or menu, they listen, too. That's nice. I try to put as little as possible into the garbage, and I like it when restaurants care about that, too.\n\nThey are under new management and just hired some drivers, I hear. Tonight my dinner got here in maybe half an hour. That was great. They've been slow in the past, but it seems better, now.\n\nSo yea, I am giving 5 stars. For cheap and fast lebanese, it's a pretty nutritious and non-greasy option. Their shawarma seems to have something a bit extra. I think they add a bit of fennel, and I like it. Their prices are great, and they don't tack on extra $$ if you need to change your plate because you can't eat wheat. \n\nDecent, tasty, relatively nutritious and cheap. Yup, no complaints, here."

This is more 80's than my grandmothers house. I could ignore the decor if the service was better. It was horrible. Our waitress came twice then disappeared.  Apparently she went home sick and no one else came to pick up our table for over 20 min. Smooth. So when we finally got our food, I was really hoping for greatness. I don't know why I was expecting good food when everything else wasn't.  I ordered veal with peppers.  17.99. I got less than a third of a pepper on my plate with 3 tiny, extremely thin, tough pieces of veal. It was supposed to be served with a brandy sherry sauce. Nope. It was a white wine butter sauce. The description also didn't mention the veal was scallopine. It was. Probably could of given myself a paper cut with these. The experience was awful, the service was horrendous, the decor cannot be unseen, and everything was a good 5 to 7 dollars over priced. Will never go back to this place again."

Pop culture...they coax you in with great deals, giving you as much food as you want, no complaints they have a "it\'s all about the customer" feel...they start to take over in popularity, everyone loves them, raves about them: they\'re healthy, they use organic ingredients, they are such big burritos!...but then a shift starts to take place...employees start to cut back on the good offers, not all stores, but some started to hesitate when you ask for more meat/beans, they bang the spoon a few more times to get just a little more beans or meat off....and then BAM! You\'re getting charged close to $2 extra for 4 more pieces of meat!! The extra charge for meat isn\'t even listed on the menu (but they do list the extra charge for their sucky guacamole). \n\nIn short, they took a great idea, watered it down, inflated the prices, and made their bottom line more important than customer satisfaction. \n\nPiss on you Chipotle and everything like you.'

The service was prompt and friendly, the portions were small but flavorful (hats off for excellent and tender veal), and the top floor allowed for people watching.  My one complaint is that if you ask for water, you're getting bottled flat water, so make sure to go hydrated.\n\nYou don't need to dress to the nines, but I'd recommend jeans, a polo and nice shoes at the minimum.

S'The Desert Oasis is a modern fine dining restaurant (well prepared food without the extensive use of expensive ingredients) run by the Culinary Arts school at Scottsdale Community College.  This is a top notch cooking program, and the students, supervised by excellent chefs, do the cooking and serving at Desert Oasis.  And they do it very well.\n\nYou will get a 5 course fixed price meal for about $21!  This will include a choice of appetiser, choice of soup, choice of salad, choice of entree, and choice of dessert.  There will be 2-5 choices for each.  The menu changes weekly so there is no point in reviewing specific dishes, but the worst of the ten that my wife and I experienced was good, and over half were excellent.\n\nService is genuine if not polished, partly because the servers will be or were recently the cooks, and they really care what you think.  I thought the pace was a shade fast, but it took 1 hour and 25 minutes for the five courses, so maybe we were just enjoying ourselves.  \n\nThe Desert Oasis is only open when school is in session, so it will close for the summer in May and reopen in October or so.  They serve three or four days a week.  The menus for the season are published in late summer.  You must make reservations way in advance, as the popular menus sell out almost at once.\n\nHere are some hints:\n1.  The Desert Oasis is on a reservation and no alcohol is permitted.\n2.  They used to mail menus out to people on their mailijng list but this is being discontinued.  Go to their website and sign up for email alerts.  That is about the only way you will know when they have opened up the new season for reservations.\n3.  There will be about six different menus which will be rotated throughout the year.  Pick out the one or ones you like and go early in the season.  You may want to come back and you will need to get those reservations in way ahead for most menus.\n4.  The restaurant has a sign out front but is hard to find.  It is on the Scottsdale Community College campus.  From the 101, take the third entrance (they are numbered) and go through the parking lot (lot H)  towards the North.  You will run into a building.  Look for the sign.'

It caters to employees in the attached and nearby office buildings, so it\'s open only for breakfast and lunch.\n\nThe long: Two words--Breakfast burrito. Fill a big white tortilla with a hearty row of "great way to start your day" (in other words, eggs, cheddar, and sausage--or bacon, if you want to celebrate another great porcine form), but don\'t stop there! Oh no. Push it over the top. This will make you smile at everyone you meet for the next 24 hours: throw that sucker onto a Panini machine. And please, don\'t forget the salsa. Sure, it\'s from a jar, but it\'s just enough red and acid to puncture the cholesterol you\'re about to coat your arteries with. The Reuben\'s another good get. Not the best, and it can get messy if you let it sit around too much, with the Italian dressing (that\'s right, I\'m no purist, and I\'ll take Italian if that\'s what there is) soaking through the bread, but it\'s a good stand-in when you can\'t stop by New York for lunch to get an authentic deli sandwich. They\'re more than willing to custom make a sandwich for you, top to bottom--just let them know. If you\'re in a rush, as I usually am when I run over there from my office, I call my order in, and it\'s ready in 10 minutes. The coffee is decent, though the recently opened Starbucks stole some of their thunder with their "big name" drinks (not necessarily with quality, and certainly not with value. \n\nThere\'s also a small selection of grab-and-go items if you\'re in a rush: baked/breakfast goods (muffins, cookies, rice krispie squares, brownies, bagels); packaged oatmeal with granola and sometimes fruit on top; packaged salads with a handful of different dressings; and a basket of fruit.\n\nThere\'s a breakfast and lunch special every day, as well as coffee specials, that make the place well worth visiting once in awhile.'

S"Was not happy with this location/most of the employees that I dealt with the past few experiences I've had here. I work in the area and on occasion stop by on my break for my dinner. I order my food to go always. I don't like how the new set up (order at the front/ pay) and then just wait around for the employees to stop talking with eachother and actually get around to getting to work and having your food ready. I think the old set up gave the employees behind the counter an opportunity to stay busy and give customers  the experience they deserve. The last few times I've been to this location in the evening, I've noticed only a few people actually being productive and the rest of the employees treating their job as a social event where they laugh, talk, and flirt more than anything else. I am still young enough to understand working and having friends, but when someone is being blocked physically from bringing me my food and he tries to walk around the other side of the counter (island) area and the girl runs over to the other side to block him again...All while I'm watching and waiting for my soup. She was treating it like a playground and  he seemed annoyed that she wouldn't give him space to do his job and he saw that I was waiting.  I saw a group of probably 5 people standing around in a circle chatting by where they make sandwiches, while only one/two employees was making food and one/two was at the register and there was a line of people waiting to order. There was also 2 employees standing by the drinking fountain.  I tried getting the tea I like and it was empty so I went to another type instead.  One of the two of them, then walked over and started looking in the tea containers, but didn't say anything to me or offer to go get more of the type I wanted. I honestly love the food (especially the soup), but  will try to go to other places instead just because of the immaturity of the employees, the lack of management presence (unless they were there and allowed that), and the overall lack in customer service in general. This makes me sad because it used to be one of my favorite places to go. The specific incidents from my latest experience was on Tuesday, October 14th in the evening."

S'I decided to come here because I found their coupon in my entertainment book, they are close to my office, and they had favorable Yelp reviews. \n\nI like that it is locally owned and operated. I enjoy spending my money in small business/family owned establishments. \n\nOne recommendation to the Deli would be to put up a menu board. Since it was my first time there I didn\'t know what I wanted, but I had to wait until I got to the counter to even look at a menu that was taped to the top of the counter. I felt pressure to order quickly because of the line behind me and they didn\'t seem to have menus available to browse while in line. \n\nI ordered the Clam Chowder Bowl and the Country Club with Pasta Salad. \n\nThe Clam Chowder was very good. Not amazingly spectacular, but average and I would order it again. Can\'t wait for the weather to get cold because knowing good warm clam chowder is near by makes me happy! \n\nThe Club was great! Fresh ingredients in the correct portions. Excellent flavor. \n\nThe pasta salad was just average. Pasta + a dressing. Good flavor, but I like "stuff" in my pasta salad. Maybe my portion just was missing the "stuff." \n\nI would definitely recommend this deli to others. I will be back to try more seafood menu items.'

Along with that, I got a double order of chicken alfredo pasta, buffalo medium bone in wings, buffalo medium bone out wings, double order of cheesey bread, and got a free order of breaksticks; just for getting the chicken pasta! It came out to rounding off $70. It was all worth it, cause them fambam ate all of it.

S'i\'ve never really went for pizza, it was always about that frozen custard! with cold season upon us, the takeout window is now closed and you need to head in for takeout. i was in the mood for more of that custard after finding out the place i wanted to try for mtl \xc3\xa0 table is full.\n\nnot to feel too weird, i ordered a takeout pizza (bari) to go alongside my cup of deliciousness. besides, to know if its good pizza, you have to do takeout when its cold outside. you know, to see if the crust will hold and still be good when warm/cold-ish. well, i have to say, besides the toppings being cold, obviously, that crust is still magnificent even cold! full of flavor and still chewy enough. i won\'t comment on the toppings as they are now cold and cold sausage, not the greatest thing.\n\nas for the custard, well, i got misled. when they first opened, i inquiry about putting all the available toppings together and was willing to pay for it which they said you definitely could. apparently, you can\'t do that now.. i was so going to pay for it :( anyway, still plenty good and hits the spot just right.\n\nnow excuse me while i go grease stefano for an "all the toppings" option!'

S'1.5, but I\'m rounding down.\n\nI ordered some crab rangoons and steamed beef and brocolli from Yen\'s. I am almost certain that one of the vegetables they steamed was rotten, because I had to spit it back out (it had a horrid sour taste to it). Also, the beef looked and tasted like rubber.... Overall, I was just very dissatisfied with the whole meal. I basically threw it out and for sure will not be ordering from this place again.\n\nSome other negatives:\n- The entire restaurant was empty. Because the restaurant is spacious, it made the emptiness seem that much worse.\n- There is a sign outside the restaurant that states "$5 for walk-ins"... Ok, what the hell does that even mean? So, if I placed my order on the spot instead of calling in ahead, then does that mean that I would have gotten my meal for only $5? There needs to be some clarification on that! Plus, it made me feel pretty crappy as I paid more than double that for my shoddy (aka. sh*tty meal).'

S"Traditional Scottish restaurant that does what it says on the tin. Old school dishes (game, beef, salmon) served in a traditional environment in the New Town. It ticks the box nicely if that's what you're after but hard to think of a reason to go more than once in a blue moon because it's exactly the same all the time.\n\nI had partridge for my starter which was mixed. The breast and the cabbage and bacon accompaniment were excellent, but the wee leg was charred beyond recognition. I couldn't get into it with cutlery and was forced to pick it up and take a bite . . . but I couldn't. Absolutely rock hard. Really didn't match with the quality of the rest of the dish and the quality of everything else we ate. Maybe it was just one of those things. The venison main was excellent though. The staff were nice, the place is very nicely turned out, if not quite as warm as it could be, so it's a good place that I would consider taking someone who wanted olde worlde charm, but there wasn't really anything to drag me back.\n\nAnd while having the restaurant downstairs is nice enough (although it blocks your phone reception...!), the empty upstairs bit that's open to the street is bizarre. A few tables and chairs with no apparent purpose, and you need to go up there to reach the toilet. Weird.\n\nSo I'm a bit torn on how many stars to give. Other than my cremated partridge leg, the food was very good, and it's a nice place, but somewhat meh at the same time."

S"Let me say that I normally only go here for an iced tea in the morning and sometimes the occasional bagel. This review is based solely off of the service. \n\nWhy I put myself through the aggravation is simple- there is never a line. Why? Because the people are rude. I did order a bagel one morning and after I ordered one of the counter girls asked me from across the counter if I could hand her an orange juice. Weird, but I complied with the request. She then took it and drank it! Rude. She then kept wiping her forehead with her gloves on- health code violation. \n\nI went here this morning just for the iced tea. The cashier asked me what I wanted and I supplied my answer. If she would have smiled I think her face would have cracked. I said thank you at the end of my transaction and she did not reply. The rudest thing a person in the service industry could do is not say you're welcome when you are being thanked. If you hate your job it's not my problem. Go work somewhere else. \n\nThe only reason they got one star is because, well basically you have to give them something. Plus I do like their iced tea."

S"Just found another favorite Vietnamnese restaurant of all time. My love for Vietnamnese food is extensive and undiminishing and the bo kho here won my heart many times over.\n\nWe came here on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm, we were sitted right away. Boyfriend's parents knew the owner, they were friendly and started bantering with us. (Too bad I can't understand anything) Deciding to be adventurous, I ordered bo kho for the first time. they came over with small pho soup (compliments of the house) first, what deliciousness, the light and clear soup with beef balls, the soup flavor is perfect, every spice, seasoning, herb and the bo soup base is on the dot. Then my bo kho came (with rice). How come I never ordered this dish before?! The flavor is incredible, the meat taste heavenly, mixed with beef tendons, skins and fatty meat, giving the extra tenderness and texture. The stew itself is brewed to the perfect flavor, PERFECT, there is no saltiness, heaviness, just the perfect blend of flavors dominating all of my taste buds. From the first moment, my taste buds started slaving away for the delishness of the food and entered a foodie trance. We had che 3 mau for dessert, the gelatin sugar, green jelly and beans, along with coconut milk (lactose free!), so refreshing, so delicious, so good.\n\nI'm in love with this place and with its bo kho. I'll definitely be back to try their bun bo hue, the other love of my foodie life. Sorry pho lien, I'm cheating on you with dakao."

S'It sounded like Bastard Noise or Merzbow was blasting through the speakers of the drive thru menu.  Same menu as you\'d find at any other 24 hour Mexican joint.  I only look at the burro section.  No \'Can i help you?\' or \'Can I take your order?\'.  Nothing like that.\n\nI just go for it.  "I\'ll have two breakfast burros; egg, potato and cheese.  And a bean and cheese burrito."\n\nNoise distorts out through the speaker.  I get the hint that it\'s rhythmically broken up into syllables.  \n\n"Hello?".\n\nMore noise.  Fuck it.  I pull forward.\n\nThe lady comes to the drive-thru window and repeats my order back to me.  She\'s basically got everything right.  The tip jar is a styrofoam cup taped rather shoddily to the drive-thru window.  She\'s not really sexy or young or anything but she\'s pretty.  I put a quarter in the tip jar cup thingy.  Our burros were $10.11.\n\nIt takes about three to four minutes for the burros to be wrapped, bagged and given to us.  My kids are pretty stoked.  The red salsa is pretty great as well.  \n\nThen it\'s on to Greyhound Park as we cruise Van Buren and sight see on our way to the flea market.  Saturday is beautiful.\n\nNote:  If you\'re at the drive thru window, don\'t look down.  It\'s full of old gum, straw wrappers, cigarette butts, gross spilled milk.  Trust me.  Eyes forward.  You\'re good.'

S"This could and should have been the world's most convenient chinese takeaway for me during my first year of uni. But unfortunately it was about as far from that description as you can get.\n\nI don't want to be accused of making any slanderous allegations, but to put a long story short I've got ill both times I've eaten here, as have my friends. The first time, I will admit we'd had more than was healthy to drink, and so we put our illness the next day down to that, giving the Chinese takeaway the benefit of the doubt. After all, it was the Chinese takeaway that had given us hot food at 00:30 after we'd left the pub.\n\nThe second time thought, we were a lot more dubious. The food was tasty, I will admit, but it's up to you if you're willing to risk spending the next two days in bed."

S'The best pizza in Waunakee\n\nWhile I wouldn\'t rate this as my fave pizza in the Madison-area (Salvatore\'s in Sun Prairie and the Greenbush Bar share that esteemed title), Zoe\'s serves up a decent pizza pie.\n\nI appreciate that Zoe\'s offers three crust options (Hand Tossed, Regular Thin or Cracker Thin) since the family and I don\'t share the same crust preferences .  From a textural standpoint, the crust at Zoe\'s has the right combination of both bite and chew,  I just don\'t find the same level of flavor as the crusts at the aforementioned Salvatore\'s and Greenbush.\n\nThe red sauce is better than average.  While it does not offer much herbal complexity, it does not have that "out of the can" taste.  There are four other sauce options (alfredo, BBQ, ranch and olive oil) if you are looking for something a little different.\n\nBesides the standard mozzarella, there are three other cheese options (fresh mozzarella, feta and cheddar).  My dad always mixed in a little cheddar one the pizza he made, so I utilize that option when I\'m feeling nostalgic.  Our household is also a big fan of feta cheese, so we utilize that option quite a bit.\n\nThe six meat options are pretty standard.  It would be nice to have a more upscale option like prosciutto.  Topping quantities are generously applied.\n\nThe same can be said about the 16 veggie topping offerings.  The are generously applied, but there are no real gourmet options.\n\nThe kids LOVE the garlic knots as an appetizer - I can take them or leave them.\n\nThere are a variety of pasta offerings, sandwiches and salads on the menu as well.  I have not given them a try yet, so you are on your own if you choose to wander off the pizza reservation...\n\nThe staff are friendly and the carryout pizzas are always ready on time.  Zoe\'s recently moved into a more spacious setting, so they now offer a dine-in option.  If you are looking for a good pizza in the 53597, this is the place you need to go.'

S"So I'm on my way out of town to visit family in california and I am a little low of gas and figure I better fill up before heading out. At the M casino near the edge of Vegas I see they have a gas station pretty much connected to the place. Noticing the Jack connected to the place I figure what the hell and decide to grab an early lunch. \n\nThe place is obviously brand new, the whole building is sparkling clean and everything is shiny. Nice photos all over the place from what I can only assume are old Jack commercials, very tasteful. They even have something that I have never seen at any other Jack, a cool new kiosk where you can order food without having to actually talk to anyone. Cool little device, but not all the necessary given how friendly the staff were. \n\nFood was pretty good, got a sirloin burger with a side of egg rolls (god I love those egg rolls). The egg rolls were a little over done but piping hot and I got everything extremely fast. All in all a good meal and good service with an excellent location just as you are entering or leaving Vegas. Gas was fairly cheap, food service was quick, and the employees were friendly."

The menu has some creative dishes, that wouldn't work for anybody on a diet. Lots of opportunity to add caramelized bananas on your pancakes or french toast.  \n\nService is hard to rate when the place was hopping.

S'I decided to take the family to RedBrick Pizza since it was so close to Cinemark Theatres and BassPro Shop.  Besides, it convenient location to where I wanted to be, I decided to stroll in with my family.  The decor was nice, it was lively, with background music, and the ultimate, a TV at every booth. My wife and I knew this was the place, that we could actually carry on a conversation without the kids meddling in our conversation.  We walked over to the counter, looked at the menu and decided to order the Chopped Chinese Chicken Salad, a Large Order of Chesse Breadsticks, and a Large Pizza, half Pepperoni and half Vegetable Gourmet.\nThe salad and breadsticks came first, in most places it comes all together...My kids ate most of the salad, however, we enjoyed every bit of it.  It was freshly tossed in an Oriental Dressing, only one word WOW! if the kids eat salad, please eat more.  The breadsticks were absolutely brilliant, hot, cheesy, and the right amount.   We waited just about two minutes after finishing those two items and magically came the pizza....It was phenomenal, thin crust, hot, and the right amount of ingredients.   Then after we finished, my little girl, decided to want to try some Gelato....(if you never had Gelato, go try it, it has less fat and CALORIES then regular Ice-Cream) it was a delight, mouthwatering, full of flavor in every bite....My recommendation WE ARE GOING BACK!!!'

The place seems to be well taken care of, clean, and nicely decorated.\n\nThere were quite a few menu selections to choose from.  Its a chicken and steak joint, and seems to have a solid selection of good food.\n\nI ordered the caddyshack basket.  This came with 3 chicken strips, fries and texas toast.  The chicken was HUGE.  I couldn't finish the whole thing.  My fries were hot and tasty, and seasoned perfectly!  You also get a choice of two sides to go with your entree.  I went with the BBQ sauce and ranch.\n\nFood was good and hearty.  I want to say it almost had a southern flair in there, and I liked that.  Worth checking out. Portions are huge, prices are totally fair, service was awesome.  Plus, if you get the putsys cup, and go back, refills on your pop are only a buck.\n\nThey also have steak items on the menu, which is awesome.  Great food at great prices. Wonderful atmosphere as well.  They even have a great outdoor patio to dine on as well."

The way i see it his in 30 minutes, in that joint of the city, you have very few choice and this one will get you filled up for 10$ max! The Spring Roll are ok too.

Wines were on the slightly dearer side, and food was averagely priced. It was however pretty disappointing, with my steak pie consisting of a stew of dry beef and a slab of blackened pastry on top - this is NOT A PIE. Chips were a bit meh too. Cullen Skink looked nice mind.\n\nService wasn't as slow as some other reviews have suggested, but was a bit sloppy (such as having to ask for a spoon for the soup). Oh and the wine had already been opened before being brought to the table, which you shouldn't do.\n\nIt's not an awful restaurant, but there's a wealth of choice down by the Shore that you'd be better off spending your money at."

S'I think this place needs to figure out whether it wants to be a nightclub, sports bar, Chuck-E-Cheese, or Italian restaurant. The ambiance has been taken down a notch since it was Hammerheads. Pool tables and arcade machines, and pool toys hanging from ceiling in the dining area - yikes. There was one kid playing a shoot-em-up game and another playing with the pool balls. Soft Italian music over the audio would have been much better than listening to the kids play, and the racket of the drunks coming in from the adjacent bar.\n\nWe showed up around 5:30 on a Friday night and there was only one other table being served in the dining area despite the parking lot being full (everyone was in the lounge). There was only one waitress working the dining area, and she was also working in the lounge. She was trying hard, but it was only her second day on the job. Both her and the bus-boy were dressed as though they were working in a dive sports bar, not a nice restaurant. Kind of a turn-off. She told us all the food and drink items on the menu were $2 off for happy hour, but that was not the case when we received our bill. Turned out only bar food was $2 off. (we still got happy hour priced drinks, though)\n\nAs an appetizer we ordered Calamari, and I gotta tell you, it was fantastic! Large chunks of tender squid in a very light, flaky batter, served with a nice boat of thick marinara sauce. Best calamari we ever had, for sure. Just wish it was a more ample portion.\n\nMy husband (it was our anniversary, BTW) ordered veal scallopine sauteed in a lemon sauce with artichoke hearts, mushrooms and capers. He loved it, although according to him, you really have to love lemon. I tried both a bit of the veal, which I thought tasted a bit "gamey" (guess I\'m not a veal person) and the sauce, which I didn\'t care for at all. I will definitely not ever order that dish.\n\nI ordered the Linguine Portofino, which was huge butterflied shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops (or should I say scallop, since I only found one in the whole dish) and squid in a rich tomato sauce served over linguini. I think the noodles (a generous helping)  were home-made and they were delicious, as was the sauce.  Both our dishes were served piping hot.\n\nCloser to 7:00 pm the dining room filled up more, and my husband and I definitely felt over-dressed compared to the other patrons and wait staff, who were all dressed as if they were in a sports bar.\n\nAlthough our food was very good, the people at one table kept returning their food items (maybe it was because they couldn\'t stand to eat it after one of the millions of black flies that were milling about the dining room landed on their food). Portofino definitely needs to do something about the flies, which made the atmosphere even less enjoyable.\n\nI\'ll give the authentic food a 4, the service a 3, value a 3.5 and the ambiance a 2. I\'ll go back, but probably to check out the bar entertainment and not for a nice special occasion dinner.'

S'I have never eaten inside this place and I probably never will... but call ahead and order your food and make sure they make it fresh... you will not be disappointed. \n\nBest deal in town or anywhere I\'ve actual ever ordered from for shumai (large pork/shrimp balls wrapped and steamed commonly seen served at dim sum dining. The owner makes them himself fresh, and order from them... they sell 62 pieces for $30. thats a deal! We tend to order from here whenever we have to go to potlucks or we need to cater an event. \n\nTheir cooking is fresh when you order from them, otherwise if you base it off the food they have displayed... it looks dried and old... but surprisingly when you get catering from them... they are hella generous, always give a little more, like free donuts. and when I order tray of lo mein from them... they don\'t just fill it to the rim... they fill past the rim and pile and pile the noodles in the tray and it\'s the foil that keeps from spilling out!!! they ain\'t stingy with servings here. \n\nThey have awesome fried cream cheese wontons... and they\'re cheap!!! 12pieces for $6.95 you can\'t beat that price, coz you order from Rice N Noodle (not to bash on them) but you get 4 pieces for $5 something I think... just saying. \n\nHonestly I would give this place a 1 or 2 star just based on the place and display of the place... but they really are a "Rice To-Go" establishment... order your shit TO-GO or by the trays so your food is bomb bomb and fresh!! and you\'ll save money than ordering anywhere else. So rightfully I have to give 3 stars for awesome affordable cheap pricing, good food when you order, and for the best LARGE shumai in town!'

S"The food wasn't bad per se. It's just the whole feel of the restaurant and the limited options of the set-lunch menu, which when they appeared were quite underwhelming, contrasted with all the other Thai places I've tried in Edinburgh, made me really think that Yes, I have experienced better (thanks for that prompt Yelp!)\n\nThe set lunch menu was \xc2\xa38.95. There were only two starter options (a chicken tom yum soup or veggie spring rolls). These two options are very...meh. Like VERY meh. Soup or spring rolls? What if you want just some good ol' fashioned meat. I couldn't help but compare it to the lunch deal I'd had at Dusit, on Thistle Street, which had 4 starter options all of which were much more exciting, and had chicken, beef, prawn tempura (three ways) or a vegetable option that wasn't pastry coated.\n\nThe main options also left a lot to be desired. And when they arrived the portions were small. My beef salad wasn't badly cooked, I ate it and enjoyed it for what it was. But I would have equally enjoyed, or maybe even moreso, a \xc2\xa33 sandwich from Marks & Spencers.\n\nWhen you go for a lunch out at a restaurant mid-week, it is something of a special occasion. And the lunch here was very forgettable. One of my dining partners told me she had heard rumours of exciting food on their a la carte menu, like beef spaghetti (?) And normally if I don't enjoy a lunch I will give the restaurant one more chance and go back to try the evening meal. But I also didn't really gel with the feel of the restaurant. As the same dining partner commented, it felt like a hotel lobby. All cold steel metals, hard edges and lacking in any ambiance. Bizarre music on the stereo.\n\nAlthough the staff were really lovely. Very attentive, smiling, eager, and trying very hard to please. It's just a shame that the food was limited in option, quite forgettable when it arrived and the ambiance did not tempt me back in any way."

S"Las Vegas friends: I don't usually make a fuss and blast a place but sadly my favorite Mexican food Don Tortaco has disappointed me. They failed to put all the food I bought into my bag. I discovered it at home of course. I drive back after a phone call for a refund request produced no results. They apologized, then gave me the food and asked for my card to refund it. They accidentally charged me again, and said they would cancel the transaction. They did not. I get home with the remade food and its terrible, I think on purpose. I have always loved their food and I couldn't eat this. I contacted them several times to talk to the manager to no avail, finally escalated to the area manager. He turned out to be a jerk too. I just wanted the $9.35 back that I was double charged. He told me to file a complaint through my bank. I told him I would make sure I told everyone I know about this poor customer service. I will also take this up with better business bureau. Sad. I also need recommendations for a New Mexican fast food, preferably with a drive thru. Customer service is key, as my friends have been pointing out, there are many other great Mexican food places in Vegas. Also my friends are sharing like crazy on facebook. Don Tortaco listen up! Its about customer service, not just the food."

Fu Lam was one of our favourite places for take out as well as dining in but I'm afraid we've struck them off our list.  One bad meal can be excused, two gives you cause for pause but three?

S'This is the closest sandwich shop to my house so I go a few times a month.  There is a Subway nearby, but I prefer the meat to be cut fresh for my sandwiches so this is normally my choice.  The wait for a sandwich is normally hit or miss, some days at lunch time it is very busy other times it is empty.  There is probably seating for 20-30 inside and often when it is busy there are many tables occupied, but I have never seen a situation where no tables were available.  The subs themselves are good, but a bit more expensive then what you will find at Subway, but I am willing to pay the extra dollar or two.  There are normally daily specials of 6 dollars for a regular sub, chips and a drink or 8 dollars for a large.  Although there is not much competition for subs around Starmount I think overall this beats the other chains for what is available.'

S'Bleh.  Atlanta Bread Company is one of those trendy "fast-casual" sandwich shops that were a big deal about five years ago.  Subpar soups, okay sandwiches, but by no means worth making a special trip.  The best thing I\'ve had there was a chicken pesto panini, but even that was simply average.  I can\'t imagine anybody would be excited to go here; the menu is very simple and the food doesn\'t even live up to its low expectations.\n\nThe decor is nice but the restaurant itself is far too large.  The last few times I\'ve gone there have only been a few other tables occupied.  The call-out-your-number style of picking up your food seems unnecessary given the usual amount of customers; I think it would be an improvement if they took the food out to you ala Noodles & Company.\n\nThe bakery is expansive but mediocre.  The cookies are large but I could make better at home.  I haven\'t tried much else from the bakery (I\'m too eager to leave) but I have no real desire to return.\n\nFinal verdict: Not bad, but don\'t bother.'

Steak sandwiches, as well at Fish, Ham and even tuna salad.  Or go with Burritos, Gyros or Pita Sandwiches.  And yes, that is a NY Steak on their menu.   But don\'t forget your appetizers - Chili Fries, Mozzarella sticks and Fried Zucchini.  Sheesh!  And their fries are SO good!\n\nReally huge portions too.  Especially for the price.  Expect to pay about $6 for lunch.  Yea, you\'re just going to sit on McDonald\'s style tables, but you didn\'t come here for the atmosphere did ya?\n\nSo far everything I\'ve had here is really good.  Even the gyros my friend got weren\'t too bad, though they weren\'t freshly cut.  Think "Steak-ums" with chunks of Gyro meat.  \n\nImportant note - While yes, you can use your debit card, their process basically works like an ATM Machine.  Order comes out to $12 - they will run it for $20 and give you back your change.  AND - it\'s a $1.50 fee to use it.  Plan to just bring your cash.'

I ate there for the first time a couple of years ago, and then again last Friday evening. I am not sure why it took me so long to go again (perhaps it is simply the distance from home) as the food is quite good! The food was quickly served by a very courteous waiter in a comfortable ambiance. For only $10.50, vegetarians (like my husband and I) can choose from several great menu options; I recommend both the Tofu General Tao, as well as the Tofu Curry with Eggplant. Meat plates take most of the menu however so if you are omnivorous, you will surely find something that will please you as well! \n\nWhile La Belle Tha\xc3\xaflandaise is not the fanciest Thai restaurant in town, it is, within its price range, a great location which offers both good service and good food.

S"There are many best of burger lists popping up on Yelp and other sites around town, and everyone is trying to interject their secret unknown spot to be included on the list. That's how I came across Upper Deck Grill and Sports Lounge, and it seems like people are really starting to fetch for a unique location to be included. I love places like the Dispensary Lounge, Badger Caf\xc3\xa9 and other off-strip locations, and get a little hesitant when they start entering tourist areas, so you can imagine my hesitation of walking into a golf center.\n\nThe lounge is in a loud, weird open space with a decent view of the golf course. There weren't too many people in there when I was there, but it still had the constant drone of chatter. The service sucked right off the bat. I didn't feel like sitting at the bar so I sat at a high top near the bar. This seemed to annoy the bartender as she had to come out to me while the other waitress chatted with customers and pretty much ignored me. I ordered an iced tea and she walked by several times before bringing it, and then took another 5 min before taking my order. I guess she thought I might be waiting for another person, but only brought one menu to my table so who knows. There was a weird mix of clientele from golfers, to random old people that clearly weren't golfing, to two guys discussing a poker blog next to me. The table of 4 old people waited for maybe 10 min before being brought menus, and had to walk over to the bar to get napkins when their food came out. Note that there were only a handful of tables full at this time.\n\nThe menu is quite large with all sorts of typical bar fare that I'm sure are nothing too notable being that no one has ever mentioned this place. The burgers start at $7.70 and include a number of free sauces and toppings, and plenty of others for 50-75 cents each. My burger had decent char flavor; it was quality beef and cooked close to the medium-rare I ordered. It had a good buttery brioche bun, but it got very soggy on the back half because of the greasy patty. The LTO and pickles were fresh, crispy and good, and my Swiss cheese was melted well. Overall this was a very decent burger given its plain looks and strange setting.\n\nThe steak fries were decent, although some were a bit too soggy and some completely undercooked and inedible. They were seasoned with a typical fry seasoning and there was just enough for my burger. My meal came to a very reasonable $11.13 considering this is a touristy destination located right on the strip, as well as the decent quality. If you're looking for something in the area I would probably go to Steiner's down the street for a slightly better burger, but if you're hanging out at the driving range you should definitely stop in on your way out."

S"So my father-in-law, my husband and I had breakfast here recently.  We were catching the train back to Ottawa, so there wasn't much selection at the Train Station.  The only things open that morning were Tim Hortons, Second Cup, Saint Cinnamon, that big place right near the main hall that is somewhat reminiscent of M\xc3\xb6venpick March\xc3\xa9 (sorry, don't remember the name) and Deli Planet.  My father-in-law wanted a sit down restaurant, so Deli Planet it was.  \n\nYou can't really mess breakfast up that much, so take this review for what it is.  I had 2 eggs poached, bacon, home fries, toast, fruit and coffee.  The eggs were nicely poached (not too runny, but not too hard), the bacon was crispy, the home fries were also crispy and much better than home fries at most diners, and I requested the toast dry and it came dry (hurray!  You won't believe the number of times I get buttered toast at restaurants, despite requesting dry toast!).  The fruit was a fruit salad with mostly cantaloupe and honeydew (the yuckiest fruits ever, in my opinion) and a few apples and grapes.  The coffee was satisfactory.  No real complaints from me (other than the yucky fruit salad).  My husband asked for his eggs over hard and they arrived over easy.  My father-in-law requested his eggs sunny side up and although they did arrive sunny side up, he said the yolk was a little too runny for his liking.  The 2 eggs breakfast was about $7 I think.        \n\nService was competent.  Decor is like a typical train station / airport restaurant.  \n\nNot a bad experience, but nothing that spectacular either."

The experiences have been a combination of fine, okay, and a few "that was really bad" experiences as well.\n\nFor starters, the food here is pretty consistent, and the menu itself is like every other Wendy\'s. I like Wendy\'s because I like a lot of their menu items, and I don\'t feel so guilty for eating fast food after leaving here.  Overall, the chain is great, but this location\'s kinda weird.\n\nFor starters, sometimes I\'ve come here and the place has felt and looked sub par when dining in.  For a while, the carpeting in their dining area looked filthy, and it grossed me out.  Now the carpeting is clean, so I guess they had to cleaned and de-filthed.\n\nOther times, when in the drive through, the service has been okay.  I remember one time I was here in the middle of the day (like 3 pm, so it wasn\'t a busy meal hour) and even though I ordered a single combo meal, they made me pull forward and wait with another car for them to walk my order out.  Um, I can\'t imagine why they would do that, since it wasn\'t really all that busy.  I ended up waiting about 5 minutes, maybe 10 in the parking lot with another car for my food.  This morning I saw a white van that went through the drive through and they were waiting as well for their food to get walked out.  Unless the drive thru people are trying to shave time off how long it takes them to get their drive thru order, it doesn\'t make any sense.  I wish it were more consistent in this area.  After having been to a few Wendy\'s this is the only location that has this bad habit in their drive thru and its kind of annoying. \n\nI will say, sometimes I come here and think, "this place is so dirty today and it took forever to get my food, I\'m going home and giving it one star." Other times I come here and everything is fine, and I think "ya know what? It wasn\'t so bad today, I\'m going to go home and give them 5 stars."  I settled on 3 because I figured it was a fair assumption of both the good and bad experiences that I\'ve had here.  Most of my complaints are in regards to cleanliness and wait times, not so much the food, because the food is consistent and tasty.'

S'I really wanted to hold off reviewing this until I had actually eaten there. However, the place is good enough that it deserves to be reviewed on it\'s own. Just keep in mind, I didn\'t eat there. But I did see the food. And I\'m SO going back for the food.\n\nI chanced into here based on a quick iPhone Yelp search for "wine". I\'d actually been looking for a wine store, so it goes to show you how much I\'d read. Upon arrival, my friend and I decided that even if we couldn\'t buy a bottle to depart with, the atmosphere was pleasant enough to stick around for. You know, for a glass of wine.\n\nWe sit at the nice dark wood bar and the bartender sweeps over. My friend was undecided on her choice and, on my suggestion, asked the bartender.\n\nThis was the best choice made that day. By anyone. Anywhere.\n\nThe somo....somma.....sumal.....wine guy asked her about her tastes and preferences (red, non-specific) and gave her a few tastes. A bit more conversation and he recommends going for the "Discovery" flight. This turns out to be a fantastic idea for her. A spectrum of red wine was put before her and she was left in a state of bliss.\n\nThe....wine guy turns to me and asks about my tastes (red zinfandels, the "real" ones, as I found out), but I\'m open to trying new wines. He thinks on it for a second and mutters a few possibilities while he looks at the shelf of wine behind the bar. Inspiration strikes, and he pulls out a pinot noir. Strange, but I\'ll go along with it. It was the damnedest thing, but if it wasn\'t a pinot noir that has a lot of the earthy characters that I love in red zin.\n\nSo that was how the night went. By the time I left there, with the good-matured feeling that wine gives you, I had been thoughroughly educated in all sorts of things about wine.  I actually even found out that the winery that sells one of my favorite zins has "sold out". Sad, but always good to know.\n\nIn short: Go here now! Sit at the bar with your friend(s) and talk to the (asks Mr.Internet) sommelier! and enjoy some fantastic service and, of course, wine.'

S"I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires."

S"On a whim and a strong recommendation from a friend of mine I went for dinner.\n\nI opted for the CHEAPEST entree on the menu which was the burger and fries.  It was excellent.  It was everything I wanted in a gastro-pub burger except of course the portion.  As my readers know I suffer from an eating disorder...  I HAVE TO EAT ALL OF THE FOODS!!!  I can't stop until it's gone and then I need more... and more... and MORE.\n\nSadly my finances were the limiting factor.  I would have loved to try an appy but the entree, 2 drinks and a coffee were all this starving artist can afford at a joint as pricey as this one.\n\nThe most remarkable part of the evening however was the house-made smoked paprika ketchup.  It absolutely blew my mind.\n\nI know I know... I can hear your disbelief.  The ketchup was that good.  It was amazing on the crispy delicious fries and it made the burger magical.  \n\nAnd no, I'm AN ORCHESTRA  musician.  My drug of choice is music/coffee/beer/food and nothing else.\n\nI will absolutely be back when I can afford another special night out."

Their soup and sandwiches look really good.  Their delivery hours used to start at 10 am and Zach would deliver early for us which was really nice.

S'I\'ve had a turkey club & fries here before and really enjoyed it. Today I ordered the open face turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes. It wasn\'t really all that yummuy. For starters, it isn\'t even that big. One piece of bread & only one piece of turkey on top. I would\'ve been a little more satisfied if there were two pieces of bread rather than one but whatever. The potatoes were good though. You can tell they\'re homemade with chunks of potato inside- just like my mom used to make. I finished the meal in under 5 minutes b/c of how small it was and waited awhile for my check. My server wasn\'t mean, but she did seem kind of weird to me since I first sat in the "take out" section. She kind of snapped at me and said to move down because the section was closed and pointed to the teeny tiny sign stated this. She was extremely friendly with other patrons but was really short with me.. blehh i dont know. I only come here like once every 6 months when i\'m over the normal downtown lunch fare.  I\'ll stick with the turkey club or their burgers. Two stars are for the other servers who seemed really friendly to their customers decent prices for lunch'

S'What a surprise THIS place turned out to be! My friend Brion and I were meeting for breakfast, and since he\'s from Vegas, he was picking. Well, the place HE picked wasn\'t open at 5am (which was when we were meeting) so I suggested the Kopper Keg because it was almost right across the street from where I\'d just made a delivery, and it looked "Open". \n\nI parked my truck around back (lots of parking at 5am!) and he parked right in front of the door. Perfect.\n\nVery quickly we were greeted my Sarah, a happy, friendly, and quick to laugh young lady who actually seemed to like her job. We got menus and made our selections. \n\nI opted for the Corned Beef Hash with eggs and toast. Oh, and country fries with it as well. Not sure what Brion ordered, but it was BIG, and he wolfed it all down.\n\nWhen my selection came, it was PERFECT! The hash was crispy through and through (just as I\'d ordered), and my fries were also well crisped - as I ordered. I\'m liking this place already! \n\nThis is a classy looking sports bar. There\'s TV\'s everywhere, so no matter where you sit you can see several. Each one has something else showing (football, tennis, golf, auto racing, baseball - you name it). I wish I lived near a place like this. I\'d go broke hanging out there. It looks like it\'s a lot of fun in the evenings when the place is packed. But for our casual, intimate breakfast it was fine. We had a few years of tales to catch up on. \n\nSarah made her presence known just often enough to refill coffee cups and water glasses. \n\nThe menu looks fairly well represented by all sorts of options. I think if you can\'t find something here to eat, you should just quit eating...'

S'I think it is clear that there is better mediterranean food in champaign (pasha) and probably also better diners (merry ann\'s) but my experience at pickles / papa george tonight was AWESOME.  There are so few times in life when an anticipated experience can live up to its imaginings, but when I sat down in that still-decorated-like-pickles restaurant and pulled out BOTH the old pickles menu AND the new, printed on paper, completely stylistically different greek menu, and our waitress came over wearing tan jeans and a tie-dye pickles tshirt and accepted our order for both a heineken in a frosty mug and a hummus appetizer, I almost lost it from the surreality of the situation.  \n\nIt was unique, in an awesome, awesome way, for example, when the manager went over to the register at the bar, printed out a mysteriously long length of receipt tape, handed it to one of the waitresses, and told her that that was the wine list with prices.  Or that the specials whiteboard up front (a remnant of the pickles days) proclaimed that the side of the day was macaroni salad, but that the dessert of the day was baklava.\n\nI kind of hope they keep it that way.  \n\nMy pork souvlaki was actually very good.  The bread, vegetables, and rice that came with it were less than fresh but I really can\'t take any points away from them for low freshness when they are trying to pull off two full completely non-overlapping menus.  We ordered a hummus and pita appetizer, and they kept refilling our pita until all the hummus was gone, which was awesome.\n\nWe also sampled from the pickles menu; my friend ordered the hawaiian chicken sandwich and claims that it was "actually really good."  Again, awesome.'

She said hers kind of fell apart, and she was keeping it together with ketchup. My biscuit was very solid and tasted quite good. The bacon was thick and plentiful, and the egg was fluffy without disintegrating. The coffee in both cases was piping hot, and I burned my tongue on first taste, but it made for good road sips.

S"We tried this place recently, by way of a celebration for my Parisienne girlfriend's birthday. The food was nice- but you'd think we were in France from the service we got! I understand they have the 'Fawlty Towers' experience here, but you don't expect it all year round.\n\nOn arrival we were greeted- or rather not greeted - by the man who seemed to be the proprietor. He was rude in the extreme- only deigning to acknowledge our presence after a couple of minutes, and then making us stand around some more while he fiddled with something behind the till- even though our table was sitting ready for us. Waitress service was fast, but they never once asked how things were, or offered a smile.\n\nDespite the above, however, the food was good, if not amazing. I had a starter of grilled goats cheese with chutney which was nice- but would have been better if it was warmed through. My main of a crepe stuffed with creamy spinach and mushroom filling was excellent, a lovely and rich with a well-made crepe. My girlfriend started with a seafood gratin and had braised lamb as main, both of which she reported were very good indeed. We finished with profiteroles, which were nice, but ordinary.\n\nI understand the place does some good deals on lunches, and if the food is all you're concerned with I can happily recommend B'est. But the service, combined with a slightly too bright/open atmosphere that makes things very slightly too cafeteria-like, make it hard to suggest as a relaxing night out."

S'Come for the food and stay for the people!  Semiramis provides a glimpse into middle eastern culture while filling you up with an amazing array of fresh, delicious homemade food.  \n\nWhile visiting family in Desert Ridge, and reading about Semiramis on Yelp, we decided to give it a try.  We arrived at 7 to a largely empty dining room but were warmly greeted by the new owner.  He retreated to the kitchen to make us some fresh hummus which was absolutely fantastic.  Rather than order off the menu he offered to create a "mixed grill" type of family style plate.  After a short wait, during which we polished off the hummus, we were presented with an amazing platter of grilled meats including chicken (prepared two different ways), steak (again, two different ways), veggies (tomatoes, pickles [totally unlike what you\'re probably imagining], sliced onion, and green olives [again, totally unlike what most Americans are used to...not at all like the pimento stuffed olives from a can]).  Fresh pita bread accompanied both the hummus and the entree.  Even my sister, who was admittedly a little skeptical when we first arrived, loved the food!  \n\nWhile we ate, some of the "regulars" began to drift in to share tea, coffee, play gin rummy, and socialize with one another.  It\'s was just as one would expect to see while traveling in the middle east.  Everyone was incredibly friendly, staff and fellow diners alike.\n\nI would encourage everyone to stop by Semiramis.  Is it a little rough around the edges?  Yes but all the more charming IMO.  I think you\'ll be more than pleasantly surprised at both their hospitality and the food.  If I lived in the area (rather than Wisconsin), I would be a regular at Semiramis!'

S'Even though I have never been to their actual mill at Queen Creek, I do love their olive oils and will purchase them whenever I see them at a farmers market or gourmet store. It was really cool to see that they have this store in UNION that has their full line of products. At least I think so. They had A LOT of stuff, anyway. I bought some of the spicy olives that they had available to sample since they were just so yummy and also after trying a handful of the dozen or so oils they had out to try ended up selecting the bacon and white truffle flavors to take home with me. YUM! I have already broken open the bacon olive oil to drizzle on some butternut squash ravioli I got at Sprouts and it was D-LISH!'

S'A new BBQ shack offering a variety of different sandwiches, combo plates, ribs, salads wings and more. You can also buy whole "family sized" meals and chopped BBQ pork or chicken by the pound.\n\nApparently by the name, the Ribs must be their specialty, though I opted for the smothered pork sandwich which was chopped pork with slaw on a toasted bun(see pics) Out of the 12 different sides I chose mac and cheese. \n\nI wasn\'t impressed with the mac and cheese, it was too processed for my liking but I did like the sandwich, the meat had a nice flavor and the slaw was crisp and refreshing.\n\nI would likely return to have that sandwich again. \n\nI\'m gonna go with 3 stars for now until I have a chance to try some more items, but all in all it was a good experience,service by friendly staff in a clean industrial shack dining area. \n\nLooks like they have a Happy Vally and Glendale location too.'

S"Normally I'm not one for fast food but I decided to stop in here on my lunch break to re-experience the Mexican-American fusion chain of my childhood. I was not disappointed. \n\nWhen I first walked into the store, I was greeted by a friendly and cheery guy behind the counter -- Clark was on his nametag -- and he took my order attentively. He seemed to be very customer-service oriented and interested in the overall quality of my lunch break. I could tell he really cared. One of the nicest people I've seen in a restaurant, fast food or otherwise. \n\nI ordered two half pound bean burritos -- bold, of course, where they add their signature crinkle fries and that oh-so-mysterious secret sauce I'm always craving -- and I received my food within minutes. Hot and delicious as always, it was truly a treat to eat here. \n\nWhile the food is similar to any other Del Taco location due to their standardisation, I can say that this store is set apart by the amazing staff. They all seem to be genuinely nice people and they are both service oriented and friendly. A really top-notch team of professionals that I've seen unparalleled in my dining experience. I think it was just as good to interact with them as it was to enjoy my food; they truly made my day.\n\nStore is incredibly clean and well-kept. Seems to be like a flagship store, the decor is modern but incredibly clean, and I can tell the store is exceptionally well-maintained. \n\nClark, and the rest of the Del Taco staff at this store, thank you for defining my eating experience. I'll definitely be coming back regularly."

And no muthaucking MSG!\n\nI ordered takeout from here and enjoy it so much I'm only talking in exclamations! Totally reasonable price! The staff on the phone and delivery were friendly! There wasn't a super long wait, I'd say around 35 minutes! And my Singapore rice noodles were DELICIOUS!\n\nThe lack of MSG meant I didn't feel sick after! Or have a headache the next day!

S"Before I get into the review, I just like to know why WEST Sunset Rd is simultaneously located to the EAST of E. Sunset Rd and also to the West!?  Who is the historical drunk and opium smoking individual or commission responsible for naming this road in Las Vegas, and why is this confusing anomaly allowed to persist?  Could it have contributed to the low test scores of Nevada education system and the general dismal geography knowledge of the Silver State?  \n\nThis is the burgers and hot dogs restaurant inside the updated local casino now called Wildfire Sunset.  The fact that the internal atmosphere inside the casino and thus Wildburger does not reek of aged cigarette is reason enough to bump it up a star.  Plus it looks clean, the staff does a good job clearing tables as guests leave after their meal, and even the plastic beverage cups look refreshingly new, all contribute to a positive guest impression.\n\nThey have a simple menu.  And is operated like a fast food restaurant, where you place and pay for your order, and wait a few minutes while the kitchen prepares your order.\n\nFor the late night and early morning crowd (11pm to 1pm) they offer their breakfast menu (Build Your Own Omelet, Bacon & Egg Platter, Pancakes, and their Wildburger Signature Breakfast Bowl).  $5-$8\n\nThey also serve hot dogs (Chili Dog, Giant Hot Dog and Giant Bacon Wrapped Dog).  $5-$7\n\nHowever, I will go out on the proverbial ledge and hypothesize that most are there for something from the burgers and sandwiches portion of the menu.  You can build your own or order one of the pre-conceptualized burger combo.  The cashier told me the most popular is their Classic Cheeseburger, but they also have The WIldburger (basically the Classic + their signature coleslaw), a Cajun Turkey Burger (if you don't like the red meat) or a Crispy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich.  $7 and up, depending on how many toppings and sauces you want on your order.\n\nThe Classic Cheeseburger was decent.  Loaded with veggies and 1/2lb Angus beef patty, and comes with a side of fries or onion strings.  The portion is large enough for all except amateur competitive eating contest hopefuls and beyond.\n\nChicken Wings and Boneless Wings with 9 flavor options.  $0.75 each when ordering 8pc, or $0.66 each when ordering 12pc or 15pc.\n\nTwo Salads selections, in case you are in the mood for some crisp fresh salads.\n\nDesserts selections are limited to Deep Fried Twinkies and their Made From Scratch Ding Dongs.  I tried the DF Twinkies mainly to see what it taste it, and can officially cross it off my bucket list.\n\nIt is a decent spot to grab a bite when you are keeping yourself entertained at this small local casino.  If you are in the area, by all means drop by, but with Wildburger locations distributed in various parts of Las Vegas, it is not reason enough to go out of your way to hit up this spot.\n\nSummary:  Inexpensive food that is decent, served in a clean and pleasant environment by friendly & helpful staff.\n\n3 + 1 stars!\n\n(This review is subsidized by Groupon Featured Deal)"

No frills, No problem.\n\nWe work in the same building as this Deli and when I am crunched between meetings, I run down here and get the Greek Salad with Chicken on top. It's really fresh and the dressing is a balsamic that is yumtastic.  The serving is huge too - no skimpy salad.\n\nIt is super fast service, you can be in and out of there in 15 minutes including sitting down and eating. If you just want to pick up and go, that is even faster.\n\nGood range of soups, sandwiches and salads - items come with a side and a fountain drink. They have fries, coleslaw, chips etc.\n\nI always have the salad and dine in or take out - it's always fresh and fast and about 10 bucks total including a tip.\n\nIf you work in town - this is a good spot - parking here might not be possible - it's a foot traffic location really.\n\nI just saw on someone else's review that they serve breakfast all day - I do low carb, so an omelet mid-day, Yup.. i will do that on my next visit.\n\nLots of booths and tables too - so finding a seat is not a problem. They have TV's running and I should mention that they do discounts for Military, Police and Firefighters - so that is great too!"

S"For sandwich chains, it doesn't get much better than this. They slice the meat and cheese right in front of you, bake the bread in house, and they keep their veggies fresh and crisp. They offer what are more or less the standard options for meat, cheese, bread, and toppings, so what separates them from the competition is the quality. The meats are all fantastic, resembling the cold cuts you would get at a legitimate deli rather than those from a fast food sandwich shop (like Subway for example). This is about the only corporate sandwich place that I trust enough to actually order the tuna salad. The cheeses are also quite good, and they offer smoked cheddar as an option, which is sheer genius. Bread options are a bit limited compared to some places, but it's always been soft and delicious, with just enough tooth to it to be satisfying. The exception to this is the sourdough, which I find to be a bit too dense and chewy a bread for a sub like this. The toppings choices also offer nothing unexpected, but they are generally fresh and tasty. Usually, they give you a pretty good helping of the meat and cheese, but they are often a bit stingy on the veggies. You can hound them for more, this gets annoying for everyone involved. Still, given the price, it's one of the best options out there for a good sub."

S'My wife and I are vacationing in Montreal.  She\'s from  San Francisco and knows good veal which is hard to find in Los Angeles, and I love to cook. While cabbing in to town Sunday evening from our airport arrival, we passed by Bis on the way to our Hotel at the Ritz Carlton.  We both love Italian and figured this might be a nice alternative to the French bistro leaning environs. The crowd at this indoor-outdoor restaurant was all the convincing we needed.  Sunday we dined at a seafood Bistro which was lovely, Monday at Bis.  In a word, spectacular. My wife craves good veal and loves truffles, so she opted for the veal in truffle cream sauce..  To quote her, it was "orgasmic, and the best dinner shed\'d had in years". She raved all night, including to the owner Aldo, who graced our outside table with several visits to chat. My pasta di mare was loaded with clams, mussels, shrimp and a whole split Maine Lobster served over al dente angel hair  pasta in a light red sauce,, equally spectacular. Desert of profiteroles, and ice cream served avogato (expresso slowly drizzled over a scoop) was all perecto!  Dinner was so good we have canceled a fancy restaurant reservation and will return later in the week so ny Mrs.  can have her veal again not withstanding so many other wonderful sounding items on the menu. Stay tuned for the the update, although we fear not.  Upon our return to our hotel, the Concierge asked how it was and advised many other recent diners had also raved.'

S"Too funny, first of all Julia S and I set out today to use my coupon book and where do we end up? Cafe International with no coupon. We get way suckered into fun. We just can't help it. Julia S told me she wanted to go to Cafe International because taxis were always outside, little did we know  some of the Cafe International family drives cabs.  A man with a Carolina Cab jacket sat us and gave us menus.  I loved this.\n\nWe sit down to a crazy, festive little restaurant, with a bar and a tiny room off to the side with a pool table. Very interesting. They stay open till 2a and serve food til midnight. So if you need get your injera (Injera is a yeast-risen flat bread with a unique, slightly spongy texture.) on before midnight, this is the place.\n\nWe shared a veggie plate with salad, greens, lentil mush mix and a potato, carrot, onion mixture. I have to say, I loved it, it's quirky and comforting. If you haven't eaten Ethiopian food, you don't get a fork, just go for it, scoop up everything with the blanket of bread and most importantly, the food is served on the injera, start with the injera with the food on it. These are the best bites. Don't wait til you are full to start enjoying the most perfect bites.\n\nIt was also very inexpensive, our lunch was $10. I have been craving Ethiopian food for two weeks, you would think that I had my fill, it's really just unleashed the beast. I want more."

S'Just found out this burrito shop opened recently near my house, so I had to give them a try.  According to the manager, they\'ve been open for about 6 months, and their thing is "no fat" meats.  My girlfriend and I got two chicken burritos... one super burrito (with sour cream, guac, etc.) and one regular one.  Both were very good, and definitely felt healthier than your other hole in the wall Mexican restaurants.  Unfortunately, they\'re only open til 9pm, so I probably won\'t be frequenting this place as much as I\'d like to.  Definitely a nice friendly vibe here, though.  Recommended.'

They serve breakfast all day which is great, sometimes you just can't make the breakfast cut off at other fast food locations, especially after a night in Vegas!\n\nI had my heart set on breakfast, but ended up getting a grilled turkey, bacon sandwich which sounded pretty tasty. It took awhile to get our food considering the place wasn't packed at all. My husband and I were both pretty disappointed in the sandwich, it had some gross sauce on it that we both did our best to wipe off. Yuck! Totally ruined the sandwich.

S"Well it appears South Queensferry is a right wee source of buried treasure.\n\nAlready a fan of the Hawes Inn, I might never have discovered the Raild Bridge had Jennie and her folks not recommended it to me. \n\nIts glass front looks out onto a tremendous view of the Forth and its Bridges. A good start... and it only gets better from there.\n\nAs happenstance had it, we chose a rather inopportune weekend to hit Queensferry as there were all manner of fundraising activities on the go down at the waterfront. This subsequently meant that finding a parking spot would be a feat worthy of fundraising in itself.\n\nNot wanting to spend all our time searching be for nought, I ran in to see if there were any tables available. Not only did the gentleman inside confirm he had space for us, he would also hold onto the table until we found a space. Legend.\n\nFrom our table on the upper floor we were gifted a grand view of the restaurant via its impressively wide balcony area. The artwork and Rail Bridge memorabilia all over the place were a constant source of conversation and entertainment, my particular favourite being the illustration on the wall depicting John Fowler and Benjamin Baker demonstrating the cantilever system.\n\nThe food was gorgeous. I started with the Stornoway Black Pudding and Chorizo Salad (see the photo, that's an order!) although the term 'salad' seemed to be a formality. What I was presented with was the best cut of chorizo I've ever had from a restaurant. The dish was a work of art, combining two of my favourite foods and tasted as good as it looked. For mains I chose the Railbridge Burger, 100% Scottish beef topped with MacSween's haggis and melted cheddar, served in a ciabatta bun and with chips and slaw. Oh wow. The bun was brilliantly soft and the burger, so tasty. Not often I eat a meal slowly because I don't want it to end... certainly not a burger.\n\nStaff were flawless in their courtesy. It seemed as if everyone who worked there was a personal acquaintance of the owner and didn't want to disappoint.\n\nAll reasonably priced, all reasonably excellent!"

What I do like however is that the decor and use of space is always a bit different in each one( here we have quotes from the Prime of Mis Jean Brodie-perfect for the location, and the food, whilst a chain restaurant is always tasty and satisfying. There are always deals available on the internet, and it is a good place to go with a crowd.\n\nIt's great to have somewhere else to go locally, and I can see myself being a frequent visitor to this branch although I like the George IV Bridge one too. My doughballs, Giardiniera pizza and truffle ice cream were yummy and I managed to finish the whole lot in no time. \n\nMy highlight of this branch though were the young and extra enthusiastic staff, who were strutting their stuff to James Brown in between courses. Excellent entertainment, The interior works well with the fabric of the building ( a former church) it doesn't feel too corporate.\n\nSo yeah, Pizza Express, you always deliver and I am a fan. You should be too."

S"01.24.13 UPDATE: I've heard that La Lumiere has stepped it up since my August review and a bunch of my friends love this platce. As soon as I go again, I'll update my review, hopefully adding some stars to the walk!\n\n08.30.12 REVIEW: really wanted to love this place. Around the corner, fresh vegan food, grassroots feel, crayons for the kids, courtyard in the back, nice people, etc.\n\nPerhaps four years ago when this place opened it was really nice. But there has been zero attention paid to physical upkeep. Now, what I can imagine was once funky and cute has devolved into dilapidated and careless. Tables were falling apart with nails sticking out of them, courtyard actually backs up to a bunch of garbage bins/dumpster which stinks, etc. \n\nFood was slow, but decent (probably a three). However, with places like Aux Vivres down the way and Panthere Verte around the corner, well, I think La Lumiere needs to  try harder. A week of scrub-a-dub clean-up and refreshing could have that place back in effect.  \n\nRating Scale:\n1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  \n2 Star: Risky at best. \n3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.\n4 Star: I eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible.\n5 Star: I'm comfortable taking other chefs here."

S'ON. POINT.\n\nLatin American food that isn\'t super heavy and salty.  The food was actually very light and bright tasting.  \n\nWe were in for a late dinner so we didn\'t want to be overwhelmed with anything too heavy.  We wanted something light so we both opted for fish.  I had the open faced Papusa with with fish and my Husband had the fish tacos with a side of patacones.  \n\nBoth dishes were delicious all the way through and the sauces only made things better!  My husband loved the green salsa which he said it tasted like it had fresh avocado with a slight kick from the jalapenos.  He also said it was slightly sweet.  The papusa with fish was also very delicious.\n\nAfter we walked out we both said "That was perfect".  We only wish we came at a better hour so we could have ordered more then we had because we both wanted to try more.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly and helpful.  El Rincon Tico has now become one of our default "go to" restaurants.\n\nI can\'t wait to try everything!'

S"I mean its a McDonald's, so expect McDonald's type of food.  \n\nThe only reason I am reviewing this sub-par McDonald's is to note that their breakfast burritos suck.  \n\nI don't mean to make this personal, but whoever they've got back there may be an expert at flipping burgers, but doesn't have a clue about rolling burritos. \n\nOn a positive side, they support the local area by having different community events such as McTeacher night in which teachers from a local school volunteer for a few hours with proceeds going back to schools.  \n\nIf you have to go here for breakfast, stay away from the breakfast burritos!!"

I had beef w/ broccoli....Very, very tasteless. I can't overstate that. Broccoli was like it was steamed and not cooked with the beef. The sauce was watery and had no flavor. The beef was tough, undercooked, and had no flavor. I'm hoping their food will get better once they settle in. There were no carrots, onions, etc., just broccoli and beef with steamed white rice. I wasn't happy with my meal. The soup was tasty.....But not enough to save this meal."

S"My second time at Khalil's was just as delicious as my first! The food is excellent. The staff is friendly, professional, with prompt service. We ordered the mezza platter, a dish with samples of bubba ganooj, hummus, feta, and other tasty items, all artfully aranged on a large platter. It could almost be a meal in itself. Delectable, and a real value at only $12. Next,  I had the chiken/lamb kabbob a la carte, because i didn't want to overstuff myself. The lamb was very good, and the chicken was excellent. Even though it was not ordered as a meal, the kabbobs came out on a nice bed of greens which gave a great presentation, also it rounded out the meal nicely. We had beer, but should you want anything else, there is a full service bar there, as well as coffe, tea etc... I would definately recommend Khalil's to someone looking for something different in the burgh. I always forget about this place, and am reminded that I need to work it into my regular rounds... the decor is a little dated, and definately not upscale, but I'll take friendly mom and pop over upscale snobbishnes any day, especially when the food is this good!

Nach einer Wartezeit in diesen R\xc3\xa4umen stellte sich heraus, da\xc3\x9f er mich eigentlich in Hartmaiers\'s Villa Watthalden erwartete. Beide Lokalit\xc3\xa4ten befinden sich in einem gemeinsamen Komplex mit dem Hotel Watthalden. Das sollte man bei einer Reservierung unbedingt beachten.\n\nNachdem dieses Problem gekl\xc3\xa4rt war, erwartete mich bei Hartmaiers\'s ein sehr aufmerksamer Service, fast intimes Ambiente und eine feine Men\xc3\xbckarte. Das Menu "Hummersuppe mit Mummermault\xc3\xa4schle" und eine "gebratetne Barbarie-Entenbrust im Gew\xc3\xbcrzlack mit Schupfnudeln und winterlichem Gem\xc3\xbcse" waren superlecker. Das Gem\xc3\xbcse hatte Biss und Geschmack, w\xc3\xa4hrend die Entenbrust auf den Punkt rosa gebraten war. Au\xc3\x9ferdem wurde ohne Nachfrage So\xc3\x9fe nachgereicht. Die Weinauswahl und das leckere Dessert rundeten das tolle Geschmackserlebnis ab.\n\nDie Wartezeiten waren angenehm kurz und das Preis-/Leistungsverh\xc3\xa4ltnis war angemessen.

S"Sandhu is situated on Papineau and Mont-Royal just to the right of La Tulipe. This neighborhood has a very busy nightlife with restaurants, bars, cabarets and nightclubs scattered all around the place. Sandhu is not expensive at all (surely if you compare it to other Italian restaurants in general and other restaurants in Plateau-Mont Royal area in particular). It is the BEST value for money restaurant in the whole Plateau-Mont Royal neighborhood. It isn't a BYOB restaurant but we didn't order wine and ended up paying around $50 for two persons (entree, main dish and dessert for one with two spoons :-) tips and taxes included)\n\nThe front facade of this restaurant is all glass so I'd recommend getting a table near it. It's basically if you were eating on a side-walk but were isolated from all the noise, dust and exhaust emissions. Their dining-hall is pretty big and you don't get the crampy feeling that you get in most of these Plateau restaurants (real-estate is at a premium in this area).\n\nOur waitress was very nice and cheerful and the service in general was very efficient. I chose a soup as entree while my friend went for their hot garlic bread with cheese. For the main course I went for stuffed veal escalope with sauteed vegetables while my friend ordered a 4-fromaggi pizza. Both of these items were very delicious. The pizza was of a very good size and my veal portion was huge. With all our soup and garlic bread entree already inside us, we weren't able to finish the main course.\n\nFor dessert, there was Tiramisu which was excellent and then espresso to finish the dinner.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see the bill which was below my expectations for what we had ordered (this resulted in a hefty tip for the waitress hehe). A very good experience. If you're in the neighborhood give this restaurant a try, you won't be disappointed (don't forget to make a reservation though)."

S"I had the pleasure of eating here a few days after my horrible wait staff experience at Restaurant Portuscalle just a few doors down.  The service and food quality was a thousand times better at Casa Minhota!\n\nThe dining room has lovely hand painted tile all around.  There were about 6 tables of small groups and one huge table of about a dozen patrons all served diligently by ONE WAITER!  Everyone got their food at a very reasonable time.  Everyone had full water glasses, bread and olive oil, dessert menus.  This guy was amazing.  He was even humming and whistling the entire time.\n\nWe started with the chorizo which was delicious and prepared very well.\n\nI ordered the house specialty grilled chicken which was very tasty and juicy.  The accompanying salad was lightly dressed and fresh.  The potatoes were crispy and flavorful.\n\nMy fiance ordered the filet which was served on a very, very, I mean magma hot, piece of slate or some other type of rock.  The steak was sizzling as it was set on the table, and continued to sizzle for quite some time.  The steak was done medium rare but continued to cook on the table.  The stone remained hot through our entire dinner.  I even heated up some of my leftover potatoes on it.  It was great.  You could literally cook the steak more to your liking if you don't like your steak a little red.  \n\nThe wine choices complimented the meal perfectly.  It was such a pleasantly different dining experience from the other place down the block.  When back in Montreal, I would definitely eat at Casa Minhota again."

S'Stayed here for 2 nights in August. Road-tripped to Vegas to see Dropkick Murphys play at The Joint at HRH. Wanted to stay at HRH, was WAY too expensive, and began to google nearby hotels so I could walk (stumble, whatever) back to my hotel room and not have to pay for a taxi or the monorail. I found this little hotel, recently re-modeled, with cheap rooms through Expedia or Travelocity. The ratings varied from fair to good, so I figured "why not?" since I\'m tired of Travelodge and it was, literally, across the street from HRH. Let\'s break it down...\nPlus...\n+Good service\n+Offered food and cheap bucket-beer and pizza combos. Never ordered anything, but reviews said it was worth the buy\n+Mini "Rehab" pool party during the afternoon at big pool. Live DJ, bar, etc. Bouncers very friendly to hotel guests. Again, didn\'t go (I don\'t like drinking when there\'s kids around), but seemed nifty.\n+Several pools on property\n+BIG room, basic cable, 2 A/C units that worked wonderful, living room, minifridge, microwave--all included with any room booked\n+Bed was actually fairly comfy\n+Short 5 minute walk to the best little liquor store on Harmon Blvd\n+(For my purposes) HRH adjascent\n+Walking distance to several fast-food joints\n\nMinus...\n-Auxillary pools could have been cleaner. Leaf debris, ew.\n-Auxillary pools music could have been playing a little louder\n-Pool chairs were seriously old. Fix it\n-Close to airport. You can hear the planes...I managed to tune it out, so not that bad, really.\n-Recent remodeled rooms still needed some touch-ups\n-Parking was a little crappy at times\n-East Vegas, 5-min car ride from strip; definitely not walking distance\n-Far from Vegas nightlife (unless you wanted to be ripped off by HRH clubs)\n\nWe had a pretty great stay. I\'m a really picky traveller, and this trip meant a lot to me. I\'d totally go back here. Their minifridge kicked the ass off the one I had at the LHC Travelodge for Tube Float. On a parting note, there was a flash flood and a huge electrical storm on the last night of our stay. We took our kitchen chairs and alcohol outside and watched from the stairwell as lightning struck the strip. Instead of disciplining us, they said: "Rock on!" and allowed us to enjoy the humid night. \nOh, and if you\'re silly...they have huge frogs on the property. Fun to chase.'

S'If ever I return to Edinburgh, and I really hope I do, I\'ll be sure to set aside time to revisit Daniel\'s Bistro.  Thanks to Lonely Planet, I found myself taking the bus out to Leith to walk the water and check out the Royal Yacht Britannia.  Whilst there, I was unable to resist the magnetic lure of Daniel\'s famed "La Tartiflette" and the exotic appeal of Scottish-Alsatian food.\n\nThroughout my meal, I "hydrated" myself with the house white wine, which was both delicious and reasonably priced.  I complemented the wine (or is the other way around) with the Scottish Chanterelles special appetizer, "La Tartiflette", and Daniel\'s Bread and Butter Pudding.  These would reveal themselves to be wise choices indeed!\n\n1. Scottish Chanterelles - I don\'t remember how much I paid for these, but no matter what I paid, these were definitely worth it.  These were some of the best mushrooms I have ever had the pleasure to taste, and I savored every buttery bite!  It was a generous portion of locally-sourced chanterelles pan sauteed and finished with butter.  I practically licked my plate.\n\n2. "La Tartiflette" - This dish came recommended by Lonely Planet as great comfort food.  The dish consists of sliced potatoes topped with creme fraiche, reblochon savoie cheese and bacon lardons oven cooked to a very crisp finish.  As you might imagine, the elements of the dish combined into the most decadent and delectable rendition of scalloped potatoes ever.  The richness of the fare was very slightly (and almost comically) offset by a small side salad. \n\n3. Daniel\'s Bread and Butter Pudding - When it comes to eating, I usually go with the "if you\'re going to sin, sin royally" approach, and my meal at Daniel\'s was no exception.  The bread and butter pudding was the perfect sweet counterpart to the caloric opulence of "La Tartiflette".  My willpower crumbled and I found myself decimating the whole serving.\n\nMy entire meal, complete with appetizer, entr\xc3\xa9e, dessert, wine, tax and gratuity totaled \xc2\xa327.10, which was very reasonable for the caliber of innovative food and remarkable service.  Daniel\'s was a worthy choice for one of my limited meals in Scotland, and I left the restaurant into the inky, chilly evening with a happy stomach, a slight buzz and a smile on my face.\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: After the meal, I tried replicating the chanterelles at home many times, but the magnificent sparkle of Daniel\'s version left mine deep in the shade'

S'Great social environment! I saw people here playing chess to just chilling alone on their laptops. I came here and no place to sit; sat by 3 strangers and became good friends with them at the end of the night. Great hookah, really affordable and really friendly staff. A high recommendation from me to anyone. There are lots of hookah lounges back in Cali., and this is probably better than more than half of the ones i go to back home. 5 stars! Will be coming back :).'

S"I've been here twice and thoroughly enjoyed myself both times.  I recommend if it's your first time you try the pizza because they do make a good one.  They use a wood-burning oven which in my opinion makes for a great crust!  I also like how they keep their pizzas fairly simple like the Italians do.  \n\nIn the antipasto department I've tried polenta with mozzarella, walnuts and figs as an antipasto.  The portion was a bit too big considering there was more food still to come and I wasn't too convinced by the figs and walnuts but that was more a question of personal taste. \n\nIf you're looking for a good plate of pasta then try the pappardelle with wild boar ragu.  The meat was quite tender and the pasta was cooked slightly al dente the way I like it.\n\nThe last time I came I had a nutella ricotta torte for dessert which was delicious.  It wasn't too rich and they got the portion size spot on.  I also tried a mouthful of my friend's raspberry panna cotta which also would have been a good choice."

It's a nice place to meet a friend for dinner and a glass of wine.\n\nThey do takeout orders, but it often feels like too much work. Many nights, there is a crowd of regulars at the bar there. When you walk in to get your takeout and head to the bar in hopes of finding someone who can help you, the regulars just look at you like you're in the wrong place. \nI'm pretty much always pleased with the food, but it shouldn't be a daunting task to pick up an order on a Tuesday night."

S"I love Butternut Squash! It's a fantastic little cafe just off the Portobello promenade and offers an extensive cafe menu. It's nothing fancy and doesn't need to be - sandwiches, paninis, baguettes, burgers, lasagne etc etc. There's also local art on the walls for you to take a peek at.\n\nEvery time I've visited the food has been very good, the staff friendly and smiling and the place busy and bustling. I usually sit outside to eat lunch, but now the weather is turning it looks like I might be relegated to the seats inside.\n\nLast visit saw me tuck into a huge plate of food for a fiver or so. A baguette with bacon and brie, complete with side salad and chips. It was served on a slate (personal bug bear of mine!) but aside from that my lunch was just lovely. Just what you need to refuel after a hard morning's slog through the charity shops or a wander along the beach ;) \n\nMy cafe of choice in Portobello - I always try to swing by here to grab a sarnie if I'm in the neighbourhood. It reminds me a lot of the Clock in Dalry - but the Porty equivalent!"

Their location on 7th street was only a short drive from the Union WorkSpace (The Construction Zone, ltd.) where I was working that day.  It is hidden in an office building, and I would recommend looking on google maps before the drive.\n\nAfter purchasing the deal, I ordered the Pastrami Panani, 2 cookies and a drink.  The order was ready when I arrived and the owner was pleasant and sincere.  I will definitely order from them again soon.  Maybe even today?  It's after lunch and I haven't eaten yet...."

He told me the food was good however a bit price. In the Bonsecour Market (March\xc3\xa9 Bonsecour) this place is IN the tourist spot. It's a culinary experience in a Nouvelle-France (New-France) decor. The services is done in old costume as well as in Old French. The tourist will be charm by the music, the complicity and the fact they scream at each other without breaking the Etiquette of Table manners. ;)  even if they don't get a word of what they say their act is fun and entertaining.  There're Table d'H\xc3\xb4te menus and \xc3\x80 la Carte menu. Both are quite expensive. The food is well done, recipes were search by owner to fit a Nouvelle-France Menu and adapted. The biggest issue is that it's a bit expensive. I had the biggest Table d'Hote menu, couldn't finish my meal 'cause I had made a raid on the exquisite homemade bread earlier and drank 2 pitchers of Cider. So make sure you're hungry and if you bring your kids,  maybe get the \xc3\x80 la carte menu because a Table d'hote will most likely be too much. My tab? 5 pitchers of cider, a Trou Normand (Calvados), most expensive meals of the menu ; 230$ with tip.  Normal people: 70$ per person"

S"Not wanting to wait 35-45 minutes for a table at Grimaldi's my friend Devin and I decided to wander the streets of Old Town instead. We were in search of other food when we found Jac's down the street, accross Scottsdale Rd. I was surprised as it used to be Nello's and looking in, there were plently of empty tables. It was sprinkling and we were feeling adventurous so we decided to go in. \n\nThe interior was calm and warmly lit. something I like. There were the now obligitory flat screen TVs but thankfully they were on mute. There was also a piano in the dining room and even though I asked him to play a little something, unfortunaly he wouldn't! (cheap guy!)\n\nWe had the house White Zin which was good and came with an adjoining mini carafe, nice for only $5! We ordered and began to wait.... and wait... and WAIT!\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, our appetizer came. great crustini topped with the usual caprese suspects: fresh tomato, fresh basil, olive oil, balsamic vinagarette, but what made this pop was the melted fresh buffalo mozzerella cheese! Melty, sorta gummy and very yummy, it made me mad that I never thought of it before... yeah, some foodie! Never thought to melt the effing cheese! \n\nWe wolfed that down and talked a bit and waited paitently for our pizza. This resulted in another waiting game. There were three tables full... and about five people at the bar... what the HELL?! We waited  25-35 minutes for our pizza. Our server brought us some bread, which was appreciated but still... that's a bit of a wait. My guess is that they burnt it and had to remake it. The wait made them lose a star.\n\nBut when it finally hit the table... almost all was forgiven... almost! The blanco pizza with its mozzerella cheese, fresh basil, ricotta cheese and our requested sausage. Was simple and simply wonderful. It was gone in a heartbeat not just because we were starving (from all the waiting) but because it was so GOOD! it's so good I would order this pizza to go and cuddle up on the couch while watching a tearjerker all by myself... not because I don't want to cry infront of others... but because I don't want to share... THERE I said it! \n\nWe ended the meal with some tiramisu. It was creamy and coffee-y. I don't know if I'll have it again, I think I'll try another dessert next time. Over all, it was good. I'll go again, if I have spare time to waste or good company like I did this time. To my yelpers I say: if you're not willing to fight the lines at Grimaldi's give this place a go. You'll have a good meal for a good price."

S'Baguette To Go is yet another sandwich bar located on Clerc Street and this one probably laps up most of the custom.  The entrance and interior are open, light and inviting whilst the service is efficient and friendly.  I came hear at least once a week in my first year and bought a variety of fresh baguettes and paninis.  \nThey have a wide selection of ingretients ranging from cold meats and coronation chicken to quality brie cheese.  Moreoever, they serve a special breakfast menu in the mornings which consists of sausage and bacon rolls for \xc2\xa32 which is indicative of the value of the rest of the rest of their service.\nAfter buying your baguette, panini or even baked potato you can either eat on the clean (verging on sterile) metal table and chairs inside or take away.  Baguette To Go offers great service at a more than reasonable price.  Well worth a look if your in the area and after a tasty lunch.'

S"Thank goodness for Yelp so I knew what to order here.  I smartly went with the ribs dinner with sides of mac n cheese and yams.  Everything was about as good as it could get.  \n\nPlease don't judge this place by its appearance or location.  You'll know you're there when you see the big drums where they are cooking up the ribs and chicken.  However, you may smell that distinctive smoke flavor in the air well before you make visual contact.  When you go inside it's a simple lunch counter with a few tables.  Inside it is very hot and smells like the inside of one of those drums.  Everyone was friendly and patient with me as a first-timer.  \n\nI admit, I had a Google Offer that was about to expire or I might never have heard of this place.  My certificate was good for $12 and my meal was around $10.  I wasn't worried about the difference but the young man behind the counter told me to grab a drink so I'd get my money's worth.  I went with a can of Hawaiian Punch.  Great customer service along side some legit BBQ.  Can't beat it."

S'Been looking forward to visiting this resto in the Laval location with several friends since it was announced.\n\nEsthetically the place is very chic and warm.\n\nVisited the resto during lunch on a Tuesday and we ordered our respective meals quickly and efficiently. Our server Daniel was great. Super friendly and had plenty of time to chit chat with us. I had their Mongolian beef and it was DELICIOUS. I recommend this meal to anyone. Not spicy at all but will provide you a party of flavor in your mouth.\n\nVisited the site mere days later for a Saturday Night at 7 PM and it truly felt like I walked into a different resto. Firstly, their location makes parking a nightmare. I didn\'t opt for their valet parking which led me to look for parking for a quarter of an hour and a 10 minute walk. The next time, I\'m definitely going to be taking their valet option for a few bucks.\n\nWe made reservations for 6 at 7. They called earlier in the day to confirm. All was swell. We get there at 6:50, we\'re all there only to be given a pager and informed that they will page us when our "reservation" is ready. \n\nRidiculous.\n\nWhy accept and confirm reservations when you can\'t respect them?\n\nThe pager rang at 7:25. So with a reservation, all present, we needed to wait 30 minutes.\n\nGreat start!\n\nMoving on...\n\nWe sit down and the service we got was definitely not Daniel quality of a few mere days earlier as we waited on our waitress for a duration of close of 3+ hours. \n\nFirstly, we didn\'t get a chance to place our orders as she completely forgot about us for nearly 40 minutes after being sat down.\n\nWe did eventually order and my friend and I shared some warm sake which was a delightful experience and the spring rolls were good. Not great, good.\n\nI ordered the KUNG PAO chicken (marked spicy) and it was somewhat spicy. Tasty but no where close as good as the Mongolian beef. However, it was still well worth it.\n\nBut before I got to eat all of this, we had to wait another hour.\n\nSo let\'s recap this. \n\nWalked in at 6:50, sat down at 7:25. Ordered at 8:20, got our food at 9:15.\n\nDid I mention we were STARVING?\n\nThey tried to make amends with us by providing the 6 of us a free plate of their cheapest appetizers. Of all the options we could have been provided we got the steamed green peas. MEH.\n\nOnce our dinner was done, we ordered their famous "GREAT WALL OF CHINA" cake. It was decent. Nothing \'great\' however. :)\n\nAll in all, if my visit was limited to the Saturday night experience I\'d have given a worse score to this resto. However, if I were to go back, it wouldn\'t be on a Friday or Saturday night and limited to the day where hopefully I\'d get some level of service as the food in general was good. The mongolian beef resigning supreme.\n\nKindly note that the plates tend to be kind of pricy.'

S"i've lived down the road from Elbow for years and yet only just made it here the other weekend with some friends to try out their sunday roast.  Elbow is a cool wee bar in a sort of random location.  it's right across from a school on the cross roads of broughton road and bellevue road, so not exactly a location that gets loads of passerbys.  however, with the quality of their food it seems they have no problem attracting customers!\n\nalthough the intention of our visit was for sunday roast, i was tempted away from this by their burger which a previous yelp reviewer had said was pretty awesome.  i added blue cheese to my burger and awaited it to arrive.  food took awhile since we were a party of 10, but i sipped my large glass of red wine while waited and enjoyed the company.  finally though, food arrived and my burger was placed in front of me.  once adding some mustard i cut my burger in half and took the first bite and wow!  this was probably the best burger i had ever eaten!!!  it wais moist and flavourful with the blue cheese melted perfectly and mixed with the mayo and tomato relish each bite was probably even more delicious.  to top it off i had a pot of skinny fries cooked to perfection to eat along with my burger, which put me into a very happy sunday food coma.\n\nalthough i was starting to feel full from the burger, i was well tempted into dessert and went with their berry crumble.  it came in its own little ramekin with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  this was a seriously tasty crumble, very berry tasting but not overly sweet and the vanilla ice cream was super vanilla-y and good.  perfect way to end the meal!!\n\nthe only small negative i found about Elbow was that our waitress seemed a bit surly or put off by our large party.  i'm not sure why as we weren't rowdy and made sure to be polite and also there wasn't really many other people in the bar besides us.  not sure if she was just having a bad day or didn't particularly like the look of our large group, but it would have been better if she'd had a smile on her face instead of seeming annoyed by us.\n\nsurly waitress aside, the food in Elbow is seriously good and i am definitely planning to head back here for another burger!"

S"Many of you would never know this place exists.... it is located in the basement of 1700 W. Washington.... The State Capitol.\n\nConsidering it is a cafeteria... it is really pretty great.  Each day has a menu of the hot foods and then there are the standards of salad bar, sandwiches and grill food like burgers, grilled cheese.  They even serve breakfast!  If you can get out of the office at 9:15am (only 45mins at work for me at this point)- I recommend the breakfast burrito.\n\nThey also have fountain sodas, yogurt, candy, snacks, string cheese, yogurt, gum.  It's  pretty darn great and convenient if you work by the capitol."

First off, I do not venture out to the west side too often but my fiance and I were visiting with some good friends so we decided to grab a late bite to eat.  The only place we could find open was Cocono's.  The staff was a bit strange, like quite possibly on muscle relaxers??  We asked 3 times for water and our appetizer was forgotten and the server was confused on why we never got it?  Maybe b/c she never brought it out?  I dunno.  But surprisingly the food was really good!  I had the Beef Machaca and it was delicious-- this is why I gave 3 stars.  The food was good.  The service was not.  It could have been because it was pretty late to eat dinner and they all popped some muscle relaxers right at 10pm so when we got there about 10:15, the pills were kicking in.\n\nWe had a pretty good laugh about it though and the night was still enjoyable b/c the company was good, we had some drinks and we enjoyed the food."

Terrible service, their tea had soured, and the food was incredibly poor - even for waffle house. \nI decided to give it a second chance, and in hindsight that was my first mistake. They were slammed when we got in, and we're not greeted, and almost walked out. But saw one open booth and decided to take it. The waitress apologized for the wait and took our orders. \nMy problem doesn't lie in the customer service we were given; she took care of us quite well. \nThe food, however, is a completely different story. The toast was cold, I had shells still in my scrambled eggs, and there was a hair in my hashbrowns. Never again."

DQ in general must be the most overpriced place to go for fast-food considering the quality and quantity you receive (aside from the blizzards).  Jennifer T. is right about the fact that this specific location has a limited meal selection...I was hoping for a burger and ended up with a sandwich the size of the palm of my hand. To top it off I was charged for a large Orange Julius fruit Smoothy instead of a medium, and there was hardly any fruit in it, so it tasted like the syrupy orange sorbet base and not berries.  Although, I should note the server was friendly and the place was very clean. Unfortunately, I came for food and not the ambiance.  The highlight was the piece of bacon on my meager club sandwich.  I got a crappy smoothy and a tiny sandwich for ten dollars; I will not be back here ever.'

S"If you haven't had fried chicken at the soul food connection then you haven't had fried chicken.  They cook it up like they invented it!\n\nExpect steaming moist crispy perfectly spiced breasts and wings, tender corn bread to soak up the sauce, and gooey baked Mac and cheese to show you how it's meant to taste.\n\nWhile many soul food spots are just rib shacks with a grill, a counter, and bare walls, this has plenty of seating, jazz posters, cozy wallpaper and framed newspaper articles about their well deserved success.  It's owned by a very friendly couple whose kindness and love for the customers can be tasted in every bite.  After soul food, I normally get the itis and have a coma/siesta, but after lunch here I felt awake and energized!  A clear testament to their natural ingredients and home made recipes.\n\nWhy not 5 stars?  To me, greens and bbq ribs are the pinnacle of soul food.  The collared greens didn't taste freshly made and the ribs were good, but not great.  Smokey but a little dry and the sauce was too mild and light bodied for my taste.  Still, for catering or BBQ, you can get 50 chicken pieces for under $50 and no one does fried chicken or hospitality with more soul than the soul connection!"

S"Santora's had flip flopped on its name more than a politician trying to sway the undecided vote. Santora's gained a huge fan base for their pizza, fish fry, and wings. When they changed over to Steelz, they kept the positive aspects of Santora's menu and refined the cuisine a little more. With a declining clientele, they changed their name back to Santora's and kept the best of the best from Steelz. \n\nIf my review did not confuse you enough. When I walked back into this venue, it was still the same cool interior and friendly greetings. For their sake, I hope the business picks up. Apparently, much emphasis is placed on a name. Due to their venture into a more well rounded establishment, they have lost quite a bit. With my couple of visits to this restaurant, I can see that they are very consistent with the quality of food. \n\nToday I had their standard burger with extra crispy fries and a side salad. $11 has never left me feeling so satisfied. I also took home a brie and bacon burger for my dad. He loves burgers and he enjoyed it."

Unfortunately, our experience was not good, mostly because of very slow, uneven and unprofessional service.  Our server told us she was new and she was friendly and tried hard, but our appetizers and dinners all arrived at different times, as much as 30 minutes after ordering for one of us, whose appetizer never came until the rest of us were almost finished with the entrees.  Even the soups for 2 of us arrived late, and you'd think this wasn't an item requiring much last minute effort in the kitchen.  Most of us thought the food was fairly good, but my petite fillet was very tough-I would be surprised if it actually was a fillet cut of beef.  At about $60 a couple with only one beer or wine apiece, and primarily appetizers with no desserts,  this  was not good value, and the service was about as bad as I've ever experienced.  We all felt sorry for the over-worked and undertrained new server."

This location is in dire need of some corporate attention.  The chow mien noodles are my go to and I usually have to always get the orange chicken.  The egg rolls here looked like they were from yesterday and were crusty, the won tons were not fresh and had the look of stones, as if they were morphing into Chinese throwing stars.  Gross.  I advanced to the point were I had to pay and I ordered a large drink.  I got the blackberry tea which was great, but... no splenda or sweet and lo.  Nothing at all.  I had to go back to the register and was only able to get sugar... which I did not want.  So I went without.  It was still thirst quenching.. but not ideal.  The whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area.  Even though I asked for dining in, they still packed me to go... was this a hint? or was it that they ran out of plates.  I think the latter.  I will say that the new grilled chicken breast with teriyaki was delish.  Let me state, I am not sure if it is all that new as I have not been to a Panda for some time.  I was saddened overall.

The sashimi is outstanding and the sushi chefs have some very creative rolls which I have never tried (Blackjack & Southwest roll).  The dinner menu is much more extensive, and I suggest first-time dinners to come by for dinner. The owner, Michael, is very nice.  When he recognizes you as a regular you will typically end up with something special from the kitchen (his treat).  It is important to mention that Ippei offers an extensive non-fish menu too, which allows you to bring sushi lovers and non-sushi eaters alike to this great establishment.  Do not miss the pot-stickers.  A note on decor: Ippei has a very welcoming modern interior making it an excellent environment to unwind or bring a client.'

I\'m fairly mental for their Chicken Soft Tacos on corn tortillas. Larger than a typical street taco, they are almost sized more like a mini burrito - Shredded Chicken, a red pepper sauce, lettuce, and melted cheddar = AWESOME. Tuesdays they are only $1, all day!  Finally their Adobada tacos are a bargain at thrice the price. Avoid the Chili Relleno burrito, however. It may be one of the worst things to ever get passed through a drive-thru window.'

S'What is not to like about Yatai?  \n\nThe location is a bit unusual simply because the east side is not really known for this type of food.  However, I can see that this location may appeal to the east side or even the Henderson residents.  This is definitely a positive for me!\n\nTucked in the back of the shopping mall, you can easily miss it if you don\'t slow down.  Upon arrival on a Saturday around 7:30 p.m., we were the only one there.  Not a problem to us - this means better service! \n\nAfter being seated right away, our drink order was taken.  As a November special, $1 for a small hot sake or $2.50 for a large hot sake. What a deal!!!  The large hot sake was delicious.  We also ordered a pint size of the Sapporo on draft and some hot green tea.  (The green tea was from a tea bag and didn\'t taste like green tea at all.  Order the matcha if that may be an issue for you.)\n\nOur server explained the menu and the ordering sheet and left us to decide while she gets the drinks.  We had the chicken hearts, chicken gizzards, chicken thigh meat, beef tongue, calamari rings, grilled squid, mixed vegetable tempura, and wasabi tako.  I think that was it.  There was absolutely nothing to complain about any of the food we ordered.  The grilled items were delicious; it was not too "char-y" or burnt like some places do it.  All the deep fried items were perfect; the oil was very obviously fresh.  The batter on the fried foods was perfect; not too chunky not too light.  And the wasabi tako was fresh as it should be.  Lastly, the grilled squid was very tasty because you can really tell the squid flavor (in a good way) and not burnt.  Some places grilled the squid so much at such a high temperature that it becomes burnt and dry - not here at Yatai!\n\nAnd again, the service was fantastic.  Albeit we were the only table there, the server and chefs seem very eager to perform their jobs.  The chef actually came out and asked how everything was; I thought that was a nice touch. \n\nWe bought the $10 for $20 deal, so our bill came out to $53 plus the $10, so $63 before gratuity.  We had 3 hot sake and a couple beer and we reordered a couple of the grilled items, too.  So this is a very good price for this kind of service and quality of food. \n\nWe are definitely coming back and recommend this restaurant!!!'

S'Quick review: classic supper club with a decent bar area and a large seating area.  Skip the buffet fish - definitely subpar.  Perhaps "menu" options are better?  \n\nDetailed review: Went here for Friday night fish fry, as we\'d heard their cod and haddock were some of the best around.  \n\nWandered in to the bar area, which is actually quite nice and very large.  Found two seats at the bar, ordered a Rocky\'s Revenge (on tap) and a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  The bartender seemed confused by the old fashioned request - she didn\'t know if she should muddle it with oranges or cherries or both... we coached her and she got it done, but I\'m sad to report the Old Fashioned was average at best.\n\nThe bar features bowls of free snacks - Gardetto\'s and freshly popped corn.  Drink prices were reasonable, and the other folks sitting around us were friendly and personable.\n\nOur table became ready at around 6pm, and after browsing the menu options we decided to go with the buffet.  In hindsight, this was probably a mistake.\n\nThe buffet features broasted chicken, two types of baked haddock (seasoned/buttered and plain), deep fried cod, several casseroles, some veggies, and several potato options (baked, broasted, or steak fries).  There\'s also a salad bar, although it costs $2.99 extra.\n\nThe baked plain haddock was firm and largely flavorless.  It didn\'t have a light, flaky texture, or a good mouth feel.  It was really quite lifeless and unexciting.  \n\nThe fried cod reminded me of a frozen Vande Kemps fish fillet.  Really crispy, but lacking in flavor.  Truly a disappointment.\n\nThe broasted potatoes were good, as were the casseroles.  My baked potato was still quite firm in places - I wonder if it wasn\'t fully cooked?  Finally, the veggies seemed like frozen veggies that had been steamed to serve.\n\nFitzgerald\'s buffet fish fry = FAIL\n\nService = 2 stars (rarely saw our waitress)\nFood = 1.5 stars (really uninspiring and tasteless)\nValue = 2 stars ($13 + $2.99 for salad bar)\nMISC = 3 stars (nice bar area; I\'d go back here for drinks with the family)\n\nSummary - there are many better options available, and who knows - the menu fish may be better than the buffet, but I don\'t feel like trying it again to see.'

They'll stare and inquire as to why you've been sitting at a seat for the last 15 minutes doing nothing, you'll tell them you ordered more, broken English ensues, you order some more. No big deal.\n\nThe good: The sushi. For all-you-can-eat, it's very good. Especially the salmon rose, mango salmon roll, and the sashimi (dinner only, sashimi is \xc3\xa0 la carte at lunch).\n\nI've eaten here for dinner and lunch, and it's always great. It's in the heart of town, decent prices ($25 dinner, $15 lunch). They serve other cuisine, but I've just gnawed on sushi while here. Oh, and they have great vegan / vegetarian options!"

S"Is it bad when the drive thru staff recognizes your voice? Beyond that, I'll never admit how often I eat Wendy's.\n\nIt's a fast food chain, the quality varies little and the staff comes and goes.  But a trend I've noticed at all fast food drive thrus lately is they want to hurl the food at you the second you pull up, and they barely wait till you have your drink/change/card in hand before they slam the window in your face.\n\nHow much do napkins really cost?  By the sudden scarcity of napkins in my bag (and not just here, all over the place) I am assuming they must be pretty expensive.   \n\nThe biggest problem here, is that no one listens to the customer.  They listen for exactly as long as they need to to get the basics of your order.  By not active listening, they create this sense that we, the customers, are taking them away from something really important.   \n\nI don't go through a drive thru to validate my self worth, so I don't care if they don't make me feel special and loved, but for god's sake, listen when I ask for a straw, napkins or condiments!"

S"It was a cold and windy night, so I decided to have some pho with my girlfriend.\n\nMy girlfriend had the Saut\xc3\xa9ed chicken with lemon and basil, I had their number 8 pho. Let me start by saying that their rice dishes were very mediocre, and lack of many flavours. The pho, on the other hand, is something to cheer about.\n\nThe soup is not clear, I tasted some hints of Chinese five-spice powder. The spices' flavours were not overwhelming, but just right (unlike some places I've been to previously). Their chop suey was fresh, and they offer lemons instead of limes. My only problem with the soup is that it was not hot enough to completely cook the chop sueys. Therefore, the taste of raw chop sueys was really a downer (still finished the whole bowl though).\n\nAs for their spring rolls, the texture of the vermicelli was slightly dry, meaning that they were prepared a long time ago. Also, the peanut sauce was not enough for the roll.\n\nThe service was very friendly, and very personal as well. With only two waiters it was fast and efficient; we didn't wait too long for our food.\n\nLastly, the place was extremely cold. Practically everyone inside the restaurant had their coat on.\n\nAt any rate, I'd give the place a 3.5/5 for now, and I believe that I will definitely return again. Hopefully, my next experience would be much better."

S"While in the search for the best place to have my graduation dinner... I had to find someplace that could house a couple dozen people and that would have killer drinks (for afterward! :P) and yet nice... after reading the reviews on yelp that were mixed... I couldn't help but to think this was the perfect place.\n\nMy mom went and found a VERY beautiful place on the inside... don't let the outside fool you! Linen topped tables and personalized plates abound! With pretty murals and cute decor. I was inlove. We had a nice dinner for two.\n\nI had some flautas with enchiladas. My mom had the enchiladas with a small steak. She was in love and I was happy too. The chips and salsa left much to be desired. And the service wasn't that great, it took us almost 45 minutes for us to get our meals! and we were the only table that was eating! And it turned out that our server was one of the owners!\n\nWe discussed the dinner and came up with a cute menu. Flautas and enchiladas. I had a few problematic guests. One doesn't eat cheese at ALL and another doesn't eat beef AT ALL and another won't eat poultry AT ALL ugh... these people! So we came up with a few nice alternatives and settled it.\n\nWe were told that they were going to cook the food a little on the early side. Just so that when we got there - we'd be ready to go. After I recieved my diploma (hard cover, the actual diplomas will be ready in a few weeks!) and headed out there, I was the LAST one to show up! I got there and it took over an hour for them to get our food on the table!!\n\nWhat happened to them starting early?? There was also a band that was playing some music. They were crazy-loud. but it was a Friday night and I did know about them ahead of time... I'm kinda glad they were loud because some of my guests were... umm... not getting along. Yeah and the band's loudness kinda kept things from boiling over. But it wasn't a nice place to eat afterward. \n\nI think it'd be better suited for a ton of appetizers and drinking and dancing. I don't think I'll be having a big party there anytime soon. But I might stop by for some dinner if I'm not in a big rush. If you have a LOOOOT of time, go ahead and give it a try... but you might not like it. I liked it, but the food was very salty. And again, the salsa wasn't that great. I didn't see ANYTHING that was uniquely Brazialian, which was disappointing. \n\nI was glad that they were able to accomidate us, but we were the only table that was eating! And they were able to box up our left over food (some ppl didn't show up) and they became our parting gifts to our guests. That was pretty cool."

S"It is difficult not to notice that the sign above this cafe reads 'Babelon', and it could be easy to accept that this is what the owners intended the shop to be called, but then you notice the smaller sign in the window calling it 'Babylon' cafe and it seems pretty clear that the owner's don't know how to spell Babylon. \n\nDespite these shortcomings, the prices in this cafe would be difficult to beat with a take away roll costing just one pound - a complete bargain in Edinburgh. Babelon Cafe serves the typical cafe food such as cooked breakfasts, sandwiches, hot and cold rolls and baked potato's as well as tea and coffee. The menu is varied and so there is something on it to suit everyone and the prices are excellent. I had a baked potato with tuna for my lunch which was tasty, but nothing special, but it was very cheap so I would definitely go back. \n\nThere are a few tables and chairs inside, but it can get very cramped in the cafe, especially during the lunch time rush, so most customers opt to take their food away.  The outside of the shop is very inviting, with the surroundings painted a bright green, but I find the contradictory spellings of babylon quite off putting."

What I like is that they have 2 sizes, the small for $4.95, and the regular for $6.95.  The small was more than enough for me.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup-The first time I had it here, I fell in love...the beef and tendon was soooo tendor along with green healthy looking baby bok choy, in a nice succulent broth, accompanied by nicely cooked noodles.  The second time, the meat was not tender, and I wasn't too happy...The third time...which is this time...was like the first time when I fell in love with it.\n\nThey serve  you hot tea and side dishes (kim chi and daikon) with your food.\n\nService is good.

Bear in mind then that the four stars here go for the quality of staff and service at this particular branch and do not necessarily reflect my opinion of the chain of restaurants as a whole. If you don't already like Domino's then this outlet isn't going to change your mind.\n\nI know I'm certainly not alone in my love for a dirty takeaway pizza every now and then and I have to say that this Domino's really hits the spot. The orders are always cooked and ready on time and the staff generally know what they're doing. A good rule of thumb as to the quality of oft-frequented chains is how often they've gotten your order wrong. We've all experienced it, you ask for no mushrooms and somehow end up with the shiitake special - but never once here has my order been anything but exactly what I specified.\n\nI'm not all too sure if this is a staple across all the Domino chain but you can get  a large pizza with any two toppings for \xc2\xa38 here and whilst that may be more expensive than the greasy takeaway a couple of doors down, it's easily enough to feed two people and it tastes pretty good too.\n\nThere's always a steady stream of staff flooding in and out of the doors into cars delivering takeaways so they're obviously pleasing some customers.\n\nWhilst I certainly see the merit behind the argument that big chains kill competition blah blah blah, I feel happy in this case that I know there's a (relatively cheap) option close by for when I want to have a few mates round and get the pizzas in.\n\nAnd they do 241 on Tuesdays on all pizzas - which is nice..."

S'Unfortunately this Pizza Hut was our favorite... And I stress "was"!  My kids loved the pan and thin cheese... Always perfect under the past manager.  But the last few months since that managers transfer it\'s just been horrible!  First if all the employees just don\'t seem to care if the customer is happy and they don\'t want to hear requests like "light sauce" or "please don\'t over cook".  My kids have Sensory issues and cannot handle hard burnt crusts or 4x the sauce.\n\nSince I\'m a working mom to two sets of twins my husband is sometimes in charge of dinner time.  Normally this means it\'s a Pizza Hut dinner for the kids.  So He tried again last Saturday night 9/27/14 and ordered our two favorite cheese pizzas... They were both over cooked and the thin crust cheese pizza looked like it was made the week prior; cheese all dried up &/or burnt.  So he kindly asked then to remake only the thin crust; even though both should have been redone.  Well the staff got our whole family back and our remade thin crust pizza wasn\'t hardly cooked; it looked almost all white. My husband felt bad to complain a 2nd time so he brought it home.  Needless to say I still had to make a late dinner for the kids since they were starving after NOT eating the pizza my husband brought home; I wish he would have done the same.\n\nHe had a few slices of the uncooked pizza and spent the night passed out in the bathroom... Yep; Food poisoning!!!\n\nSo watch what you ask for; they know how to get the picky customers back.  I would have preferred  they\'d spit on our pizza; at least that would have not made my husband so ill!!!'

I took it to go and when I reached my destination- less than a 10 minute drive- I sat down to have lunch- or so I thought.  The sub was soggy- covered in some strange damp slime- it feel apart in my hand as I tried to pick it up.  I took a bite- as the soggy sandwich continued to fall apart - it was a soggy tasteless mess.  Ugh- straight to the trash.  So, I  just spent $9.00 on a sweet tea.  Not happy .  Too bad- I really like the idea/concept of Firehouse as I have many friends in Chicago who are   firefighters.

Since we were packing up to move and needed to eat somewhere and were too tired to head down to Spring Mountain to our usual haunts we found this place on Yelp. .It might only have 8 reviews but I have to tell you it's way better than other take out Chinese in the area. \nWe are veggies so won't eat meat or chicken and they were very accommodating. We had tofu and veggie curry and kung po tofu.. Both not on the menu but made special. Yes she charged us a bit more but not enough to make us not order it. We also had veggie lo mein which was really really good. Of course, they don't compare to many of our favorite places on Spring Mountain but for a quick dinner that's fresh, hot and tasty you can't go wrong with MB China! ."

S"Tucked away at the back of the train station, the Nor Loch is a good way to pass some time if you're a bit too early for a train (or in my case, late!)\n\nIt doesn't really have a personality, but that's to be expected since its main pull of customers are commuters. As I've said of train station bars before, I quite like the anonymity of sitting in a place like this where you're unlikely to bump into someone you know. You can usuaslly grab a paper and a pint and go undisturbed.\n\nThey serve up some pretty standard food and drinks prices are reasonable. It's decked out like an old man bar so it's got a cosy facade. There's not that much behind it but then, there doesn't need to be. If you're wanting somewhere to meet a friend before you catch the last train home, this bar is a perfectly nice venue to do so. They also serve up tea and cake, if you're that way inclined."

My first impression was how beautiful the sunset looked through the panoramic windows. The decor has an 80's feel but in a good way. Chairs are cushioned - soft and comfortable but perfect for the tables. We even joked about buying similar ones for home. A large chandelier dominates the ceiling. Overall, the restaurant was warmly lit, clean and welcoming. \n\nMy In-laws said they hadn't seen children at the restaurant before and called ahead to see if my 14 month old daughter was welcome.  And yes, the staff was fantastic with her. I'll think nearly every waitress stopped by to talk to her.  One even read her a couple pages from a story book.\n\nOur service was great! The staff anticipated our needs by clearing plates and refilling drinks before we even realized we needed them. And I never felt like anyone was hovering over us. \n\nFood - again great! We started with calamari, which was the huge crowd favorite, and zuccinni. Both were good and huge. We had a table of 5 adults and the 2 apps were a little too much though you would never know it because we cleared the plates! We all ordered something different for an entree, and happily agreed that we would order the same again. \n\nAfterwards, the waitress took my left overs to the kitchen to wrap - rather than tossing me a box to do it myself. When I got home I noticed that she even covered the box with plastic wrap so it didn't spill in the car. \n\nA real class act!"

We each ordered chicken kabob, which came with cucumber salad,rice and grilled chicken. HUGE PORTIONS worth the buck! So much flavor, not too salty, and felt like it was freshly made. We had a "e-certificate" that decided to give us problems and as we were trying to figure it out the owner of the restaurant came up to us and asked us how she can help. We explained what was going on and she said "...don\'t worry...I\'ll tell you what...it\'s on the house!" I mean, wow!!! Not only the food was great but we couldn\'t have asked for better service!

How hard is it to get " medium bone out "? 4 out of 5 times it\'s anything but! Last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey BBQ. After calling the manager to let her know of the mistake, she replies "I guess some one else got your wings". Really!? An apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment!

Instead of saying "we\'ll cook it up for you right now," they said "we\'re really busy and it will be 30 minutes before it will be ready." I decided to go elsewhere.

He simply said "This one is on the house, if you like it- which you will, come back and see us again" :D so I got my first Baja Fish Taco Free! and not only that- it was AMAZING!

This is where Bar Trois Devins comes in. \n\nAmbiance/decor : Very clean (including bathrooms). It has a heavy, sombre feel, with wooden beams and exposed brick, which is very appropriate. \n\nDrinks : What differs them from most bars is that they import beers and stay off the mainstream track. Kudos.\nTheir cocktails aren't decorated like Mardi Gras, but very well mixed and taste good.\n\nService : I was actually impressed on how fast our waiter served us, considering the bar was completely full. (to both bring our orders and when we were ready to check out). \n\nPRO : Location. Many enjoy the restaurants on that strip, yet feel that their night is cut short due to regular restaurant hours. It's right next to (walking distance) all the restaurants and is open late.\n\nCON : Due to the fact that it's one of the only bars in the area, it can sometimes attract a clientele that may not be right for you. If you are with a small or larger group, this would go unnoticed however.\n\nNOTE : This could be an interesting place to rent (as a venue).\n\nReason of 3* rating : I was not blown away, considering Montreal is a bar&restaurant capital, but nothing disappointed me or anyone at my table."

Though we were one of just three tables there on a Saturday night around 7:30, it took nearly 30 minutes for our platter to come out. It was plated beautifully. Unfortunately, the fried shrimp had an odd texture I had to pass on, and the crab ragoon and ribs were barely lukewarm. The highlight was the egg rolls. These were clearly made in-house because the insides were crunchy. As in, not previously frozen and then defrosted mushiness. They were very good.\n\nWe ordered Kung Pao chicken and a beef and brocolli dish, plus house fried rice. The two dishes were well spiced. Often spicy dishes are just ungodly spicy where you can't taste anything else, but these actually had some flavor. It's just too bad the quality of beef was so poor you wouldn't want to eat it by itself.\n\nThe house fried rice was outstanding, with huge shrimp. We'd highly recommend the rice and eggrolls.\n\nWe also had a coupon, and our bill, with one soda, was $40. Ouch. We couldn't make heads or tails of our itemized, handwritten bill.\n\nThey do have an outdoor patio."

S"tasty Matcha Green tea and free wi-fi isn't enough to get me here regularly, but when you drop someone off (lucky someone going to see my fav Black Eyed Peas) at the West Gate this is the best place to sit, unless the concert is over after 10pm on a Thursday, because they literally KICK YOU THE F out at 10pm, or at 1 minute until then. you can still sit on the patio and use the free wi-fi after hours (until lights out i think) its kind of weird to me that a Coffee place would close at 10pm when there is a concert in the area and the line for coffee is still 5 deep at 1 minute till closing time. unfortunately they have several high school age Baristas working, so they have no idea that in this economy- all business is good business, as they are too consumed with getting out of Dodge!\n\nthe wi-fi is fast and the electrical outlets abundant, which makes a worker bee like me ecstatic! they are loaded down with coffee alternatives so everyone is sure to find a tasty beverage. the deserts looked tasty, but i'll try them next time. \n\nthe only problem is, they are located in the West Gate. parking is a bitch (except for us=Rockstar Parking oh yeah!) and traffic into the place is worse! so don't go out of your way to this place, but definitely utilize it when you need to wait and work in WG.\n\nmy  matcha green tea was tasty because i asked for cold matcha tea without ice, so they must have added more matcha (based on the previous review) because it was a shade of green i have never seen in a Green Tea. i guess you'll have to taste it for yourself if your into the Green!"

When we got here they told us that they were out of wings, cheese, nachos, pizza and salmon. So pretty much our choices were nil. The food we did get to order was terrible, we got the mixed green salad and it was nothing but spinach. No tomatoes...nothing. The spinach was also completely wilted and starting to rot. Just a handful of spinach for $6. Also got the po boy and the bacon on it was complete raw. My sister got the lettuce rolls and she didn't even touch it. I never complain, but the food was terrible and then we said something and our waitress. We complained and were told that the owner never comps anything. It was just a terrible experience.

S'This place is to be completed avoided. I wish I can give it negative stars..  It went from bad to worse in a blink of an eye... The only thing that was utterly FANTASTIC was a clementine-champagne frozen drink (which shouldn\'t even be considered a drink but a sip). Besides that, everything was completely forgettable. Given the opportunity to go back knowing what I know, I wouldn\'t go back even if someone PAID me.\n\nThe "order" of the night was an entree of foie gras, main plate of salmon and beef tartar and dessert. The entree and main dish took us over 2 and a half hours to receive. I wasn\'t aware that was a normal delay. \n\nLet me elaborate as to how the girls-date-night went out the window and we finally just walked out...\nReservations were at 8pm. Got there on time, seated instantly. Then waited for exactly one hour before our entree got to our table (to which another table came in, was seated and served 2 orders before we got our first). Our main meal came about 45 minutes after. At this point, we are contemplating leaving. I\'m sorry but is it normal to get 2 plates in about 2 hours..?? \nOn top of the horribly slow service, one of the waitresses was having a GREAT time with her boyfriend (while she was on the job); sitting on his lap, giving him "affection" and having drinks. Funny how she can have HER drinks but we can\'t get OUR food.\nAfter over 2.5 hours, we finally decided to leave. YOu know, for RAW food, it seemed like a long time to wait. Unless the chef is outside FISHING for the salmon and HEARDING the cows, I don\'t see why it would take this long. And not to mention that we didn\'t get all of our plates! We gave up on dessert!! \n\nOur waitress finally came to see us and inquire as to what was wrong (she saw us leaving our table). When briefly advised of what our sentiments were, her only response was "The kitchen is backed up". Funny though, the table of 6 that walked in after us and got served before us seemed to be getting everything in a timely manner. Once being brought our bill, the waitress hovered over us like a hawk until we paid our bill. That was definitely awkward. \n\nAfter this whole disasterous evening, to top everything off, my girlfriend was so intensely sick we didn\'t know what to do. So if you want to pay money for  a stressful evening with horrible service, this is definitely the place to be.'

S"Flame Kabob is en fuego!!\n\nThe new Spring Valley location of Flame Kabob doesn't disappoint.  The interior is outfitted in brick, lusciously hand-painted ethereal wisps of detail, and a few beautiful oil paintings in regal brass frames.  It's bright, clean, and refreshing, much like the flavors you'll find in the authentic Persian cuisine.\n\nI went with the Schawarma (beef and lamb).  It came wrapped in a wonderful Taftoon Bread (Persian pita, but better)  The bread was rolled out from the dough, and cooked in a clay oven right before my eyes.  Cue the 70's porn music...(bow-chicka-bow-wow!)  \n\nAlso accompanying this huge Persian pleasure feast was some tomato, seasoned onion, lettuce, Tahini, fresh hummus, and dolmeh.  Dolmeh is Persian Dolmades for those of you familiar with Greek food.  It is a grape leaves stuffed with rice, onion, oil, saffron, and other fantastic flavors I couldn't figure out.  I finished this one, and immediately regretted not ordering more.  It was as satisfying as pizza rolls were when you were 12, or pizza rolls now if you're a kid at heart.  \n\nThe schawarma itself was light in flavor, yet filling.  I had trouble finishing the meal and I was starving.  Notes of lemon, good olive oil, and the lamb and beef danced around beautifully with each bite I took.  I tried it with both the hummus and the tahini, but honestly, neither were needed, the flavor profile was perfect.  I would recommend ordering an extra side of the Taftoon Bread and dip your face off (nicholas cage movie reference anyone?)  \n\nThis is a family run vacation from the greasy, typical, and always disappointing.  I feel bad even using these words in the review, this place is great and you need to get your Perzh-on!"

The place still looks basically the same on the inside.\n\nIt was a Monday night and we were looking for a quick bite to eat so we figured why not give this place a try.  Thinking back, I believe that the happy hour specials as well as the menu items were about the same as what the Half Moon Grill offered.  \n\nIt was about 6:30 on a Monday night and the place was basically dead so we we seated right away and had our choice of table.  Our waitress was fast and friendly and we ordered up a couple beers, a salad and some burgers.  The burgers were a good size, not frozen or pre-cooked and were topped with fresh ingredients.  The fries were good as well and were hand cut.  We also tried the homemade kettle chips and they were excellent.  I could probably eat them all day.\n\nIt was about $40 including tip for everything.  If I am in the area again and want a decent burger, have a beer and watch a game; I would definitely come back.'

The shrimp were butterflied, battered and deep fried. And I'm assuming that since it was take out, they put the sauce in a container on the side to keep it from getting soggy. Good call. \n\nI cannot comment on the service since I went in and ordered take out. I walked in, ordered off the menu and my dinner was ready in less than 10 minutes... talk about fast. \n\nIf I'm going to be picky, I'd say the flavors could have been a little more robust. Overall it was very good and I'll be happy to go back and try more off of their menu."

S'We saw the "open late" banners off the street and just stumbled. I have a penchant for late nights and Bf has a penchant for izakayas, \n\nThis is in the same plaza as the TAM place. When I asked my bf, "Where, in relationship to TAM is it?" he answered "Its next to the Greek restaurant." You are retarded. Its between TAM and the Greek restaurant, in the crotch of the L-shaped building. \n\nWe were the only ones in the restaurant the whole time, except for when another young couple came in to order take out, trying to move in on our territory. We felt like kings. \n\nWe did the all-you-can-eat like true American swine. The AYCE, at $30 was a little overpriced. The menu items ranged from $3-8 and averaged maybe $6. So we calculated we had to order 10 items between the two of us. omg, cake walk. \n\nThe dishes are small, izakaya style. My favorites: \n\nSalmon shioyaki - So perfectly cooked. It looked dry when she dropped it. But when we broke it open, it was perfectly moist on the inside. Nice and fatty. So tender and delicate on the inside with a slightly chewy outside. \n\nYellowtail kama (collar) shioyaki - We kept forgetting to order this, but it finally dropped at the end of the meal. Dessert! Like the salmon shioyaki, it was perfectly tender and fatty. The meat was so yummy and complimented by an occasional blast of salt from the rub on the skin. \n\nShishamo - Pregnant smelt. We ordered three orders of this (one order = three smelt). Pungent fish like saba (mackerel), pregnant with masago (smelt egg, get it?). \n\nNimono (nishime) - Nimono literally means boiled things. Boiled veggies in a fish dashi. This is comfort food for me. \n\n\nEverything else we ordered: \n\nSashimi - Small ahi, yellowtail, and salmon cuts (see pictures). \n\nTempura \n\nWafu yakiniku - Like teriyaki steak. Drenched. \n\nBBQ short ribs - Really tender and tasty, but the sauce seemed packaged. \n\nSaba shioyaki \n\nUnagi kabayaki - Too much eel sauce. This is a huge steak. I think I only like unagi in moderation. \n\nShrimp karaage \n\nKinpira gobo \n\nThere were a lot of items we wanted to try but the mamasan hadn\'t ordered some ingredients yet. She told us this was the first night they were open late with the izakaya menu. We couldn\'t get the ozoni, senma tatsutaage, or mentaiko. \n\nWe also got two tall Asahis and a cold sake. If you order a cold sake, you get a wine glass half full for $4.50. It you want a hot, there are two sizes. \n\nI felt like I was in someone\'s home. The mamasan took some time to chat with us. She\'s part Okinawan and gave us a little rundown on things. The food wasn\'t Okinawan, though. It was straight up Japanese comfort food. I\'ve ate dinner at my high school friend\'s grandma\'s house hundreds of times and we ate the same things as at Kikuhana. \n\nBefore tip, the tab was $82 for the two of us. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino'

Yes, you will hear the phrase "beer money!" spoken in the same building where the Nevada Supreme Court makes decisions.  \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a Capriotti\'s fan but I applaud Capriotti\'s on their business sense.  Desperately hungry people like me, trapped in the RJC for hours on end, will do crazy things to get fed.  My desperation led me to eat at this Capriotti\'s, a chain I truly despise.\n\nCapriotti\'s, to me, is universally gross and this new location did not disappoint.    I ordered the Cole Turkey featuring dry, overcooked turkey, sweaty provolone cheese, dry coleslaw, and one slice of tomato.  Eating this sandwich was like chewing an entire bag of cotton.  That\'s the Capriotti\'s experience!  This place was packed though, so apparently it\'s popular.\n\nNeedless to say, once my biological need for food was met, I threw away the rest of my sandwich.

A little greasy, but once that's wiped away and a little parm is sprinkled on top, the pizza veers towards excellence.  $12 and change for the large pie.  They also sell 40's and 6-packs of beer, ranging from PBR to Victory and Bell's for somewhat decent prices, around $9 per 6-pack.  You can also pick up some Boone's Farm, which I only mention for the sheer hilarity.\n\nWhile I'm happy to take-out from here, I'd probably end up dropping a star if I ever stayed inside for longer than 5 minutes--it's fairly filthy.  However, the staff is nice and it never takes longer than 20 minutes for a take-out order to be ready."

My wife wanted breakfast and I just wanted food.\n\nWe sat at a booth and had a look at the menu. There was a wide choice of food available. I ordered a waffle, Bert's best chili and all the way homefries. Our waitress Jane was prompt with our drinks.  She did tell me that they had to throw away the chili so I ordered a ham & cheese omelet instead. I thought the food was great with the exception of the omelet. They folded the eggs over a hunk of cold cheese.  The homefries were delicious. The waffle was cold but filling. My wife didn't like her view of the kitchen and commented that my meal looked like vomit. She kept staring at me in horrified fascination as I cleared my plate.  Never again she said!

(Sorry meal plan, but I had to break a couple rules last night...)  Food, service, atmosphere were all A+!!!!  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The salad bar is AMAZING!!!  And the tour of the kitchen and the private room was a great touch to end the evening.\n\nThank you Gabi for putting this together!  It was such an excellent treat!'

S'We went there for the first time yesterday, and I would definitely recommend Spartan Pizza.  Here\'s why:\n- the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top\n- the sauce is sweet and savory\n- the cheese is rich and delicious\n- the veggies were fresh and tasty\n\nWe ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I\'ve had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.\n\nWe also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I\'d bet the pizza salad is much better.\n\nThe service was casual and friendly.\n\nIn regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance.  We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.\n\nI should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic.  This is a "no frills" kind of place.'

S"Pales in comparison to the Peruvian food I ate in Port Chester, NY, but unfortunately, it's all we have in AZ.  The food is not bad, but it leaves something to be desired.  \n\nI've been here twice, and I don't remember what the dish I had the first time was called, but it was steak, a fried egg, rice, plaintains, and french fries.  It was filling, delicious, and the steak and egg were cooked perfectly (juicy and runny, respectively).  The second time, I had the Jalea, which I was not particularly impressed with.\n\nThe corn juice beverage is also very good and unique.  \n\nIf you go, be prepared to spend an hour and a half there.  It sometimes takes awhile to cook the food, and they don't exactly operate at lightning speed.  They're pretty laid back, which, I think, can be a good thing.\n\nTheir flan is also very good.  They sold me an entire pie for a very reasonable price of $18.\n\nNote: Closed Mondays."

As I recall they only take cash so, if you only have a card on you, rob a bank or something because you do not want to miss out on this. Cheese steaks are top-notch but if you get there earlier in the day try the provolone and egg sub as a special breakfast treat. Then go back for lunch.... and dinner.\n\nTip: You must add sweet potato fries to your order - I think this is actually a law in all 50 states."

S'Nope. And it\'s 100% because of the service. There\'s maybe 12 tables in the place, yet we were somehow invisible. A glass with one melting ice cube sat in front of me for 10 minutes before the kid remembered to open the cooler and bring me my can of soda. The food was just okay - the pork was a generous serving but overcooked. Perhaps that\'s why it took so long (20 min), even though no other dishes were coming out of the kitchen. I had to ask for silverware twice, and no water refills.\nThe kicker was at the end. I wanted to buy 4 pastries and the server acknowledged. 10 minutes later, a dude walks in and buys all the pastries in one go. When I (finally) got the check and asked about the pastries, she says "Sorry, we\'re sold out." W...T...F.\nIf you have nowhere to be for a few hours, angelic levels of patience and aren\'t concerned with flavor, this might be a place to check out.\nTwo stars because the order was accurate and I believe the kitchen is doing their best.'

Both of the owners and all of the staff are friendly and welcoming, and the food is absolutely delicious.  We've been in three times in the past few months and have had consistently good experiences.  Last night, we started off with a very reasonably priced bottle of Coppola cabernet, had a house salad (for me) and the shrimp scampi appetizer (for him), both of which were fresh and tasty.  I'm a big fan of their house dressing, sort of a balsamic vinaigrette that's on the creamy side. I passed on the house garlic knots (the owner's specialty) as I'm watching my waistline, but hubby loves them.  For main courses, I had the vegetariana pasta with the white wine sauce and angel hair, and he had the chicken picatta.  Both arrived fairly quickly, even though there were five other tables being served (on a Monday night).  My love and I were both totally full by the end of the meal, and had enough food left over to have a lovely lunch today.  We totally recommend this place and know it will become one of your faves, as it has become one of ours..... Buon provecho!"

S'I tried Taco Loco one Saturday afternoon a few months ago when I had one of my very rare, but very strong Mexican cravings (which really has more to do with having an early afternoon margarita then it does the cuisine).   The first offputting feature of this restaurant was the fact that I had to request, and then was subsequently charged, for what ended up being the most unimpressive set of chips and salsa I\'ve ever had.  Since I wasn\'t impressed with the salsa, I ordered the guacamole hoping it would be better.  But to my great surprise,  I discovered what is likely the only guacamole on earth that does not make me want to grab a spatula and clean the bowl.  It is very difficult to spoil guacamole for me, but they did it with the garlicky-smokey-not quite sure if it\'s supposed to taste that way or not-flavor.  I was very sad about my chips and salsa/guacamole experience since that\'s usually my favorite part of "Mexican dining".  Well, that and the margaritas.  \n\nThe tacos were equally questionable as the guac. I believe I ordered the carnitas tacos and something about them was just....off.  Another reviewer mentioned old, wilted lettuce and I experienced the same thing, which just makes you wonder about the rest of the ingredients.  My husband ordered fish tacos and wasn\'t impressed either.  After tasting my carnitas tacos, I was really glad I hadn\'t ordered fish tacos.  That just seems like something that doesn\'t come out right too often, and here it could have been scary.   \n\nAs for the margarita, nothing sticks out in my mind other than the fact that I only ordered one, which probably means it was just, eh.  :-)  \n\nWe won\'t be back here.  There is now a much tastier, albeit "chainier", Mexican restaurant serving up scrumptious salsa, tasty tacos and mouthwatering margaritas right across the street.'

When the gentleman came over the intercom I could hear some snickering and laughter; that made me happy. I like people to enjoy their job. When I ordered a burger he told me they weren\'t serving lunch yet. I said "okay, thanks then" but as I drove past the window I felt stared at like "who wants a burger at 10am?" Young punk... I crossed the street, and at the JITB intercom I asked, "Can I get a burger right now?" The man responded, "You can have whatever you like."

They serve hot meals here in addition to the salads, soups, and sandwiches available at their deli locations. \n\nThe food is pretty decent. I had the Zarella Chicken sandwich which has a grilled chicken breast  with fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, pesto and balsamic on a whole wheat bun. The sandwich was kinda bland and the balsamic and pesto made the bun too soggy to eat by the end of the meal. Hubby had the Kitchen club sandwich  and he enjoyed his. I chose sweet potato fries as my side and they were delish, hubby chose the yukon fries and he said they were pretty awesome. I only wish this place had prices that matched the quality of food. over twenty bucks for two chicken sandwiches, fries, and sodas? yikes. \n\nWe also went for brunch the other day, because I am a pancake freak and they have them on the menu. Again, way over priced! 3 pancakes with 3 slices of bacon @ around 10 bucks.. ouch. The pancakes were yummy, but not 10 bucks yummy.\n\nI\'m sure I\'ll go back again and try some more of the items on the menu that sound delish, but I will more than likely kick myself in the end for paying too much for so so food.

So, we figure with Hurricane Grill & Wings advertising like mad about their 31 flavors, why not give it a try?\n\nWe walk in just as the game is starting and take a look at the menu.  The hard part really is deciding what flavors you want - we went for their Hurricane Wing Flavor Sample for $17.99.  It comes with 24 pieces of their jumbo wings or boneless wings, tossed with four sauces of your choice, celery, and ranch or bleu cheese dressing.\n\nIt took about half an hour for our order to go to finally come out.  We weren't the only one waiting though.  A bunch of people had called in their orders, and they weren't particularly pleased with the wait either.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm watching the dynamics of this place - they're trying to train a new girl, but I don't think they are doing a very good job of it.  The bar is REALLY close to where the tables are.  Therefore, if you plan on bringing your kids to this place, watch out for the foul- mouth drunks hanging out at the bar.  Dropping the F bomb every other second can be described as a not family-friendly environment.\n\nThe good thing about taking it to go is that they label each box with what flavor you got.  The bad thing is that they don't bother asking if you want ranch or bleu cheese, they just give you the ranch.  And the celery includes four pieces.  Also, we saw someone else get hot sauce for their to go order, so we were sure to ask for some of that too.\n\nOur flavor choices: \n\n* Sea Salt & Vinegar - We really couldn't taste the whole salt and vinegar concept, just tasted like deep-fried wings. Lacking in overall taste.\n\n* Ancho Chile Lime Sauce - Good flavor with a nice heat as well.\n\n* Habanero Lime Toss - A dry rub - nice heat as well, with a fresh squeeze of lime on top.\n\n* Hurricane's Garlic & Parmesan - Pretty good flavor with the cheese adding the funky smell and taste.\n\nWith wings, the BF loves Wing Stop.  My complaint with them is that their wings are too small, good flavor though.  Here - the wings are bigger with more meat and good flavors, if you choose the right ones.  I was dipping my wings in the ranch, bleu cheese, and hot sauce, so maybe there wasn't enough flavor for me.  Sometimes they don't have all the flavors available though as we heard they were out of a few. \n\nOverall, we'd go back.  But the wait alone sucked and I don't about dining in since the service seemed lacking.  Their Garlic Parmesan Fries ($3.99) look tempting though!"

S"I think people are writing reviews for Beach Cafe since Cafe Nikki hasn't been on Yelp.com.  Anyway, I've had two experiences here.  I'm staying at the Tropicana so sometimes you don't feel like travelling far for food.\n\n1. I had room service.  I would have been fine going down to pickup my food and save the $7+ fee ($5 delivery plus added in tip) but apparently you are not allowed to do this.  I ended up paying $22+ for a grilled chicken sandwich that took 40 minutes to deliver around 11 PM.  The order service was friendly and the delivery service was also a friendly person, but very expensive.  It was very filling though. You pay a lot but you get your tummy filled. I was satisfied with the food quality. The bread and toppings were good and the steak fries were tasty.  The chicken quality was ok.\n\n2. I went down for the breakfast buffet.  I just went by myself as my boyfriend was out at Red Rocks climbing.  They sat me at a small table.  The music playing was nice downbeat electronica and the atmosphere was great.  You could look at Nikki Beach pool and I'm sure it would have been nice to be outside if temperatures were warmer.  The food quality at the buffet was good. Fresh fruit, fish, even the eggs were good.  The potatoes resembled sausage and since I don't eat red meat or pork, I had to confirm it wasn't, in fact, sausage. The orange juice was tasty but the glasses were extremely tiny. The water even tasted good  I enjoyed the food a lot.  The major drawback was that no one was my waiter. I think this was uncommon. I had to go to the bar to check out and the bartender was surprised no one was servicing me.  If it wasn't for this I would have gave 4 stars, or maybe even five.  The buffet cost $20 so if you're hungry, it's worth it. \n\nTip: Apparently if you make a reservation through Travelocity or other services you get coupons.  Probably worth it.  I didn't know about this until I paid."

The walls are adorned with all sorts of goodies to help take your mind off the fact that you are indeed just in a strip mall, and the bar itself is outfitted like a tiki bar.\n\nitems on the menu are not overly surprising for a bar - you have some burgers and some fish and there is even fried gator on the menu, if you're feeling adventurous (while I've had fried gator before, I haven't had it here).\n\nStaff is friendly, but when I've been, the place is typically empty. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, except it doesn't really explain why the food takes a while to come out and isn't terribly interesting. If there isn't anyone else there, the food should be able to be served pronto, and they could take a little care.\n\nI get it, i've done my time in restaurants, so when no customers are there, the day can drag, but you have to make those that are there want to come back or no one will ever come back!"

Because 3 years ago, I didn't even know what this place was.  Then after having my son, I avoided Chuck E. Cheese like the plague because the place just seemed noisy and ANNOYING to me.\nWell, here I am 3 years later giving Chuck E. Cheese 5 stars- why?  Because my 3 year old absolutely LOVES this place.  \nDon't ask me how because I've never mentioned Chuck E. Cheese to him but at 2 1/2 when we drove past a Chuck E. Cheese, he could call out the place by name and wanted to go there.\nFINALLY, I could not avoid the place any longer after we were invited there for a birthday party and my son was so excited to go there.  Once there, my son was in heaven!!\nThe noise level on a busy Saturday morning still drives me crazy but I've since gone with my son and friends on a weekday morning when it's not so busy and I have to admit, it is a very safe environment with fun games that will entertain your child for hours.\nAnd definitely get on their email list for their great coupons and specials because if you are like me (and I never thought I would be doing it), you will end up buying tokens by the bucket load!\nSo Chuck E.

The daughter had a pizza, which was very cheesy, and she was happy. I have forgotten the glass of wine but it went well with the food.

S"Many moons ago, as a recent college graduate, I took up residence in the South Side of Pittsburgh (South 22nd Street to be exact).  I enjoyed many a nights during that time at the plethora of watering holes.  And as I would make my way home I often stopped by a local eatery for a late night snack.  My favorite was DiSalla's, a pizza shop that served up square pizza.  It was by no means the best pizza but it was close to home, cheap and very tasty with alcohol.  DiSalla's, sadly, no longer exists.  Pizza Vesuvio was another pizza place I enjoyed because it was also cheap and had nice big New York slices.  It has since become Pizza Sola and way too expensive.  Enter Sal's Pizzeria.  \n\nMy first trip was really just a fly-by for a snack on my way to a show at Club Cafe because a friend had told me to try the meat pies.  Yes, for $2 you can get a Jamaican meat pie.  And for $2, it was tasty and hit the spot.  \n\nYesterday I walked in and was told they had just opened so they didn't have pizza ready yet, but that it would be out of the oven in 5-7 minutes.  I was willing to wait.  It's exactly what you'd expect or want when you walk into a place like this - a slice of New York.  Thin crust oozing with sauce and melted cheese as I folded it in half....and for only $2 (plain cheese)!  It might just be the cheapest meal in the South Side.  An unbelievable deal at an unbelievable price.  The guy behind the counter even asked me how it was as I left.  A side of nice with a cheap slice?  I'm hooked."

Standard fare (apps, burgers, sandwiches, etc.). Decent service.\n\nI had "The People\'s Choice" sandwich, which was a chicken breast with provolone, bacon, and grilled red peppers. At first, I thought it was a tad small, but it turned out to be prefectly portioned. It would have been nice to have more than 2 grilled peppers on it, but overall, it was VERY tasty. I will get that again. It came with red potatoes, which were just OK. Nothing special.\n\nWarning to any tea drinker: they only have "soda-fountain" tea, so it was (Bill Walton voice) "terrrrrruhbull".\n\nThe service was fine. Nothing fancy, nothing bad.\n\nI will write more upon my return to Pitt, when I go back for wings/beer (which I almost did today).'

Been that I'm from DC I'm used to A+ Jamaican but Fireside gets a B+. I had the Oxtail with rice and peas and it as a lot of food and very good. Its located in Wilkinsburg on Penn and Center st right across from the Historic Penn-Lincoln hotel  which might be why you can never find it when you search for it on Yelp. Their service was fast and courteous and very respectful. They only take cash which is ok because Pamela's do the same thing. Overall I enjoyed the food. I know Wilkinsburg gets a bad wrap but don't worry about the neighborhood, I've eaten in worse places in DC and most hole in the wall places make the best food. Check it out.

The bar\'s a great place for a nicer-than-usual happy hour too although on Friday and Saturday nights, you often have to defend your seat/table with an iron fist as once all the chairs are taken, there\'s not very many good places to stand...  They sell Banfi sparkling red wine by the glass and it\'s deliciously festive!'

I have been here for lunch and its pretty good. Most things are tasty but the consistency varies. Most of the time I love their egg salad but sometimes its different and I do not like it. \nI have had the shrimp tostadas and they are excellent. I had the mexican salad the other day and did not care for it. There were very little beans, iceberg lettuce, and the cheese was not flavorful. \nThe servers are always friendly, but the food can take a while.\n\nOverall I do enjoy it, and will be back.

It took over an hr for our appetizer to arrive, while one party of 3 who came later of us already finished and left (and another party of 6 had their order 20min earlier).  We were too hungry, and we asked for bread. Took them in total 40min to get us the bread.\n\nWater was never filled until we asked and it came 10min later.\n\nThere were about 5 tables at the peak time that night with 2 servers. Then there were the owner and his family. The owner came to apologize after us waiting for almost an hr, saying he'd check on the meals, but he never came back with a follow-up. At the end, he offered dessert on the house, but they were out of the one we wanted. He didn't offer to not charge our appetizer. Not sure how sincere he was about his apology.\n\nFood was ok. Decor was ok. Due to bad service, I would not go back.\n\nMistakes they made:\n(1) 1hr wait entree\n(2) 40min wait for bread and appetizer\n(3) water was never refilled\n(4) entree were wrong"

S"Another tiny store-front restaurant (a concept that is almost becoming Edinburgh's signature), this place is great. At first you wonder how such a tiny space can serve up proper hearty German food. There's certainly no room for busty Bavarian waitresses to barrel through with an armful of brimming steins. That would be doubly difficult considering they don't serve booze. But you can BYOB at no charge, which also makes this a cheap and cheerful dinner choice when you're feeling a bit skint.\n\nThe menu is basic, but who needs the illusion of choice when you have a handful of classics, all done well. The food served here is spot on, according to my hazy holiday memories. Hearty portions of authentic German grub. On my first visit I had tasty Vienna schnitzel with yummy fried bratkartoffeln. I'm already looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.\n\nThe d\xc3\xa9cor is very, err, homely, if not to say basic. But the charm is in the simplicity, and the food, and the simplicity of the food. The waitress was very nice and the chef even came out to ask us how the food was. These friendly touches contributed to the homemade vibe. It's no-frills dining, cheap and cheerful, perfect for this time of year when the weather is heavy and your wallet is light."

Our breakfast rolls and tea arrived quickly after ordering. They tasted fresh.

S'I was disappointed with the food. Service was good but there are some inattentitive things that bother me. All the little things add up that makes it hard for me to return. But let\'s start with the food.\n\nAh, cornbread to start. I love the cornbread as long as it isn\'t too sweet. The cornbread was great, not sweet, and to my surprise, little chunks of jalapeno mixed in, friend and I got one each of these delightful starts to lunch. Nice, very nice start to my anticipation of better things to come.\n\nLunch friend and I started with an appetizer of wings. They came out in an attractive basket (8 of them $7.95) so they are $1.00 a piece. Crispy fried with a sweet BBQ sauce and your usual celery and carrot sticks with what looked like ranch dressing. Now here is the experience once I "bit" into them....sweet but no smoke or taste to the wings, just the initial sugar rush, fried skin and then no flavor to the wing. Disappointed. I cannot figure out what the magic white sauce that accompanied the celery sticks is? Something whiteish, just not ranch, not mayonaise...like light mayonaise without taste, whatever it was, it remained in the bowl not eaten. Uh Oh, I said under my breath.\n\nOK...so I said to myself "If you want good dough...go to a bank, or go to a bakery" If you want good wings...well go to the Native New Yorker and get all you want at around fifty cents and 31 flavors if you want.\n\nWell, let\'s judge them by the BBQ, that is why I came here. So the way to sample BBQ is... the Sample plate, three meats at lunch (not including ribs I might add). Had to have their ribs, so got a few on the side plus the one sidedish which I chose coleslaw. Pulled pork, brisket, and chicken, plus the side of baby back ribs that I had to have. $12.95 plus $3.00 for the side of ribs. A little (and I mean little silver cup of BBQ sauce reserved usually for a side of horseradish)\n\nPulled pork....2 stars. brisket 2 stars, chicken 2 stars, ribs 2 stars, coleslaw, 3 stars.\n\nSorry, Bad to the Bone no pun intended is just that. I don\'t care about the decor, I don\'t care about mean waitresses (which in this case we had a sweet one) but just deliver me some good BBQ.'

I ordered on GrubHub (which I do often) at 2:18pm, my estimated delivery was 3:45pm-3:55pm\nSeemed a little long but its BBQ and red velvet cake with corn bread and mac n cheese so has to be worth some wait, and I am near a college campus so OK.\n\n4:00pm rolls by and I call the restaurant. At first it goes directly to VM. OK, this isn't good so I call again and I get put on hold. Once the gentlemen finally picks up Im told it will be 15-20 minutes for my order and he apologizes for the delay. OK no problem.\n\nI decide to hop on Yelp and look at the reviews, as when I ordered I was starving so just picked a place (I'm still starving as I write this first part). I see the wait is not uncommon. In fact its the norm.\n\n4:20pm rolls by and I message GrubHub. Within 2 minutes I had a text and email stating I should have my food by 4:32pm ...its 4:29pm as I type this. They gave me an extra 10.00 in food, which I appreciate and realize its not their fault my food is late but with all these issues piling up you would think they might get the hint to discontinue business with this place. (Just sayin).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo food got here at: 4:37\n\n\nReview of food:\n\nHot Links - Sauce was spicy and good so was the hotlink the bun was crunchy on the edges link it was over microwaved.\n\nMac N Cheese - Bland. Its a shame too there is so much you can do with Mac N Cheese.\n\nCornbread Muffin - Decent taste, horrible consistency. I don't expect my Cornbread to be chewy.\n\nRed Velvet Cake - Cake was moist and it was good but it had an after taste like the cream cheese had been wrapped in plastic wrap too long\n\n\nAll in all I wont order here again, the food was not great and the time it took to get here was utterly poor."

HORRIBLE customer service, and way to nickle and dime the customer.   Also, clearly can't do math.....the two hot dogs total $3.59!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    How the hell do I owe more???????

S"Soooo, though this is not the reason why I YELP, it was a nice surprise that I got a message from the owner of HWY55 to offer me a second visit with my family to try them again and re-review. He let me know that they had more systems in place and got their general act together. We were glad for the opportunity cause I, believe it or not, don't like writing bad reviews! \n\nWe got to the restaurant at dinner time (5ish). I approached the fellow who seemed to be in charge and indeed I was correct. It is a weird moment when you have to approach restaurant manager and introduce yourself as the guy who gave them a crappy write-up and are there for your free meal. He was endlessly cordial and friendly about it, making sure to mention that without folks talking straight in reviews, that they couldn't improve. I admired that attitude so things started out pretty well. \n\nSo the first thing I noticed was that, service-wise, they were understaffed for the time of day. The young lady that was waiting tables was very pleasant though and handled the stress with dignity and a smile.  At the end of our meal there were more servers, so there may have been late arrivals or cal-outs. It could have been a bad situation but it seemed to be handled well enough. On the funny side, I don't know if the manager told her why we were there, but while taking our order she seemed a little nervous, though pleasant, and forgot to take my order after the rest of my family. No issues and she giggled when I mentioned it.\n\nThe food was definitely better this time though, again, did not blow my mind. We tried to order as close to the last time as possible to the original visit to get a generally true comparison. My wife got the pimento cheese sandwich which, again, was tasty but lacking the generous-ness of cheese portion spoken of on the menu. Still really good pimento cheese for real! My pimiento cheese burger was of proper size and was tasty. I got the chili cheese fries which were okey doke but fairly pedestrian. I make some pretty good chili but absolutely appreciate other chili, this was just run of the mill. My daughters kid-burger was cooked properly and she got all over it. The most telling moment of the meal was that my son (food critic or epic pain in the butt, I'm not always sure which) said this time that he wouldn't mind heading back some day. After his first reaction this was a big plus for the restaurant.\n\nSo, overall, a much better visit. Why, then, V-Dub, did you only give one more star then before? Well, person asking the question, I take my 4 star reviews pretty seriously. If I drop a 4 star, then it's a destination eatery. If there were and opportunity to give a half star rating then I would go that direction. HWY 55 is a proximity restaurant. If we are in the area and need some burger and fry action, we will stop in and get some grub. It does not come up in the conversation when deciding where to drive to for dinner. This is in no way a bad review. The fact that we will go back speaks volumes for this particular joint. The owner owned the problems and invited us back. The manager was very accommodating and the server was peasant despite being in the weeds. Consider this a 3.5 star rating. Worth a shot especially now that they seem to have systems in place. \n\nNote to owner: Need sugar caddies for those who drink unsweetened tea. They are pretty cheap and a nicer touch than the first waitress who brought my wife sugar in a coffee cup and the most recent time packs of equal (or something similar) dropped on the table (though nicely dropped on the table :) )"

Their sauce is their standalone winner, its probably the best BBQ sauce I've had ever.  The ribs were fantastic.  The bbq chicken I've only tried reheated, and it was still tasty after being nuked in the microwave.

Fresh, flavoursome and fabulous to say the least.  \nWe opted for the salmon cerviche and guacamole for starters.  Both very fresh and immediately showed us that we were dealing with high standard food. \nThe tacos (at a reasonable \xc2\xa36.50 for two) are incredible.  We visited this place twice because we loved it so much so got to sample a few of them.  Our favourite was the fish tacos, but the pork and duck were also both excellent. \n\nThe staff were really friendly but not overbearing and the margarita's were refreshing and a perfect accompaniment to the food.  \n\nThey've kitted the place out with dark colours and bright Mexican skulls which match the rugged rap music which pumps the ambience of the entire place with an edgy (yet not pretentious)  hipster feel. \n\nHighly highly recommended!"

S"I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas, probably cheese and one other choice. But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS! \n\nPizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.\n\n Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.\n\nThere is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves. \n\nThe employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box. \n\nI love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!"

S"I think I was wrong to assume that if 'steak frites' was the name of the restaurant, it would be one of the BEST steak frites I would ever have.\n\nWe arrived around 5pm-ish for an early dinner.  The space was a gorgeous second floor restaurant with a floor to ceiling window that overlooks the street.\n\nThe menu was pretty straight forward offering a choice of 5-6 appetizers and mains.  Ofcourse, I had to have the name sake so I ordered the 9 oz. steak ($23) with frites.  A 7 oz. steak is also available for $20.  In addition to the steak, we ordered a duck confit main ($22), grilled shrimp appetizers ($14)and a side of mushrooms ($5) for the table.\n\nEach main came with a nicely dressed salad and fresh hot buns which were both excellent.  Off to a good start.  The steak came on a bed of crispy green beans and all-you-can-eat fries.  Our first round of fries were cold and not that crispy.  A choice of sauce on the side comes with each order of  steak - pepper, mushroom or dijonnaise.  I chose the mushroom.  The steak itself was pretty flavourless and blah, even though it was ordered medium rare.  It just lacked any wow factor.  A second round of fries came which were fresh and hot.  I had a taste of the duck and it was excellent, a tad salty but infinitely better than the steak.\n\nService was alright, a little slow at times.  We waited a long time for our second round of fries and had to flag the waiter down for things like ketchup and mayo.\n\nWe liked that we could bring our own wine with no corkage fee, and there is a SQA very close by.\n\nI'm pretty sure Montreal has better steak frites out there so I'll definitely be seeking out other places."

This location had excellent service, but the food was absolutely disgusting, however, that's because the food at every Culver's is disgusting, and not any fault of the employees.\n\nThe burgers are drowning in grease, are super thin and flavorless, and make the buns soggy quickly. There's nothing I hate more than a soggy bun. Urgh. The pickles are also sweeter pickles, which I'm not a huge fan of. The fries were not at all crisp, which is another down side. \n\nThat said, the service was excellent. We'd eaten at a Culver's once before and didn't like the food, but we thought we'd give a new location another try. Not being familiar with how the chain works, the counter lady was kind and explained things to us and was just very friendly. So was the gal who brought our food to us. So they were excellent!\n\nI just don't get the appeal of Culver's food and shan't be going back again. If I want flavorless fast food, I'll go somewhere cheaper and less greasy."

First off, the floor was extremely greasy. Very dangerous. Yes, I realize they are a fried food establishment. Doesn't matter. Someone could seriously injure themselves in there.

S'This popped up on my radar of Middle Eastern food, and, since I was in the mood today, I made a trip down to the area to run my errands. \nLike most Middle Eastern eateries here in Charlotte, the owners/cooks made sure that the fare is as "American-friendly" as possible.  What do I mean by this?  Well, glad you asked!  Turkish food, like other Middle Eastern (and to an extent Mediterranean food as well) has its own unique, historic, culture-saturated taste that is very difficult to deal with or enjoy if you\'re not accustomed to it.  The spices are so different than what is generally used in American, or even western European, dishes.  That being said, Carolina Kebap kept true to their Turkish ways and added their own twists to menu and food.  \nI ordered the lamb kebap (or kebab, kebob, etc depending on where you hail from in the mid-east!) and it didn\'t disappoint.  The fixin\'s were good as well; grilled tomato and pepper, small salad, pita bread, and rice that was a blend of basmati and pilaf (interesting and delicious!).  What I like the most about the plate was the yogurt dressing they served with the meal.  It\'s similar to a tzatziki sauce in Greek gyros with a twist; it has hints of mint and garlic in addition to the mellow cucumber normally found in tzatziki.  I did feel that the portion size was a little on the "small" side, but I did go for lunch, so it wasn\'t that big of a distraction.\nThe restaurant itself was pleasant, if a bit small.  The atmosphere was inviting and clean, with hints of "restaurants-of-Christmas-past" in the front area (I overheard another patron talking about the last 2 restaurants that occupied the same location!).  The servers were pleasant and helpful.  To top it all off, they played authentic Turkish music to drive home the feel!  Overall, a good experience.  I\'ll visit again when in the area, and try some other stuff they have to offer.\nNoosh!'

S"I hate writing this update because I used to really love Apple Spice, but the last three times we have ordered lunch there have been multiple mistakes. For a place that does catering, getting 10 lunches right doesn't really seem like too much to ask.\n\nToday, two people ordered bread bowls. They received a very small container of soup with a slice of bread. That is not really a bread bowl.\n\nMe and one of my vegan co-workers ordered the southwestern salad, sans cheese. It came with chicken, and on the menu it states you have to pay an additional $1 for chicken, so it would definitely be something someone needed to ask for.\n\nOne of the lunches came as a sandwich instead of a wrap, and Heather W. was missing her cookie and her juice with her meal.\n\nApple Spice was nice enough to replace the mistaken items (brought corrected salads, brought the actual bread bowls - although, not with new soup, brought the wrap) and bring us an extra plate of cookies, but like I said, this is the third time this type of mistake has happened. \n\nIt's pretty expensive, the Southwestern is not even very good, and once the order comes back wrong it delays my eating for an hour + and it is just frustrating.\n\nI'm sorry Apple Spice... you guys are great but you need to get it together."

S'A couple of years ago when Allo Mon Coco opened I posted a review praising the food and service. The food remains unchanged. It\'s well prepared standard breakfast fare. \n\nThe service on the other hand is, frankly, abysmal. Today for the first time in my life I got up and walked out of a restaurant leaving the meal barely touched. That was after waiting for someone to take my order (i eventually had to track down the hostess, who eventually sent a waitress who said she was "just informed" there was a customer at the booth. Another ridiculous wait for the food - again only coming once I complained to a staff member (the one waitress in the place that seems to genuinely care) to be followed by another wait for toast while everything else went cold. After almost 40 minutes I lost patience and walked out.\n\nI could blame the hostess and the waitress, both of whom could be kindly described as indifferent and probably more accurately categorized as both lazy and indifferent. They don\'t deserve blame though. They were only doing what comes naturally to staff when the management stops managing.\n\nI\'ll give the owner(s) some unsolicited advice. \nOne: \nTry spending some time in your store. The staff (especially the young ones) wander around aimlessly with no desire or understanding of what is expected. When a waitress tells me she needed someone to notify her she had a customer  I really wonder if she ever bothers to look at her station. That\'s so bush you should be ashamed of how little you put into training and follow-up.\nTwo\nPut someone on hostess duties who is actually going to greet customers within a couple of minutes and knows the extent of her (his) job. Currently you\'ve got a parade of amateurs  - usually waiters or waitresses who have their own jobs to do. Alternately ask the person who seats customers to inform them that they are now being abandoned. At least prepare the customer for the rest of the non-service coming their way.\nThree\nIf you really don\'t care about your restaurant - sell it. The food is good. There are some staff members who really do care about doing a good job. Before you kill a good thing at least profit from it.\nFour\nIf you actually do care about your store. Get your ass off the couch and get back to work. Clean house. Light a fire under the lazy ones and if they still don\'t rise to the job boot them out. Inspire the good ones to meet your standards (you\'ll need to show everyone that you actually have those standards - something not currently evident)\nFive\nLet me know when you get your act back together.

I finally get them to offer me a free order the next go around which I accepted.  This is when it goes to an all new high.  After explaining once again to the manager who had no idea what I was talking about, instead of them making it right I was told to get the fuck out of there store.  I was threatened by the owner who called me a fat fuck and told me I didn't know who I was dealing with that he fucks bigger guys like me all the time.  He threatened me with bodily harm, He picked up a two by four and told me he was going to bash my head in with it.  All this over $20 dollars.  He then calls the police whom I anxiously await for, only to be told that I'll need to file a small claims suit in court.  I gave them the chance to credit my credit card or to make it right and this is how they chose to handle it.  I beg of anyone considering ordering from this place to reconsider and go elsewhere.

S'Believe the hype - it may just be a food truck, but Top Notch Barbeque is a legitimate BBQ game-changer in Vegas, with the potential to do for que what Slider Truck did for burgers. \n\nThe Las Vegas Weekly just recognized them (rightly) as the best BBQ in Vegas, which is a refreshing change of pace in a city that insists on bowing at the overrated altars of flavorless Famous Dave\'s or jerky-tough Memphis Championship.\n\nThe thing to order here is the pulled pork sandwich topped with Cincinnati chili. It\'s like two of my favorite foods ever made a delicious baby. Served on a crispy toasted bun, the sandwich is a brilliant "why-didn\'t-somebody-think-of-it-sooner?" pairing of rich, smoky (apple and pecan wood, I think?) and impossibly juicy pork shoulder and just a touch of sweet, spicy Cincy chili. Honestly the pork is a little more chopped than pulled, and while I generally prefer the latter, this is perfection. Especially when contrasted with the relatively thin texture of the chili, which is a perfect example of the unique, cinnamon-centric regional favorite. The only other spot in Vegas serving Cincy chili is Egg and I/Egg Works, and to be honest I find their chili to be overly sweet and a little dry in comparison. But this? The real deal.\n\nThe only other meat I\'ve had there is their hot link, which is juicy with a nice snap - I wish I had ordered it with the chili. Their potato salad is the only side that I\'ve had, and it\'s superb. I\'ve heard many good things about their sweet potato casserole and baked beans and definitely look forward to trying them.\n\nTheir sauce comes in mild and spicy; as is custom I opted for the hot. Which actually had a fair amount of bite - a rare thing for me to say about anyone\'s BBQ sauce.\n\nA word must be said about the service. Pitmaster Jimmy Cole is welcoming, outgoing, energetic and friendly - and his passion for what he does comes shining through.\n\nI just wish they\'d sell the chili on its own. Because I would put that on everything.'

S'Dang, where is the crackhead ghetto speaking midget counter guy as was described in another review?  I was hoping to take a picture of said employee because it was a hot day (102 degrees) and I was ready to unload some insults at someone.  Instead, we have a cool, nice, and efficient counter guy.  Did they have the nerve to fire above midget?  Or did he leave for a better paying gig? Aw dang, normal hard working people are so...boring.  So, anyway, I settle for a medium burger with the works but no egg or chili.  My brother had the same thing\n\nI wasn\'t there when the previous yelpers had a bad experience.  But we clearly enjoyed ourselves. Based on those previous yelp reviews, I also didn\'t want to get food poisoning so I watched them make it from start to finish.  To my surprise they were actually very clean on a Saturdahy night at 7 PM.  In 10 minutes, the guy brings out our tray.  Now I am a clean table freak at time.  So of course, I had to wipe down the table we were sitting in even though the table looked clean.  I do this all the time. \n\nSo I take a picture and take a first bite of the burger.  Very good...hot patty nicely grilled with a pile of letttuce, tomato, mayo, and mustard.  The bun was grilled, too which is important to me.  Who wants floppy buns?  \n\nThen I take a taste of the crispy, greasy, sweet onion rings.  Its was a 3.5 burger but 4.5 onion rings this time.  Both were just cooked and just fine.  While people in the casino said words like "Da!! I lost my money" we said, "Yum, we\'re gaining calories with a Fatburger fat burger" and it was good. With a soda, it\'s over 12 dollars, a lot more pricey than In N Out, a 5 star place for me most of the time.  This was a 4 star trek for some decent burger and 0-rings, and hope my luck doesn\'t run our either with the good burgers and casino if I ever gamble.'

I ordered a large 3 topping pizza with extra cheese as one of the toppings and when I got to the store to pick it up the cheese didn\'t even cover the dough in the center of the pizza, how is that extra cheese.  I asked them to add more cheese so they remade the whole pizza and again I could see dough in the center of the pizza.  I sooooo would not recommend this location. A few days prior I ordered from the one on Sunset and Pecos and my pizza was ooozing with cheese at least a 1/2" thick so obviously I expected consistency as this is a chain.  The employees at the Nellis location barely spoke English and are definitely not about good customer service or customer satisfaction, I will never go back there again.'

S"We were really sad to see Lao Thai go and were even sadder to read negative reviews when Pon Ocha Soup first opened.  But, boy, are we the happiest campers in the Wild Wide East now!\n\nAfter reading a couple good reviews recently, we decided to try Pon Ocha Soup.  Upon arriving, the decor is almost the same as when it was previously Lao Thai.  The buffet station is still there, and the same elephant tablecloths are still there. \n\nThe menu looks a bit smaller and different, but they were actually able to make the dishes on the menu. (Lao Thai had a bigger menu, but they weren't always able to make certain dishes.)\n\nWe had the sausages (appetizer page; I don't know the name), the pork skin with Chinese broccoli, the tom yum noodle soup and the raw shrimp salad (on the a la cart page of the menu).  \n\nThe plate of sausages were plenty of food for the two of us.  They were actually better and juicier than before. The pork skin w/ Chinese broccoli was not salty and the pork skin was perfect.  The noodle in the noodle soup was a bit soggy, but it was still very good.  Last but not least, the raw shrimp salad!  Oh my gawd, I could not believe it when the fiance pointed it out on the menu.  Not long after we ordered, I heard the food processor in the kitchen and I knew the wonderful ladies in the kitchen were making the deliciously spicy green sauce for my raw shrimp salad.\n\nIt was the last dish to arrive, and it was everything I could hope for!  After eating my fair share of raw shrimp salad in Bangkok (Thailand, that is), I know what it is supposed to taste like, and this is no joke!  Aside from the freshness and the deliciousness of the shrimps and the sauce, they gave us at least a dozen shrimps in that one order!\n\nThe service was wonderful albeit the server who seems to have problem with hearing us.  We are definitely going to come back regularly to Pon Ocha Soup and we are happy to have probably the best Thai restaurant in town so close to our home!\n\nOne last last thing is their lack of a liquor license, but that's not their fault.  The chef tells us they are waiting for its approval.  Five stars!"

S'With $1.00, I can either get 4 gum balls from the gum ball machine at the mall, or choose an item from the plethora found on Wendy\'s value menu.  I rarely choose the gum balls.  I give Wendy\'s 5 stars because in my opinion it is everything you could ask for in a fast food joint: Value, friendliness, and most importantly, speed.  I like to play a game called \'How many seconds from the time I finish placing my order until the time I have my order in hand and am driving away?\'.  Today it was 24 seconds - now that\'s fast food!  They are so quick when taking the order, charging at the first window, and delivering your food to you at the second.  And that was around the time of the lunch hour rush.  My favorite game, however, is called \'Don\'t come to a complete stop when picking up my food\'.  Since they usually have my order hanging out the window before I even get there, I can just roll right through, grab my food while still in motion, and be on my way (With a "Thank you" of course).  This location usually has hot girls working there too.  Did I mention that the girls at both windows said "have a good day!"?.  Well now I did.  In fact, the second one even asked me how I was doing, and while I know their bosses tell them to say those things, my friends at Wendy\'s almost always sound more genuine than at other places. Many times I get the mandarin chicken salad, which is amazing, but today I got a jr bacon cheeseburger, a crispy chicken sandwich, and a frosty.   I never expect gourmet from Wendy\'s, especially from the dollar menu, but it\'s good food and definitely worth it, especially the decadent frosty.  The only complaint I would have is that the first-window girl was not hot like the second-window girl.'

But somehow truth has turned into myths and I don\'t know which is which... \n\nAnyways, people tell me Villa Pizza used to be THE neighborhood pizzeria to go to, but looking at their website, Villa Pizza is a chain, it has always been a chain. So... what\'s the dealio? Was there another Villa Pizza? \n\nAnyways... onto the review... the pizza. It\'s good. Pizza cat says it\'s edible, typical NY style made with cheap ingredients. The crust saves the day, it\'s a good crust, perfectly browned and foldable. This is about as "authentic" NY style as you can get, down to cheap-grade pepperoni. \n\nPizza Cat says to avoid anything with spinach in it. They use frozen spinach, and poor quality at that; it tastes like the green garbage you\'d leave behind in the school cafeteria. \n\nPizza Cat says it\'s a well-made pizza but the cheap ingredients and average sauce put it on the same level as Sbarro\'s. It\'s edible when a pizza craving hits, but nothing worth eating otherwise (really, not even worth Yelping). It\'s just another chain.'

S'My husband and sister surprised me with my 40th Birthday at Aroma Garden Cafe. The food, staff, and location were great! The guests were treated with Hummus, and a variety of salads that were fresh and delicious. The Entree Choices were chicken breast with wild mushrooms, sauted crusted salmon, chicken shish kabobs, NY strip steak, Filet mignon, and lamb chops. I ate the lamb chops and they were prepared perfectly to my liking. I got to taste test the filet mignon and the chicken dish with wild mushrooms. They were also fantastic.  I am a new fan of the Aroma Garden Cafe and I look forward to dining again with my hubby soon.'

Some new furniture. Some extra wall sockets. But a significant improvement given how tired this Taco Bell location had become. The change in the exterior is also a noticeable upgrade. And I suspect the added square footage behind the counter is a boost for employee morale. Also improved restrooms.\n\nJust think, this Taco Bell was narrowly saved, thanks to some legal wrangling, from being converted into a Fry's Grocery Gas Station! Phew!!! Now it's all new and shiny! Well, mostly new and shiny.\n\nA well below average Taco Bell before the remodel, this location is now quite nice. Still, the Taco Bell at nearby Tatum & Bell remains nicer.

S"Going to the Strip makes me wish I had more than one stomach. I'm not a Pittsburgher; I visit because my boyfriend has family here and on our trips I get fed pretty well. That said, I've recently started making sure that some of the limited real estate in my stomach gets dedicated to eating in the Strip, with the biggest parcel of space going to La Palapa. Admittedly, I have a soft spot for Mexican food, perhaps because although I live in Kentucky now, I grew up in Southern California. Let me say that I'm not grading on a curve based on what may or may not be available in the region. La Palapa is good, period.\n\nYou'll find the stall in the Public Market under the thatched roof that is the business's namesake. On each visit I've been served by the same very friendly man (likely the owner?). I get whatever tamales are available and they've always been great. They're corn husk tamales (as opposed to banana leaf). I challenge you to pick a favorite between the red and the green sauces. The beans and rice should not be missed. I'm normally more of a pinto bean girl but these black beans are seriously great. I hope to eventually try the empanadas but again, just one stomach, so we'll see if I ever make it that far.\n\nIn the event that a tourist is reading this, the address that is currently listed on the Yelp page is the South Side location. This review is specifically for the location in The Strip, which is in the Public Market on 2401 Penn Avenue."

The place doubles as a bar up at the front and a unique sit down family restaurant towed the back. \n\nAs far as the bar goes, the drinks are super cheap, and they have 40s to go at the cheapest price on Carson St. The bartenders are always friendly, and ready to mix up your next favorite drink.\n\nThe food like is super good, known for their deep fried fish sandwiches, all of it is home made. I personally love their clubs and Reuben sandwiches. The place always has great food specials, and the family owned staff is always super friendly and ready to serve. The food is also super cheap compared to other bars in the South Side. They could definitely up their prices 20% and still be reasonable. \n\nOnly negative thing I would say about this place is it needs updated a little. Lose the old paintings on the wall. Haha'

S"I saw in our neighborhood newsletter that Banzai had opened up on March 3rd.  Last night my wife and I went up there to try it out.\n\nI am glad that another sushi bar has gone into this location.  I was a big fan of Blue Wasabi at DC Ranch because it was great atmosphere.  At times we were there 3-4 nights a week.  Banzai Cowboy certainly is trying to make their place a fun spot to be.\n\nThe owners of this place are the former owners of NYPD Pizza, so they have the restaurant experience.  The food was very good.  For their second day open we didn't have any problems with dishes coming out wrong (which is typically when some places open their doors).  The staff was friendly and had a great attitude about the place.  \n\nThe menu is nice and has a bigger variety, food wise, than what Blue used to have at DC Ranch.  We tried a bunch of their specialty rolls and thought all of them were good.  They have about a dozen martini's on the menu and I only tried two of them last night.  They were pretty good.\n\nMy only complaint is a small one.  I started out by ordering a tall Captain and Coke, my standard drink.  I was disappointed that instead of being served in a pint glass (or something of similar size) it was served in one of those narrow Collins glasses.  Had I known I never would have ordered the drink tall because there really isn't any benefit too it. \n\nThis place has got different stuff going on every night, so they should be able to bring in a decent crowd.  25% off on Monday if you wear Cowboy or Japanese apparel.  It's spelled out on the menu with the details.\n\nKaraoke on Thursdays and a bunch of other stuff the rest of the week.  I really hope this place does well because it is nice to have a fun, casual sushi bar in the neighborhood."

Their Salt and Pepper shrimp and Lemon Chicken in particular are very good.\n\nSince Chinese New Year is coming up on January 23rd, I\'m suggesting as many Montrealers and Yelpers go to New Dynasty to help them out and get back on their feet again and show that Montrealers are better than what was depicted on that video.'

Lest this appear to be only a game meat restaurant, let me mention that our friend, a vegetarian, asked the waitress what they could do for him and they brought a tower of pureed root vegetables on a bed of chickpeas, along with a variety of the vegetable sides that were featured in the meat dishes.  Madeleines for dessert and a very respectable espresso finished an excellent meal.  Bring your own wine.  Under $40 per person."

When you walk in the music is loud and the decor is very dark and uninviting. They were out of salsa first of all and out of two fountain drinks. No straws either. We both ordered chicken burritos with cilantro lime rice, black beans, corn salsa, lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. Found burritos very skimpy on the meat and very flavorless. They forgot to add sour cream and lettuce. About 5 minutes of getting meal a worker came over with a bunch of loose lettuce and said she forgot to add it.

There were 6 huge tv's above the front  bar - each showing a different channel. Each booth had a separate sound speaker so you could listen to the program of your choice. Cool right? We reviewed the menu and decided on the all you can eat sushi for 18.95. Strangely enough - there was no description of what ingredients were used in each roll. Hmm, ok . Well we decided on a few rolls - not knowing what they were - dragon roll? sunset roll? Should we just pick the most expensive ones and hope for the best? Our order came out and it was plentiful. Two huge plates of sushi. I was so excited and  dug right in. The first bite was unfortunate as I believe the sushi might have been bad. My stomach will probably let me know later. It just didn't taste right - sour, old, something was off. I thought i was being picky so I had another. Same odd taste again! I smelled it and not the right smell either. I am really hoping that it was an error in my judgment. What really bothered me was the rolls. Inside each of the rolls was this Costco-style, fake crab stuffing. Each roll had a ton of rice, fake crab/mayo stuff, and a little fish. We were so bummed and reluctantly finished our plates and made a dash for the door. $40 bucks not well spent here - oh well."

S'Rule of Thumb: Don\'t call the name of your restaurant by the dish you make the worst.\n\nI\'ve watched how the number of this restaurant\'s clients has dwindled since the opening a couple of months ago. In fact, a few red flags were raised in my mind when I realized I was the only one in the restaurant at a peak lunch hour one weekday. \n\nWhen I break it down, the problem here is three-fold.\n\nTo begin with, it probably has the most uninviting entrance I\'ve seen in a long while. In both instances that I\'ve visited, I felt as if I was going into an illegal establishment where illicit substances are manufactured and sold to the masses. The stairs leading up to the restaurant are creaky and narrow, with antiquated walls and run-down surroundings. The only identifier of where the restaurant is, is by the banal sign that stands outside the door, which from time to time, gets blown down by the mighty gusts of Charlotte\'s southern winds!\n\nSecondly, its conveniently (or not-so conveniently) set up right next to a place that also produces Asian delights 7 times faster, cheaper, and arguably more delicious (Tin Tin  Box Noodles). Additionally, they\'ve been around for far longer than Rice Inc. has. To any outsider, it\'s almost like you\'ve created that barrier to entry for yourself. \n\nLastly, the food here needs an entire revamp. At no point will any client walk in and say, "wow that was really good! I\'ll be sure to come here again" because it tastes and looks like a watered down version of the same Asian food that "Simply Asia" sells in your local supermarket. There\'s no differentiating factor, save for the portion size.... which is actually tiny (so that negates the attempt at cost leadership). To top it all off, the RICE does not do justice to Asian Culture!!!!! My ancestors lived off of that stuff for centuries! I\'m certain they would scoff at the dry, clumped up grains called rice here. \n\nIn short, every menu item here is a standard and generic form of short-cut Asian (Chinese? Thai?) food and it shows from whatever viewpoint you\'re looking at it. What a shame!\n\n2/5'

It's a small Indian restaurant with a great eat-in lunch menu that includes soup and rice or naan.\n\nThe issue I have with this place is the inconsistency in the service and the quality of the food.  Sometimes the food is great and the service is fast.  Other times it seems that you have the service very slow and you have to ask for every single little thing, which seems to just annoy them and make the service even slower.\n\nAlso, although the lunch specials are a reasonable price (although the portion can be a bit on the small side), the dinner pricing is pretty expensive for what you get."

S'What can I say other than this place just plain stinks. I usually do not give 1 star ratings but this place had it coming. We went there with friends for dinner and there were several issues. First of all the waitstaff were very snooty and unfriendly. I got the vibe this place was big for the local Myers Park crowd and the whole atmosphere smelled of rich arrogance, so I was a little put off from the start. Secondly, they need to learn how to cook Filet, Both myself and my buddy ordered the Filet, I ordered it medium rare and he ordered it well. The steaks came out cooked identical, both were cooked well done. For a place that seems so arrogant they need to work on their skills in the kitchen to back up the attitude. The third and final insult came with the french waiter there dropped a knife not only once but three times on my wife, all without apologizing. I was beginning to think they were trying to tell us to leave. Save your money, you can get a better steak at Longhorn without paying a premium.'

S"I can't tell you how authentic this might be, but it sure is delicious. Rather than have one of the varieties of fried chicken, I had the grilled. It arrived with a whole lot of chicken on the plate, a good amount of fluffy rice, some salad and a grilled jalapeno (that was pleasantly warm and not overly hot). Speaking of hot, it was right off the grill and plenty hot.\n\nService was good. There is a television (tuned to a Spanish-language station) and a small play area for the kiddies. Soda is canned Pepsi varieties, they didn't appear to have a fountain.\n\nGreat food, good service, decent price."

S"The Skinny: Extremely good value for a pretty tasty three course menu with white linen tablecloths - for now this is a lunch only place (4) Service is super friendly (4).\n\nOpus Too is the Art Institute's Culinary school restaurant. Yes, it's the training ground for the chefs of tomorrow. They are open 3 days a week for lunch only during the school year. They also require advance reservations.\n\nThe choices are eclectic (to introduce the students to different types of cuisine) so do check out their website before you go to see what they offer. They serve something very different every 1-2 weeks. The food is pretty good (3 stars-ish) and has an outstanding value ($10 for starter, entree, and dessert). Service, albeit untrained, is enthusiastic and pleasant.\n\nIf you have the time one day during the week to check this place out, do go. You won't be disappointed."

S"Went to Gary Canter's Deli for lunch with my wife and friends from California.  The deli is located between the Race & Sports Book  and the Poker Room.  It's kind of hard to find if you don't know where you're going.\n\nI had the Gary Canter Special, which was a huge sandwich with Pastrami, Corned Beef, Turkey, Honey Ham, Muenster Cheese on Rye Bread.  My wife had the 1/2 Corned Beef Sandwich with cup of Matzo Ball Soup.  Both came with a side order of fries.  The sandwiches were ok, not great.\n\nMy sandwich had a ton of meat on it.  I don't really like it when the meat is piled too high.  It tasted good but it didn't blow me away and leave me wanting more.  The fries were not good at all.  They tasted a bit stale and cardboard-ish.....no real flavor to them.  We tried to get chips instead of the fries but were told it would be an additional $2 for chips...what?  For a small 4 oz bag of Lay's?  Fuggetta 'bout it!\n\nMy wife enjoyed her cup of Matzo Ball Soup....again, not blown away.\n\nBecause this place is located in a casino, their prices are pretty high.  My sandwich was $13.99 and the 1/2 sandwich & cup of soup was $9.99.  Kind of high for so/so food.  Good thing my friends were paying for lunch....otherwise I would have been upset.\n\nWill I return?  Probably not....unless I was starving and my friends paid for the meal."

S"I really wish I could get good bagels in this town but really I feel like Einstein continues to be best for the price. Bagels forever is ok too. I live right around the corner from here and as a bagel addict I thought I had hit the jackpot but no dice. Rather, these bagels are a little too dense for me so they're chewy but don't have the right fluff. Also, this makes toasting them result it a stone-like circular object. They are decently seasoned. \n\nWhere it goes downhill is the price/lox cream cheese. Their lox cream cheese is basically this pinkish brown tasteless muck. It adds nothing which is sad because I love lox cream cheese when I don't feel like shelling out a ton of money for the real deal. So my favorite bagel in the world (Poppyseed with lox spread, onions, and capers) does not hit the spot at all. Instead, I find myself having trouble finishing it. \n\nNone of the other things I have tried have been better than a 3 and they're all at least 9 dollars. The salads look good but I have yet to try them because I only go when I have a bagel craving. I also had this meat and barley soup one time and it was the fattiest soup I have ever had in my life. Blech.\n\nI'm going to go again and hope for the best by just ordering plain cream cheese and maybe something in the glass showcase but it pisses me off I can't even go to a bagel place and be satisfied with what I would actually want. \n\nAlso, I realize bagel chips are a good way to deal with old bagels but who the hell gives bagel chips as a side with a bagel??"

This is good and bad, keeping a majority of the loudness away from the Gamers, yet making it tough for most of the bar to see the band.\n\nVery good Domestic Beer prices at $2.50, but the Liquor is another story, with Fireball Shots at $4.50. Higher than probably every bar within 5 miles. Most bars in the SouthEast are prices $3.00-$4.00.\n\nFood is nothing spectacular, mostly frozen/fried appetizers. Jalapenos are fresh but flavor leaves a lot to be desired and with 6 halves on a plate, very over-priced.\n\nBurgers are very small and not even close to worth the $7.00 charged. A $5.00 Burger at best. \n\nNachos are typical for a bar and way over-priced at $7.00\n\nMake sure to lock your cars/trucks.

Our friends joined us a little while later and we sat down and ordered some appetizers.  We had the Sambuce, which we were told was actually a Persian dish....it was the best thing we ordered.  The stuffed mushrooms were terrible, the crab cakes, equally as disappointing, definitely, NOT Lump Crab.  There were five of us and 2 of the entrees were sent back.  Even the entrees that were not sent back, were average at best.  The rice was bland and hard, the chicken dry, the balsamic reduction was like molasses.  The Manager, who initially was very friendly, never came to our table once he knew we were unhappy with our food.  They made no offer to compensate us for our displeasure, not that we were looking for anything.  We were overcharged for a very mediocre meal at best.  Very disappointing."

The only reason that I was able to enjoy anything from this place is that I took my birthday off from work and just so happened to walk-in and give this place a try.

The casual intimate lakeside dinner included chicken and proscuitto and a not greasy crisp Italian cheese loaf, all served family style. The next morning we woke up with a spicy Eggs Benedict. Thanks Ed!!\n\nOriginal post for the Phoenix location:\nThis place is a hidden gem. It's a tiny place and the hours of operation are up to the owner, so you have to be flexible. Despite that, it's worth it. \n\nDon't expect a 6 page laminated menu with a perky waiter that also sings. The multicourse meal is carefully chosen by Ed based on availability of seasonal ingredients. You can sip an apertif while you watch him prepare your meal. If you're lucky (or cute), he may also offer you an assortment of house cured salumis with your apertif.\n\nI have a sweet tooth and unfortunately he doesn't do desserts. If you are like me and don't feel that the meal is complete until you've capped it off with something sugary, you'll need to stop by a bakery on your way home.\n\nHe also does catering for larger parties.

Every other order I get from here is either wrong, cold, or takes forever. \n\nToday I went in to pick up a couple of pizzas for my kiddos.  While I was waiting for the clerk to finish with a couple dining in I noticed that there were signs all over the counter saying that there was now a charge for cheese and peppers. Let me rephrase that, it said, "Now available for purchase". Sneaky, huh?  I don\'t know why exactly but this totally rubs me the wrong way. I have both of these items at home so I didn\'t have to purchase any but I would have been pretty ticked to pay almost an extra dollar for some fake parm! What\'s next? McDonald\'s charging for ketchup packets? They said it\'s because people take too many and then just throw them away. I\'m sure that happens often and it\'s unfortunate but a part of the business. I\'m going to be in trouble if Starbucks starts charging for cream and sugar.\n\nI think I\'ll find a different location to use. If they are that hard up for cash that they need to charge for cheese and peppers who knows what other short cuts they\'re taking.'

S'I, for one, am shocked by these awful reviews!  I was staying at a nearby hotel for a Balloon Twisting Convention and was given several area restaurant menus.  Well, when my friends and I pulled up to Rice King, the general consensus was to go to the (awful) Hawaiian Food place a couple of doors down.  Halfway through that meal, I was so disgusted with the Hawaiian shortribs that were inedible, that I headed to Rice King.  I thought, \'ok, so they have an old menu, but that just means they\'ve been there a long time,so they have to be good\', and I was right!  \n\nRICE KING has the BEST Crab Rangoon that I have ever had.  EVER.  \n\nThen there\'s the "Grandma\'s Salad" which I ordered every single night of our 5 night convention.  The GS was spicy-sweet with delicious crisp veggies including the main ingredient, cabbage.  We even stopped in again on the way back from some Arizona Spelunking.  \n\nMy business partner also concurred that this place rocks.  We both enjoyed ALL the food we had there, including some fantastic vegetable Lo Mein where the veggies were so fresh and tender-crisp (instead of soggy, nasty, overcooked vegetables like most Chinese Restaurants serve).  \n\nI wish I could remember all the dishes my friends and I had over the course of the convention, but suffice to say, we all enjoyed it!\n\nThis place has been in business for 20 years, and I know why.  Good, fresh food, served by a very nice gentleman (the owner), Vincent.\n\nMy partner and I are no slackers when it comes to Asian food either.  I\'ve lived in NYC and had fantastic Chinese Food in Chinatown there; and we\'ve both dined in San Francisco Chinatown and MANY other SF Bay Area restaurants.  We consider ourselves Foodies, and are always trying new restaurants.\n\nEach day, I was chanting "RICE KING, RICE KING, RICE KING" (like when they chanted "FOOD KING" in Animal House).\n\nGo check out this place.  Yes, the decor needs some, uh, updating (or MOBILE would be better), and the menu is old and, uh, not pretty, but the food rocks!  Good stuff!!!\n\nDang, now I\'m craving some Grandma Salad.  And Crab Rangoon.  And.....RICE KING!!!!'

S'I have been wanting to write a review about this Sonic location. They are consistently VERY nice, order always correct and hot, and the ONE TIME  we had to wait longer than a couple minutes (this only happened once and we live down the street and order here often) they apologized many times and delivered our order along with coupons for a couple of free sandwiches. For a fast food place they go above and beyond. The McDonalds across the street could learn a thing or two from them hahah :)! \nGreat job running the place and what wonderful staff.

S'Consistently good food served in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.  I like the salads, pannini sandwiches, and smoked salmon plate.  Deserts are fresh and delicious.  Two for one drink specials in the early evenings and coffee is very good as well (a coffee and a desert will make a good meal for most).\n\nThis is a neighborhood restaurant for me (I live a block away) and I go there often.  Between late May and early September the street in front of the restaurant is closed to traffic and they also serve on a deck built onto the street.  By the way, the restaurant sold to a new owner several months ago (April 2011) and the restaurant is now called 1000 Grammes.  The menu and staff are the same but the name was changed from Kilo because the seller wanted too much $$ for the Kilo name.  Kilo == 1000 Grammes (cute huh?).'

S'We decided to try this place out as we had received a mailer for AYCE dinner for less than $20 a person; however, when we got there, they were having a special of $16.95 a person, so we nixed the coupon.  We did have to give our information to get the special pricing (i.e., name, address, etc.), so of course I gave fake information.  The place was a little weird; the location (next to Sonic) is not ideal and there is a smoke shop inside also.  I have never seen a smoke shop in a sushi restaurant, especially in such a small restaurant.  \n\nThe sushi selection was not expansive.  The iced tea tasted horrible.  The rice was a bit hard/overcooked, but overall, the sushi rolls were edible.  The server/owner was nice, but a little too curious to know how we heard of his restaurant and also proceeded to tell us details about how expensive rent at the restaurant\'s former location was.  It was a little awkward since no one was there, so we felt like our every move/word was being watched/heard.  Dessert selection was also not great.\n\nWhile it wasn\'t a "terrible" experience, I suppose I would rather pay the extra $10 a person and eat at a better sushi restaurant in the area.'

S"I'm from Philadelphia where there is a much larger Asian population than there is in Pittsburgh. I was excited to find a place that served Vietnamese food but was extremely disappointed with the quality of food and service of this restaurant. The broth for pho does not taste like traditional broth; it tastes like it was made using artificial flavoring rather than from roasted spices/bone/onion/ginger. The noodles are thick unlike noodles typically used in pho. Overall the quality of the food was terrible, and expensive. I can get a large bowl of pho that tastes considerably better for $6-7. Drinks were extremely expensive? $5 for thai iced tea? Bye.\n\nIf you're looking for better Vietnamese cuisine in Pittsburgh, try the Strip District. Don't give this place a shot, or you'll regret it."

S'(3.5 stars, rounding up because I feel generous...)\nReally enjoyed brunch on the patio here. The place is stylish and classy, with all white decor and interesting design. Even the flatware and dishes are cool. The unisex bathrooms are definitely worth checking out -- feels like a club in there:P \n\nThe patio is small, but on this particular Sunday it wasn\'t too crowded (we went around 11am). It\'s mostly covered, so you get the nice open-air feel without boiling in the sun. \n\nThe espresso is excellent and while you are waiting, they bring Carrs crackers with brie and pate. I had "Les English" - which came with a omelette with ratatoille (you could choose plain, cheese, or vegetable ratatoille), hash browns, sausage AND bacon, toast, and a fruit cup. It was a lot of food! The omelette was great - the eggs were light and fluffy. Everything was good, except the fruit cup was that kind that comes in syrupy water and was not very fresh. Friends had the eggs benny, which looked a-mazing and Le Nordique (fish, potato, smokes salmon pattie, sort of like latkes). \n\nService was very relaxed and warm. Kudos to our waitress for switching back and forth from English and French seamlessly and without attitude (half our table was Francophone, half Anglophone). I would come back here again for brunch, or maybe cocktails, next time I am in Montreal and in this neighbourhood.'

Didn't really taste the alcohol, which is fine, because I was just having it with my meal. \nThe nachos were ok. They didn't look like a lot on the plate, but they filled me up.

S"So a friend of mine is here for business and I we ventured out to the Westgate area. I had not been over in the area for quite some time since moving to North Phoenix and I must admit, it has changed (but for the better of course) \n\nWe were seated immediately as at the time we were the only customers in the restaurant at the time, I was around 5pm and everyone knows that if there is nothing going on at jobing.com arena, then business is pretty slow around those parts. Our waitress, Michelle, was cheerful and not overbearing. Me likey! \n\nMy friend ordered the crab and shrimp stuffed ravioli and I ordered the prosciutto and fresh mozzarella panini. Now although my friend enjoyed her meal very much, I was disappointed as I didn't realize that my panini was not going to be the warm panini that I am so used to. Had that been the case, I would have ordered the scallop and saffron risotto which was the risotto of the day. Darn on my part. I will admit that Michelle did offer to have them warm it for me or get me something else, but I told her not to worry about it. It was my mistake for not checking to see if it was going to be warm. Take note, not all panini's are the same. \n\nFor dessert, we both ordered the key lime pie which actually turned out to be a key lime cheesecake. I swear it said key lime pie and not key lime cheesecake as we both ordered the same thing thinking we would get a key lime pie. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I was hoping for the actual key lime pie. Darn. \n\nSo again remember, not all panini's are made the same. Make sure that if you order that to ask if it is going to be warm or cold. Also make sure that if you order a pie its an actual pie and not cheesecake.  I may give this place another try if I am ever out that way. Remember to ask for Michelle. She was great."

My friend's brother was DJing here so we ate dinner before he started his set. It is a hip trendy place. During the early dining hours the sliding glass partitions were folded to allow fresh air to come in. It is dimly lit, but the atmosphere is laid back. The food was great. The meatballs crumbled in my mouth and the sauce wasn't too overpowering. The mac and cheese was good, I did want more. The sea bass though was really good. It was warm buttery and flaky. The assortment of desserts were good. I was addicted to the creme brulee.\n\n After dinner they move the tables and open it up as a dance floor. The glass partitions close and the dancing started. I didn't really venture outside my group of friends, but it was a young cool crowd that night. The set was hip-hop so the music was fantastic to me. It was packed with people til 3am. If you know UFC, apparently GSP was there the night I went. Sucks I didn't know. But I heard he goes there alot. It's always a good time at Med. Everyone should go when Toddy Flores is DJing."

I was a little shocked at some of the prices (in particular the Croque de Fruits) which is yogurt fresh fruit and Quakers Croque Matin. But then the bowl came and I can see why! It was on the side gi-mongus and could have feed a few people. I could only eat about half of it before I had called it quits. \n\nIt was amazing however that we got seats straight away (considering it was 1130am on a Sunday) My friend who dislikes breakfast food was disappointed however, that they do not offer any of the lunch options on the weekends. So she ended up with a grilled cheese sandwich that comes with fruit and potatoes (which was surprising a good deal for all that). Lastly my other friend got a regular eggs, toast, bacon, sausage and potatoes. \n\nEverything was good, coffee refills were speedy, and overall a decent breakfast place for sure. The only complaints: they opened the door to the patio a bit, and someone was smoking outside, and it came straight inside ruining the smell of breakfast; bathrooms are single stalls, which caused a pretty large lineup of people. Other thing to note: if I get this again, I will ask for the Croque de Fruits without powder sugar on top (unnecessary IMO) \n\nI would eat here again if asked. :)\n\nPS: They gave out roses to the ladies because it was mother's day!"

Fairways were in good shape, traps were all raked and edged and the greens were pretty fast. Outside of a few dry patches on the greens and some unmowed tee boxes, I was very happy with the course. Very wooded in some areas and there are some places where a driver just won't work off the tee. Very rarely will you find wide open shots if you miss the fairway. \n\nNormally priced at $60 for a Saturday round, I found a coupon, as usual, on clickitgolf.com that had $10 off. There was a tournament /outing there late morning, so with our 8:30am tee time we were able to get out and back in less than 4 hours."

Fries were amazing!  Almost forgot to mention that. Then again, after waiting an hour to get some hot dogs and being hungry for hours before finally getting to eat, my mind could be playing tricks on me. \n\nAs far as food truck hot dogs, I prefer Short Leash, but if I'm craving hot dogs and these guys are around, I'd be sure to hit them up."

S'Although I definitely like meat, this is fast becoming one of my favorite places! If you want high quality, well prepared food and you\'re up for a tasty dose of veggies, this is the place for you!\nI have know the owners casually for a number of years. They have been at this location for a while, starting out with a coffee shop, and recently reinventing themselves as a vegetarian restaurant and smoothie bar, and I am so glad they branched out because they know what they are doing!\nThe place is very cheerful and clean looking, and the inside feels spacious even though it\'s a small place. In fact, you can miss it real easily because it is so small on the outside. It is part of a strip mall at the entrance of Regent Park on the opposite side of the parkway from Food Lion.\nThe first time I had lunch they had a Dried Tomato and Scallion Quiche for their special. It was divine: very thick, about 3", in a flaky crust with a wonderful Spring Mix side salad with homemade dressing.\nAnother time I had a Lemon Raspberry Tart. It was delicious and the texture was like butter, while the fruit flavors were intense.\nMost recently I had the Spanish Tamales with melted cheese and Black Bean  Pur\xc3\xa9e. I loved every bite!\nThe portions are not large, but adequate, so a big hungry guy might want more, but it is perfect for me. It\'s an unexpected gem of a restaurant for those who want healthy.'

S'Steak Frites is a steakhouse where you\'re encouraged to bring your own wine. The ambiance of the place is very nice and can be used for fancy get togethers with friends/family and even in a romantic setting.\n\nI warn you to not come here without a reservation because you\'ll be turned away from the door, it has happened to me... with most of the resto being empty. Reserving the same day requires you to call in and hope they call you back before your plans come into fruition. In my case, call them at noon and get a call back nearly at 4 for a 5:30 reservation. This can be very inconvenient unless you really plan ahead. Reserving online is an option as well, as long as you do it beforehand.\n\nOrdering is a little bit different as well, the online website has no menu per say, just pictures of various plates. When you\'re seated, they don\'t give you a menu that\'s just a simple table d\'hote with a few options. Anything else, they encourage you to look at the various types of chalkboards in the resto (sometimes forced to leave your seat to actually read them...) to find something you want. The description is pretty bland with with the item and the price-tag beside it. For example "Steak Frites = $26" or "Ribs = $24". To find out what exactly it is you ask your waiter what it consists of and hope for the best.\n\nI went with their Steak Frites option which consisted of a few greens with a acceptable cut of meat (I believe it was frank steak) that I choose to be cooked medium-rare. The fries are free refills and are quite excellent! For the price, I would have liked the cut of meat to be a bit bigger, considering the price-tag. However, it was succulent and flavorful albeit cooked a little too raw for it to be perfection. The pepper side-sauce this meal came with wasn\'t for me.\n\nFor dessert, I went with the creme brulee which was very good and a cappuccino which was very well prepared.\n\nThe service was good and we weren\'t rushed while we ate.\n\nThe price-tag for what I ate was quite high. While I truly enjoyed the fries and creme brulee, the main meal was only decent and I didn\'t feel that it was worth over $50 for a single person with no drinks other than the cappuccino. I feel their profit margins for their menu can be reduced to be far more competitive to other Steakhouses that are located very closely to this place.... but hey... that\'s just me.\n\nI\'d recommend to try it out at least once.'

S"At Yuki Ramen, you can get noodles... and more noodles. But they are damn good noodles! I order the BBQ pork noodle soup here almost every week and I never get tired of it. For $6.95, you get a large bowl of chewy, springy, long wheat noodles that are hand-pulled to order right before your eyes, steaming meat broth that is light and flavourful, but not overly salty, thin slices of Chinese barbecued pork, baby bok choy or nappa cabbage, green onions, and cilantro. \n\nThe menu is limited, with only about 8 options. I've also tried the beef noodle soup and the minced pork noodle soup and they were both good, but the BBQ pork one is by far my favourite. The only drawback is that Yuki Ramen is located in the Faubourg food court, which could really use a facelift. But you'll forget your surroundings once you dive into your hearty bowl of savoury noodles!"

S'My experience here was awesome from start to finish.  I was greeted by an extremely friendly, smiling man (I believe to be the owner) who helped me with my order decision, took my order, then asked me to "please, sit down, be at home".  Awesome.\n\nI inquired about the salad and asked if they put any feta on the salad (they don\'t), he followed up informing me the sauce they serve has dairy, but that he would substitute garlic sauce instead.... now this might not seem like much, but to someone who has food allergies like myself, having someone with intimate knowledge of the ingredients and the care to make sure they don\'t serve you anything that might not agree with you is really a blessing and gives you assurance when you eat there.  Huge bonus.\n\nI had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous, salad, rice, cucumber (substituted instead of pita since I don\'t eat wheat... nice touch) and a side of garlic sauce.  I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma, but he insisted I try.  Well, he was right, I will say now I love chicken shawarma, Aladdin\'s chicken shawarma.  Their gyros was awesome too.. homemade, not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety.  \n\nI paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake.  Service was awesome, food was awesome, and they were able to easily cater to my picky food needs.  A+!'

S"Due to my incurable desire to try all the food trucks in Vegas I had to stop by  Flow Rider truck since it was not too far from where I live. Flow rider truck's design is interesting, you can't see in the pictures but it has a background of the strip to go along with its sin city theme.\n\nFirst off I would like to say that their portions puts pretty much everything to shame. I'm thinking that goes along with the sin city theme, giant proportions that are not good for you, but you can't help. Food can range anywhere from $4.50 to $20. The $20 item is this huge burger with 8 sirloin patties and many other things. \n\nAnyways I only ordered two lunch specials, the mini loco dog and the mini hydrolic, but man for $4.50 it makes me regret touching subway. I believe that there are four specials, which are mini versions of their regular menu, comes with a McDonald's medium size of fries and a 20 oz soda, great lunch deal if you ask me.  This is not diet friendly food, but you only live once. Moving on the mini loco dog which is 6 inches, its a California street dog of giant proportions. The huge beef dog is wrapped with bacon and top with avocado, lightly grilled onions, relish, some kind of sauce, and maybe parsley and jalape\xc3\xb1os? The only nitpick I have with it is that my bread broke in the middle so it was a bit messy, but good nonetheless. \n\nThe fries were lightly crisp and nice, but were unseasoned, which is ok for me since they provide a station of the side for you to add your condiments and seasonings. \n\nThe lady who took my order was nice, told me how although flow rider truck is new they have been in the mobile truck business for a few years.\n\nOverall I like flow rider truck and hope to visit them more often in the future."

I'm guessing they did this to compete with the McDonald's that will be opening around the block in a few months.

Wandered in on Friday afternoon last week with a couple of friends and we were I suppose lucky to get a table straight away as the place was heaving. Once seated the number of other customers revealed the first downside to the cafe - its acoustics. Either this was an unusually loud collection of customers or anything over half full always results in such a cacophony but it was noticeable for the entire time we were in there and as such offputting.\n\n\n Waiting time, service, quality of food (eggs florentine, beef olive and lamb shank) and prices (the pot of tea was particularly good value for money) were all fine but I'll think twice about going back in if the number of punters is that high next time."

S"COOKIES!!! Back when I was a carb eating machine, I would eat cookies from here without abandon. I've always preferred the thin, slightly crispy yet soft cookies from Great American Cookies over Mrs. Fields. These are the type of cookies that you get from slice and bake dough like you make at home. If that's you type of treat, then this is the place to go. Some of the frosted cookies can be a bit sweet but I've tried almost every variety this place sells and all of them are good (the snickerdoodles, sugar cookies topped with cinnamon-sugar, being the standout flavor). Swing by the food court if you are in the mall and see if you can snag a free sample. They are usually handing out samples of their chocolate chip cookies. If you are lucky enough to encounter a freshly baked batch of cookies coming out of the oven, buy them! You won't regret it!"

Good God get the Sizzling ninja, top that off with a fried egg, and pineapple, get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then DRENCH that bowl with NINJA SAUCE AND SRIRACHA (which comes standard btw) AMAZING! Don't waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop, i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did!  And for those wondering they don't serve pirates (some will understand this fact)  Also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at YOUR FACE LIKE NINJA STARS!!  I joke they don't throw them but you may get some for free (really though)!"

S"The beautiful Carin and I decided to go dinner last night and wanted something burger, within walking distance.\nI had seen a review of Fusion and the burger looked pretty good so we decided to try it.\nWOW!!! I have had most of the burgers in the greater Phoenix area and around the USA, and this is in the top 5 of any burger, anywhere ( I am including Taylor's Refresher in St. Helena, CA and the BigAss at Roaring Fork, among others).\nThis thing was more than I could eat (admittedly after the more than delicious Panko breaded Calamari appetizer and a really good vodka martini). \nThe caramelized onions and jalapenos are the perfect sweet counterpoint to the meat, bacon and cheese and chili/cheese sauce on the burger.\nI brought about 1/4 of the burger home and I think it will be lunch today. Carin had the same thing (we both just wanted a good burger and wanted to try something different...we have been to Stax, etc., and they are good, but this was decadent).\n\nThe prices were good ($48 for 2 burgers, an appetizer and the marti), and I understand they have 1/2 price happy hour during the week, so we will be going back soon!!!\n\nThe service was also terrific, our waiter was attentive without being intrusive, the elements of the meal showed up exactly on time, and we had chance to have really nice chat with one of the owners, Jen Lynn ( I hope I spelled that somewhat correctly).\n\nI recoomend that you give this place try, esp. if you are burger fan."

S'Lightning fast "strip-mall" style Chinese food.  It\'s exactly what you expect it to be.  It\'s a great spot to stop by after work and pick up a quick take-out meal for the family, but I wouldn\'t expect too much by the way of "cuisine".\n\nHad the beef with broccoli, kung pao chicken, and sweet and sour chicken recently.  All of which were made from picky-eater friendly ingredients, and were a hit with the kids.  I do like the fact that the staff is all Chinese and a few words spoken from the customers in Mandarin seem to go over well.\n\nOverall it\'s nothing special, but a decent value for a mid-week take home meal.'

The bread was great, they didn't skimp on the meat, the bacon was real and not that floppy chewy stuff-it had a nice crunch to it, but wasn't overdone and I really love their peppercorn sauce! \nMy boss goes there all the time so they must have good service and decent prices. \nI recommend you check it out!"

I called on a Monday to confirm and got a dude saying they close 9ish. I showed up and they have a menu that states pretty simply, 11am - 10pm 7 days a week.. Buffet closes at 9:30.\n\nThey didn\'t speak about, point to or even half heartedly gesture to the menu. I was immediately pointed to the buffet and told "have whatever you want" or something similar. There were 6 veg options,  4 meats (biryanis and curries), nan, poori and bhajis, kheer and pleasantly hot gulab jamun, average (free, unlimited) lassi, some good chai,  and decent chutneys and lemon pickles.\n\nMeals ends with mukhwa, but the candy and plain fennel seeds are kept in seperate bowls.

S"This restaurant is really great in theory, but poorly executed. I really struggled between 2 and 3 stars for this place, but ultimately decided on 2. Our reservation was for New Years Eve. When we arrived, our table wasn't ready yet so we were provided a seat at the bar and took a look at the drink menu while waiting. They offered to allow us to order and our drinks would be served at our table upstairs, but we decided to wait. We eventually worked our way upstairs, and the dining room was quite small with about 7 tables in total. \n\nI decided to order the Pork Belly with black pudding mash, and my husband went with the Water Buffalo roast. We also both started with the Parsnip soup and ordered a bottle of wine. When our server brought our wine out, he set it down with two glasses and we were left to open it by ourselves. I mean, it was a screw top bottle, but I've never had to open my own bottle of wine AND pour the first glass in a restaurant EVER.\n\nThe soup it's self was quite good, not much else to say about, it was soup, ha ha. The pork belly its self was REALLY good, especially with the apple and cinnamon sauce it was served with. However, everything from there went down hill. The vegetables didn't have much flavour, they just tasted like boiled vegetables. The black pudding mash also didn't have much flavour, they just tasted like dry mashed potatoes. I thought they needed more salt and pepper (which in my defense, I NEVER put on food in restaurants) but there was no salt or pepper on the table. My husband roast tasted like any normal roast. There wasn't anything necessarily wrong with it, it just tasted like a roast you'd get in any pub. His vegetables were much like mine, but his roasted potato was quite good. Especially in the gravy served with the roast. \n\nAt the end we decided to order a couple whiskeys as our dessert before heading off to celebrate new years properly. You have to pay for your meal downstairs, which I thought was a bit odd, but oh well. The service that night was particularly slow. Which surprised me given that there were 7 tables (only 6 of which were sat) and there were 2 servers. \n\nAll in all, this restaurant really has the potential do and be something really special. But instead, the food is more like something you'd get in a basic gastropub."

S"The BRGR truck is now parked at the parking lot across from the courthouse(Forbes & Grant) M-F, 11a-3p. This is a nice addition to the downtown lunch scene, especially in light of Winghart's closing for renovations. The truck has a pared-down menu consisting of about 5 beef/veggie/turkey burgers(All around $8), 3 sides($3), basic shakes($4), and a few daily specials. Interestingly, the truck has brought back BRGR's old 'Add Foie Gras to anything' policy - $12 extra gets you a slice of guilty decadence. \n\nThe service on the truck is pretty quick, our burgers were ready in under 10 minutes from ordering, served to us in paper boat trays wrapped in tin foil. There isn't really anywhere to sit in the parking lot of the truck, so you'll need to have somewhere else to eat, especially in the cold. Additionally, we went around 1pm and there was a short line of about 3 people. \n\nFor more about the burgers you can read any one of the numerous reviews at the restaurant. The food here is identical, definitely not my favorite burgers in town. My burger tasted like it got an excessive salt rub - big crunchy hunks of salt were charred to the bottom of my burger, and while I like salty food, it was way too much, and overpowered the tiny bit of chipotle mayo. \n\nMoreso than its food though, the BRGR TRCK(ha) is important politically. Pittsburgh's laws on food trucks are arcane and are inhibiting a lot of great businesses that are now operating only at events. You can read more about the effort to get Pittsburgh's laws changed here: http://pghmobilefood.com/ . In the meantime though, BRGR's truck is getting the word out that trucks can provide quick, affordable lunches, and increase the diversity of available food to downtown workers that would be otherwise unaware of these issues.\n\nSo, go out and grab a burger and help Pittsburgh catch up to other cities with great and vibrant food truck communities. \n\n\nAdditional note: You can get the truck at your event/business for a minimum food purchase of $500 for the first 2 hours. More info on the website. Cards accepted, too."

The staff is generally pretty nice and effective, the only time I have issues is when I'm ordering multiple sandwiches at a time, then things start to go screwy. One major plus I'll give them is that the vegetables are always fresh and while not overly liberal, they have no problem filling the sandwich with veggies if you ask, which are the two major things I don't like about most locations. Overall, I like this experience more than most subways, so kudos there"

This place has some very interesting burgers on their menu including a burger served on a donut, a burger with mac and cheese on it, a burger with bacon and eggs on it, a burger with pastrami on it.... the combos were odd and plentiful. he husband got the burger with the mac and cheese and it was really good. He won the food contest for sure. The best part of this burger? The mustard....it was really tasty mustard. I got the mother hen burger that has an egg and bacon on it. The bacon was very crispy and tasty. The only issue was that the english muffin was a little small and the burger could have benefited from a different sauce from the one that came on it (a sriracha aioli)... maybe like that mustard? Oh ya.... We also got the cheese tots with the chipotle cream cheese... that was pretty delicious. I think I gained 10 pounds from the one meal, but it was worth it. Although this is not my favorite burger in town, I would like to make it back there soon and would recommend that you check them out!'

It's all very tasty, but it's more the homely atmosphere, New York Dolls on the stereo, and comical but fun sense of organised chaos when it gets busy, that combine to ensure I keep coming back.\n\nFred's cappucino is excellent, and he sprinkles loads of chocloate on top.

You wouldn\'t be disappointed if you went in expecting to find this!\n\nHaving been in for lunch and snacks on previous occassions, we tried them for breakfast on Sunday.  The breakfast service seems new - it wasn\'t as organised as the rest of their usually good service.  \n\nIt was, however, generous and delicious.  Not haute cuisine but perfectly tasty breakfast nonetheless, and good coffee.  It was a hard choice, as usual, to choose what to have...all the deli items are so tempting that actually plumping for a traditional breakfast seemed a heart-breaking waste!\n\nThe odd item I\'ve ordered in the past doesn\'t quite reach the otherwise high standard of their deli choices but, overall, a consistently good to excellent experience.  I don\'t think I\'ve ever been truly disappointed any of the times I\'ve been here and feel a little like I\'m being unfair only giving three stars rather than four.

S'I\'m in Edinburgh.UK for a little under 2 weeks for work.  I\'ve been here before, and I know that Scottish food is pretty bland, so I came here with pretty low expectations.\n\nHowever, for a restaurant in the UK, I would say that this is a pretty decent restaurant.  For starters, I had some smoked salmon wrapped in cream cheese and a minestrone soup.  The smoked salmon was pretty good, it came in 3 pieces.  There was a bit too much cream cheese for each piece, so I only had one and shared the rest with my co workers.  The minestrone soup was very good and refreshing, considering the weather is currently in the 50\'s - 60\'s and I came from Houston 80\'s - 90\'s degree weather.\n\nFor the main entree, I had a shrimp dish, served on rice, in a creamy mustard sauce.  It was alright.  The sauce felt overwhelming, and it was poured all over, drenching the rice, so it was hard to take any bite without a spoonful of the mustard sauce.  Mustard is a strong flavor and it felt like they used a bit too much mustard.  The shrimp were small pieces cut up into smaller pieces, which was not what I was expecting either.  \n\nJust a note, "lemonade" means sprite to them.  Not fresh lemonade.\n\nOverall, still a better meal than anything I expected.'

It\'s 100% Americanized without an ounce of authenticity but damn it\'s cheap, it\'s fast and it tastes good!  \n\nMy favorite is the house special chicken (similar to General Tso but tastier!), and my second favorite is the crispy honey. Yup, I like the 2 most unhealthy items on the menu - big surprise ! \n\nSo the thing to order here is the Wok Combos. For $6-$7, you get an entree of your choice (House Special chicken!), a side (the highly mentioned cream cheese wontons), AND rice or noodles (Egg fried noodles baby). It\'s a high calorie, highly indulgent feast of Americanized "chinese" goodness!'

It\'s the same place as it was 20 years ago.  That being said, the Pho is \'good\' but not outstanding.

Namaste offers up all of these delightful factors for your consumption, plus the food looks great when it's presented, with the traditional brass looking bowls and serving spoons. This is well above average Indian cuisine, and really reasonably priced considering that fact. I love the Karahi dishes, and the classic Rogan Josh, but there are a range of both Indian and Nepalese dishes to select from.\n\nThe staff at Namaste are super friendly and accomodating, and there's a fair amount of seating room, although you might have to book ahead at weekends. The interior, although nothing super fashionable or over the top, is comfortable and feels welcoming. You're also minimal steps away from various Grassmarket drinking joints if you fancy imbibing a few after dinner."

Unfortunately, the Veggie Hot Dog is not a part of the $1/dog promo, but I thought it was still worth it. For a Veggie HDOS, plus large lemonade and fries, it was about $9. I thought this was a bit pricey, but being it was my first time, I was okay with paying it. The veggie dog was good. First veggie dog I've ever eaten. The flavor was similar to a regular hot dog, and the texture was actually pretty firm. The lemonade was freaking amazing, maybe the best I've had that I didn't make myself, and the fries were pretty decent. My co-worker had 3 regular HDOS. He said they were very good, though his stomach hurt a bit after devouring them. \nThe batter is not corn dog batter, so don't just expect a regular corndog. The batter has a different flavor, and is pretty decent. \n\nI am sure that the veggie HDOS contains milk or casein and they are fried in the same oil as the meat dogs, so they are definitely not Vegan."

S'Castle Terrace isn\'t normally the kind of place we would choose to frequent.  We love great food but Michelin stars often mean something which is a bit beyond our price range and level of enjoyment.\n\nFortunately Castle Terrace\'s three course lunch is actually therefore quite a bargain (for what it is), coming in at just under \xc2\xa330/head.  \n\nOn arrival we received three canapes which I\'m actually seeing in someone else\'s picture - a deep fried ravioli, a mini burger and a "Cesar salad" in a bite. All good, but slightly more interesting and small than actually truly tasty. I\'m also a bit surprised that they seem to have been serving the same canapes since at least the end of 2013. \n\nFollowing the canapes, we were treated with a "cheesy baked potato" amuse bouche, which was absolutely brilliant.  Give me a vat of that.\n\nOur starters were both lovely - The Man opted for the Gurnard tartare and I had the crispy Ayrshire pork, though admittedly mine was a bit on the tough/dry side. The taste was great, though.\n\nOur mains were the highlight.  I had the Hake on Thai style veggies which was absolutely phenomenal except for the old, hard broad beans which could have been easily left out.  The Man fell in love with his squid cannelloni and thought the spelt risotto was the best he\'d ever had.\n\nFollowing the bites, the amuse bouche, the gorgeous warm sourdough (which I forgot to mention), starters and mains, we were pretty stuffed.  But, it\'s a three course set menu so might as well get desserts, right?  We also fancied coffees, so each ordered a creme brulee and an espresso.  \n\nThe espresso arrived with three little petit fours which were certainly a nice touch but at that stage were incredibly overboard. Especially considering they, like the canapes, were rather nicer looking than they were tasting.\n\nWe were, therefore, rather put off by the fact that we were ultimately charged for these petit fours that we didn\'t order. Our bill noted that our espressos were something like \xc2\xa35 each, which included the petit fours. I found this quite cheeky considering we only ordered coffee and goodness sake, \xc2\xa35 for an espresso?  I think not. \n\nOverall it was a very enjoyable experience. The service was attentive without being oppressive, and professional without being cold. The food was very good, but I just slightly felt overall that creativity was slightly lacking.\n\nMaybe the lunch menu is affordable for a reason and the true stars are the full price dishes, but I don\'t imagine I\'ll ever find out.'

They have a small and large size. I got the small, and to be honest, it was large in my opinion! So to have the big would be massive! Plus it's only $9.99 vs $13.99. \n\nI also loved the dressing and thought the salad was loaded with the good stuff, the toppings. Sometimes they scimp on the toppings, but they didn't. The salmon was a decent size and cooked perfectly too. \n\nLooking forward to visiting again... I'm coming back for the sweets, don't you worry!"

The order will come with ceviche, chopped up soft octopus, and cooked shrimp.

However, if you are staying somewhere else, it is definitely worth a trip to this cute neighborhood and great restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is intimate (I counted 13 2-tops total), with one bright yellow and blue room, and vine-y plants hanging in the windows.  Get the full menu... for only an additional $8, you can have a choice of entree (meaning appetizer) and dessert added to the main course of your choice's price.  My favorite was my daughter's duck done two ways.  My son also had an amazing ravioli with duck confit.  I started with the snails (perfect texture, neither chewy nor mushy) and had the mixed grill, which was also delicious and perfectly cooked.  My husband had a salad with gizzards, which doesn't sound like something you want, but believe me, it really is.  Desserts were also impressive.  The wine list, not available on the website, is on a chalkboard in the restaurant.  Most bottles are in the $35-55 range, with many glasses available from $7.5-9.\n\nThere was one cheerful waiter (he's actually from France) serving the whole place and making it look easy and fun.  And I think the chef/owner cooks everything himself.  We got to meet him at the end of the meal because a big table of 8 people requested him to come out while everyone was finishing desserts.\n\nI will definitely return, and this restaurant will replace L'express for us...it is also an excellent restaurant I have reviewed here, but Jurancon is much more charming, and the food is more adventurous."

I was actually quite excited due to the other reviews that I\'ve seen on various websites.\n\nFirstly, the waiter that we had was friendly and was very enjoyable to talk to.  Food took a bit longer to come by, however, it was a great experience.\n\nThe bread and spreads that they offered as a starter at del Dente was AMAZING.  The bread is baked in a flowerpot, so that was quite different.  They offered a few different types of spreads for your bread - including garlic, and an apple-cinammon one.  \n\nWe started off with the "fish cakes" - which were Breaded crab & whitefish cakes.  It was pretty good considering that I\'m not a huge fan of crab cakes.  I ordered the apple poached salmon (which I\'m not sure if it\'s still on the menu now).  It wasn\'t the best salmon I\'ve ever had, but it sufficed.  My friend had the lamb sirloin, and according to him - it was delicious.\n\nFor dessert: we ordered the del Dente\'s cheesecake creation with orange coulis.  It was quite impressive.\n\nAll-in-all, a great experience with the service and the food.  I think next time, I shall try out one of the pastas!'

S"Surprisingly good. Crawled into this place after coming off a binge, (won't say what, but I was zombie status) craving some soup, I was tempted by the super nachos, asada nachos they call it, if your not familiar with super nachos, it's a big plate of messiness, chips beans guacamole sour creme cheese pico meat salsa. A bunch of shit all combined to make your nachos super. I ordered that and a shrimp cocktail, shrimp cocktail was ok, they don't have tapatio there, I need tap with my cocktail, so it wasn't as good to me, but this is my substitute for my filibertos super nachos. Also stopped in for a burrito another day, and was happy I did. They are open late and conveniently close to home, stop by if your as unsatisfied with fili b's as I was."

S"Eating downtown is generally expensive, but Osteria does it right--their happy hour special is what brought me here the other week. $12 gets you an appetizer sampler of your choice of three out of five options (I had a mozzarella sandwich, flatbread and roasted red pepper dip,  and unbelievable meatball sandwich sliders). The roasted red pepper dip was possibly some of the best I've had in the city, and you really can't beat the price. Everything is share-able, we were able take it all down with a beer or a glass of wine, and it didn't put too big of a hole in our pockets after tip.\n\nThe service is quick and easy and the waiter couldn't have been nicer even though we were obviously not ordering much. It's a great location, too!\n\nI can't wait to come back to try an entree. Or another sandwich. Or more appetizers."

S"This place just takes itself a little too seriously.\n\nI like nice d\xc3\xa9cor and surroundings just as much as anyone else when I go to a restaurant, but I really don't need to read about who designed it/what fabric they used for it/where this particular cushion was imported from in the menu. By definition, when I open the menu it's because I'm hungry and I want to eat.\n\nAfter all their obsessive descriptions about every aspect of every single item that was within a mile radius of the restaurant, I couldn't help but suspect that they were doing it to dazzle you so much that you wouldn't notice if the food was mediocre. And it turned out I was right. I have no doubt that the ingredients were all grown especially for them and probably flown in on a private jet or something equally ridiculous, but there are so many other great food places along George IV bridge that I did feel a bit ripped off.\n\nBeing part of the Hotel Missoni, people will always eat here. Mainly because of it's reputation and because it's the kind of place that you can name-drop. But unfortunately the quality and style of Missoni clothes doesn't transfer to their hotel restaurants."

S'We have a group that meets monthly and have been to George & Dragon II one other time so we felt safe going back, but this time was like day and night. We got there early because we planned on having a dozen or so people there on a Friday evening, and there was a larger party in the back room. The other half of the room was empty so we asked to sit there. The waitress agreed so we took a seat. We asked for drinks which took a few minutes. Two friends came after we got our initial round, and they were ignored. The waitress seemed to be more interested in the larger group with the bigger tip. \n\nPart of our meeting dealt with being online since we\'re a technology education group, and we were blown off. Finally we were told that they no longer have wireless (which they use to "share" with the hotel next door). This was really annoying, but we weren\'t offered any excuses or apologies. We put away our laptops and prepared to enjoy an evening of drinks and dinner. \n\nAfter an hour of literally not getting served (drinks or food), we waited for a table to open in the front. A few of our people were annoyed and left without ordering anything and another person was told not to bother coming. We finally got a booth out front and complained to the waitress there. She said the next round was on the manager, who she supposedly told about our unhappiness (but unsurprisingly, he never came over at all to talk to us). We got our free drinks and two of us who were famished were able to eat. \n\nAs soon as we were done eating, we got out of there and parted from the bust of an evening. We quickly removed George and Dragon II from our rotation of places for this meeting. \n\nFrom the fact this is has become a dive bar (absolutely NOTHING like the AWESOME George and Dragon I on Central), that the wait staff mostly sucks, and that they don\'t seem to care about customers, we are completely done with this place. DO NOT GO HERE.'

S'Also ich muss leider auch zwei Sterne abziehen. Nachdem ich jetzt ein paar mal da war, muss ich feststellen, dass der Service doch stark nachgelassen hat. Vielleicht w\xc3\xbcrde es Sinn machen, wenn sich das Serviceteam mal kritisch mit den Kritiken auseinandersetzt und damit arbeitet. \nZum einen ist es mir v\xc3\xb6llig unverst\xc3\xa4ndlich, wie man an einem Sonntag die Getr\xc3\xa4nketheke mit lediglich einer Person f\xc3\xbcr Zubereitung und Service besetzen kann. Ich habe geschlagene 16 Minuten anstehen m\xc3\xbcssen. So etwas ist ein NoGo. Die Pastak\xc3\xb6che hatten in dieser Zeit \xc3\xbcbrigens Langeweile, da muss sich dann halt mal einer einen anderen Kittel anziehen und flexibel sein. \nZum anderen muss den Kunden das System offensiver erkl\xc3\xa4rt werden. Wenn das der Service am Eingang nicht immer schafft, hilft auch ein Schild mit ein paar Piktogrammen. \nWeiter geht mir das Pl\xc3\xa4tze reservieren der meisten Kunden wirklich komplett auf den Senkel. Vapianos in anderen St\xc3\xa4dten haben schon gelernt damit umzugehen und ich w\xc3\xbcrde mir hier eine steilere Lernkurve w\xc3\xbcnschen. Da kommt man sich schon vor wie im 3Sterne Club auf den Balearen, wenn zuerst einmal die Tische reserviert werden und dann das essen geholt wird. Damit sind die Tische dann grunds\xc3\xa4tzlich ca. 15min l\xc3\xa4nger besetzt, als wenn die G\xc3\xa4ste sich einen freien Tisch suchen, wenn das Essen fertig ist. Der Service ist dann auch komplett \xc3\xbcberfordert, wenn es Krach zwischen den G\xc3\xa4sten gibt, der auf Grund der fehlenden Regeln leicht eskaliert. Wo soll man sich auch hinsetzen, wenn \xc3\xbcberall Handt\xc3\xbccher \xc3\xa4hh Jacken liegen. Systemgastronomie beinhaltet das Wort "System" - sollte man mal dr\xc3\xbcber nachdenken. \n\nMein Fazit daher: Was andere Vapianos schon gelernt haben, muss sich in Karlsruhe noch einschleifen. \nMein Tipp: Mal ab und zu einen anderen Vapiano besuchen und lernen.'

Stale biscuits, soggy lettuce, a "steak" with the fat not trimmed off, I could go on and on. There aren\'t a lot of places out here so I gave this place several chances to straighten up and it just never got there.'

S'I really wanted to like this place. I even prematurely took a menu because I thought I would be ordering dinner as take out from this place as everything looked super healthy in a biggest loser sort of way. I ordered the Antioxidant Salad (see photo) and it was AWFUL. The lettuce was fresh looking but had tons of wilted slimy pieces on it. The chicken or turkey was dry and chewy. The walnuts were not candied and the salad dressing was non existent. Basically this salad was not even edible and I ended up throwing it out after I picked out the edible bits. Sad :('

S'My friend and I decided to try Technique since Du Jour was booked.  I\'m glad that I had an opportunity to try a new school.  I love that this culinary school restaurant actually looks like a restaurant.  \nNow for the food.  We started off with the bread.  Yum!  It was delicious.  Next came the appetizer.  My friend and I ordered the scallop with risotto.  I kind of with now that I had gone with the pork belly.  The scallop was perfectly cooked, but the risotto lacked some flavor. :-(  Then came my main course.  I ordered the chicken dish.  The chicken was so dry.  It was stuffed with something.  I can\'t remember. what it was supposed to be stuffed with, but when I looked at the chicken, the "stuffing" was the tiny little area in the chicken.  It had no flavor at all.   The whipped potatoes were fine.  I\'m not sure why I got the chicken.  So not like me.  Next time I will get the steak.  I tasted my friends dish and it was great!  \nNow for the dessert.  That was the best part of the whole meal!  It was a ginger spice cake with a sour cream ice cream.  Delicious!\nThe whole meal cost only $13 plus tax and tip.  \nI under stand that these are students the are still learning, so you might not have the perfect experience.  But I think that this place is worth a trying over and over again.  If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would.'

S"I've been meaning to visit this place for some time now. It is basically a sort of sandwich shop/cafe, but as they state on their website: 'But the main difference between social bite and the rest is that 100% (every single penny) of profit goes towards solving social problems. This is not a token gesture. This is not a PR spin. This is just a different kind of business. A business to help others. This is a Social Business.' \n\nSo I went here today to do my bit and get a saintly lunch! They have such a wide range of delicious sounding salads, wraps, sushi, noodles, paninis, sandwiches, and hot food. I chose the Chorizo, Pear and Manchego Cheese panini. The staff were absolute sweethearts and the panini turned out to be absolutely delicious! \n\nUnfortunately, just after I bought my panini I noticed their pie menu on the wall and had major food envy. Their pies so absolutely mouth watering, but that's OK, it just means I have to go back soon to try one! :)\n\nI paid slightly more (\xc2\xa33.99) than I normally would for a panini, but the ingredients were delicious and fresh and off course my money was going to help others so I am more than happy to pay a bit extra!\n\nI strongly recommend this place and I'll be back there very soon. They also offer loyalty cards which is a good incentive to keep going back."

I went to the location on Bell Rd. before but that location had since closed.\n\nThis location seems to be a little roomier and cleaner. You can't beat the all-you-can-eat breakfast, that is a fact. Bacon, biscuit and gravy, pancakes, scrambled eggs, fruit, and much more to choose from. \n\nDon't try to re-use your plate like I did though because they will take it away from you! Just go back and fill yourself up a new plate and they will come by to pick up the old one. \n\nThey give you a bill when you are done eating and you pay at the front register.  Nobody showed up at the front register to ring us up for a good five minutes or so.

S"I'm a local, so I suppose I'm a little partial for neighborhood businesses, but Pittsburgh Fish & Chicken is certainly a great option if you live in Brighton Heights or you're just passing through after work with a hankering for fried.  You're mainly going to find all things fried, with the exception of a few individually packaged desserts and waffles (which accompany the Chicken & Waffles dinner special), but fried is what they do well here - with a mildly spicy, lemony dusting of their signature spice blend.  Avoid the fries (unfortunately they are not fresh-cut) and the sandwich version of any of their fried offerings (the buns and accoutrements are second rate).  Yes, the place is a little shabby looking, but the cooks are friendly enough, and lord knows we need more local business, and dinning options in particular, in our proud neighborhood.  Try the ocean perch, catfish, or the chicken tenders, which are surprisingly awesome, even for an adult palate.  The best bet is to order ahead and have your fried feast waiting for you."

S"I frequented Bruegger's a lot in my childhood and I still do so I have a soft spot for this place. Bruegger's offers a selection of bagels, sandwiches, soups and salads. The Bruegger's on S Aiken does a great job in preparation. If you're not getting a simple bagel with cream cheese, the items are about 6-9 bucks but the quality is worth it. They actually mix all of the components of your salad in a bowl before they put it in a container whereas other locations will just put the fixings on top with dressing on the side. I have enjoyed their breakfast sandwiches, signature bagel sandwiches and salads. I haven't had their paninis and their coffee is just a-ok which I'd go elsewhere for that.\n\nSurprisingly they have wi-fi though I have never seen anybody studying/working with a laptop. This location is nice in that it has a whole upstairs to eat your food but the configuration of entering and ordering doesn't make sense to me. When you enter the store, the cash registers are in front of you and then off to the right is where you order. They have a big ORDER sign in wooden letters above the counter where you order but I just noticed it. Hopefully I am not the only one!"

When we arrived we showen 2 our table stuck away in the corner and giving the set menu something they forgot to tell me when I booked the table. The waiter brought us wot we thought was a complimentary glass of bubbly each or so we thought until we got our bill.  Not been a fish eater my choices where limited with 3 starter's I been fish and 2 fish mains so starters we opted for the ravioli and soup and mains my wife for the monk fish and me for the loin of pork served with blue cheese not been a lover of blue cheese I opted not 2 have it. So the starter's came soup quite nice but under seasoned and the ravioli was far from being al dente the only flavoursome part of it was the sage butter sauce. Mains not much better the pork was served with roast veg (a few slithers of red onion and courgette) and a potato flan im still wondering where the flan cane into it not sure if it was mash or boiled potatoes the pork to me was rather dry to We choose the strawberry tir masuo for dessert witch was a complete let down it was more like a cream sponge with half a chopped strawberry on top with a swoosh of chocolate sauce and strawberry coulis. Finished with what I would say was the worst brandy coffee that I've had in any restaurant I've been in. Disappointment is an understatement especially when the bill came and found out we were charged for the bubbly we never ordered."

S'This place is supposedly owned by the same people that own Sapporo. Or maybe it was and isn\'t now, I don\'t know. What I do know is that we have been there many times and the one constant is the shiiiiiiiitttttty service. Here\'s an anecdote: \n\nThree friends and I went to Ten to get some sushi. We ordered sushi. My little deal is I like to order spicy tuna rolls but--get this--add avocado. Because avocado is good. The couple with me orders a spicy salmon roll, which ordinarily comes with avocado--except that they didn\'t want the avo. So, among other things, we should be receiving spicy tuna rolls *with* avocado and spicy salmon rolls *without* avocado. Backwards, yes. \n\nWell of course I wouldn\'t be writing this if that\'s what had arrived. No, alas, we got our rolls but sans modifiers, i.e. spicy salmon with and spicy tuna without avocado. So I politely pointed this out to the waiter. The appropriate response would be: O. M. G. I\'m so sorry--be right back with the correct order. Nope. The waiter looks at the rolls and then goes to check with the sushi chef. He returns and tells us (!) that the rolls are actually correct: that salmon colored roll is indeed tuna, and the tuna colored roll is, in fact, salmon. When confronted with the issue of salmon colored ties (not to mention half of Craig Sager\'s wardrobe) being named after the wrong goddamned fish, the waiter could only muster a vacant stare and offered to talk to the manager. TALK TO THE MANAGER? \n\nSo the manager comes and reiterates: yes, that is indeed tuna. "The one colored like salmon?" Yes. "And the tuna colored one?" Salmon. Ah. "Would it matter to you if I told you that I ate the \'tuna\' roll and it tasted conspicuously salmony?" No, that is indeed tuna. We add to our tuna (insert name of some made up, nonexistent spice that turns tuna salmon color and vice-versa) and that makes it look that way. \n\nNow I\'m making this story drag, I admit. But the concept of someone so brazenly lying to me (or just being plain fucking stupid) is highly irritating to me. If it weren\'t, I\'d watch fox news. But no, the manager and waiter all stuck to their story. What I should have done is played along and ordered a spicy "salmon" roll, complete with avocado. But I was too pissed to do that, and so instead I argued with the manager and embarrassed my friends. Sorry all. \n\nMoral of the story: Ten has mediocre food and fucking dipshits working the sushi bar. If you trust these mensas with raw fish that you\'re about to eat, go ahead. Otherwise I recommend Celsius or Shogun. (reviews to come, maybe.)'

I ordered the $6.95 lunch special that came with java rice, atsara and macaroni salad. The portion was huge! The meat was marinated in something similar to what you would get at a Hawaiian BBQ joint. It was grilled to the point that the outside was crispy and the inside was moist and tasty. The java rice was eh okay. I should have substituted the garlic fried rice for it like my friends did theirs. It was almost like yellow rice with BBQ sauce and bits of meat in it, not a whole lot of flavor. The macaroni salad was a treat though, I think it had pineapples and raisins in it? The atsara was different than anything I've had before. It was raisins, carrots and pickled mango. It was a nice burst of flavor to offset the mild rice and macaroni salad. I definitely want to come back for the Filipino Breakfast specials (I love me some Longaniza)."

An incredibly friendly team of people!  And while sitting and eating two different people stopped to ask us if we needed anything and how our food was.

S'24 hour coffee, free internet, lots of seating. What is there not to love?\n\nDuring exam time the place gets very crowded with students revising, but otherwise you are guaranteed a seat for your morning coffee, pre-clubbing energy boost or just a hangout while waiting for someone.\n\nTheir filter coffee comes in more than five canisters, each with a different flavor. This is Heaven, as usually the house blend filter brew in other coffee shops is nothing short of vile. Some coffee joints seem to scream "here\'s crap coffee for poor people!". Thankfully this Depot hasn\'t adopted such tactics. \n\nI like my coffee to be Chuck Norris, therefore I love their darkest Italian roast and regularly get it.\n\nI am sad to report their cannoli aren\'t up to scratch. A cannolo\'s filling should be heavy and filling ricotta goodness. The ones I tasted were filled with either whipped cream or a ricotta that must have seen the inside of a bike pump.\n\nHowever, as we are over 4000 miles from Palermo I can\'t complain too much. Their coffee rocks, their staff is friendly and their Wifi is free. Enjoy.'

S"Took the family for a weekend lunch and had a very enjoyable meal. The service was attentive and polite and helpful - described all the specials before we ordered - never let our glasses get empty even after we paid the check. The sports bar motif was toned down by a soft comfortable decor and the TVs (while every 10 feet) were just loud enough to follow the commentary, but did not interfere with conversation. Food was good and plentiful. My son had an amazing build-your-own burger deal - put whatever you want on it (he had fried egg and bacon) for only 6.99 and that includes a large helping of tasty crinkle fries. My wife had an excellent wrap and I had chicken tenders (their version of boneless wings) which were larger than expected and perfectly coated in BBQ sauce (not dripping, but fully covered). Kids menu, while a bit short, was well priced at 3.99 and included drink and plenty of food. I'm looking forward to trying the pizza next time."

There was no way to choose around this. \n\nI had to settle for instead of 4 courses to get 3, with a overdressed salad, but still paid the same price as people who were getting 4 courses of meat. \n\nThe food in general was not outstanding for the price you pay.\n\nThe waiter was not very friendly either. seemed more interested in hanging out with his friends who were at the restaurant as well."

The lamb is juicy, succulent, hot....perfect seasonings.  I cannot wait to go back in the cooler months and sit outside.  Seems family friendly, although our booth was situation up against a wall of bottles of alcohol so if you have the kiddos, avoid that table!  It seems as though they also offer coffee drinks in the mornings, as they have a coffee bar towards the back of the restaurant.  I will have to check their coffees out next time.

On entering the restaurant proper we were directed to wait in the bar area until someone could seat us.  The place is attractive, but neither upscale nor particularly intimate though we required a flashlight to read the menus.   We shared a full size house salad that was described as field greens tossed walnuts, gorgonzola cheese, onions, carrots and berries in apple pear dressing.  The salad was very good even though the gorgonzola was MIA and the berries were represented by 2 slices of strawberry.  My wife's entre of spinach lasagna in a tomato vodka sauce was prepared with fresh pasta and was melt in your mouth delicious.  I chose the penne alla Dean Martin - a thick pink vodka sauce with peas, chicken and prosciutto served in a martini glass.  Just kidding about the glass, but there is an appetizer on the menu called a lobster martini that is served in 2 martini glasses. Overall the food was better than average though very pricey."

S'First, let me say that Italian eateries appear to be a dime a dozen. "Italian" has become watered down into a bland mix of spaghetti, lasagna, pizzas and some bland salads on iceberg lettuce.  I got tired of these so-called Italian restaurants eons ago.  But someone suggested Fazoli\'s so I tried it. YUCK!  It fits right in with the bland, pseudo-Italian stuff I\'ve been talking about. Does that mean the food is bad? Not necessarily, but you can see from my review my basis for judging it unsatisfying. It\'s just kinda nondescript, nonspecial, "blah" to me.   But that type of blandness could make it a good choice for a group of friends or a family with kids who want a casual dinner with familiar foods.'

S"As a lover of Italian food, I thought this little place was delightful. I purchased a Groupon and a friend and I came in for an early reservation on a Tuesday. The chef and owner, Scott, was very attentive and kind. He talked to us about the menu and explained that everything is fresh and made to order. Because of this, the food takes a little longer to come out, but I have no complaints about that, especially since we had both bread with a delicious homemade tomato sauce and salads with a house balsamic to keep us busy while our dinners were prepared.  I had the Pollo Della Chef, and it was fantastic. The Marsala sauce is a bit sweeter than I'm used to, and it ended up being a pleasant surprise. The freshness and quality of the food was obvious in taste and presentation. I included a picture here, but I didn't think to take the photo until I was well in to eating it, so if you check that out, you should note that you're only seeing about half of the portion size. \nOther things to know: this joint has about 8 or 9 tables, so I'd recommend a reservation; Meters run until 6 on Brookline Blvd, so don't forget your quarters (or credit card) if you come early; They have some wines available, but you can also BYOB;  The bathroom is not easily found, as you have to go in to the adjoining bar in order to get to it; I read another review that said it is cash only, so I brought cash and didn't ask about credit cards; And if you want an idea of price, an appetizer, two salads, and two dinners (one pasta and one chicken and pasta) ran us $43 before the Groupon."

S"The food tastes good as Subway always does. However the service here leaves much to be desired and I'm sorely disappointed. I frequent Subways often as its one of my favorite foods. This is my first time at this location and I've never experienced such poor customer service at any other location. The girl serving my family and I is not wearing a name badge so I don't know her name. However she is young and possibly of latino decent. She's tall and has long dark curly hair pulled uo in the front with a barret on top and the rest pulled back into a point tail. She has a deep raspy voice. Hope that helps in identifying her. We are here now and it is 4:30pm on Sunday.\n\nAnyway, when we first arrived we had to wait to place our order while she was talking and laughing with the customer before us. He was already done checking out and just standing there joking around with her. She didn't even acknowledge that we were standing there (four of us). She eventually sauntered over and as she asked us for our orders she never made eye contact and had an attitude of annoyance. My whole family noticed it and we were all really bothered by her acting like we were putting her out. She never once smiled or made us feel welcome. \n\nWe are eating in so we've witnessed her being a lot more friendly with the young guys coming in. And now we are leaving in which she isn't acknowledging or saying thank you or good bye, nothing.\n\nOver all an uncomfortable and annoying experience. I doubt I'll go into that location again even though I'll be in that area often now. It's unfortunate for me as a consumer and for you as a business. \n\nBy the way, this is the first bad review I've ever written as I don't believe in writing bad ones unless absolutely necessary. My hopes are that the management does something about this so future patrons don't experience the same thing."

It is a small place, neighbourhood style, so I imagined it won't stay late open during the week. \n\nSo I asked what time do they stop serving. The waitress kindly confirmed to us with the owner/chef that last orders are at 20:30, so I reply we'll be back in 5-10 minutes, please don't close, while smiling! :-) \n\nWe returned back less than 10 minutes later, however the owner/chef this time replied (through the waitress) that the kitchen had been cleaned up and they only take orders for pizza. \n\nReally? I mean... REALLY??? I did prefer the take-away, so we ordered a calzone pizza, which, to his credit, was good, but it felt a bit disappointing... \n\nI will certainly think twice before going there again..."

S'Vegan food is a beast that is hard to tame, as variety is sometimes missing or taste finds itself lacking. As a meat eater myself, it took some convincing by my wife to try O\'Bol, which is a 100% vegan restaurant with no animal products whatsoever.\n\nAfter tasting their Californian salad however, I was truly impressed! The blend of vegetables with "simulated" chicken strips that tasted so much better than some real meat strips, topped with a peanut sauce that marries itself so well to the Asian flavours... It was a piece of heaven!\n\nI\'ve returned only once since then as it\'s out of my regular way and tucked in the Bonaventure Plaza\'s food court, but just writing this review right now makes me crave for more. \n\nIf you\'re a vegan that has trouble eating out with those damned meat lovers because they hate your food, this place will change their mind.'

The tacos aren't terrible and are usually quite cheap. Quesadillas usually have lots of cheese and the spicy chicken burrito is one of my fave indulgences.\n\nBUT my husband and I came here on a week night and sat in the drive-thru FOREVER. On top of our horrendous wait we got sub-par food (even for fast food standards). My chicken burrito was half-filled and barely warm. I asked for a crunchy taco in place of what was a soft taco in a combo meal, and they gave me - nothing! Yes, nothing.

S'Wendy\'s should NOT allow this location to operate!  I pulled up to the drive-thru tonight and a young girl on the speaker asked if I could wait.  I waited about four minutes while two cars pulled up behind me..and waited.  Finally, I ordered.  I could barely understand the girl through the speaker, but I managed.  I rolled up to the window and the girl took the orders for those behind me--very efficient, actually.  Then a rather large middle aged woman came up to the window and the girl disappeared.  I watched through the window as a middle-aged man watched french fries fry.  The transaction went well (they took my money just fine).  Then I pulled into the parking lot to eat my food--I really only treat myself to Wendy\'s once every month or so, but it has to be HOT.\n\nMy burger was warm but dry and squished.  Oh well.  I was looking forward to my fries and I was so excited when I pulled them out of the bag to see that they were overcooked--I love my fries crispy but rarely request this.  Then I ate the first fry and spat it out--it must have been an old fry that was sitting at the side of the fryer.  Then I ate another...sure enough, the reason the fries were well done is because the man at the fryer had taken COLD OLD fries and put them back into the fryer to re-warm them!  DISGUSTING!  I threw them out.\n\nThis is actually the fourth bad experience at this Wendy\'s location..out of four.  AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!  No doubt they\'re having staffing and other issues, they\'re DISGUSTING!  Oh, but at least my order was "correct" this time--the trick to getting your order right is to only order three items.\n\nI\'m now waiting for the food poisoning to hit.

S"I came here yesterday for a satisfying lunch. I had a beef burger added with BBQ sauce and it came with a ton of chips at a reasonable price (20% student discount woohoo!). Sure the chips were from a bag and the bun was a bit dry but I was craving for a burger and this hit the spot perfectly- yum!\n\nThere's loads of space, a pool table and you can even play on their wii. There's a huge selection of drinks at the bar. The large TV screens can be a bit distracting, but I had fun with friends commenting on the music video. My friends had a falafel burger and salmon fish cakes and both were quite pleasing. Plus the peppermint-almond latte was a treat.\n\nThere were only two downsides that I can think of about this place:\nTheir cappuccino was not a cappuccino- more like watery coffee with a tiny bit of frothy stuff on top.\nWe couldn't figure out if this place was a pub (go to the bar, order, pay, then get your orders) or a table service place. It was rather confusing and we ended up ordering our drinks at our table, ordering food at the bar, and paying after we ate. \n\nOther than this small glitch perfectly satisfying food and place, at least for lunch."

S'warum war ich nie vorher im Braust\xc3\xbcble?\n\n\n Keine Ahnung, jedenfalls habe ich bisher die wirlich guten Schnitzel dort verpasst. Das Schnitzel ist mit Neun Euro ungrad nicht gerade g\xc3\xbcnstig, und lappt auch nicht \xc3\xbcber den Tellerrand, wie es manche gerne w\xc3\xbcnschen. Es sind eher zwei kleine. Das Schnitzel gibt es mit Bratkartoffeln oder Pommmes und einem wirklich guten Salat. Etwas l\xc3\xa4nger drauf warten musste ich auch - aber die K\xc3\xbcche ist, wie die Kneipe innen nicht gro\xc3\x9f, so dass frisch gemachtes (NICHT frittiertes) eben eine Weile braucht. \nDie Schnitzel haben \xc3\x96sterreichische Qualit\xc3\xa4t - die besten, die ich bisher in Karlsruhe a\xc3\x9f.\n\n\n Es gibt nat\xc3\xbcrlich auch andere Sachen als Schnitzel, aber jenes hat es mir eben angetan. \nDa Bier ist ebenfalls gut, der Service schnell und freundlich- mit osteruop\xc3\xa4ischem (?) Akzent- und h\xc3\xbcbschen Kleidern.\n\n\n Der Biergarten ist wirklich sch\xc3\xb6n! Die umschlie\xc3\x9fenden Mauern sind mit Efeu berankt, so dass dem Gast alles etwas gr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9fer vorkommt, als es wirklich ist. Damit die Getr\xc3\xa4nke schneller serviert werden k\xc3\xb6nnen, gibt es im Biergarten auch ein Getr\xc3\xa4nkeh\xc3\xa4usschen.\nKLeines Manko: im Biergarten ist tats\xc3\xa4chlich mit Bierb\xc3\xa4nken und Tischen bestuhlt, aber das "gh\xc3\xb6rt" schlie\xc3\x9flich zum Biergarten.\n\n\n Die Kneipe selbst ist sehr klein, eine richtige alte Gastst\xc3\xa4\xc3\xa4te im dunklen Ton, aber liebevoll mit k\xc3\xbcsntlerischen Elementen aufgepeppt: Lampen (die wohl von HFG-Studenten gemacht/designt) wurden - interessante "Tischdecken".\n\n\n Es gibt auch eine Kegelbahn- die aber wohl von Stammgruppen meist belegt ist.\n\n\n Ich bin gespannt, ob ich das n\xc3\xa4chste Mal auch etwas anderes von der Karte probiere, oder mich wieder am Schnitzel labe.\n\n\n Fazit: schlicht gut.'

The only time I've ever had an issue is on...say...Black Friday, but even then the staff is great about maintaining a good flow. \n\nThe menu is simple and delicious. Great soups. Great sandwiches.

S"DW was desperate to go to a Canadian Wal-Mart so we take the car out of the parking Garage (first mistake), drive nearly an hour through traffic only to find out that Wal-Mart apparently closes sometime before 8:15PM on a Sat. night.  While we're out in the burbs we thought we'd find a place to grab some dinner (second mistake).  After driving around for nearly two hours we end up a block from our hotel nearly 10pm at night @ Guido and Angelina's.  \n\nIt was nice and quiet and we were seated quickly.  I had the Penne Romanoff (kinda like Penne in Vodka Sauce) and DW had Tortellini gigi al cardinale (meat tortellini in rose sauce).  The bread was really good, fresh and warm.  The service was super fast, almost too fast as if the food was already prepared and just warmed in the oven.  This is why I took a star off.  Otherwise we were extremely happy with our meal and only wish we had saved ourselves the time of driving aimlessly around Montreal for no apparent reason."

This place was never busy, so I did whatever I did that past for studing sometimes here.  The interior was nice and roomie and had and interesting set of furniture.  The crust was cruncy (not crisp on the bottom and doughy, really unique actually.  So unique in fact, occassionally I would get a specific craving, which is always a good sign.  The sauce was very tomato-y.  Good pizza, by the slice.  Cheap.  I can't argue.  I'd give it a 3.5 but must round down."

Well my wife and I went into Millers at 9:15 pm for dinner.  The hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat.  she said "ughhhh you know it\'s close to closing time, right"?  my wife said, "what time do you close"?  The older, short blond curly haired hostess with glasses said "we close at ten".  TEN???  TEN????  They weren\'t closing for 45 minutes!!!!  This was the second time she did this to us and it will be the last because they have lost our business for good.  We even heard a phone ring at quarter to ten and she didn\'t even answer the phone, she just picked it up and snarled "closed" and hung up on the person!  Our server however, was spot on and the food was decent but the hostess or manager or whatever she was left the worst taste in our moths and spoiled Millers Seafood forever.  If you go to Miller\'s Seafood and you see her at the front, turn and run!'

S'I was surprised to see that this location was not yet on Yelp, however this address is not listed on their website either so maybe it is a separate franchise(?). Anywho, I am giving a 4 out of 5 stars for this type of restaurant, not necessarily a 4 out of 5 for all mexican dining. I like that Juliobertos offers a "light" menu and wheat tortillas although I am not sure just how light these choices are. Also it seems to depend on who you order from but I have noticed that some of the staff do not know what is what when it comes to the menu. I have ordered the grilled chicken burrito off the light menu and received grilled breast one time, grilled thigh another time and shredded chicken one other time. Either way everything typically tastes great, I like that there is a salsa bar inside and the food overall is a great value as is with most \'bertos restaurants. Plus after a late night of drinking who can beat a $5 meal of carne asada fries?!!!'

Even if you arrive at 4, expect a wait. This place gets PACKED and busy fast. \n\nI heard about this place for a while now and have been meaning to try it- but the hours threw me off. Well now I see what the fuss is all about! \n\nMy mom went to get the pizza last night. She arrived around 6 and as she has been told in the past , there would be a long wait or she could take the pizza and bake it at home. Rather than wait an hour when she was hungry, she brought the pizza to be baked at our house. You bake at 425 degrees for about 15 minutes . \n\nWhen I first saw the pizza, I noticed that it is a square pizza which I usually dislike. Not anymore. This pizza was amazing. We ordered just the plain pizza and it did not lack in flavor. The crust was unlike anything I've ever had in a pizza- light, flaky, not so filling and overwhelming like a lot of crusts. The sauce was sweet and packed with flavor. You can taste that it's homemade and that the tomatoes are fresh. The cheese was awesome- mozzarella and provolone I believe. Amazing. After having 4 pieces,  I didn't feel uncomfortably full, I felt satisfied which is a much better feeling. \n\nI would love to give this place 5 stars, but there odd hours and the fact that they were closed 2 Thursdays in a row without as much as a sign on the door prevents me from doing so."

S"This place is a train wreck. We waited at least 10 minutes (maybe 15) for a server to come to our table.  Finally I got out of our booth and flagged him down. His name is Lance and he is without a doubt one of the most obnoxious jerks I have ever come across. When I complained about the wait he essentially said that they were short handed and if I didn't like it we should leave. Naturally I walk to the front and asked for the manager. I was told by the hostess that she wasn't there (big surprise). She did give me her card.  I called and left a message but no return call. I will never go to any IHOP ever again. Absolutely pathetic."

S"If you're a seafood enthusiast, then get along to Creelers for a taste of some super fresh, really, really decent dishes.\n\nI came along here at festival time in August, so the place was buzzing, being right on the main strip of Fringe revelry. All the fish here is obviously very carefully sourced and of high quality, as one of the owners of Creelers is a fisherman, who brings seafood fresh to the restaurant on a daily basis. \n\nThe inside of Creelers has that clean, polished surfaces and not too fussy look to it that I think always looks great in seafood restaurants. The dishes served here are classic and not extravagantly complicated, but it's classic done very well, with the chargrilled fillet of Loch Duart salmon and the fresh mussels with white wine, shallots and parsley being firm favourites for me. There are also meat options, and dishes with a bit of a twist to them, like the spiced seafood laksa and jasmine rice."

Our waitress was competent, friendly and on top of refills throughout our meal. I'm not a fan of the flat screens in every corner, but that can be a plus when you're dining alone - also they reduced the volume on the one closest to us as we requested. San Remo will probably always be a bit of a dive, but that's not a bad thing. Hopefully we'll continue to see improvements here and there at this low-key diner."

I booked a table here after briefly glancing at the menu even though I had never heard of it.\nBoy, am I glad I did.\n\nThe setting for this fantastic restaurant is rather old-school opulence rather than modern chic. Spot on if you ask me. Amazing views of the castle if you get the right seat too.\n\nI started with a ravioli of rabbit with home made ricotta. YUM. \nThe main. Holy lord above. That main. I had beef fillet. Cooked to perfection. With Beef Shin and Foie Gras croquettes - tasty little things EVER.\n\nThen for dessert we shared the tarte tatin with cinnamon ice cream. It. Was.

It's quite narrow and hard to maneuver through.  Especially since it runs between the building and trash area.\n\nThe food, even though it took me five minutes to get home, was nearly cooled the whole way through.  I know I could have heated it up in the microwave, but I kind of expected it to be at least lukewarm.

S'Being a Lake Las Vegas resident sometimes you just want to get away from the touristy atmosphere, so my go to place is upstairs in Palio Bar and sports book in Casino MonteLago. The sports book and kitchen just opened September 1st, so I have only had a couple things on the menu where pizza is the main ingredient. I have to say the pizza is very good and is cooked by a born and raised New Yorker; New York Yankee hat included, but don\'t hold that against him. He offers a pretty good selection of pizzas, including his namesake "The Joey" (Pizza Bianca), which I have to say is very good. Other menu options include Calzone, buffalo wings, chicken fingers, St. Louis style pizza, and Hot dogs. You can buy cheese pizza by the slice for 99 cents or the whole pizza for $8.\n\nNote: Kitchen is only open when NFL football is airing (Thurs - Sun), while the sports book is open 24 hours.\n\nAs far as the sports book goes, it is open 24 hours a day and \nabout 30 LCD monitors were added that display odds for all sporting events.\n\nI would like to see them put in a bigger main screen for major sporting events like UFC fights, football playoffs, etc.'

This should tell you that you are probably going to take it go unless you want to sit out side at the picnic table and watch people pump gas while you eat, I think me not.  Ordering is pretty simple, and the food is cheap and pretty tasty.  King Gryos is still my fave in the area and is the one to beat.  Basically its like they are subletting a space in the gas station.  Its a greek greasy spoon.  If you need some quick greek or grill take out like gyros give it a try.  If you feel the need to park your can to get the restaurant feel during lunch, this may provide you some nice redneck entertainment if thats what you are into.'

They have beers from all over, including North America which of course always brings a smile to my face (even if the imports tend to be the ones I don't like!).

S'This "restaurant" is, quite possibly, the worst place I have ever eaten - and I\'ve traveled through Arkansas, so that\'s saying something.  \n\nThe waitress was only mildly interested in being there, and our dining experience only went downhill from there.  The food was among the most mediocre I have ever eaten.  The BBQ sliders (dry pork with a drop or two of sauce and some cole slaw) I got for an appetizer were barely appetizing.  My entree was an 8-oz sirloin (because, at 6:00 on a Tuesday, they were out of the only other cut of steak on the menu), which was completely without flavor.  Ordered with grilled onions, it arrived with mushrooms on it, and when I sent it back for grilled onions, it came out covered in raw onions that had been dropped on the grill for less than 10 seconds.  The accompanying beer-battered onion rings were uninspiring, as were the steak fries. \n\nAnd the atmosphere - it is very hard to describe.  The decor is ambitious and has some potential - but it needs people to liven it up.  It won\'t, however, get people with the lackluster food and service.  Generally, the place seemed like an old adult book store where someone decided to serve food.'

We sat next to a little fireplace, and the ambience was very nice.\nWe started with a bowl of small marinated olives and bread, and had the Portuguese mussels as an entree ($11).  They were great, and we soaked up all the delicious broth/sauce with bread.  I had the octopus and potato stew (approx $25) in a red wine sauce.  It was flavourful, rich, and very hearty, and the octopus was perfectly cooked. Although it was good, I wouldn't make a meal of it next time (it would be nice to share with a group as an entree) - it's a little too much of the same flavour at one sitting. My boyfriend had the charcoal chicken plate (approx $19), which our waitress said was their specialty.  It was very good (especially the bites of salad I stole to cut the richness of the stew ;) ). We also had a red sangria - our waitress' own recipe. It was great, and the service was friendly."

Not so lucky for my pants which have been feeling the stretch of this staple of my diet for some time now. I don't know what it is about this burrito-maybe they warm the tortilla in butter before filling it with tasty beans and cheese. Maybe it's the fact that they likely cook those beans in lard, which let's be honest, makes all the difference. I don't know, but if I knew I could live off of these without dropping dead of heart disease, I'd do it. \n\nThere aren't many things I order here- the enchilada plate, the bean and cheese burrito and from time to time the carne asada nachos which are a day and a half's worth of calories and sodium, but worth it. I only recommend the carne asada when it comes to nachos- the chicken just has never been good when I've had it. Nothing to ruin a delicious plate of cheese and chips like dry flavorless chicken. My favorite salsa is the green-not too spicy and packs in some great tomatillo flavor. If you go inside you can get as many little containers of salsa as you want, which brings me to my next point. \n\nDon't get in the drive through lane unless you like to be tortured before your meal. I've made the mistake many a time of  hopping in the drive through lane because I simply didn't want to get out of my car and I regretted it every single time. It is significantly faster to park and go in because the drive through line can be a 15+ minute wait and in my experience they get the food inside the restaurant faster. I mean, I've actually pulled up at the same time as someone and have walked out with my food before the cars in front of them have received their food.\n\nThe food is consistent, the service is what you'd expect at any fast food establishment and if you avoid the drive through line I could almost guarantee a positive experience!"

S'We just moved in a couple blocks away and thought we\'d try them out. Their prices are great but, seriously, worst customer service I\'ve ever seen. I walked in and the guy had to finish his cell phone game before helping me. I get home and realize we were given the wrong pizza. When I called to see if they had our correct one the guy tells me that\'s what we ordered. I assured him we didn\'t, I was there when my girlfriend called the order in. He just said "sorry man" and didn\'t offer any solutions. So we just picked off the garbage toppings that we didn\'t order and threw most of it away. It would\'ve taken very little effort to fix it for us. All this after it took them an hour to make the thing. I\'d go back if I were desperate but it\'s seriously amateur hour.'

S"Again, I'm not sure why Yelp encourages double pages for the location, the only difference being abbreviations within the street address.\n\nWhen the restaurant opened almost ten years ago, it was great! Management was friendly towards people of all ages, prices were cheap, and pizza and wings were excellent. I remember Amore working out a deal with my cousin's middle school for pizza Fridays, and all the kids appreciated it.\n\nI'm not sure when the change happened, within five years ago, or if there was another change after that. After the original owner changed hands for the restaurant, things took a turn for the worse. Employees eventually consisted of teenagers looking for extra cash instead of the workers who put their heart in soul in cooking, delivery, and service. The food quality also was much more sloppy, and prices steadily raised over the years.\n\nNow it's just another greedy restaurant. If Amore were in its original hands, it'd still be one of the best places for pizza in Scottsdale. Now it just blows."

S'Easily the worst Quiznos I have visited, and that is saying a great deal. \n\nWhen I first went in, I was ignored for the first 3 minutes even though there was no one else in the store.  I was then greeted by one of the employees, and her accent was so thick I could not understand half of what she said.  I made it clear to her I had a gift certificate and asked what I could order.  She pointed to the $6, $8, and $10 combo they were offering, and said it was good if you wanted a drink.\n\nAfter I made my order for the combo, and I was being rung up by someone else, I was told I could not use my gift certificate with the combo.  I asked why, and the server became rude and combative.  I asked to speak to a manager to resolve why two different people told me two different things.  I was handed a phone after a minute and was told by a rude woman I could not have the combo, and without getting a chance to say a word, was hung up on.\n\nJust avoid this location if you can.  There are other shops in the area and hopefully they are ran by better people who are not out to give Quiznos a bad name.  I do not understand why Quiznos allows these franchise shops to be so rude to customers, but it surely cannot be good for business.'

S"Looks great- like a page out of a loft kitchen in Dwell magazine- but often what looks good may not work for the intended function. As a restaurant, the space was not utilized well- a tiny waiting bench area, a bar counter that takes up more space than it offers in function, a small lounge of two chairs and a sofa that- I guess? is for waiting, that could host tables where customers could eat. It makes for a chaotic entryway where people stand or sit around in confusion.\nThe cold, stylish lines of the renovated-warehouse-chic dining area are not kind to sound: one can't hear their friends across the table because of the clatter of commerce and other customers. The result, you both have to speak louder. Then that bounces around, and everyone has to speak louder- and so it goes. It could be fixed with sound dampeners on the ceiling or walls, which could easily be integrated into the look. It's restaurant 101, really.\nThe food. No complaints, really. I didn't enjoy my lunasagna, but that is more of a personal aversion to limp zucchini, and the red sauce of the sundries tomato base was too strong somehow and didn't blend well with the nut cheese on top. I wasn't alone there, one of my group had the same opinion and couldn't finish his.\nThe bill of my group was much higher than I'd expect, and I wonder if when the hipness wears off people will realize they can make the small portions of raw food at home much cheaper, and in a quiet setting."

They have fountain soda, which I prefer over bottles, along with horchata and other Mexican drinks. They have managed to stay in business in a shopping center that lost it anchor a few years back, so they must be doing something right. I would rate the food as on par with other Roberto's in town, but this one gets an edge for their customer service."

S'I had a lovely girly night out recently that involved cocktails and Chinese food... and then me going home because I\'m an old person and turn into a pumpkin if I\'m out late.  \n\nAnyway...\n\nI\'ve struggled to find decent Chinese food in Edinburgh and currently live down the street from a Chinese take away that smells amazing but serves up greasy awfulness, so when a coworker of mine told me about Wok and Wine, I had to check it out.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated in a manner that I find pretty standard with Chinese food places I\'ve visited before - in kind of a non-hip modern way.  Clean, rather sterile, but comfortable.\n\nWe were taken to a nice little table and left with the extensive menu which (top points!) offers all full sized dishes in smaller sizes so two people can try quite a few different things in a tapas-style meal.  \n\nWe opted for a good mix - one order of veggie dumplings, a pork dish, chicken satay, crispy beef, and shrimp and veg tempura.  \n\nOn the plus side, everything came out immediately and was piping hot.  Unfortunately it all came out at exactly the same time so we felt pushed to eat quickly so it didn\'t get too cold.  We also discovered that the "small" dishes are actually hardly small at all and we really ordered WAY too much food.\n\nThe chicken satay and crispy beef were very tasty, but the tempura -which I had been looking forward to since I saw the menu- was a huge let down. I found it incredibly greasy and salty.  The texture of the batter was nice and light but the grease literally dripped out of bits, and the combo of salted batter with salty teriyaki was too much for me.  \n\nThe other dishes were fine tasting and well made, but just not entirely to my taste.\n\nDespite this, I would return.  The service was lovely and attentive and to a certain extent I think we just got a bit unlucky with what we ordered.  Add to this the price - five dishes plus rice and two beers for \xc2\xa340 - and it\'s really good value.  Just keep in mind it\'s cheap and cheerful and if you order as much as we did you\'re bound to find something that doesn\'t quite float your boat.'

S"At first I was a little underimpressed with Moo Cafeteria. Upon showing up on an oddly glorious Saturday afternoon, we wanted to sit outside, and after some persuasion, the four of us were allowed to take 2 of the indoor chairs outside while the manager wasn't looking. Not sure if that is the lady who came out to take our order, but man, she seemed really annoyed at having to deal with us. With me being the odd one out by ordering falafel, and the rest cake (oh damn you, diet! The glee to which the cakes were ordered was NOT FAIR). The falafel came out a little later than the rest of the order, and when they came out, my oh my, in the spirit of ACDC, I had big balls (of falafel, that is). \n\nThe only problem is, they were too big, and raw in the centre, which I slowly worked out as I tucked into them. So into the cafe I trotted, plate in hand. The waitress immediately apologised and took my plate back into the kitchen. Now here is the kicker of a good cafe - do they scrape off the offending part of the meal, or provide an entire new dish? Well, Moo gave me the latter, with smaller balls, which had clearly been checked before being sent out to me. I like that - it makes me feel happy that the chef didn't intend the same mistake to happen twice. \n\nWhere I wouldn't say wow, they were the best falafel in the world, they were tasty bites, freshly made and the plate overall was nicely presented. Despite one of the ladies who served us original ill-humour, she was lovely when my plate was returned to me and full of apology. I would definitely go back, and most importantly when I can test out their cake range."

S'I\'ve been here about 4 times. \nI think 3 out of 4 of those visits were negative. \n\nThe rapidity of the service is totally non-consistent. Sometimes the food takes too long and other times the waiter/tress never stops by. At one visit, for myself and my neighbor our sausages were extremely cold. It was embarrassing for everyone, and all they did was take our plates as they were and changed the sausages to fresh ones. \n\nThe smoothies are totally w-e-a-k. It\'s not real fruit they use in there. It\'s thick frozen mud. Not authentic at all.\n\nTHE MENU IS MESSED UP ALSO. For breakfast, on the eggs page it says at the top: Includes toast, potatoes - showing it at the top that all of them come with those extras, then you get your plate with nothing?! So you ask and they say "Oh the menu is like that, but with this plate those are not included."\n\nLike, what the HECK is that?!'

S"Cave Creek is not Chicago, hell it's not Phoenix.  But we were watching Sunday night football and all of A sudden my neighbor and I decided that grilling salmon was too much effort.  And our BAC prohibited driving    We have few choices in town for delivery, one of which is Papa Johns which I find hideous.  Not just here but everywhere.   I am originally from Portland so I got the awful papa johns experience there as well.  Pizza arrived 20 minutes earlier than promised.  It was very good.  My neighbor ate 3/4 of it I saved one slice for breakfast.  If you are here in cave creek it is a great option.   Unless you want the take and bake from papa MURPHYs   But again, sometimes discretion is the better part of valor when you have no designated drivers among the hungry neighbors watching sports   The best daytime pizza ( no delivery) is at The Hideaway Bar and grill up in town   Hands down.  \nSo I've obviously had more awesome pizza in foodie Portland, Chicago and NYC.  But this is Cave Creek. So a man needs to choose from where he lives \nMy one criticism is that they don't deliver after 5pm.  Which I find to be a stupid business decision, but really, who wants pizza after 5pm except everyone   They have a bizarre explanation but it is what it is   Give it a try but if you have a pizza craving after 5 and don't feel driving past the MCSO gauntlet you are screwed.

Or if you want, you can buy from the merch table which has a wide selection of "Las Vegas Nebraskan" shirts and hats. There was cheering. There was yelling.

S"I came here on a Wednesday night with a large group of friends.  Oddly enough, we were the only people in the restaurant!  The service was adequate (obviously, as there were no other patrons to distract our server!).  My Chicken Karahi was pretty satisfying, but as this is my only real exposure to Indian food I can't comment how it might compare to other places.  Overall, the experience was good--but it could just as easily have happened at any other Indian restaurant.  I can't fault the restaurant for anything in particular, but they did not do anything to stand out in my mind and make me want to come back.  The food wasn't overly expensive, but I'm left with the feeling that I should have paid less."

One of us had pizza, 2 that had whole wheat linguine pasta with marinara sauce and 1 had broccoli cheese soup and a half turkey sandwich.  All was very good tasting, and hot when delivered.  The service was very good, friendly wait staff.  We would recommend this place for casual dining and we will return! Lunch prices were very reasonable.'

S'WORSE GENERAL TSO CHICKEN AND CRAB RAGOONS EVER!!!!\n\nNot being a Madison native, I was relying on yelp to find a good Chinese fast food to pick up.  With 4 1/2 stars, I figured this was a safe bet, but for the first time ever, I was blindsided by other yelp reviewers.  \n\nThinking that general tso chicken and crab ragoons were the safe choices for ANY chinese take out, I was wrong. \n\nThe general tso chicken was SO salty I couldn\'t even swallow it.  I honestly didn\'t taste ANY general tso, tangy flavoring... it was pure SALT.  The crab ragoons had less than a teaspoon of filling in it and were cooked so crisp, I couldn\'t even break it. For ~4$, I expected a little more than that. \n\n Don\'t get me wrong... I understand this is a chinese take out and I dont expect 5 star quality food, but it was so bad I had to return it and went to ANOTHER chinese restaurant for food. \n\nI honestly would have given this a 0 star but they were willing to give me back a refund, which entitled it a 1 star.  The funny thing is when I called back to complain about how salty the food was, she told me that I should have told her not to put as much salt in my food.  Explaining to her how I\'ve never been at the take out, I didn\'t know I had to specify "not so much salt" when ordering a tangy dish... and she continued to argue with me saying that all of her customers like it that way...and those who dont, they know better and would order "not so much salt" next time they come back,, so next time, I should order correctly.  \n\nNo thanks, I won\'t be coming back. \n\nSo save your money...save your time...'

S'Food and drinks were great, but way overpriced.  The service was great and people very nice.  The only reason I give it two out of five is the price.  Come on people, the only reason you are willing to pay $12 or $15 for a martini is location, the atmosphere is just ok, nothing special.  If you are looking for a place to wait to meet up with friends it is ok; although the tapas are good, but nothing truly special and the least expensive drink I found was $8.  We stayed for one drink and a few tapas and bailed before we needed a second mortgage.'

So 2 stars for my food being good. 3 for below average service.\n\nUnfortunately, it's close and one of my boyfriend's favorite fast food places so I may end up eating here again, but not by my choice. \n\nAnyways, all the sandwich makers had scowls on their faces, shit attitudes. \n\nI ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich and my sandwich maker forgot the avocado (the reason I even got the sandwich), so I told her to just add that on and we'd be good. She scooped it up and put it on the edge of the sandwich and put the bread on... didn't spread it or anything. \n\nSince she was already in a shit mood I just decided to take it home and I'd spread it myself.\n\nWhen I got home the avocado was all over the place, but not in my sandwich and the damn thing wasn't even cut all the way through...\n\nMessing up my food is a sure fire way to piss me off. I had half a mind to just throw my sandwich at them and make them redo it and do it correctly. \n\nIt's not difficult to make a damn sandwich. Next time I'll suggest just letting me go back there and making my own (if I am ever forced to go back). \n\nI'd suggest Jimmy Johns or Silver Mine in Tempe. Much better service and food."

However, we shared the tartar tasting (you get a bit of everything) and felt like it was totally overrated. Not worth the price at all - we've had much better tartars elsewhere for much cheaper! With wine & service, ended up with a bill of nearly 200$ for two. I won't be back."

S"Nice atmosphere, good service, delicious coffee. The breakfast itself was definitely lack-lustre though. The baguette served with breakfast seemed suspiciously not same-day fresh, my Italian sausage plate was artfully garnished with green grapes. Pretty to look at, but they weren't the best quality and some more fresh fruit on the plate would have been a nice thought. The Italian sausage was nice and comforting but it was topped with a dollop of mayonnaise. Clearly of the homemade variety but really unnecessary on a nice greasy sausage. My egg Benedict was perfectly cooked, warm, with a nice creamy glob of slightly under seasoned hollandaise. Oh and the potatoes we're perplexing in their simplicity. Also I'm always weary when there's no salt and pepper on the table. From personal experience in one of many restaurants, it's the sign of a chef with a little too much pride. Fact of living in multicultural MTL, we don't all have the same palate. One nice touch these guys deserve kudos for was the mini glasses of Nutella, and jams brought to the table. So here's my official review. Give these guys a month or two. Let them work out the kinks, and then when spring hits pop by and see what's on offer. They've a ways to go if they want to become a Mile End staple but somehow I'm hopeful Barcola will step up it's game."

My husband had the build your own steak with the sirloin (mw) with the seasonings but cooked on the grill which he thought was a little on thw dry side. He had the aussie fries as his side but thought they were soggy and bland, he preffers large steak fries. His dinner presentation was on the boring side, not very impressing but his dinner salad that he started with was fantastic. It was the perfect salad for my husband... Lettuce, cheese, croutons, bacon and ranch only. It was crisp and delicious. We will definitly be back to visit Tori, thanks for the great experience!!'

I can't get enough of Pret and can honestly say I haven't found a bad branch yet.\n\nAfter doing a spot of shopping in Habitat just further up the road, I decided to sit down here for a cup of tea, a cheese ploughmans sandwich and a slice of millionaires shortcake. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have my favourite chilli prawn subs left but the cheese ploughmans was outstanding so I'll let it slide.

S"Excellent food. Intimate little place.\n\nThe plan was to eat at the new raved about Kazu in Montreal, but when i got there at 9pm, there was no more seating. Back in a cab we went to try out La Poisson Rouge and it did not disappoint in any way.\n\nFirst off, it's worth mentioning that they have a pre fix dinner at $37. Well well worth it, but majoirty of the items are add ons.\n\n4 of us went, and we tried alot.\nFor starts, it was escargot (plain and simple in garlic butter but excellent), foi gras (with pineapples and rasberries emulsion and the star of the evening), mussels (good quality and good coconut wine sauce). The only think disappointing was the crab roulette (kind of bland, but served well).\n\nYou have the choice of soup or salad in between. The spiced yellow pepper soup reminded me of my mum, and the salad's presentation was amazing. Served in bushell format, held together with carrot.\n\nFor dinner, it was duck confit leg in apricot sauce (bone licking excellent), asian style sashimi grade tuna steak (amazing but not a 'new' dish, i've had similar before), lamb (which they are famous for, despite being a fish place, and for good reason) and finally a thai baramundy (least favourite though the white fish itself absorbs butter well and i feel i will cook with it in the future).\n\nDesserts come with good quality coffee - desserts are either a warm baked chocolate souffle, or an orange cream and strawberries. I liked both tremendously.\n\nAll in all, the quality of food, excellent service and cooking with love was unexpected, but this place came recommended by foodies. It was extremely enjoyable, despite the restaurant being of the beaten track. Everything is french though i must warn you, includig the menu. And for the total of the bill, this place was well well worth it.\n\nOh and the best part is this place is a BYOB. And there's a dep (corner store) right next door. and to make it even more perfect, the dep next door does not charge premiums on their wine, so the prices are the same as the SAQ. It was a perfect night."

S"I visited Riverlife a couple months ago for their nine (!) course French Proven\xc3\xa7ale banquet on offer.  We booked mid-week and the restaurant was pretty dead.  There was only a family of 4 and us in the place, so there wasn't much atmosphere but I guess it is a bit off the beaten track (in Dalry) and relatively unknown. The interior was quite plain, cheap and a little dull so first impressions didn't fill me with excitement.  \n\nThere was some confusion over the booking and the waitress said there maybe some wait between course as the chef was not prepared for the 9 course banquet, however it wasn't noticeable and the time waiting was filled while drinking our BYOB red wine, with free corkage! \n\nOur starters included seafood bisque, which was very creamy and tasty, so far so good! Our second starter was warm goats cheese salad, also delicious and plate was scraped clean!  So far the starters had been served on separate plates so I expected the following courses to be the same, but instead next 5 courses were presented on one large long dish to share.  There was two of each seared fillet of sea bass, rib eye steak, rack of lamb, confit duck leg and pork scallops.  The sauces used on each meat were all very similar, a red wine gravy, however the seabass had a lovely garlic butter sauce in it's own small dish.  The other meats however were a bit gristly and of poor quality.  These meats were eaten along side a plate each of caramelised sun blush tomato, red onion tarte tatin, dauphinois potatoes and vegetables.  \n\nThen came our dessert, a lemon tart (very sickly sweet) and a selection of cheeses to share.  Although we were already full after the previous 7 course, the desserts portions were very small and uneventful.  So generally the meal was enjoyable and we rolled out of the restaurant will our bellies full, but I won't return for the 9 course banquet, maybe try something else from the menu instead.  The overall bill was very reasonable due to the BYOB."

My husband ordered  Eggs Bennedict, which he said he would never have again.  The muffin was burnt on the bottom and sauce looked like it has been around for a week.  I ordered 2 eggs poached with back bacon and a side of sausage and brown toast (which was right on the menu).  The waitress came with what was supposed to be my order and when I told her that what she brought was not back bacon and i had to argue with her. The sausages looked liked they had been cooked two weeks ahead.  Finally when I did finally get my meal,  the waitress said she was sorry but she did not know what back bacon was and it was the first time she had served it (maybe a little more training would help).

S'I first saw these guys when they made a pitch to the wealthy entrepreneurs of the ABC TV show "Shark Tank" last year. While they didn\'t connect with any of the investors, they seem to have done well enough for themselves to bring a truck to Las Vegas.\n\nI ran across Baby\'s Badass Burgers at the Sunset Park\'d food truck festival. Having been kinda-sorta promised Fukuburger and not finding them present, I figured these guys would do for a burger alternative.\n\nI went for the simple Original Beauty ($8), a half-pound burger on a King\'s Hawaiian roll with melted Swiss cheese, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms, and some sort of special sauce. I actually got $1 off that price by following them on Twitter, and I just noticed that it\'s listed at $9 on their web site. Not sure if they cut prices overall or decided to have a special for this event, but I felt like I got a decent deal.\n\nThe burger itself seemed just a little bit larger than a Fukuburger offering (if that helps at all). It was pretty hot, and the ingredients all complemented the meaty burger. Ironically, the bright pink truck didn\'t have much going in the way of pink meat. I just thought it was good, and it should have made a better impression on me as my first food of the day in a pretty hungry stomach.\n\nThe fourth star on this rating is because I don\'t wanna be a jerk toward a new business and because the $2 "Pig Tails" (curly fries) looked like a sizable and tasty portion on other people\'s orders. If I hadn\'t been saving room to try other food trucks at the event, then I would have gotten it for sure. I\'d be interested in trying another burger and getting those fries next time.'

I wish we\'d have gone home and had a frozen pizza instead of dropping $25 on one of the most unenjoyable meals we\'ve ever had.'

S'So I decided to try the "amazing" burrito bowl... I dot know where to begin..\n\nThe rice was dry and hard, chicken didn\'t taste like chicken, the rest of the ingredients didn\'t stand out and just tasted weird. I could barely choke down half of it before giving up... I have eaten many of their offerings, none have come close to this atrocity.\n\nI can\'t believe Lorena Garcia put her name behind this!

S"I'm giving JNB a better rating then it probably deserves, but I have a place in heart for this FF joint.  This spot has a few thinga going for it IMHO.  One, they just remodeled and it's beautiful, but I'm going to miss the old portraits of movie stars they used to have hung up for art.  They had Albert Einstein with his incredible shock of hair, a personal favorite hero,  a young Ella Fitzgerald, Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn(Breakfast at Tiffany's).  These photographs really jazzed up the place, but the wallpaper, rugs and other furnishing need updated, so I guess the remodel was good.  Two, when I first arrived at Arizona(Flagstaff), via Greyhound bus, we stopped near a JNB, so technically this was the 1st chain I ate at in Arizona.  I order the Jumbo Jack which hasn't changed since I ordered it back in 1985.  They did raise the price from a dollar(Bah humbug!  Now, I just order a 99\xc2\xa2 hamburger for value.  Also, good on the menu:  Egg Rolls, SourDough Bacon cheeseburger, Jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers, and the super yummy Breakfast Bowl.  Service is very good.  They almost never mess up my order as they are careful to repeat the order if they don't understand me.  They are fast too.  My only request would be to find a way to clean up the  garbage can and grease bin out back.  They need to control the odor that emanates from there because it causes potential guests from losing their appetites(especially those who drive through)  Other than that, I like the restaurant and have been dining there close to 20 years now."

S"Sometimes when you have a layover (ok yes I could have driven home and driven back, but it seemed easier to just chill at the airport) you just need somewhere to hang out. \n\nPros: \nCheap beers!

S'I realize that this chinese fast food "restaurant" is in the middle of the MGM hotel walkway and it caters to the foreigners so it\'s not truly authentic.  I get it.  But where does it say that just because it\'s not authentic chinese food it has to taste like crap?  The chow mein is tasteless and has way too much bean sprouts.  The mushroom chicken & broccoli beef are both missing flavor.  Yes, it\'s relatively cheap (1 item combo for $4.99) compared to other places like Nathan\'s (2 hot dogs, fries & a drink for $8???), but is it really worth it?\n\nMy other gripe was I ordered to go and they gave me this HUGE container and gave me stingy amounts of food.  It looked like a stingy portion because the freakin container was so huge.  Here\'s a tip Studio Wok: if you\'re going to give less portions, get smaller containers so it looks like you\'re giving more.'

S'Being from the north-east, I had never even heard of Jimmy John\'s, never mind eaten at one.  So when I was craving some sandwich goodness I decided to try it out.\n\nIf Subway is 2 stars, Jimmy Johns is 3 stars.  Definitely a step-up from Subway, but nothing super spectacular.\n\nI got the Vegetarian sub, easy on the mayo.  It was simple, and tasty.  The bread tasted good but was really chewy.  After finishing my sandwich I felt like my jaw got a pretty good work-out.  I was also disappointed by the amount of avocado spread, or lack there-of.  There was just enough to add flavor, but it didn\'t make up a very substantial part of the sub.  Cucumbers were crispy, tomatoes tasted fresh, and the sprouts were good.  For such a simple sandwich, it would have been nice to have something other than iceberg lettuce...kind of just seemed like filler more than anything else.\n\nOverall, it was good.  Service (at the drive-thru) was really fast.  I\'ll definitely choose Jimmy Johns over Subway in the future when I\'m in need of a "fast-food" sandwich, but I\'m not sure I\'ll go out of my way to come here.'

S'Stopped in at the Salsarita off of S Tryon to grab a quick bite to eat.  I haven\'t been in here in awhile but I remembered that they charged extra to get sauteed vegetable on my chicken nachos, which is what I usually order.  O-kay so first off it\'s kinda a full house. The line is long but it\'s moving.  First thing is first, please do not try to take my order if I\'m not up there to actually see you apply it to my food.  Salsarita is like Subway and you tell them what you would like to go on you tacos/nachos/or whatever it is that you order.  So how am I suppose to tell you what I want when I\'m at laest three people behind and not even up there to look at the choices.  I had to repeat myself so many times that I was starting to forget if I had actually told them to add this or that.  Then they charge for every little thing now.  It was extra for my vegetables, extra for the queso, extra for the black beans...I don\'t want plain nachos!\nWhen you get up there to pay that was also a nightmare.  They started off by trying to give your food to other people, because like I said you\'re taking people\'s order who aren\'t even up to the glass yet so once they do get up to the right spot, their food is at the cash register...not feeling it.  I don\'t like my food just sitting there so strangers can breathe all over it after you keep trying to hand them the wrong thing.  Once it was my turn to pay; for me and my bf (who also got a chicken nacho) and one soda, we were looking at a little over $20.00 dollars!  WTH\nI paid took my food to a table and then noticed that one of the servers, the one who kept asking me if I wanted "Queso?" and me telling her that she has already put some on mine, had litterally drenched the chips with queso cheese so they were soggy...not one dry chip anywhere.\n\nNeedless to say it will be awhile before I come back here...IF I ever do.  I can make better nachos at home n e way :('

S"Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy.\n\nDaniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back.\n\nWhen we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri! Wow. (That's another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice).\n\nWhen Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms.\n\nThe menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page.\n\nSome might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon.\n\nUnfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all.\n\nDaniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy.\n\nP.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient. You'll have to ask Daniel."

S'For those of you in the Charlotte area I just ate a brand new cafe.  I don\'t do this but OMG it was good.  It is called Indigo Cafe - Southern Cuisine with a Twist.  This is a classic style diner.  Black and white tile on the floor and walls.  Red booths with Coca Cola condiment holders.\n\nI met the owner\\chef this morning.\n\nBeing a cold and rainy night the Cajun Shrimp and Grits were calling my name.  Fresh peeled shrimp sauteed in cajun spices, red and green peppers, andouille sausage, and white onions.  Poured over home-style grits and served with fresh grilled bread.  One of the secrets is the smoked Gouda cheese in the grits.\n\nWhile waiting he brought me a bowl of one of the best chili\'s I have ever had.  Then he brought me a Jalapeno Popper.  This was not your ordinary popper.  It was as big as two jumbo eggs.  Stuffed with lamb, wrapped in bacon and deep fried with panko bread crumbs.  Served with a jalapeno mint jelly.  The spice was nice and warm not hot.  Flavors blended nicely.\n\nI will definitely return to try other items from the menu.  Sandwiches: "Chicken-Nator", 3 Pig Po\' Boy.  Burgers - Pulled Pork (yes pulled pork on a burger. and the Ortega.  Entrees - Twice Peppered Ribeye Steak and Indigo Pork Chops.

S"I had read the previous review before heading along to International Starters but, as my friend had booked the meal, I was heading along there anyway. As Alice said, I think the principle of what is effectively international tapas is a great idea and, yes it was not the cheapest meal I've ever been for, but I had a really good meal and left feeling perfectly stuffed! There are a wide variety of different cuisines and the larger tables have lazy susan type things in them, making for easy sharing with groups. I tasted: haggis balls (very nice, I'd had something like this elsewhere and was really looking forward to trying them again!); meatballs - v.good and spicy; curly fries with bacon and cheese - normally I'm not a cheese on chips fan but these were really good; haggis, black pudding and a wee mushroom on a mini potato scone - not as good as the haggis balls actually but still tasty; wings of fire - these were ok, very spicy; I also ordered an indian-y thing that I cant really recall what it was called! Overall the food was excellent and I enjoyed being able to taste a variety of different things in the one meal.\n\nThe restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere inside, service was sometimes a bit slow but the waitress remarked herself that she hadn't been expecting it to be that busy on a Sunday night ('twas the night after the marathon)."

S'Thai Express is one of my favourite cheap \'n cheerfuls and after finishing a job in the west island I spotted one as I was heading down St-Jean Boulevard. Upon entering its a really nice looking place, lots of seating, yet for a lunch time it appeared to be rather sparsely populated. I am quite use to Thai Express\' level of service, which is "express" level, at most locations you\'re chowing down before McDonalds has even finished microwaving your burger.\n\nI am also use to the Caribbean temporal anomaly called "Island Time" where everything happens in slow motion due to the lack of motivation of the island\'s inhabitants. Little did I know that Island time also referred to the West Island of Montreal, but it appears to have found its home in this particular stretch of DDO.\n\nThe first bad omen -- no one is working at the cash. I stood there a good 3 minutes before someone finally meandered over, after placing my order I stood and waited, there was no one cooking anything, and now a few others placed orders after me, still no one manning the wok.\n\nFinally after about 10 minutes and being quite hungry and frustrated I asked why there was no one cooking and swear to God, this is what I was told. "The cooks are off having lunch" to which I replied "That\'s ironic, I\'m here for the same reason!"\n\nIt took me another 5 minutes to get my money back as no one knew how to use the cash register, I then went somewhere else.\n\nFunnily enough when I told this to a friend he told me this place is known as a disorganized disaster, and the google review of it pointed out the same.'

S'On previous visits, I\'ve had decent service and always liked their chicken empanadas, which I still like. And If I happen to be at AZ mills already, then I\'d deal with the luke warm service just to order one to munch on while shopping.  So, prior to today, I would have rated them a 3 or 4 star. \n\nToday, I drove out just because my brother had been really craving a good piece of cake. So we trekked it out to Red Ribbon.   Starting with the good.  The eating area was clean.  My almost 2 year old daughter loved playing on the cool orange chairs.  \n\nUnfortunately, my brother & I don\'t recommend going out of your way, like we did, just to come & try Red Ribbon at AZ Mills.  So, Now with the not so good, my brother decided on a red velvet cupcake.  There were three on a tray along with 3 chocolate mint cupcakes and a white cupcake.  The sales lady told him, "Oh that\'s just for display."  My brother & I exchange glances, because he was just joking about this possibly happening!   \n\nThe sales lady promptly suggested we buy the four pack of mint chocolate cupcakes. My brother didn\'t like the look of the chocolate cupcakes, plus he only wanted one!  So, he asked for the only other cupcake option, one white cupcake. She told him it was for display also. \n\nI suggested that maybe they should sell the cupcakes individually. She responded that they do that. So, I was thinking OK, so why can\'t he order that red velvet cupcake? but oh, well, maybe it was old. \n\nSlightly perturbed, but not yet willing to abandon our quest, i ordered the Ube Boba Shake, because they were out of Mango.  While my bro made his final choice, he noticed there was one white cupcake, that was in the tall refrigerator behind the counter.  It was inside a plastic four pack container, along with one chocolate mint cupcake.  The lady said, "Oh, that\'s just icing from a previous mango cupcake..." My bro asked to see that one anyway. \n\nShe seemed to me, to be reluctant as she went to the fridge & got out the pack. And lo and behold, it was not just icing, it was a white cupcake. Odd that she would tell us that it was just icing. \n\nSo, my brother asked if he could get that one, specifically pointing to the white cupcake in the pack. The lady again, proceeded to put the four pack of mint chocolate cupcakes in a bag... \n\nMy brother & looked at each other again. I told her that this was just confusing and that she looked like she was getting stressed out & I apologized for that. But, my bro wanted that one white cupcake. She finally rung us up for that mango cupcake. Relieved to be done with us, she quickly asked the next customer if she could help them, without giving me my Ube Shake. I asked if it was ready?  Without saying anything, she walked away to the back, then came back & told me they\'re still making it. In my head, I\'m thinking, OK....I just don\'t get the feeling that we are a valued customer. \n\nWhile waiting for my shake, I tasted the cupcake that was so difficult to get.  I liked the icing, because it was light and not overly sweet.  But the cupcake itself, was nothing special to write about.   My brother also told me he tried their pancit on a previous visit and thought it was, in his words "Blegh!"   I told him how I like their chicken empanadas, but he was no longer interested in trying anymore of their food. \n\nWhen I finally got my shake shortly after, it was nice & cold and had a thick texture like a shake should have, but really did not taste great. Mainly because the boba had a strange texture to it, like some parts were hard and some semi soft.   Also, to be fair, I\'m usually not an ube fan in general. But, even still, I just thought it tasted bland and with a hint of sweetness/ chalkiness. I guess I was hoping for something more exotic with such a bold purple color. I think the price of $3 something after taxes is high for what you get.   I suggest taking two more steps passed Red Ribbon to Gloria Jeans or Haagen Daz if just want a good shake.  And I will save my Boba Shake cravings for Lollicup or AZ Boba Tea House. \n\nSo unfortunate that we didn\'t have a good experience at all.  I really want to support our local Filipino restaurants. Hence, why we went out of our way to get to Red Ribbon.    I feel bad giving them a 1 star, so I\'m giving them an extra star...If Red Ribbon can improve on their customer service at least, then I would recommend people  try it.  Because I\'m sure they\'ve got to have something good on their menu, it\'s just we didn\'t have any luck with what we ordered nor with the service...'

I have to say the Lighter Garden Vegetable pizza is delicious!  It's on a nice thin crust, creamy sauce, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, artichokes, etc! It is so good. The other pizza we got was also thin crust, delicious as well. \n\nThe crust reminds me of Zpizza, which I love, but the one at Metrocenter closed. I love having pizza without all the grease! \n\nTo those that balk at the price - look for a special. I've used Groupon Now twice. Great deal.\n\nFriendly staff, prompt service.

S"I don't need to sing the praises of The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh.  This working scientific research station has been adding value to Edinburgh and scientific understanding of plants and fungi since the seventeenth century.\n\nIn the past 30 odd years, the RBG has reached out into the community, engaging folk in all parts of Scotland and around the world in the enterprise of discovery.\n\nThe new kid on this established block is the John Hope Gateway at what used to be the 'back entrance' to the Garden on Arboretum Place.  In the John Hope Gateway you'd find the RGB's new biodiversity and information centres and a simply excellent place to go for breakfast, lunch or afternoon tea.\n\nThe Librarian and I took the train from Glasgow, made our way across Princes Street to Hanover Street.  We walked down Dundas Street and onto Inverleith Row by way of Brandon Street.  Through the Garden we reached the back door now guarded by the very welcoming Gateway.\n\nWe had booked and were seated whenever we arrived.  The menu was proffered and we looked over the balcony to the madding crowd below.  We selected crab salad and duck;  boring, I know, but we both had the same.\n\nThe food was nicely prepared and well presented, although the crab salad gave the impression of being a little 'tired'.  Perhaps they were saving money by preparing the little salad starters early and having them sit about waiting to be ordered?\n\nI noted that HMQ had been to the Garden formally to open the new gateway.  She will have been impressed by everything that she saw.\n\nI cannot think of another scientific research institute in the UK that is as open to the public nor as responsive to public interest.  The addition of the Gateway is icing on an already very nice cake, and the inclusion of this restaurant is inspired."

S"Another format change!\n\nDinner: Now they have crab legs!\n\nFor sashimi and sushi, you now order at your table and they bring it to you, just like at other AYCE sushi places. If you want 30 salmon sashimi, you can get it and not have to guiltily hawk the salmon sashimi platter when they put it out once every 15 minutes. Good things!\n\nYou can also order all rolls for your table. I've only bothered to order sashimi to our table, as most of the rolls are available at the buffet. Since sushi/sashimi are the only things that are ordered (compared to the non-buffet AYCE formats where all things are ordered), the sushi/sashimi does come fast.\n\nThe take-out menus that have been mailed around to all residences with all the other flyers includes a 15% off dine-in buffet coupon. \n\nI found out the hard way that they shut down the sushi bar at 9:15pm-ish, even though they're advertised to be open until 10pm."

When I get up I start my order then he went silent said " im sorry what was that again" so i went over half the order and he never replied back I said hello and no reply about 4 mins later he wants me to announce my order again. ONE CAR WAS IN FRONT OF ME. place was not busy, I worked in the food service for 5 years thru college and never had something like this happen at my places. if it did i would have been fired. after i make the order and get to the window 15 mins after i decided to go here and not wendys next door, he tells the only car infront of me to pull forward. well he only pulled so far forward or he would be in oncoming traffic but yet it wasnt far enough for my 4 door car to get out and around. when i told the guy that took my order i didnt have time to wait 20 more mins and how long would my food take before i paid him he said should be ready in 5 mins. 20 mins later the guy in front of me gets out of his car walks in and takes  1 bag of food, at the same time i turned and this guy gave me my food. so for about 35 mins took me for a order of two combos and they call it fast food. The guy didnt even address the situation just said sorry for the delay. I wrote churchs chicken website and never heard back. I also called and they said the manager was not there he would call me back. never heard back. horrible store dont go !! with that service they will have to shut down unless they revamp the staff.  worst experience in my life!!!'

The cashier tells him well I'm sorry but she was here first and I'm giving them to her!

I go ahead and bring it up to the cashier and she asks to please have it remade the guy opened the Torta and stuffed it mad and put tons of meat in it and threw back on shelf .. It was so nasty you can tell they made all of our food in a bad manner !! When you are in this business they should welcome all comments good or bad. And they should try and fix the problem and argue with customer . And while we are paying for food that was disgusting the cook is now arguing with another customer over some tacos that were given wrong. I gave the cashier the torta only gave it 2 bites.

S'The restaurant was beautiful and open and hit it\'s stride with plenty of people later in the night. Good to know is that you can bring your own wine here for no charge whatsoever! "Free" wine= happy people. Nice touch, Trattoria. \n\nI went for the $10 extra to make an entr\xc3\xa9e include soup or salad, dessert with coffee or tea.  The minestrone soup was decent and it was appreciated that they didn\'t put in soggy noodles like so many restaurants do. I heard the salad was very nice. \n\nFor the main I got the gnocchi with a spicy rose sauce and spinach. I felt kind of bad asking but I asked for an extra dash of whatever vegetables they had and it was no problem! The gnocchi were a good deal firmer that I would have liked and the sauce had some good spice at first bite. I don\'t know if I just got used to it very quickly or what but I stopped noticing shortly after. Maybe not so spicy after all? \n\nThe server was very diligent serving our table of ten at the beginning. I must mention, I have quite a boisterous family and as the night went on I saw the server\'s patience wane. She just didn\'t want to be there any more and it was written all over her face with every serving and request after the appetizers came. \n\nDessert was a bit disappointing too. I LOVE cr\xc3\xa8me brul\xc3\xa9e. This one came in a wide and shallow dish that looked so inviting, I squealed. But underneath the delicious crackling, the custard was piecey and running in the wrong places. Not the creamy goodness I was expecting.  \n\nIt\'s sad that a couple things make this a more negative review because we really did have a great time at the restaurant. They accommodated the assorted taste buds and we all walked out very full!'

S'Update:  Just as I thought, this place went out of business EXACTLY WITHIN A YEAR as I predicted.  They were just too expensive.  I am actually saddened because I hate seeing this across town with businesses closing.  I was actually rooting for them, even though I thought they were over priced.  I don\'t ever want anyone to close their doors -- but the truth, ANYONE could have seen this coming (outside of the owners, of course.)  Good luck to them in the future -- but next time, make it more affordable.  They could have achieved this by slimming down their menu and offering fewer choices for salads -- a menu rather than "create your own."  Any restaurant that provides a "create your own" menu just starting out can expect hard times in a poor economy.  Food costs will go up very fast.  Oh well, sorry Salad Creations....  sad to see you go.  :-('

S'I love Which Wich!  I have written a review on the one located in the park road shopping center.  When I saw the sign go up for Which Wich coming to Rivergate, I was so excited that I could have them more often!  We went to WW yesterday for lunch and they were busy, I believe the second or third weekend to be open.  While all of the WW we have been to are small and cramped, this one seems to have a little more space and more outside seating which is a plus.\n\nI love their process of ordering.  It may seem overwhelming if you have not been, but you pick a bag based on the meat or specialty sandwich you want.   Once you select the bag you mark everything you want, put your name on the bag, and hand it to the cashier.  They will then call you up to get your sandwich in your bag.\n\nYesterday I got my favorite, the buffalo chicken and Kevin got the gyro.  Both were great.  I love how they have plenty of options compared to the standard sub shop.  Also, their shakes are good - have had the Oreo shake before.\n\nTwo Complaints:\nThey seemed over staffed, which is good for the sandwich making crew, but they had 4 people on the floor to help out those coming in with questions and to check on people eating.  I really did not need to be checked on 4+ times while having a Wich.  I think once the newness dies down, they can have the proper number working.  \nThey have a loyalty card for getting so many wiches and then you get one free at all of the other locations.  We finished one last time at another location, but they did not have any out at this location to start a new one.'

Having just spent a year living in South America I was so excited about going here with a friend to sample their 2 Courses for \xc2\xa34.95 lunch menu.\n\nI'm afraid I came away feeling a little disappointed. I started with the Bruschetta, and despite it's description on the menu it had hardly any topping on it and instead of the crusty bread advertised it was a part-baked white baguette. Hardly screams latin flavour. My friend went for the mozzarella melts with chunky salsa and a side salad, and got a grand total of 2 teeny tiny fried mozzarella fingers, 2 limp lettuce leaves and a pot of what looked to me like nothing more than lumpy ketchup.\n\nThe main was a bit better. We both went for the Chicken, Bacon and Avocado salad with honey and mustard dressing which, although not being a remotely latin american dish save for the avocado, was still tasty. I would have liked a bigger portion though.\n\nThe d\xc3\xa9cor was what salvaged it for me, stepping inside made me feel like I was back in Buenos Aires or Quito again, and the music added that extra little bit of authenticity that the food lacked so badly.\n\nHowever, my admiring of the d\xc3\xa9cor stopped when the bill arrived. I really don't see the point in luring people in for a cheap lunch when one glass of wine costs more than 2 courses of food.\n\nI hear this place is good to go in the evenings, but if I'm being brutally honest I wouldn't rush back there for food."

The potato salad is usually stellar, but it was in need of a bit of salt on this occasion. Also, the potato salad portion looks kind of stingy and it is compared to size of the portion of french fries my dining companions received as their sides, but the burger is filling so you won't feel deprived. \n\nThe burger patty has this incredible depth of flavour. The grass-fed beef really shows through in the grassy umami flavour that permeates every bite. The burger patty was juicy, luscious, and delicious. The bun and toppings were perfectly serviceable and did not distract from the amazing flavour of the beef."

S'Great place for gourmet subs. I love the capastrami, and anything with turkey. The daily roasted turkey\'s here definitely separate them from all the other sub shops. The only thing it\'s expensive ($9.50 for a 12" sub) but if you get lucky you can get a survey on your receipt for $3 off your next order. The service is getting better, but it can still be slow during peak times because the sandwiches by convention take longer to make than say at a jimmy john\'s.'

S"Now, that I have to change my friggin diet.  I must seek other alternatives to my favorite delicacies of fatty fried chicken, tender prime rib, and lamb chops.  The same shopping complex, which houses SF Supermarket, Hue Thai Sandwiches,  a Korean fried chicken and beer house, and other great restaurants, also has a Chinese Hot Pot Restaurant.  In the last year, I've had the opportunity to try out more of these restaurants, where you place vegetables and meats into  a swirling and boiling pot of broth in front of you over an open flame.  It is really good stuff, and one very cool evening in Las Vegas, yes Vegas, I was craving to go.  \nI was joined by my forever favorite dining companion, and now fiancee, and two other friends who also wanted to try something new.  When you walk in, it feels like a little market, where you can buy some packaged goods, another area had a small buffet area (which we all need to try the next time because it is great deal), and the dining area.  The dining area was very empty, and decorated with faux mahogony Chinese furniture.  Above the area was a big screen TV connected to a satellite Chinese channel.  \nWe began to browse the menu and noticed that the combination hot pot specials were for about less than $20.  The waitress assisted us by selecting one combination hot pot for the 4 of us, since ordering 4 hot pots each would be too much,  You are also handed  a sheet to mark off any extras, such as beef, lamb, vegetables, mushrooms, tofu, rice, etc...etc that you would also like to cook for yourself in the big bowl of hot broth.  We chose the combination of seafood and lamb hot pot.  She gave us a heaping plate of vegatables w/tofu,  a plate of raw shrimp, mussels, imitation crab (yuck!), and raw squid, and another plate of thinly sliced frozen lamb that were rolled like mini cigars.  They placed a large metal bowl that was divided like the Yin-Yang symbol and filled it with a warm broth.  It was brought to a boil with the little gas stove that it was placed on.   Once the broth was bubbling, we started throwing in some of the vegetables, seafood, and meat.  We dipped it in various sauces that we alone created at the sauce station near the door.  My favorite was to mix the bbq sauce, with chili oil, and garlic in garlic juice and some green onions to give it some crunchy zing.  It goes sweet, spicy than tangy...It was quite tasty when the lamb or tofu was dipped in because they absorbed the flavors so well.  Because it was in the hot pot, anything that you removed from the broth was steaming warm.  It was very satisfying for the cool night that it was.  You cooked the shrimp till it turned a bright orange, but not too long bc it will become tough.  I was a big fan of the enoki mushrooms, I just love the crunch it has when you bite in your mouth, plus the flavors and moistness of the mushroom.    The lamb was humming full with flavor.  Not bad for being frozen.  We did end up ordering more items, such as enoki and lamb.  We also decided to venture and try deep fried fermented tofu.  These beautiful golden deep fried puffy cubes have this wonderful crisp when you first bite into them, and then finishes off with a very pungent smell that slowly drifts up your nose and down your throat.  Wow, talk about strong flavors.  I really recommend to not burp around people or accidentally covering your mouth while you burp.  ha..ha..  it is definitely worth a try.  We were also amazed how busy the restaurant became after we arrived.  It seems that 7:30 is a busy time for this place.  All in all, I would have to say I'm a fan of this restaurant.  I loved the selectons in modifying your bowl of hot broth  that came with a total bill that just can't be beat.  I walked out of that restaurant with an especially content and warm chubby belly that evening."

S"Whilst I don't seem to have had quite the same terrible experience as Gavin, Cafe Keno didn't exactly bowl me over with awesomeness.\n\nCafe Keno is a fairly standard affair. It offers decent coffee and tea, and substandard British cafe food. The problem basically is that at the heart of Edinburgh, on the High Street, why not go elsewhere? There are a million other very high standard cafe and restaurants nearby. Cafe Keno just doesn't really stand out. Perhaps it has room for improvement though, it certainly isn't a bad place.\n\nIn its favour there is usually plenty of sitting space outside which is nice on a summers day to watch the busy tourists go by, especially as they serve ice cream to go with it."

S'***Chase Field\'s Big Dawgs sells decent though expensive foot-long hot dogs that are heavily topped and categorized by city or state (Chicago Dog, Wisconsin Dog, California Dog, Arizona Dog)***\n\nChase Field\'s main concession stand is Double Headers, which is easy to find because of their many locations.  Double Headers features traditional ballpark food like hot dogs, popcorn and nachos.  Big Dawgs (which has only one location in Section 130) also serves traditional concessions like hot dogs, but they are done with a little more flair.\n\nBig Dawgs emphasizes "big" food items such as a variety of foot-long hot dogs to a very large $16 soft pretzel that comes with multiple dipping sauces.\n\nThe foot-long hot dogs are named by city/state and they were offering 4 varieties on our visit (the dogs were displayed in a glass case with all their toppings).  There was the Arizona Dog, which featured melted cheese, sausage and red and black tortilla strips.  There was also a Chicago Dog, which seemed to the traditional Chicago ingredients like relish, tomato, etc.  They also had a Wisconsin Dog, which was topped with macaroni and cheese and bacon.\n\nThere was even a California Dog on the menu.  If I asked Californians what they think would be in the California Dog, I imagine most would say avocado.  I don\'t think avocado was in it (unless the enthusiastic cashier did not explain it correctly). The California Dog was topped with melted cheese, onions, peppers, and steak (it really seemed to be a Philly Cheesesteak Dog so maybe the name was just incorrect).\n\nWe went with the Arizona Dog and it was pretty good.  The bun was nice and soft while the hot dog had a good flavor.  Not too strong and not bland.  The toppings were just okay.  The tortilla strips were fine and provided a good crunch, but the cheese did not have much spice and the sausage was a little ordinary.\n\nThe staff here was very enthusiastic and helpful.\n\nPricing was high.  The foot-long dogs were elaborate creations, but they might not be worth the $9 price tag.\n\nBig Dawgs provides a different hot dog experience so it might be worth checking out if you come to this stadium and want to walk away with something a little more interesting than a regular hot dog, nachos or popcorn.'

Other than it being on the oily side, the flavor was awesome.\n\nI got the Kraut dog.  Was pretty tasty, lots of kraut was given and the dog tasted great because it wasn't salty or oily.  \n\nI did catch 2 things that didn't sit well with me...  They charged me $1 for kraut add on when their menu says $0.75.  And when they gave me my garlic fries, they only gave me a tiny ass portion.  I knew that b/c I looked at the 2 customers in front of me get the same thing but they got a full big basket each.  I told the worker that i paid $4.25 and u only gave a couple fries.  He was nice and fixed it, but i was a bit irritated cuz i had to wait again and my food that I already got, got cold.  \n\nI'll still come back again.  It totally hit the spot.

This Dominos ticks all those boxes - they also have never made a mistake with our order, and the in-house service is quick and friendly.\n\nConsidering some competitors make you wait 40+ minutes for delivery, these guys get my vote for local pizza in Surprise.

S"I give this a 3 stars, because if your ordering Domino's, you know what your not getting a great pizza, your getting fast food delivered cheap. And at $7.99 a medium, with extra meat and such added while ordering online and no added charges, it's good for what it is. The pizza was fresh and fast, the people polite, the choice to no longer offer Parmesan cheese was irritating since we are moving and even our fake cheese was packed. No plates was a blech as well. I do like the thin crust and the Cheese Steak ( for what they are mind you, Would I rather Grimaldi's? heck yeah, but this is the McDonald's of pizza, and The Bride didn't want to order Chinese) The most you can realistically hope for is inexpensive pleasant mediocrity, which is what was delivered, and every time I have needed to order there, it's been consistent. So my experience is, good store team, company focused on the bottom line. I'd rather have cheap asian myself, but if this is the price of marriage, so be it."

We enjoyed a phenomenal buffet, with two delicious wursts, pork cutlets, potato pancakes, sauerkraut, and a whole mess of tasty German sides dishes. And we spent the next three or four hours in a handsome ballroom with folks as much as three times our age, drinking beer and enjoying awesomely German music from "Fred Zurich and His Sound Machine".\n\nWhat a great time this place was!

S'Ive eaten at this location 5 times of which the last 3  since moving here from KC. The first last August on vaca here was awesome with great food with a short wait and one of the best waitresses we\'ve had!  \nThe next visit was last November while we were looking for a house here where it was still  great with friendly wait staff but the food wasn\'t as good as the first time but was still very good.  \nHowever, we have moved here now and have been back three times since mid Dec.  Very convenient on Sundays.  Gradually and regrettably the last 3 have gotten progressively worse.  Food quality and consistency as well as trained wait staff have both suffered. Staff is still trying and polite but seemed to lack training and leadership from the management. The last visit today, the Pad Thai (which I love) was bland, overcooked noodles and the shrimp smelled and tasted funny to me (almost tainted).   I told the obviously new waiter and asked to order something else of which he gave me the courtesy of.  BUT, the manager came over afterward to inquire and I explained as nicely as I could. He then scolded me for expecting to get an exchange dish for free after sending the first back because I must have ordered something I just didn\'t like and there was nothing wrong with his food. He announced that he would let it go this time but in the future if I ordered something I didnt simply "like" he would charge me for the inferior dish and be happy to sell me another dish if I\'d like to try something else. He got on to the waiter (I did see him do the same thing to a different young waiter over another customer the last time we visited) and told my waiter he was paying for the bad Pad Thai dish that I returned.  I wasn\'t going to let this happen as the Rookie did the right thing. I paid for the bill ($24) and gave my waiter a $14 tip to cover him and the dish he said he would be charged for. That seemed ridiculous to me, poor kid was trying to do the right thing.  I don\'t ask for anything free and offered to pay for the Pad Thai to the manager, which was when he told me he\'d "let it go" this time.  Really? My 16 year old was so embarrassed by his rude behavior that she doesn\'t want to go to that location again.  \nJust thought I\'d offer my experiences. If you go I wish you better luck with the manager than I had:-)  Bon Appetit.\nI\'m 47 years old by the way and was there with my 3 daughters.'

S"This restaurant has changed hands a few times over the years, but I hope this one sticks, because it's lovely. The owners have form, having come from the successful 'Mya' Indian / Thai restaurant down the road on Commercial street. Although the decor is (for now) largely unchanged from the building's previous incarnation as Amani, the kitchen and other facilities have been completely replaced - a move which suggests the new owners have their priorities right.\n\nThis seems to be confirmed by the quality of the food, which was splendid on the night I went. Both the Indian and Thai sides of the equation stood up to scrutiny, in terms of the ingredients and preparation. The Tom Yum Gai starter was spot-on: delicate and fresh, but packed with flavour to line you up for the main course. The only slight (very slight) let down was the chicken panang, which was a tiny bit insipid.\n\nThe service was really great - very friendly and nice chat. The owners don't drink, so after the meal we were all invited to try a couple of new wines they were considering adding to the list (which is, incidentally, pretty impressive).\n\nI'll definitely go back soon - and take a few more people, so I can try out more of the menu!"

S'At the outset Maison June Rose sounds like a good deal but it quickly falls very, very flat. The advertised all-you-can-eat $20 Chinese-style menu turned out to be a bunch of absolutely TINY appetizer sized portions that are neither tasty nor Chinese. Sure, there\'s things that sound familiar at a \'Chinese\' restaurant - some salt and pepper shrimp, some steamed broccoli - but its evident with the first bite that no effort has gone into creating any discernable flavour. Every dish was so unbelievably salty that I had to ask for 3 refills of water. And that\'s saying something coming from a guy with an unfazeable stomach.\n\nFurthermore, when my girlfriend and I tried every dish on the buffet menu we figured \'maybe the chefs actually try harder on the off-the-buffet menu.\' We were mistaken. Not only did the Duck Rillettes taste like a salt lick, but it wasn\'t even edible. We kindly asked the waitress to take it away. After asking the owner why the dish we sent back was still on the bill (we sent it back), he vehemently refused to comp the $7 dish and said \'whatever I serve is good and people like it.\' We did our best to kindly tell him the duck rillette was inexcusably bad, tasted nothing like food and only a condensed and salted preservative - and that we simply did not wish to pay for it. But the level of pomposity was too high to even have a conversation with the man.\nAnyway, I figured I would end the meal with one of those classic chinese desserts - sesame balls with bean paste (Another off-buffet-menu item, $5). The only way to describe it would be a frozen and microwave-reheated version of an almost un-fuck-up-able food. The preparation was so poor that the sesame ball couldn\'t support its own weight; in fact I was left asking "why is it so hard to unstick from my teeth"" and "what discount frozen section did they buy this from?"\n\nThe owner SERIOUSLY needs to reconsider the buffet menu. If the buffet menu was a baseball player, it would be batting 0.154 - only the Sauteed Chinese Broccoli and the Braised Eggplant and Pork were good enough to warrant a second order. We didn\'t want to finish most of the buffet menu items (and we\'re talking VERY small sized plates). I can\'t tell you how heinous the duck rillette was; under no circumstances should that item be served to anyone without a severe congestion.\n\nTo be fair, the decoration and ambience is very beautiful at Maison June Rose. It would be a great bar for drinks, if you can stomach $16 cocktails (btw there\'s nothing special about them, only the price).\n\nIf you\'ve had your tongue cut out recently, I\'m sure you\'ll enjoy your dinner at June Rose!'

He ended up making the Lemon Drops but instead of rimming my shot glasses he gave me 3 sugar packets!!! What did he expect me to do with F-ing sugars packets. I got a glass and plate, poured my shots into the cup rimmed my own glasses and poured the shots back. Once we FINALLY took them they tasted horrible.\n\nHe is the only reason why Myself and Others all walked out of there saying we wont be coming back.

The ambiance is simple, understated, casual elegance and cozy. \n\nThe menu has traditional French specialities, such as Foie Gras for appetizer, and mains like Duck l'Orange, Veal, and even Rabbit. There are a few other mediterranean infuences like Canelloni and Carpaccio from Italy and  Paella from Spain, and they have several seafood selections like more than one salmon and a trout dish, as well as other popular meat favorites.\n\nThey have a very affordable 3 course daily  evening special, with appetizer, main and dessert for under $24 CAD (under $20 USD at today's exchange) and most of the entrees a la carte are $18 - $24 CAD,with appetizers in the $6 - $10 CAD range.  They have an adequate wine selection appropriate for their food offerings. \n\nService is very attentive, with the owner/manager  providing personalized suggestions and service. \n\nThis is mostly a hidden, affordable gem for locals, but if you are ever in Longueuil or along the south shore of Montreal, this would be an excellent, affordable choice for good local French food."

S'I was in Verona to visit a co-worker and to assist with the set-up of a home theater when we decided to celebrate the day\'s accomplishments with two of the finest rewards known to man: quality beer and quality pizza.\n\nWe made a quick run to the local grocery store where we procured a bevy of bottled beverages and some salty snacks (kettle chips - yum).  I spied the Falbo Brothers pizza sign from the grocery store parking lot and suggested we B-line it and order the biggest, thinnest, bacon cheeseburger pizza they could make.\n\nThe staff was for the most part helpful, but the manager was over-the-top-awesome.  He was extremely friendly and super accommodating - obviously a guy who values his business and his customers.  \n\nOur 16" thin crust pizza was ready within 15 minutes; we rushed back to my co-worker\'s pad, fired-up his new 55" LCD with 7.1 surround and tore into our bounty.\n\nThe pizza was excellent.  I haven\'t had Falbo\'s in a year or more and I forgot how good it really is.  Granted, it\'s not exotic, nor is it gourmet, but it handily beats anything you\'ll find from places like the Hut, the Papas, or any of those other jokers.  \n\nThe cheese was plentiful but not overwhelming; the bacon was crispy and meaty, the hamburger had just a hint of fennel.  My only regret was not adding onion, but there\'s always next time.  I believe the pizza cost about $18, which given its size, worked out to about $1 per inch of diameter - totally fair.\n\nI have heard their delivery is quite slow, so I\'d recommend driving to pick it up yourself.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  \n\nFalbo\'s = WIN\n\nService = 4 stars (manager was super great)\nFood = 3.75 stars (VERY solid pizza)\nValue = 3.5 stars (about average)\nMISC = N/A (we did take-out)\n\nI rounded-up to 4-stars because there was just something about the \'za that I really enjoyed.  I do like my Roman Candle pizza and my Blue Moon pizza, but Falbos is no slouch.  Kudos!'

They serve really delicious wraps, filled with almost anything you want. They offer a huge range of authentic ethnic cuisine such as falafel, hummus, babaganous and kidney beans, as well as the more traditional fillings such as mozzarella cheese, salad, kidney beans, and a selection of meats. I love their hummus and falafel wrap served with a spicy sauce and I find that when I eat one of their wraps for lunch, I am not feeling hungry for the rest of the day.\n\nCoffee Etc offer a huge range of non-meat options so it is a great place for vegetarian's as they will definitely find something on the menu which they fancy. \n\nThe prices are incredibly reasonable here to, with a wrap costing about \xc2\xa33.50. Coffee Etc toast their wraps and is lovely to eat a wrap wrap on a cold day. There is a small seating area inside Coffee Etc which is cosy with comfy chairs, but can get quite cramped during the lunch time rush so I tend to take my food as a take away. \n\nThe staff are also very friendly and will to explain all the exotic dishes on the menu which they offer. Coffee Etc also sell a range of ethnic teas. It is definitely worth a visit."

I have been to this location multiple time, thus the dukedom but unfortunately its more about location and accessability than service (and isn\'t it true that\'s the case with most everything these days "/) but I digress, the wait times are longer than average when you dine in or even if you go through the drive thru, and that makes me sad.  The only reason this place is getting two stars is the fact that I know that I will probably be back there, another thing that makes me sad.  There is hope though, every once in a while I get pretty good service so the silver lining is there but hopefully that shines through more often than not!  We will see as I said before I will be back and hopefully they suprise me in a good way!'

S"Fling your hands up in dramatic horror - until yesterday I had never eaten something prepared or designed by Mr Greenaway! His reputation preceded him of course, and so when I came to Bistro Moderne to check out the Sunday roast with Sharon G, I had high expectations.\n\nThe location itself is splendid - nestled near St Stephens, it has high ceilings and lots of natural light. We were seated by our enthusiastic waiter in a cosy wood-panelled alcove, which was lovely, although the table was weeny so we had to do some juggling to fit our dishes and glasses on once everything had arrived.\n\nGreenaway attends mostly to his main restaurant but comes and cooks in person at the bistro on Sundays, when they offer a roast for two at \xc2\xa325. Starters and desserts are both in the region of \xc2\xa37 so it isn't cheap but as a treat it's just the ticket.\n\nOur waiter was thrilled when we ordered the chicken. He was excited to tell us that he had witnessed the preparation of one such chicken earlier and it had entailed a piping bag of butter slid under the skin. Om nom nom. Well, it sure was tender and juicy! Gorgeous chicken, and the roast potatoes were perfection too: crispy, fluffy, not too oily... Dream potatoes. The Yorkshire pudding, which is an explosive puff, was a little too crunchy for my tastes but the brassicas (a mix of chopped sprouts and cabbages) and the carrots (including a couple of purple ones - awesome) were sweet and addictive.\n\nFor dessert, I chomped on a slice of treacle tart with creme anglaise and a shard of treacle glass. Without wishing to sound too plebeian I think it needed more than just the shallow covering of creme anglaise and a fork would have been helpful to break through the super-chewy top, but it was delicious all the same.\n\nOne to remember for special occasions!"

S'Gross is the one word that comes to mind when I think of where we had my nieces 3rd birthday party. This location has to be the dirtiest, stickiest, worn down place I\'ve ever been into. Which is pretty sad since it\'s for children. A lot of the games and rides didn\'t work. The customer service there was awful. They didn\'t even remove our dirty plates after we ate our pizza, we had to put them on the table next to ours and they were sitting there as we left. All of the animated animals or whatever you\'d call them looked like sad, worn out, crackheads with lazy and/or unopened eyes as they danced/flailed around. The place didn\'t even do anything for the birthday girl. No Chuck E walking around, no ticket booth, no happy birthday song, pure crap.\n\nThey really need to close down for a few days, clean and sanitize the entire place, fix the broken games and rides and have a "how to treat customers" seminar. I DO NOT recmommend this location.'

S"My parents and I have very different culinary tastes. I am also about the rice, they are all about the potato. Somehow, we've managed to settle on occasional compromises of Japanese food. Don't ask, just accept. \n\nThis was my first visit to Koi - I had been a little put off by the reviews but I enjoyed my meal. I would be picky and say that the waitress refused to check with the chef to increase the tempura plate to suit 3 people rather than ordering 3 plates (lets face it, all I really wanted was it to be put on one big plate) but otherwise service was really attentive even though the place filled up as we ate our meal. \n\nTempura - I felt the batter was a little soggy. \nMiso soup - it's either me or miso in Scotland always needs more salt? \nTeppanyaki - I had the Diablo - my little piggy eyes were a bit bigger than my belly, as usual. The calamari was beautifully cooked (got to give a chef thumbs up when that happens), but the sauce it was cooked in was a little overwhelming in flavour (mainly of butter) - I had to give up on it eventually. The salmon was a little dried out, but tasted fine, as did the king prawns and scallops. I couldn't really define what sauce/marinade the fish was cooked in - it didn't carry a whole lot of flavour, except on the calamari. \n\nI didn't try the sushi, which would be my rule of thumb for a japanese restaurant - I think this was my first teppanyaki experience to be honest, so I have nothing to compare against at the moment, bar the miso soup. Would I try Koi again? Yes, and I would implore them to create a sushi set meal, as I couldn't order sushi for one :("

The three girls working were extremely nice and as always greeted me with smiles. I ordered the Chicken Pesto Panini with french fries and it came with a drink. The place was almost full so I expected to wait for a while. I sat down at one of the tables looking around just to fulfill my time. Even tho it was very busy the place was really clean and what really made an impression is that the girls managed to greet every single customer walking thru that door. And next moment I know there it was my panini served to me. The experience gets even better when one of the girls came out to the front and checked on each group to make sure that their food was good. \nMy panini was great, the staff were super friendly and my lunch break was totally awesome!\nThank you!'

So with my Honduran adapted taste buds, I was not impressed. Perhaps it is more Nicaraguan? I couldn't figure it out, the menu is sectioned out by country, with a bit of overlap. Best advise? If you are looking for pupusas, head to an El Salvadoran restaurant. Baleada? Head to a Honduran- and so on.

None of these things concerned me though.

The burgers are standard size.  The fries are weak and not very good.  The service, as someone else said, are bored and apathetic high-school kids.

That alone is a wonderful welcome.  No goon!!!\nThe atmosphere is open yet there is a patio and seating area outside of the music to enjoy a meal, appetizer, drink and a conversation without having to struggle to do so if you choose.  \nBar staff very friendly and efficient.  Offered glasses of water at no charge afterhours.  When is the last time you were in a lounge that didn\'t want to charge you $5.00 for water?!\nThe music and dance area has loads of seating with very open chill space.  Food can be ordered in that area as well. \nThe aromas of the food are devine however I have not sampled the menu as of yet.   I have noticed many food items out to other patrons that look delicious.\nThe music is NOT the regular same old tired Hip Hop that is the norm in most clubs.   Underground house, progressive house and some trance. Live Dj\'s ( local) and taped as well.   I like to say more "grown up" music than other establishments around.  \nGreat place to spend another hour or so before heading home after all the other clubs have chased their patrons out to the curb and locked up at 2am. \nTHIS is just what Scottsdale needed. Late night, food, afterhours and great little lounge.'

S"I went there for lunch. 6/24/14  1:35 PM\n\nThe counter girl, Liz, was charming young lady, smiling, polite and a great example of customer service.\n\nI had a the three piece combo, two breasts and a wing, mashed potatoes and corn on cob for sides, it comes with a small drink. $8.49. \n\nThe service, at the counter, was great. If it was based on this, 4 stars.\n\nThe food was good. If it was based on this, 3 stars.\n\nThe restaurant was a mess. The ice dispenser on the soda machine had dumped all it's ice into the tray and onto the floor (it took awhile for that much ice to be dispensed). Since it's around a blind corner, I'm surprised no one was injured rounding the corner and slipping on the ice. It was a slip and fall suit, waiting to happen.  Every napkin dispenser in the place was empty. And there wasn't a clean table in the place, looked for the least dirty one. Did I mention it wasn't busy here?\n\nWhat's the manager doing? Milling about smartly, behind the counter, basically accomplishing nothing, oblivious to everything going on around him. He's standing two feet away from two empty napkin dispensers, that were already open, with a new package of napkins next to them, did he fill them, no. Did he go into the restaurant to see the ice everywhere or the dirty tables, no. Whereas Liz was the epitamy of customer service, the manager was the antithesis of customer service. When a manager reaches the point they feel they are above their crew, no longer a part of the team, too good to assist with the work, disinterested in the condition of their store, they are no longer effective.\n\nThis is an unusual situation for me, where I would have given two more stars, had I used the drive-thru, instead of going into the store. My work truck is too big for the drive-thru, so that's not an option.\n\nOkay, I'm done ranting. I just expect a place I'm eating at, to be clean. Possible exception a picnic, but even then I bring a clean blanket, if there's no table."

S'Loved the atmosphere! BEAUTIFUL walk-way to the restaurant with sparkling pavement and lights. Interior is also very tasteful with great decor! The lights were just right, not too dim and not too bright. LOVED  the flame-less candles adorning all of the tables! \n\nNow, for the not so good...I came to the restaurant expecting authentic Turkish fair, and got some American steak-house instead! I wish there was some kind of announcement online, so when I looked at the menu I wouldn\'t have expected Turkish food...I guess it\'s part my fault and I should have read Yelp before I went :D \n\nAt first we got bread and olive oil/vinegar blend. The bread was good, but not the best. The oil dip was a bit thick on vinegar. Hummus was average; My friend commented that it tasted just like store-bought. I thought it was a little better than that, but still not great. Calamari was excellent. Mediterranean salad was very heavy on cheese, which I didn\'t like. The vegetables tasted fresh, but all that cheese distracted from the flavors. The Turkish pudding dessert (one of the few remaining Turkish dishes) was tasty, but nothing ground-breaking. And $7.95 for a small piece seemed a little steep. Overall prices were reasonable, however, for this caliber of a restaurant.\n\nService was nice, not overbearing and helpful.\n\nOn the way out, we noticed that one of the steaks of other patrons looked very pink and undercooked. It did not look appetizing at all. Of course, she could have ordered it that way...\n\nOverall, loved the atmosphere and the service. Food was mediocre. I am sure I would have loved the Turkish fair here, but certainly was not impressed with "steakhouse" food. I felt a little deceived in the process as well. I probably won\'t be back here.'

Admittedly, I am not a sushi expert, but if it tastes good and doesn\'t fall apart, I\'m happy. The service was good on a busy Saturday night.\n\nWe went again recently on a Saturday afternoon during a "dead period". A few people were in the bar area, but the hostess was doing double-duty as a waitress. I was a bit worried that it might be slow, but no problem. She was friendly and quick. This time we did the teppanyaki table and it was great! The chef that came out was very friendly and skilled. We got steak, chicken, and scallops, all prepared perfectly. However, everything is cooked with a lot of butter, which gives it a rich butter taste that is not to our liking (or good health). My wife ordered a mixed drink from the bar that had absolutely no alcohol taste - I think we paid $9 for mostly pineapple juice. Be safe and order beer. \n\nOverall, great place.

S"Came here on a groupon and glad I did. I see behind the counter an aging, white guy at a place called Devil Hotz and figure I should stay away from the Mexican food and veer towards the more East Coast food. Everything, no matter gets home fries and mac salad. I decided on the Philly cheesesteak. \n\nWhat a disappointment. I swear the meat was Steak'ums and the green peppers had this very weird clove flavor to them. The home fries were just potatoes, no peppers or onions. The mac salad was noodles and mayo, no flavor besides me drenching the only topping around on it, Trappey's hot sauce. I'll return to try their Mexican food just because I never make a decision based on one visit. First impressions though, don't waste your time unless you want a pound of cheap, flavorless filler."

But any who, the guacamole sat for a few moments and it turned a really funky green that I'm not use to.

It should be mentioned that everyone ordered vegetarian items, and no one was disappointed, even my fussy grandparents.\n\nThe waiter was a jokester, and I found his excessively corny humor endearing.\n\nMy dish (family bean curd) was tasty, and I was pleased to learn that, for once, a restaurant had indulged me when I asked to turn the spice all the way up. My friend got the Vegetable Lo Mein. There were fewer vegetables than she typically prefers, but we both thought the sauce was superb. I also tried several other dishes and was not disappointed. It was definitely a nice experience.\n\nThe one negative I can think of was that the floor in the area we were seated was uneven. It's a minor gripe, and may have stood out more to me due to the cramped seating (as the whole fam was crowded around the table)"

At first I wasn\'t sure, but then when I ordered a sausage/pepperoni pizza, I could not believe what I had just received.  The pizza was ENORMOUS!  and the price of course was fantastic!  When I opened the box however, I was shocked that what I got was in fact a delicious real cheese pizza with fresh pepperoni\'s and shredded sausage.  That\'s right.  Shredded sausage. How many times have you seen that done?  Easy to get ground sausage, but let me tell you , shredded sausage is the omega of Delish!!

S'Le Mouton Noir is bringing a touch of je ne sais quoi to Bruntsfield. This small French restaurant is a good place for a romantic little date for two (as to be honest are most French restaurants) or good for groups, maybe to wish a friend a bon anniversaire. If arguably a little cramped, the restaurant makes up for it with the d\xc3\xa9cor which is fresh and avoids being overbearing. There are some set menus, with 2 courses from \xc2\xa316.95 and 3 from \xc2\xa319.95 on Fridays and Saturdays, or there is the a la carte option. \n\nThese prices are not too expensive, especially when you consider some of the other French restaurants in Edinburgh but the food is not up to the same quality. That is not to say it is bad at all, indeed my steak was excellent, but for the price I had expected something better. The mains generally have this problem; they are all very nice, but just seem a little overpriced. On the other hand the starters and deserts are d\xc3\xa9licieux. Another small point is that the wine list, whilst comprehensive, is also a tad pricey. This is often the case with French restaurants, and Le Mouton Noir is very good, there are just other, better ones around'

Sometimes, I just want something to make my tongue sweat, and that's when I go for a Kickin' Chicken Sandwich!\nThe ingredients are consistently of high-quality; real chicken, freshly made, and made to order.  The sauces they use are one-of-a-kind, ranging from Wimpy (super mild) to Insane (slap-yo-momma HOT!!).  The fries are krinkle-cut to ensure maximum flavor-ablitiy from their fry seasoning or the optional Zax's Sauce ($.25 extra!).  They offer quite a few delicious sides, such as fried pickles and fried mushrooms.  Both rock the socks off your taste buds.  \nZaxby's is a nice departure from your run-of-the-mill fast food stops.

We loved the perfect puff pastry, mascarpone, onion confit, and mozzarella was terrific and it paired well with our white wine. Our wine was delightful and fun! If you want a bottle of white thats crisp, enjoyed young with elegant depth; go for the Malvasia. I\'m not a fan of tomato sauce, but Rom\xc3\xa9o pulls it off with authentic richness. I know this because I had a slice of my dinner date\'s Calabrese and was stunned. If you love well done crusts and lighter flavors - go for the La Flamande. I was very impressed and will order again! The cream sauce was rich, yet lovely. Perfect pancetta, fresh leeks, with flavorful mozzarella and parmesan: you won\'t be disappointed. \n\nOh and don\'t worry at all about your French, they give fabulous service in French, English, Yum, and Mouthfull\'s of food! \n\nWIne: CONTI ZECCA MALVASIA BIANCA DONNA MARZIA\n\nAppetizer:  LA TARTE AUX TOMATES P\xc3\x82TE FEUILLET\xc3\x89E, MASCARPONE, OIGNONS CONFITS, MOZZARELLA, TOMATES,  ROQUETTE\n\nMains: LA FLAMANDE - SAUCE CR\xc3\x88ME, PANCETTA, POIREAUX, MOZZARELLA, COPEAUX DE PARMESAN \n\nLA CALABRESE - SAUCE TOMATE, CALABRESE \xc3\x89PIC\xc3\x89, FINES HERBES, OIGNONS, PARMESAN, MOZZARELLA /'

S"Ok after a long thought I will give this place a one star. It's apparent that the manager/owner? Does not quite know the tricks of the trade. Reminds me of the tv show restaurant rescue because they need help! First off:\nThe kitchen crew was complaining and taking the entire time. Conversations bled into the customer floor and that's a no no. Then THE COOK CANT KEEP HIS HANDS OF HIS FACE! Gross!! In his ear and on his hair. The manager jumps in to help puts on gloves but does not instruct the crew to do the same. \nSecond:\nThe help looks frustrated at the lack of incentives is ovbious. Very not motivated at all. Waited for ever, sat down without menus or drink requests.  She checked on us once? Maybe twice for coffee top up. Tables are dirty and condiments are empty :(. \nThird:\nCleanliness is next to godliness and Jesus doesn't eat here lol.  The forks were dirty had to reject them. The kitchen is dirty just look at the backsplash and see how often they clean up. Bathrooms? Don't bring reading material you're not gonna be long if you know what I mean.  \n\nLastly the food:\nOk then here is the element intent. 1-10; ten being best this was a 3. When you over cook bacon then you have rookies in the kitchen. Sausage was undercooked!!! (Dangerous stuff lol). Eggs were not over easy more like swimming in grease. Potatoes not even mostly loose ends. Pancakes were not even. Looked like I made those at home (and I suck). \n\nOverall:  there are NO good bfast places in the west end unless you make the drive to Nicks Dinner on  Litchfield and Waddell ave.   I used to frequent a Carrows in Cali all the time hence why I came here. Sorry folks but nothing to see here. Grab a bagel or something."

There wasn't much that was edible for a vegetarian.  They had set menus for breakfast and even though one included a croissant, you couldn't order a croissant a la carte. I would think that a croissant would be a staple but I guess not.  The english muffin I got instead was small and tasted like it was from the grocery store.  Mostly tourists ate here and we did too but only out of desperation.  I must find better options so I don't have to eat disappointing food like this again."

S'It\'s been a few years since I\'ve been to the Common Plea.  As I mentioned in my last review, it\'s not a place to dine at every day.  But Common Plea is one of those Pittsburgh dining institutions that has been around since before I was born.\n\nWe had an early holiday supervisor\'s luncheon here today.  We decided to have it early in December so that all of us including our Field Office Director could make it. Being that I was just promoted in October, I now felt like one of the "in" crowd.  \n\nThe Breakfast for Lunch (Frittata Potato, Spinach & Crispy Proscuitto or \nHot Sausage, Eggs & Potatoes or Egg Whites Omelet & Steamed Vegetables) sounded mighty tempting, but I went for the Waldorf Salad with Cajun Chicken & Granny Smith Apples.  Yeah, I know.  I\'ve read the reports that restaurant salads are even bigger carb- and calorie bombs than entrees.  But it had meat, veggies, & fruit--that\'s healthy!

S'I tend to not go to Subways because I think their bread tastes like cardboard but it\'s hard to ignore the convenience of having them in so many places. Was driving by this one and decided to give it a shot. I wasn\'t disappointed. I did have a "buy one 6 inch get one free with a drink" and it came to $6. Clean location, quick service and compared to others, what got them 5 stars is that my sandwich artist didn\'t skimp on the ingredients. Felt like I got extra cheese without asking and they were really kind about asking if I didn\'t want anything else almost perhaps surprised by the fact I like my sandwiches pretty simple.

S"With the proliferation of chic burger joints in the city, I was very happy to discover this unpretentious little gem of a restaurant in a secluded corner of the Plateau. All I needed that cold Saturday evening was a burger and a poutine, and I must say they filled my cravings with flying colours. My burger was well put together, held its shape even towards the end, when usually burgers start to fall apart, and it was daaaahlicious. I can't remember the name of the burger, but it was the one with a strip of bacon in it. The poutine also made my heart sing, for they were crispy in all the right places, sweet in the right degrees and covered in just the right amount of gravy. As for my husband's order, he had a plate of boulettes d'agneau topped with feta and emmenthal cheese. and he loved it. The restaurant atmosphere was also cosy and being away from the hustle and bustle of Mont-Royal Avenue, I felt a bit like in a small town's greasy spoon, which was a sweet feeling. At the end of the meal I said to myself, why haven't I been here earlier?"

The service from boath the greeter and waitress was pleasant and attentive and my sardine starter and hake main course w/ side of spinach were both very well cooked and presented.\n\n\n I'd like to give them a further half star but as ever having to dock a full one instead. The cheese board was the one minorly negative aspect of the meal. It could have done with a couple more oatcakes and maybe more onion marmalde and the slice of brie had clearly been allowed to dry out and harden a bit + the cheese knife had seen better days (the plastic handle was cracked clean through on both sides near the base of the blade).\n\n\n No idea if the interior's changed much since it was a Harry Ramsden's but it's well decorated and gets a lot of sun. I intend to go back."

Food is hit or miss. I know its a "All you can eat sushi" place in Chinatown, so expectations shouldn\'t be too high, But if you are paying around  $30 per person, I\'d expect the food to be good.In the menu there\'s a section (Big rolls). So we ordered 1 "big" roll of the dragons eye. When it arrived, we couldn\'t help laughing. It was was super thin roll, a bit smaller than a Loonie.

S'Next up, there was the Winneburger from the fine folks at Nouveau Palais on Bernard street in Mile End. This old school looking winnebago serves up classic summer BBQ fare - burgers, chips, milkshakes and lemonade. I decided to go for the regular burger and a lemonade to get a sense of their offerings.\n\nThe lemonade was solid - sweet and freshening. Perfect for the hot summer during which it was consumed. The burger came with cheese, onions, lettuce and a tomato. This was a perfectly executed classic burger. The beef patty was nice and juicy without being too messy to eat on the go. The bun had the right level of crunch on the outside with the nice soft interior. All the vegetables were fresh and classic for a burger. This burger is exactly the kind one hopes for when having a nice BBQ back home. Just a classic item done right. Quite nice.'

I took them home about 5 blocks away and as soon as we opened the bag out came a cold feeling, like when you open the reefer door.  We had to put them in the microwave for 30 seconds which turned them into a semi-warm sloppy mess oozing melted cheese and sour cream.  Needless to say we will go elsewhere when the next "gotta have taco alarm goes off".'

S"Their sandwiches are the best in town (same owner as Dakao sandwiches).  The freshness and the light crispness of the bread is perfection.  I personally think it's better than Lee's sandwich in Vegas.  \n\nI tried their soup-  bun bo hue, it was decent.  Little noodle and meat in a large bowl of soup (the owner was so nice he even apologized and brought out a plate of extra meat).  The soup itself wasn't greasy as other restaurants, so that's a plus.  I'll give them a lot of credit for the side  toppings dish.  That's something I pay really close attention to - how fresh the greens are, the quantity, and the proper types of toppings they give you for the particular dish.  I'll give 5 star for that one!  But on the other hand, I think it's best to order what their known for - sandwiches :P\n\nThe Vietnamese coffee and their jasmine green tea were pretty good and on point - can't go wrong there.  \n\nAs for their desserts, I was too full so I ordered their coconut jello to go.  The drive home was enough time to make more room to try it out and it was pretty good! Can't wait to check out their other freshly made desserts next time!! \n\nAs for the customer service - the owner and the older lady in the front are really sweet !  :)"

I mean, really, when else is it acceptable, nay, even expected, to replenish lost salts and calories via Mickey D's?  Thus, my feelings towards McD's may be skewed to be more positive than most yelpers.  When I dropped into this McDonald's for a quick lunch break during a bike ride, I was famished and heartily devoured a hot cheeseburger and fresh fries in approximately 2 seconds.  After inhaling my lunch, I noticed that the place was clean and, after a quick visit to the loo, the restroom was clean as well.  Staff seemed pleasant enough and got both my husband's order and mine correct (although that should really be a given).

S'I hate to give my peeps 2 stars, but this cafe just didn\'t deliver.\n\nEnter your typical strip mall, into a very small store with a few tables along the walls and a counter.  Loud Vietnamese patrons sat around "playing cards" (it\'s a euphemism), smoking and  talking loudly.  You know you\'re in a relatively growing, but new Vietnamese neighborhood when there are a lot of "card houses" in the area.  The kind of place you walk into and they\'re a little surprised you want to order food.  \n\nI don\'t think they speak much English and looked at me and my Caucasian husband as if we might be lost.  FYI, we tried the Banh Mi Cafe up the road, but they don\'t serve banh mi anymore and this was an even more awkward entrance than where we ended up - strange goings ons that I don\'t want to know about.\n\nWe ordered the white ham sandwich and an iced coffee to go.  The coffee was good (as it is at most, ahem, card houses), but skimpy.  It filled only half my cup.\n\nAs for the sandwiches, they use traditional Vietnamese bread, not the long french Vietnamese baguettes, which is fine, except mine was pretty stale and chewy, as only a stale Vietnamese baguette can be.  The meat, veggies, peppers, cilantro etc. were all pretty good.  If only they baked their bread fresh, in house.  \n\nYour best bet is Le\'s Sandwiches.  It\'s a little out of the way for me, but worth the drive.'

What Kwok does have, however, is a ability to offer some unusual alternatives to the usual Chinese cuisine regulars. An interestingly spiced 'Eight treasure shredded duck' and a dish of mussels in black bean sauce are a few of the unique offerings. The menu is hit and miss, though, some dishes will leave to satisfied and other will leave you questioning the flavour combinations.\n\nB.Y.O.B and some inexpensive set menus equate to a cheap eat though, so Kwok is worth a try."

Da muss man fast Angst haben, dass einem da nix ins Essen springt (die Reinigung Classic Clean ist 50 Meter weiter und freut sich \xc3\xbcber Arbeit).

Allerdings stehe ich nicht auf das 90er Jahre Plastikbesteck. \n\nMan m\xc3\xb6chte nach dem Besuch im Pizzahaus etwas in die Spendenbox werfen, damit es den Laden auch noch in Zukunft gibt. Allerdings habe ich da bisweilen so meine Zweifel. \n\nIrgendwie schwierig das Pizzahaus zu beurteilen, da ich schon viele lustige Abende dort hatte. Das lag allerdings nicht am Essen, am Service oder am Ambiente.\n\nUpdate 21.10.10: Ich ziehe einen weiteren Stern ab, da selbst bei Betr\xc3\xa4gen um die EUR 50,00 keine Kartenzahlung m\xc3\xb6glich - leider an meinen Bed\xc3\xbcrfnissen vorbei.'

The chicken fried steak tasted like mystery meat, everything was doused in extra salt, and the vegetables tasted like they'd been in a freezer for years and then poorly reconstituted. Our meals were a disaster.\n\nThe only two saving graces: A surprisingly decent salad bar (with a lot of fresh fruit and fresh spinach and other fresh, healthy things) and a relatively chipper waitstaff."

S"Having never ventured north of the Laurier subway stop before, on our last day in Montreal we decided to breach some new territory.  We went in search of another brunch spot and walked by Le Toasteur on the way, and thought it looked busy and good.  Well as it turned out, the primary target of our trip was close, so we doubled back to Toasteur.  It wasn't bad... but it there was nothing particularly out of the ordinary or special either.  I had a salmon bagel which was pretty standard, the fruit was fresh and the toast slices were thick.  Not bad, but I probably wouldn't seek this one out again."

Originally seasoned and nicely flavoured (and I'm a girl who loves her pizza!). I asked the waitress for the most popular dessert and she suggested the Nutella doughnut holes. They were good, but tasted exactly like you'd expect them to taste.\n\nService : although the wait staff is very friendly, the service is quite long, considering the menu options. Don't be too much of in a hurry.\n\nDecor : simple but nice. the TVs are a little distracting considering the place isn't that big. The bathrooms are VERY small - I know this doesn't affect the restaurants quality, but it was worth the mention."

S'Is "Arizona\'s Best BBQ" hidden behind Famous Dave\'s BBQ in Peoria? Well, yes and no. The sign out front boldly declared it but I\'m not too sure myself...\n\nPersonally, I\'m often a bit of a contrarian as in I like to look for the non-obvious. In my continual quest to find something redeeming about Peoria, I find a BBQ place tucked behind Famous Dave\'s and right next to Arrowhead Harley- so I figure that this\'ll be my hidden gem, right? I mean, a small BBQ place literally behind a chain operation like Famous Dave\'s has to either *really* bring or they\'ll soon be out of business, right? Well... not to be mean but something tells me that there will be a space for rent in not too long...\n\nNot that anything was really terrible. The staff was friendly enough. I ordered the half-rack of ribs with two sides. It was $14. Sure, there were lunch sandwiches in the $7-$9 range but BBQ to me means ribs. And for $14 in a "hole in the wall" place should be large portions and fabulous. I really can\'t say it was either. And I wanted to like it. The portions were OK but not $14 in size or quality. I almost wanted to hit up Chipotle on my way out of Arrowhead... I\'d definitely skip this place...'

S'The Hub is a venue owned and run by the International Festival, right in the heart of Edinburgh. Converted from a beautiful church, this main festival venue, which can be hired out for functions, also contains a large cafe restaurant. The beautiful church facade is unfortunately a little let down by the modern interior.\n\nI\'ve been to the Hub cafe a few times to meet people for coffee or lunch on businessy sort of meetings. Its a fantastic location, right at the top of the Mile and just around the corner from the castle. This is probably the main cause for the Hub\'s business.\n\nDespite the beautiful building and the convenient location the cafe isn\'t the best. It serves ordinary sorts of teas and coffees and light lunches. The lunches themselves aren\'t terrible, after finally extending their menu, but the prices are. For what you get, which is fairly small portions of "fancy" food dressed up, the cost is too much. In the past the staffing has been too slow and a bit inconsistent.\n\nA great location venue but with a poor cafe and a lot of room for improvement,'

The black gentleman who took my order in the drive through, was so unprofessional and rude, I actually left without my order, because He made the wrong order and kept arguing with me about it. I was like, can you just make what i ordered, and he was really bitchy to me. I mean they always get my order wrong at this mcdonald's it never fails, but this time, i actually caught it when i was paying because the price was off. He was such a jerk. I was like I don't think that is what I ordered, It is the wrong price. He says to me, well thats what i made so your gonna have to buy it. I thought he was joking and Then I realized he was seriously asking me to pay for this meal, that i did not order. I was like so pissed, and i just left."

S'2nd worst fast food experience of my life. \n\nAt the drive thru menu, we ordered 2 Double-Downs and a 10piece boneless meal w/ mac n cheese and mashed potatoes (the cashier repeated our order back to us). Once we got to the window, we had to repeat our entire order for the cashier as if he didnt catch any of it the first time. I thought that was a red flag but took it as a sign that at least they wouldnt be messing up our order... NOPE!\n\nWe got home and opened our food only to realize that the mac n cheese our toddler had been begging for was switched out with cole slaw! As if that wasnt enough to irritate me, ALL of the chicken was way overcooked, dry, and tough... And since bad things come in 3\'s, it\'s only right that our double-downs were horrific too. I\'ve had at least a dozen double-downs in my life and this was the only time I\'ve ever seen KFC use what was basically 3"x1" chicken strips. Also, they were served without bacon.\n\nI was STARVING when I ordered my food but had absolutely ZERO appetite when I got home and saw the food. I was so upset about my $35 order that I actually called them. I spoke with the shift leader and what was his solution to the problem?? Free food!! Why the hell would I want MORE of that "food"?!! Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake? When my wife drove back to speak with someone in person, the place was closed!! The door said they close at 11pm... Ummmm, it was 10:15pm. Seriously?!! Corporate WILL be getting a phone call first thing in the morning.'

S"It's Subway.  Maybe it's just me, but they don't seem as good as they used to be.  They barely put any marinara on their chicken marinara, and the bread seems to turn into a doughy mess after just a few minutes.  It looks OK when they cut it and put the stuff on it, but just in the time it took to get to the table it had collapsed from a full, airy bread to a wad of dough.  I'm not sure the toasting helped at all.\n\nAs restaurants go, they suck.  As sub shops go, they are really below average.  I'd go here before going to McDonald's or Burger King.  But that's about all I can say.\n\nIf you have other options, I suggest taking them.  If not, it beats McYucks."

Well it was hot and it was fast and it was Wendy's. I'm not looking for gourmet. I ordered 2   5 piece spicy nuggets and a new caesar wrap they have. My total was 3 bucks. The nuggets are spicy and the wrap was basically one of their chicken sandwiches cut in half and wrapped up with some lettuce and dressing. Not bad I suppose, and for 99 cents its better then any other places wrap I think. In fact, Wendy's has a HUGE value menu so if your into quick cheap eats, I'd definitely recommend it because I'm sure you can find something."

S'When I first heard about Imbibe opening it was a great announcement. They have delicious craft beers and delicious menu options that taste phenomenal. In addition, it has a nice layout and great atmosphere. Unfortunately, this is not even close to being enough to allow me to ignore how horrible the service has been 3 out of the 4 times I have been there. The first two times attending Imbibe we were barely approached and if we were it was with an entitled and pretentious attitude. The waitress made us feel as if we were bothering her by being there. Not to mention we were also severely rushed into leaving, even though it was made obvious the bills were not needed. But with all that in the past, lets discuss my last visit. When we arrived we picked a newly vacated seat outside and informed our waitress ( the same waitress all three times ) we needed menus. 5 minutes later our menus came and we ordered beer. 10 minutes later the first beer came but the second beer had been forgotten and took another 5 minutes to arrive. Than we ordered food and I pondered, "i am not sure which one to pick." And our waitress responds "just pick one*. To top of the evening after waiting probably 30 minutes for our food it came out wrong and I had to wait about 15 minutes for a replacement. Once again, our waitress actef entitled and better than you, which is the opposite of the environment I want to be paying to hang out in. I work customer service at store with challenging customers and I know how irritating and aggravating our customers and jobs can be but that never gives you the right to talk down and belittle people who are just trying to enjoy a night out. I want to attend imbibe on a regular basis but will not anytime in the near future. I write this review so that the management and owners of Imbibe can be notified that they have a staff member that evokes all this in me.

Nevertheless, I ordered an appetizer and a entree and was waiting UNTIL I SAW A MOUSE STROLLING BY MY TABLE! I  freaked out and kindly asked the waiter to go check out behind the fire extinguishers in the corner as I saw the mouse hiding behind them. The waiter KEPT REFUSING to go check it out (he looked pretty scared) and kept saying that there were no mice in the premise. Eventually, he worked up enough courage to go check out the extinguishers, only to find a mouse hiding there in a "surprise"\n\nNot sure how great the food is (I\'m sure it\'s very tasty because chinese food are very tasty) but I ended up walking away because I totally lost my appetite. I can understand that these kinds of things can happen due to the building being old, but still, I did not receive a single apology from the waiters, only to be greeted by \'hey it\'s only a small mice\' by a young man working there. This level of service was totally astounding to me and, of course, I told all the people staying at my hostel to stay away from the place.'

S"One of those cold Montreal nights where we froze ourselves to death at the Snow Village, so we felt like eating polish on Prince Arthur. Unfortunately, Mazurka closed, as many restaurants on Prince Arthur, so we chose to go to the first restaurant in sight - la Caverne Grecque. \n\nFirst of all, this is why I am giving a one star - it was really cold in the restaurant. Unpleasantly cold.\n\nWe wanted a hot chicken soup as soon as possible to warm ourselves up - it came within a minute we had placed our order, so we knew it was sitting on the stove all day... it was bland and warmish, not what we expected, and the weird taste made us think it was loaded with msg.\n\nThe chicken and the lamb were okay, really nothing amazing. Our problem was with the potatoes, veggies and rice. Bland. No taste. If your chef does not believe in seasoning, please just please at least use some salt.\n\nThe restaurant does have potential. But it seems to me that the whole Prince Arthur area is slowly dying, so I won't recommend it."

S'I probably would say, that this place is okay in a sense.  But, probably not a "good" OK, but more like a "meh" OK.  It is a nice place and it\'s kept clean.  Then again, we did go really late around 10pm, after our concert with Aaron Lewis.  We didn\'t really want to go around GVR to find a place to eat, so Turf Grill was the first thing that kind of stuck out.  Actually it was the first thing I read on the direction board. \n\nLocated inside Green Valley Ranch, is a small sandwich/burger shop.  Which pricing is a bit more then expected.  But, I did like my turkey sandwich, cause it was a lot of turkey.  I was expect a few slices, but it was kind of stacked about 3 inches of turkey, plus your two slices of bread. I really enjoyed that turkey sandwich.  My wife on the other hand, had a hamburger.  It was edible, but not sure if she liked it that much but it was edible.  \n\nThe place itself seem small, but enough room to stay and eat.  The staff was very nice, and friendly.  Kind of sucks that there\'s only one menu to look at, which is kind of plastered next against the wall, next to the register.  So I can see how it can be hard to read, when you go there during the busy times.  But going there at night, it wasn\'t so bad or crowded.  \n\nI would have to say, if your looking for a quick bite to eat and don\'t mind the pricing.  Then Turf Grill is good to go.  I would probably consider going when its not to busy, cause there is limited seating.  If you go when their not busy, you might get the best out of it. If you go when it is busy, then you might not get the best out of it.'

I think that those may have even been when we were moving, and stopped to grab a bite so we would have something to eat while we were moving boxes into the house.\n\nWhile the corner location is decent, it is not the easiest business to get into and out of.  You have to do a bit of maneuvering into the Bi-Lo parking lot, and that can be challenging - especially if you are headed back towards Charlotte on Lawyers Road.\n\nThe good news, such as it is, is that the staff typically does a decent job and are generally friendly.

I went to collect after this time, the woman on the till took my money (more than the advertised amount) but then it became clear my food hadn't been cooked (so why take my money?). She said it'd be another ten minutes. While I was waiting she was receiving several orders via phone and online and seemed unable to cope with the demand. The group sitting in the restaurant area started complaining and asking where their food was. I left, called the restaurant again after ten minutes, she said she was getting the order ready for me. After returning to the restaurant for the second time it became clear the chef hadn't even started cooking my very small order. Ninety minutes after placing my order and two trips later I got my food. The food itself was dull, no subtlety to the flavours, some of the vegetables far too hard, and only a few prawns in the curry. Here's a suggestion: try to fulfil the orders you have before accepting dozens more, and be honest with your customers. Shambolic place and terrible customer service."

There's no way I would usually pay that much to get into a venue unless I knew of something special happening, however the group I was with decided to go in.  Very long entrance way and bar before you get to the back of the venue to the stage and dance floor, which is massive.  There are even a few booths overhead, like at a theatre.  It is a lovely venue and would be great for watching a live band.  There was actually a live band playing when we arrived (which I'm guessing was the reason for the exorbitant cover charge), but unfortunately they only had a couple of songs to go until they finished.  Then the dj played 70's and 80's music all night.  It was fun and had a good dance, but had had enough after a while.  We certainly felt very young, compared to the majority of the patrons who were between 40 and 68 I reckon.\n\nI wouldn't choose to go back, but can see how the Jam House would appeal to an older crowd."

When we stepped through the door the place was totally empty apart from two members of staff having food and working on a lap top, they looked a bit surprised to see us but stopped eating and showed us to a table.  There was no music on which left the place silent and a bit unwelcoming.  They did put music on after taking our coffee order which helped certainly, as it did with a couple of other folk arriving. \n\nThe late and mocha both looked the part in nice tall glasses but didn't taste the best.  It was super sweet with no real chocolate flavour, I wonder if it was cheap hot chocolate powder? I never finished my mocha, which is unheard of!\n\nLooking around, you get the impression that this little bistro has once been loved but it feels like the relationship is over, there were light bulbs out in every light fitting and a general tired feeling for the place."

S"Plenty has been said of late about the eating choices we make. It comes with little wonder. We are, after all, a very fat country. That is, so the experts contend, because we just cannot seem to get enough to eat from our cartoon-represented fast food chains. We eat the greasy burgers and fries, chicken sandwiches and the gravy-suffocated chicken bowls (Wait a minute. Does anybody really eat those?). There are better dining choices, to be sure. But I'm just not sure those smarter decisions can be made a Baja Fresh.\r\n\r\nConsider first that Baja Fresh is or was a subsidiary of the Wendy's burger chain. While Wendy's is home to one of the best fast food chicken sandwiches out there, it is not by any means the Good Earth. It should come as no surprise then that a subsidiary packs a lot of calories into their food offerings as well.\r\n\r\nTake a classic like the Bean & Cheese Burrito, for example. There are beans, cheese and a tortilla. How bad can it be? Try 980 calories worth of bad with 40 grams of fat. That doesn't even include chips. By comparison, a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese at McDonald's would plow 730 calories into your gut. The good news, I suppose, is that you hardly need to eat the rest of the day after eating a Baja Fresh burrito. In the end, just know that a trip to Baja Fresh --- while tasty --- is as much of a trip to Wendy's, McDonald's, Jack in the Box, Carl's Junior ..."

They give you chips, of course, but then you get four, five six - I lost count - salsas to go with them. It's a veritable buffet of salsa. As has been mentioned, none are earth-shattering, but it's nice to have something other than a simple watered-down salsa to go with your chips.\n\nAfter that, you get fairly standard mexican fare, delivered by generally helpful staff at a very, very slow pace. In fact, were it not for the chips and the extraordinary amount of salsa, it might be far too slow. Though I like mexican food, and don't mind it taking a while to prepare, because it means they are generally working on something tasty, in this case it was like they forgot we were there and had to remember what we ordered.\n\nBy the time they delivered it, we had eaten so much of the chips and salsa, we were hardly hungry for the food, but we did eat it, and it wasn't bad - just not decent enough to make us want to go back. In the end, eat we did, and if nothing else, I can say without a doubt that...\n\nI ate it and I didn't die."

Eggs over easy, salad with dressing, toast with peanut butter, bacon, potatoes and several different fruits plus a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Wow! I looked in their display cases and they had huge sandwiches and yummy looking desserts. Wifi was free and they had computers you could use. They are cash only but have an ATM right by the entrance.

S"This place is the worst in fast food service. \nThe management does not seem to get the concept of good food fast with good service and attitudes from your employees who deal with the public.  And when you screw up an order, don't make pathetic excuses; apologize and fix the problem! Quickly!\n\nI've been to this place three times now and each time have had to wait so long compared to other similar fast food places. \n\nGreat coupons in the mail. Great pictures of the food on the mailers. But they just don't deliver.  In the future, I'm taking my fast-food business elsewhere."

Caesar salad was perfect but could have been a bit more generous. \n\nMom had the sandwich du Marche which had green apples, coleslaw, grilled chicken, beacon, tomatoes I think and get this...  A breaded and fried slice of Cheddar cheese ! Yum but they should make a sandwich out of that alone. \n\nThere's a nice terrace in the back, the waitress I think was alone, it was around 6 on an early weekday. She was friendly but seemed a little too comfortable. \n\nNow, the not so good....\n\nThe prices are steep, the plates we had should not have costed more that 12$ max and they were around 17$ do you know what I can have to eat in Montreal for 17$??? Shaking my head !!!\n\nSo despite the fact that i admire their ambition, unless prices drop considerably, I won't be returning to Casey's as there are way more places in Montreal bang for your buck worthy !"

S"My parent's business use to be next door to one of these places....\n\nFor this location, I would recommend eating here on the weekdays ONLY. The guy (mencho) that makes the bowl has been doing it for a long time and knows how to make them the best. \n\nIf you are really hungry or want to get a bowl for two meals I would recommend the sumo bowl. It only costs 8 dollars + change and its loaded with meat, veggies and rice. Another good entree is the Yaki Soba, which are grilled noodles with veggies (make sure to add your meat choice it costs extra). If you want to give your salad more of a zing rather than the plain rice vinegar go with the ginger dressing - its delicious. \n\nEnjoy the sweetness of  the massive amounts of sugar and tastiness of their Teriyaki sauce! But if you are looking for a healthier option go with the white meat chicken, more veggies than brown rice option. Food is usually pretty fresh.\n\nRemember to get stamp card if you are regular, 10 stamps = $5 off a purchase :)"

So you have been warned.\n\nThe carne asada was mediocre, reminds me of ground beef, huge let down. I hate when carne asada is like a ground beef rather than diced.\nThe al pastor was good. Only thing different about this place that I will remember to change next time is they add some kind of a orangey red sauce on top of the tacos so if you like crazy spicy food don't ask to have it removed. But i personally like to add the heat as I go. Not in every bite. So until next time this place is just  a C for me. I'm a huge Carne asada Freak and this place didn't cut it."

S'We came here since our original destination had a grease fire and closed for the next hour.\n\nBreakfast sounded kinda good so the BF and I grabbed:\n\nDenver Pancakes- these were okay. They would be better a bit crispier since I like my hash browns crisp.\n\nThere was confusion on the ordering though. You can get a la carte and just get the pancakes, a combo which is "served with two eggs any style and choice of: applewood bacon, sausage links or turkey sausage patty, or you can go deluxe which says "served with three breakfast meats: applewood bacon, savory ham and sausage links or turkey sausage patty. Only $1 more to upgrade from a combo". The server asked if I wanted it as a combo. I said no, I want to go deluxe and let me have sunny side and I picked pork sausage links over the turkey patty. \n\nThe meal comes out and I have sausage links and denver pancakes. I asked where the other meat and eggs and she goes "oh thats why I asked if you wanted a combo"....which I didn\'t because I want it as a deluxe and either way a combo or a deluxe has eggs and I did say what style of eggs I wanted and it was written down so she goes looks and realizes I did order it. So then she asked what choice of other meat I want for my deluxe and I said, it comes with all of them but then she just sounded really confused like and kept saying its a choice of and was getting frustrated like  I was not ordering right so I just said give me bacon. Choice of- combo, 3 meats deluxe....I don\'t work there, but I can read that right on the menu. She didn\'t charge me for the bacon or eggs, but it is still not what I ordered and I don\'t get why it was hard to get that the deluxe has a little bit of everything. The was the point- I wanted a variety and I didn\'t get what I sought after. Also she said something about the chef was missing so she apparently cooked it.... (that\'s kinda weird) the bacon was crispy burnt, the eggs over easy, not sunny side. \n\nBF got corned beef hash which has eggs, home potatoes and then you get a choice of bread or pancakes. He upgraded to red velvet pancakes. It was all pretty okay, but nothing remarkable. \n\nIt\'s not the best breakfast out there, but late night it\'ll do. I would usually say  that it\'s a wide variety breakfast platter bang for your buck place, but not tonight. For the fact it was difficult to get something straight forward and on their menu I can\'t really give more than 2 stars, "meh I\'ve had better" on a place that will never really have outstanding food so it really tanks when service isn\'t there. \n\nShe was nice enough....but that isn\'t enough to make up for the confusion. Just don\'t order anything "complicated" I guess.'

S'Okay, Here\'s the truth: I go to this Applebee\'s for dinner because my son and I can walk there from the movie theater, where we\'ve been dropped off to see a show. The food is not very good. It\'s mostly out of a box or a bag that started in the freezer and prepared by someone with limited culinary training or authority. They are reheating and combining. What little comes fresh is often not fresh at all (think two to three item salads, with that one wonky tomato wedge). We once asked for steamed broccoli for my son and were brought a hunk of broccoli that had not even been trimmed -- stalk, leaves, and all. It had been lightly steamed, at least. \n\nWhat\'s best are things like steaks, burgers, little sliders and other fried appetizers (because, well, fried), dessert shots (like pudding in a glass). The drinks are okay, too. \n\nThe tables are getting sticky with age. They\'re wiped off with a communal rag kept in a bucket of disinfectant stuff behind the greeters\' podium (it just makes my skin crawl every time it comes out of the gray "water"). \n\nThe best thing about the place is the staff.

Their cajun filet biscuit and their steak biscuit are absolutely delicious.  The biscuits are nice anf buttery and soft.

I also love their dirty rice, but it is not usually available at breakfast.  That was the case this morning - no problem.  As I was on my way to my table - the woman behind the counter calls over to me and says thay they just brought the rice out and here is a side.

S'For a while, I made a point of passing by this place and never stopping in. It was just a matter of principle: If I can\'t trust a restaurant to avoid using Comic Sans on its sign, how am I going to trust them to prepare my food? But when I was wandering for dinner one time in the area, I saw a "pulled pork combo" for $6.25 and figured, hey, it\'s better to knock a place you\'ve tried than one you haven\'t. The d\xc3\xa9cor on the inside is pretty basic, but a whole lot better than the outside. I liked the cook and the cashier. The pulled pork sandwich came on a pretty big bed of high-quality fries. It ain\'t Stubb\'s, but the food was perfectly acceptable, and greatly improved by the addition of hot sauce, of which they had 4 or 5 of my favorite brands.\n\nBurgers Etc., I like you, despite your terrible sign. Seriously, you\'re in a hip, happenin\' \'hood in western Montreal (shoot me now, I can\'t believe I just said that). You will lose business over it. Not mine, though. You\'ve got a friend in me.\n\nMaybe get some music in there, too. The whirring of the soda machine doesn\'t do much for the atmosphere.'

Did not receive an apology nor offered to correct the mistake after it was mentioned to the waitress.  Waitress even gave the wrong change back afterwards.  Food and price was decent.  Place & patrons have a mellow, depressing mood... not recommended if you want to enjoy your meal.  Other village pubs were much better!'

S'New businesses typically up their standards for grand openings.  If that\'s the case, Big Daddy won\'t be around for long.  This was, by far, the worst pizza I\'ve had.  I was really hoping it would be at least as good as Little Caesers, as Big Daddy is more convieniently located.\n\nWe ordered a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza.  \n\nAPPEARANCE:  The pizza is quite small, as another reviewer stated. I believe it\'s equivalent to a Domino\'s medium pizza.  I also noticed the pizzas were much flatter than most others. It was hard to pull a slice out of the box.  It\'s common that we have to re-cut pizzas as they\'re usually cut in a hurry.  My pizza slicer would not cut thru this pizza.  It was like leather - my daughter has braces and was completely incapable of biting thru the crust.  She ate the stuff off the top. The pepperoni pizza had about 2.5 slices of pepperoni per slice - not enough for pepperoni in every bite.  Both pizzas were full of grease.\n\nTASTE:  The sauce was good.  The grease made me think back to high school pizza (I graduated in \'95).  I made a comment about high school pizza, and everyone else said "no, school pizza is better."  There was an adequate amount of cheese.\n\nOVERALL:  Save your $5 and get pizza ANYWHERE else, seriously.  Go to Albertsons and get a frozen one to cook yourself.  Drive up Nellis and go to Little Caesers.  As convenient as this place might be,  it\'s just not even worth $5.'

It seemed like it was a place "waiting for the night"...at least that\'s when I hear the action happens. The staff weren\'t friendly. It did not carry the warm and relaxing vibe I\'m accustomed to when I enter a coffee shop. Rather, they were playing a movie in the corner (that reminded me of a Lifetime movie) and pop music. It just didn\'t work.\n\nIf you are around in the afternoon, get your cup to go.'

S'I don\'t normally review chains but this one is tiny and local so I figured I give it a quick and dirty review anyway if only to spew off a few words about this Sandwich Shop.\n\nNot that there\'s a lack of sandwich shop in Montreal. There\'s a lack of seriously good ones and I think Sac Wich can somewhat fill that hole though it\'s not a Mom and Pop store and any shop that claims to be "The Best Sandwiches in Town" will undergo certain cynical scrutiny. But I don\'t believe Sac Wich tries to move in on the Mom and Pop stores\' turf but rather it\'s telling the bigger shops like Subway and Quisnoz that they can do better and here\'s the proof.\n\nSac Wich has a gimmick which if the chain grows I foresee they will give up which consists of picking a brown paper bag writing your name on it and picking your sandwich from the list off the bag. Cutsey at best but I don\'t care for it. I much rather communicate verbally with my hosts what it is I want. Apparently it\'s about getting the customer more involved in the process. Maybe I\'m just not motivated by this and am reminded of Kramer\'s build your own Pizza fiasco. Also if I\'m eating in, I don\'t see the need to trash an extra high quality paper bag in these days of environmental sustainability. But I won\'t let a paper bag get in my way of a good Sandwich.\n\nThe owner was on site and hand held me through the whole process and I was tempted to put him through the ringer when I spotted the Philly Steak sandwich. If you\'re the best sandwich in town and you have a Cheesesteak on your menu well this dude who lived in Philly is tempted to put you on the spot about your cheesesteak. But it\'s not served wit whiz so obviously not a real Philly cheesesteak so I opted for the Prime Rib to avoid probable disaster instead.\n\nSo Sliced Primed Rib (yeah yeah), Gouda, Roasted Red Peppers, Roasted Onions, Tomatoes, Basil, and Aioli sauce all on some dense chewy Chiabatta bread. All fresh and not cheaply portioned. Sounds good huh? Well you would be right. They set up your sandwich and then stick the sucker in a brick oven to heat it up real good. No not a microwave oven, a brick oven. So what you get is one hot crispy tasty sandwich with a side.\n\nA side of what? Well like the big chains you have your chips but they also have cold vegetable and pasta salads and to differ they have criss-cross-cut French fries which I took. I love those. Sadly they were soggy or soft. I expect them to be crispy with this cut but they were still ok and served with a zesty mayo. You also have a choice of pop but also a good selection of beers and wines bringing a more European feel to the shop than an American one. Something Montrealers can better identify with than soft pre-digested slop served at Subway\'s\n\nIn all the sandwich menu is somewhat predictable with some surprises but way above what your options are at Subway\'s and Quiznos and tastier. But it doesn\'t top the homemade taste of Italian sandwich shops where you eat sandwiches until you explode like the fat man in a Monty Python sketch because they are THAT good. But scanning your meager options when at the AMC theater for a movie, this is some good eats.\n\nDespite being a sandwich chain I can\'t help but give a slamming 4 outta 5.'

The man behind the counter (presumably Tony) was pleasant and seemed to value our custom.  What's more the the place was clean and the interior decoration gave it a welcoming atmosphere particularly after coming in from the cold outside.  \nThe menu consisted of the usual battered sausages, savaloys, haggis and, of course, fish and chips.  I had a battered sausage and chips whilst my flatmates had fish and chips.  Mine tasted pretty good and seemed to be up to the standards of any other chip shop.  My flatmates agreed claiming that the fish and chips were decent but nothing to write home about.\nTony's Fish Bar is an inviting chip shop with good service.  Although perhaps not worth going out of your way for, it's definitely worthy of your custom if you're feeling peckish on the long walk up Ratcliffe Terrace!"

My husband and I went  for lunch on a Saturday a couple of weeks ago, and the waitress was so bad, no forks, no water, no asking if we needed anything, order messed up. So disappointed. On the same day, there was another customer giving the owner a piece of her mind as well. Unfortunately, I had to agree with all she was telling her. So I chalked it up,   as okay, maybe the waitress is just bad. So I decided to go for dinner with my daughter on a Monday night. First of all, we were the only ones there, and this other waitress was just as bad, if not worse. How can you not give your customers good service if we were the only ones there? I expected cartwheels! I do not know how they are staying in business, with that kind of service. Pretty sad, considering the food is really good. Needless to say, I left no tip!'

It's perfectly located within walking distance from the station, or staggering distance to the station, depending on which way you look at it.\n\nYou walk in, and it's bright and clean, yet still kind of snug enough to feel old school. Walk up to the bar and you're hit with a flood of options on tap. There's well over 10 lagers and beers on draft, and as far as I could see as I observed (for research purposes, obviously) you get the correct branded glass for whatever drink you order, which makes me geek out a little.\n\nI ordered a pint of Deuchars, which is my personal favourite tipple, and it was cold, fresh and went down a treat having just came off a train. Yes, with the trains being close by, you can top up yourself if you're in danger of dehydrating and/or sobering up...\n\nBecause of it's location, I sometimes overlook Ryrie's on my travels, which is a shame, I really should make more visits here... and so should you!"

S'I\'ve only had them deliver sandwiches to us for meetings, so I can\'t comment on the interior or ambiance of this location.  However, if you\'re an office type that has to provide meals for working sessions over lunch, give Potbelly a try.\n\nWhy?\n\nTheir online ordering system is superb.  It\'s absolutely intuitive, fast, and accurate.  I\'ve never had a single issue with their system.  What\'s that?  You say that "Joe from Accounting" is a picky eater?  No problemo, my friend - Potbelly\'s system will not fail you.  You select the base sandwich, and then customize it to your heart\'s content.  It\'s foolproof.  And they\'ll even write Joe\'s name on his specific sandwich, so there\'s no confusion.\n\nAnd perhaps the best part is the highly precise delivery time window - Potbelly has never once been late (or too early) with an order.  If I select the "11:45am - 12:00pm" window, I\'d bet my paycheck they\'ll be there at around 11:50am.  Without fail.  Oh, and the drivers are super friendly and helpful as well.\n\nI\'m a fan of their farmhouse salad (no bacon, no cheese, add extra chicken), although the chicken is a bit "meh" at times.  When I\'m feeling indulgent (which is often, these days), you cannot go wrong with one of the hot sandwiches.  The "wreck" is legendary.\n\nHave a larger group to feed?  Get a party pack.  It\'s painless, and it\'ll be devoured, guaranteed.  The larger orders include all of the extras like condiments, plates, silverware, and so on.\n\nGiven the choice between Paneras, Milios, Capriotti\'s, or Cosi, I\'ll take Potbelly every time.\n\nPotbelly = WIN\n\nFood = 3.75 stars\nService = 4 stars\nValue = 3 stars\nMISC = 5 stars (great online ordering system; highly configurable, easy, and accurate!)\n\nOh, and pssst - need a cookie fix?  Here - try one of the Potbelly cookies.  What\'s that?  You\'re week in the knees?  Good.  First bite is free, then you\'ll have to buy the rest.  \n\nSeriously - their cookies are TO DIE FOR.  My insulin spiked just thinking about them.  nomnomnomnom'

The lobby needed sweeping and no one showed any interest in correcting the problems. The staff wasn't concern about meeting my request for no ice. Guess she thought disregarding me gave her power."

S"Baklava Cheesecake.\n\nThat's all I have to say.\n\nOkay, no there's more.  Graham cracker crust with a thin layer of filo, then thick NY style cheesecake...cinnamon, crushed pistachio nuts, shredded filo on top, sitting on top of a light drizzle of honey with more crushed pistachio decorating the plate.\n\nSo good that the meal before it seems like a dim memory...although the gyros are pretty darn tasty too.  Succulent pieces of lamb, thick fluffy pita.  You have to ask for feta on the side otherwise it doesn't come with any.\n\nAlso tried the avgolemono soup...creamy chicken rice lemon soup.  Unfortunately, this one was the deal breaker.  The chicken was old and multi-colored and the soup was a little too sour.  I've had it before and really like it normally.  I just don't like it making my mouth turn inside out.\n\nAnother sour note was what seemed like the manager yelling in the open kitchen asking his staff if he could meet their girlfriends and how old they were.  Ooooo-kay.  I didn't realize I was in My Big Fat Greek Real World.\n\nThe good news was the soup was first, and the cheesecake was last, so I left an extremely happy Margaret.  The waiter was really nice about the soup, and very attentive.  Good enough to make me want to go back sometime."

S'not authentic, period.  Waaaaay over priced for its ingredients and portion. Never trust those local quebec newspapers because they don\'t know much about asian food anyway and they haven\'t traveled or experienced much outside of quebec. Another word, they don\'t know what they are talking about. \n\nOrdered the spicy octopus with cucumber. It came out like Chinese Szechuan side dish with lots of sesame oil in it. Cucumber was not even marinated. Any Chinese person could\'ve made a much better version than that. $6 for tiny 5 pieces of octopus and 1/4 of a cucumber? Kidding me. \n\nGyoza was recommended by the waiter. Seriously?!  If you buy frozen leek dumplings from Korean supermarket for your restaurant, at least don\'t advertise it as "recommendation item". Japanese don\'t eat leek. Koreans do. $6 for 5 frozen dumplings for what I can buy the entire bag of them. You don\'t make dumplings from scratch it\'s no big deal, but just don\'t pretend people will not recognize it. \n\nFinally, the ramen. I had the lobster miso broth. Lobster seafood flavoured MSG was heavily added coz I felt EXTREMELY thirsty afterward. Ramen was just average, not memorable.  Lack of ingredients of traditional ramen. Other local Isakayas had better ramen, not to mention those NYC places or in Japan. \n\nFYI, my check was $73 for two ramens, that fantastic cucumber and gyoza and a 350ml drink. Could\'ve had two courses much more promising French instead. \n\nWhat a replica!\n\nP.S.When diners review a restaurant, isn\'t food the most important? Yes you like the decor and the service, but you don\'t just pay to sit there and admiring the space unless you\'re in a museum.'

S'Seems like a very strange name for a restaurant.  It\'s basically American cuisine (salads, burgers, fries) with a Mexican/SW "kick".   The decor is casual, the dress code is casual, there are multiple flat panel TVs for the sports fans. \n\nI had the sliders.  They had at least 4 types of sliders (mini-cheeseburgers).  $6.50-ish for 3 mini-cheeseburgers and NO fries.   They were good, but not the best I\'ve ever had (read my review of PJ Clarke\'s).  Seems a bit expensive.  I had a side salad.  It was good, but they didn\'t have french or honey mustard dressing.  \n\nOne bad thing:  The chips and guac - they\'ll give you a whole bag of chips and a teeny-tiny bowl of guacamole.   \nOne good thing: They have drink specials EVERY day from 4 - 7 p.m.\nThe margaritas were only $4.00.'

S"We happened to be in carland at supper time and elected to grab a quick supper out rather than coming home to an empty fridge. \n\nThe good:  Service was fast and friendly. The people are definitely the high point of this chain resto. \n\nThe mediocre: If you come here, be safe and stick with the rotisserie chicken with fries and salad bar. (For any other choice, the salad bar is $3.75 extra.) Fries were good and chicken was acceptable but not great. The salad bar was clean. Unexciting options even compared to supermarket bagged salad, but fine.\n\nThe ugly: The hot chicken sandwich was disgusting. The gravy (obviously from a mix) was chemically-tasting and the bread was, well, mushy sawdust is the closest analogy. \n\nWe should have gone to St-Hubert across the street, or even Wendy's on the next block."

I had a good experience; the server was nice, the food was good, and the atmosphere is cool there.\nI had the fish & chips; my yardstick for any seafood place.  The fish was odd-looking, as the pieces were like large nuggets, but it was tender, flaky, and hot.  They have good fries, too.\nI wanted a beer, and my server mentioned the drink specials, which included Beck's Oktoberfest for $1 / bottle.  WOW!\nI'm a huge Oktoberfest beer fan; I didn't even know Beck's made one!  These were obviously left over from last October, but who cares?  For a buck, I would have sat there and drank 12 of them, if I didn't have something to do later (and had to drive).\nWhat a great find!\n\nIf I'm ever in that area again, I'll stop by there for food.

S'I have been here 4 times now and it gets better all the time! I have sofar only had the Hot Pot (Spicy) and this I can fullheartingly recommend to anyone. It works with any meat, fish or vegetable. They have nice round tables that can sit up to 10 people. You are encouraged to share. The dishes are coming in think and fast. There is a condiment table where you fill your bowl with chili, onion, soya, sambal, sate sauce etc... The Hot Pot is served in the middle of the table (individual or couple pots are available) the more you boil the more flavours develop! \nThey have cutlery available but I would encourage you to use the chop sticks, feels more authentic that way. - all your usual chinese beers are availabe and also local brews. Wine and sake for the people who are more partial to this. However with a hot pot you should drink some jasmine tea. It cleanses and tastes delicious. \nRegulars can get a 10% discount on anything (food) they order, so it pays to visit often.'

S"For our first dinner in Montreal, a friend selected Carte Blanche based on some excellent reviews on other sites.  It's a quiet. beautifully designed contemporary restaurant, a bit out of the way, but well worth a short walk.  Either of the two price fixe options, at $25 and $35 are great deal, and since we were a group of eight, we sampled just about all the items on both of them. There is a small, but well-selected wine list.\n\nWe were pleased with the inventive cuisine, although more detail on the menu may have led us  to make other choices.   For example, the vegetable soup was pureed and served cold, not at all what we were expecting on a dreary, rainy night.  I also enjoyed my veal ravioli topped with foie gras but if I had known that they were served in a broth, I might not have ordered both  soups.   Overall, though, we were pleased with Carte Blanche, and would be happy to come back again."

S"Key: Notice the dates on the reviews. This place was great but mismanaged into not so great. First thing to understand is that this is a fantastic location. The result is that they don't have to do it right to keep people coming in.\n\nI went inside the restaurant to eat last Saturday at 5:45 pm. Immediately noticed the place was a dump. Trash everywhere. Even a seat cushion was ripped. (When was the last time you viewed a ripped seat cushion in a McDonald's?) I used the restroom - same thing - one hand dryer was busted. Gross. \n\nBut I thought, maybe they cater to the drive through and neglect the store? So I went ahead and ordered my food anyways (plus I had a coupon). Both my Big Mac and the 1/4 pounder came with stale buns. How is this possible at 5:45 pm on a Saturday night?\n\nIt's all the fault of the management - the sad part is that it used to be fine but now it's not. Also there is a Chick-a-filet a mile up the road that is awesome. Maybe that is where the management goes to eat?"

S'I had the teriyaki Bowl. They gave a decent amount of chicken. And rice. I was disappointed with the vegetables though. I only had once piece of broccoli and no egg roll. When compared for the same price as other places you get veggies and atleast one eggroll if not two and a drink. The Soda was a Dollar extra. And the Teriyaki sauce wasnt really sweet.

S'Historically, of course, the region of Dalriada was situated on the west coast of Scotland. However, it seems to have landed very comfortably after its migration across the country; now situated entirely within a magnificent turreted seafront house on the eastern coast at Portobello, it could have done a lot worse. With what estate-agents might term a "well-proportioned" garden and a series of bright and cosy adjoining rooms leading from the front door to the bar, it feels as much like a friend\'s home as it does a beach pub.\n\nWe arrived on a Sunday to find, to my sheer delight, a session in progress. It seems that live music is a regular feature in the Dalriada week, as if its sweeping views of the ocean weren\'t sufficient entertainment. A session always, always means extra points from me. I wished I\'d brought my mandolin so I could join in, but instead took advantage of the glorious weather to sit on the grass outside and admire the view.\n\nAs a seaside establishment ought, it caters for pretty much everyone. The bar is well-stocked with a range of beverages and (hoorah) cakes, and they even keep water bowls behind the bar for the many dogs that romp along the sand every day. There was a great family atmosphere when I went, too - little children were out in the garden having a whale of a time.\n\nSomething that I, a naturally queue-conscious Brit, particularly enjoyed was the bar experience. The bar room itself is a little on the small side and so, rather than the usual game of squashing around the bar and hoping the serving staff have a supernatural ability to remember the order everyone arrived in, there was a nice little linear queue that wimbled out into the next room. That queue scooted along at a good pace, too; that\'s impressive given the business they were getting on such an unexpectedly gorgeous day.\n\nIt doesn\'t all hinge on the weather, though. It seems such a lovely place that I\'m almost looking forward to the winter - I do love a bitterly cold walk along the beach and I can\'t think of a nicer way to round it off than with a spot of music and a hot chocolate while gazing out of the window.\n\nDalriada, please don\'t go back to the West. Stay here forever so that I can make you part of my every trip to Portobello Beach.'

There were only 4 other tables seated, so you would expect GREAT service.  Unfortunately, that was not the case AT ALL. Had to ask the waitress for more salsa 3 different times, she kept forgetting. Had to ask for more chips. Asked for refills on our drinks twice, didn't get the refills until we were done with our meals. With barely any other patrons, you'd think we wouldn't have to ask for ANYTHING at all...but to have to ask repeatedly? Not good.  Mind you, she wasnt busy, she was sitting down with another staff member (the manager I think) in a booth throughout our meal. As for the food, it was great. Chips were great.The iced tea tasted like it was a day or two old, very bitter, but was forced to drink it because the salsa was hot and like I said, she kept forgetting to get our refills (and my new drink). I have to say the courtyard looks great, I love what they did with it. I will give the place anohter shot becuase the food was good and I know that sometimes people only work as hard as they have to. So when its slow, waitresses seem to slack off. BUT I am hoping the owners read this so they can train their staff better. EVERY CUSTOMER COUNTS, not just when you're busy. BTW I am a GREAT tipper....this girl could have made a nice penny from my table alone had she cared enough to pay attention."

S'I have actually been here once, but I couldn\'t write a review because this place wasn\'t discovered yet! (but I created it and decided to write my review in the restaurant, hurrah!) But let me say, this place is awesome on Tuesdays because of their deal. It used to be $1.00 beer and slices...\n\nHowever it went up in price... 50 cents. So, $1.50 for each a huge slice of pizza (pepperoni or cheese only) and $1.50 domestics. That\'s still an awesome deal. Their pizza slices will definitely fill you up, 3 got me full and happy. On top of that, the pizza has flavor, as the owner is a New Yorker so he knows how to do it right.\n\nWhen you walk into this place it\'s a semi bar, so yes every drink you can think of can be made! This place is sort of a family/after workday hang out with the gang at work or watch a game. They have 6 tv\'s across the restaurant hanging parallel to each other, so choose where you want to turn your head. \n\nYou\'ll see some locals here and some that are from across town (me). But overall, the service was simplistic and not bad.\n***But I do have to say that they keep this place cold, and they don\'t care if their customers are cold. When we said that it was cold and my mother was wearing her jacket, one of the managers said "well, put your hood up!" Well, that\'s something what I wouldn\'t say to a customer... She could have just turned off the air considering it was 40 degrees outside. Note, every customer had their jacket on!\n\nThis place is okay, my rating was 4 stars but because of that person\'s comment towards my mom I have to dock it.

They prepare themselves and they open their large glass windows to a flood of hungry, loud, and drunk pedestrians. It definitely gets crowded after a night of debauchery and for good reason. :)\n\nI appreciated my $2 noodles and egg rolls....while being sober as well as drunk. Thank you, Montreal."

S"If you accept what you're getting - and considering the tradeshow atmosphere - this place is decent. Extra star for being a decent place to eat. \n\nThe following cuisine types were noted\n\nAmerican Grilled Meats\nAmerican Chinese\nAmerican Italian\nRabbit food\n\nI'm a fan of the rabbit food, even though it can be a 15-30 minute wait during peak lunch hour to start building my bowl of bagged mixed greens, artichokes, canned olives, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, and croutons and garbanzo beans, it's a faster line than the other food stations. \n\nCashier stations are efficient as possible (considering the chaos) - it most of the cashiers are retirees making an extra income. But I normally wait in a cashier line for about 3-7 minutes - pretty typical wait time for here. \n\nThere are typical tradeshow prices - which is about 30-40% higher than what you can find in say a regular grocery store, or a strip mall, but that is life in Vegas.\n\nNormally, the mess hall is filled with every single seat taken when I stop for lunch. What I usually do during lunch is take my food outside and take one of the benches along the perimeter of the building and enjoy the sun. If there's no benches, there's always the grass to sit on. :-)\n\nTip: Please - don't be a prick in while in line. It's a tradeshow - everyone is wired and stressed. People need to lighten up and take it in stride."

S"Was there awhile back. Food was just average. However the reason for my 1star review-   On my way out i ordered a piece of chocolate cream pie to take out.   When I got home I opened the box and inside was a dried up piece of pie.   Literally.  I put my fork into the whipped cream and the entire whipped cream came off in one piece.  Underneath the chocolate was dried and cracked.  It was the consistency  of something that sat for 2 weeks in an arid place.   Im not making this up.  The pie had to have been a couple of weeks old.  What bothered me though was that waitress HAD to have known the pie was old.  The staff HAD to have passed it several times over the weeks.  I was floored.  I threw it out cause it was too late to drive back there.  Da did they think I wouldn't notice!  Will never go back there because that wasn't just a mistake.   They didn't want to loose money so they sold me it to instead. And they are famous for their pies.   What a laugh"

The waiter brought out to us a crab shell stuffed with crab meat and it tasted nothing like either of their places back in the City. I was floored! There's nothing like craking your own crab.

The sandwich was huge and a great value ($5.99) considering how much veal and lamb there was. The Pita was soft on the inside, but had a crispy outside which was a nice touch. The veal and lamb were tender and had some delicious spices going on. It's a brand new restaurant and the inside of it looked like it was pretty good for a sit-down meal. Overall, my sandwich was really tasty and inexpensive, and the atmosphere was welcoming.The staff was really friendly, too. I highly recommend Fez Grill!"

S'Decided to order a pizza and saw a pizza hut commercial so thought yea I\'ll give it a try since I had not had pizza hut in ages!!!!! Called in to place my order and the women who answered the phone "Gullian" or something like that, was the rudest and probably had the worst customer service that I have ever experienced! When I asked what my crust options were again she paused took a deep breath as if she was irritated with me asking for the options of the pizza I am going to pay for. She got loud and rude so I  let it slip but by the second time when I asked how many topings she raised her voice and began to yell out the answer.  That is just uncalled for and disrespectful to customers. When I called back to ask for the manager she claimed to be the manager. If this place is ran by people like this, I want no part of it! Took my money to papa johns and enjoyed their friendly upbeat service.  Thanks pizza hut for that awful experience I will probably never be trying pizza hut ever again.'

The food is decent but overpriced (IMHO), and the service is slow, which is okay if you're just killing time before a Suns game, but not so much when you're on a work lunch break.  \n\nI first got a turkey & cheese sandwich.  Well, I should say I paid for turkey and cheese, but they forgot the cheese (which they charge extra for).  The sandwich was literally bread and turkey, period.  The turkey itself was good, but overall the sandwich was incredibly plain (and $9 bucks for the half sandwich after tax).  And the wait was about 10 minutes.\n\nThe next time I went to check out their breakfast.  I was the only person in the restaurant, so you'd think it would be quick.  Nope.  It must have taken 3-4 minutes before the cook even came out.  Then another 8-10 minutes to cook two eggs, a slice of ham, and hash browns, and another couple of minutes to get someone else to wrap it all up and hand it to me.  \n\nThe last time I got a bowl of chili and a hot dog.  Over $9 bucks, and another ridiculously long wait, made more aggravating by the fact that there were 2-3 employees just standing around.   When I got back to my office and opened up the bag, realized they didn't give me (or offer to give me) ketchup, mustard, or anything else for the hot dog.  \n\nIt's too bad.  I really wanted to like this place.  I predict it won't last very long, but hopefully I'm wrong."

S"The perfect example of don't judge a book by its cover! My SO and I decided to give this place a go because of its great reviews. We were the only customers at the time, because we had lunch at 4pm. Otherwise, the owner (I presume) just had some regulars or friends sitting at the bar, talking to him. They were really kind people too.\n\nAs we sat there, I admit we had our doubts. The restaurant itself has seen better days. It was in the heart of Kitchener and people stared at us through the window, then at the restaurant sign. We didn't know what to expect and I feel a bit guilty, because now I do genuinely like this place.\n\nHe could tell instantly it was our first time trying anything of this sort and tried to walk us through it a little. We were definitely surprised at the size our platter was. We ordered the beef and lamb tibs (which was delicious). It came with so much injera - the absorbent sourdough flat bread. No cutlery, you just pick the meat up with the bread. The meat was so good. You could tell they were lean cuts of meat, but they weren't tough. It was cooked well and the sauce kept it from going dry. Now, we don't like the taste of sourdough bread, so that was just our own fault for not doing research. But by what we saw, everything was really authentic and well-made. It came with a simple side salad of shredded romaine. I don't know what was in that oil-based dressing, but it was really good and I ate all of it.\n\nSince it was just him working, it was sometimes hard tracking him down because he would be cleaning something behind the bar or in the back. But when he had his back turned, a friend would always see us and tell him we needed something. I thought that was really nice of them.\n\nWe ended up having to take the rest home. The owner helped us pack it up and the box was so heavy! He told us he really appreciated us coming."

S'Hola, Bienvenido a McDonald\'s.\n\nThis is the absolute WORST McDonald\'s that I have EVER been to in my LIFE!   First off, the health grade never seems to be better than a 94 (http://mecklenburg.digitalhealthdepartment.com/facilities.cfm?facilityID=316649.)  Don\'t even bother ordering anything that will differ from the way the employees are trained to make it - forget about extra pickles, hold the onions, no ketchup, add mustard - it WILL NOT HAPPEN AT THIS MCDONALD\'S!!!  One day, a man ahead of me at the counter simply wanted a PLAIN cheeseburger - JUST CHEESE AND MEAT!  He sent it back 2 times because they kept making it wrong.  Really?  Bread, cheese, meat - that\'s it.  How hard can it be??  When my simple little ole iced coffee came out wrong (after they had overcharged for it!) that same man smiled at me and said "Good luck with THAT!"  \nAs for the drive-thru?  I\'ve had to jump out of it too many times to count because after I had placed my order at the speaker, we never seemed to move along.  If the car at the pick-up window is waiting on something that is taking an extra long time, YOU will have to wait also.  They don\'t have that car pull out of line for an employee to bring them their item(s) when ready.  OH NO!!!   EVERYBODY in line has to wait!!    \nDon\'t bother calling any 800 # about this McDonald\'s - it\'s useless.  One would think that the owner of this location would be more proactive in making it a better McDonald\'s, but after more than 6 years of the same kind of service (or lack thereof!)  I guess not.  The only reason I ever went to this location was because it is close to my work, and options are pretty limited.  But now?  I can\'t even go back because it\'s such a waste of time & money.'

S"One of the better local pizza places; however, if they were more consistent they could be a 4 star, for West Mifflin, restaurant. We normally order wings and maybe salads from this place. Monday is indeed their wing night, and some times on wacky Wednesday, and they are 58 cents a wing with a minimum of 1 dozen. At that price, it is certainly not the best deal on wings in town, but it is decent and normally works when we don't feel like driving somewhere further. They have plenty of wing flavors to choose from (check out the pictures of the menu), but picking a favorite and sticking with it is difficult because they aren't consistently made. Sometimes the wings are great, but other times they are overcooked, small and/or lacking sauce (or as in yesterday you might get the wrong sauce all together).  We try to ask for a little extra sauce on the side to overcome at least one of these issues. Yesterday was not one of the better days for wings from them, but I will order take out from them in the future (probably at least once a month). I have had other things from their menu that I would recommend like their buffalo chicken hoagie, reuben roll, and their buffalo chicken salad."

I\'m fairly fluent after 5 years of studying, so I thought we\'d be ok. Then we drive into the parking lot and figure we\'d have to go to the back to get our car wash. New-car scent please. Seriously though, I think this place was an old carwash place or something. The bathrooms are on the side of the building, not connected at all to the dining area.\n\nMy significant other and I visited this place upon the recommendation of my friend. I feel like recently he\'s been sending us on a wild goose chase. First he sent us to Grimaldi\'s which didn\'t live up to the hype, but I think he finally got something right.\n\nWe ordered the california burrito per Steven G\'s recommendation, and while it was an interested interpretation of an old burrito, it fell short in one or two areas. There definitely was not enough meat in the burrito, sadly, because if there was this place would be a 5 star. I felt full afterwards, but I\'m usually even fuller after Filiberto\'s due to their generous portions of meat. However, the burrito is still worth a shot. I thought to myself while eating it, "Wow, humans really got it right with meat and potatoes. You can serve it up so many ways, and it never fails." Think about it for a second, steak and mashed potatoes, hamburger and fries, california burrito, and there are probably dozens more I left out.\n\nWhile this place has all the salsas you\'d expect to find at your local Fili-B, it also had a mysterious green salsa that wasn\'t clear. I\'m guessing this was the coveted "jalapeno salsa". It had a creamy smooth texture and taste, but also had a hint of fire. Filibertos has nothing like this, and it was simply amazing. Couple their impressive salsa line up with some chips, which come with your burrito, and you have a winning combination. One thing I feel worth mentioning though is that the salsa is a bit more watery than what you are used to at Fili-B.\n\nIts unfortunate that there is no Fili-B near ASU. However, this place fills the gap just perfectly, and its actually an interesting place to try out. They are also open 24/7.'

Uhm, no just would like 2 get something close 2 what I ordered & paid 4. And speaking of water... red & green sauce cups r 1/2 filled & mostly water w/ color & little flavoring & they just love throwing them in ur bag on top of whatever u order so it gets all over the place & satur8es napkins (if they even include them) cuz they don\'t secure the cheap lids, even when u ask 4 them in a seper8 bag. Yeah, they understood me (I\'ve asked both in English & in Spanish). Yes a \'gringa\' can talk Spanish fluently... ;-p\n\n   And I really don\'t get why a "drive~thru" can take SOooo Long when u discover there\'s nowhere near the food in ur bag that Filiberto\'s used 2 b famous 4. As I\'ve said b4, if any place inevitably increases their prices as often will b the case, @ least let it b equivalent 2 what it was b4. Also when a Veg~head orders the very limited items we have 2 choose from & almost every time finds some meat that somehow managed 2 b in their pl8 or burrito, that\'s a Huge EWWW!!

They brought the table two orders of pig tail tacos on the house and later gave all 12 of us a round of free shots. \n\nI had the mackerel which was suuuper tasty and my boyfriend had the marrow plate which was surprisingly inexpensive and good.The drinks were delicious and they were nice enough to make a non-alcoholic version of my favourite one (the Bangarang - so refreshing!) for a friend who doesn't drink booze. \n\nWe'll definitely be back!

S'To say the pizza was not so great would be a compliment. I didn\'t go in to the business with high expectations to begin with since I realize that they cater to kids. I was looking for a quick and hopefully inexpensive pizza with the understanding that this wasn\'t a gourmet food chain. In my opinion though, the price should be a reflection of the quality, care and time that went into a product or menu item and this was not the case here. The pizza was horrible and for the same price or a couple bucks more get a gourmet pizza at a real Italian restaurant (or get 2 to 3 frozen pizzas that would be better tasting). Service wasn\'t any better than the food. I ordered two side salads with my pizza and was told they were out of them at the moment but they would come out with the pizza, I said OK. It seemed to be taking a long time for the pizza so I went to the pick up counter and asked "is there was any chance I could get my salads before the pizza?". The person behind the counter says "I can upgrade that to a garden salad which is twice the size, is that OK?", I said sure. He leaves and comes back with ONE garden salad. I said "I ordered two salads", he replies that "one garden salad is the same as two side salads you just split it". Oh, how nice of this person to assume the other person I\'m eating with is comfortable enough to share out of the same bowl! Not cool! On another occasion I went to the the same counter to ask a question and the manager saw I was there and ignored me. I took about 40 minutes for them to get our pizza out and they were not that busy. I also witnessed many people go to the pick up counter to complain about their orders being wrong or taking taking to long in the time I was there. All in all bad food and bad service. This was my first and last visit.\nDate of visit 5/22/11'

S"The Skinny: hot dogs, served cold, in a soggy  bun while the Italian sausage was undercooked (1) Service: slow - waited 30+ minutes for 2 orders, the bathroom is located in the adjacent smoky vlt bar area... not family friendly, and the waitress upcharged us for stuff without informing us (1), value: stay away unless you love being overcharged for underwhelming food (1) \n\nI feel in love with the Chicago hot dog after heading to the Windy City. So we've been looking for a wonderful hot dog just like the ones on that trip several years ago.\n\nHearing about a place that is complete with the classic Vienna sausage, we were excited about coming here. We used a Living Social deal which, at the time, appeared to be icing on the cake.\n\nKnowing that my hubby was planning on ordering a dipped beef sammy, I advised him to eat in because I didn't want the bun to be overly soggy. Little did I know what a bad decision that was.\n\nService was painfully slow. We waited 30+minutes for them to prepare 1 hot dog, 1 sausage/beef sandwich and a side of fries. And the sausage was pink in the middle. Oh yes! the time that it took to get our order obviously had nothing to do with actual cooking time in the kitchen. Did I also mention that a fellow who had a takeout order after us received his food much sooner than ours did?\n\nOkay, back to the food. I really couldn't tell if they were real Vienna sausages or not because the wiener was stone cold.  Real Vienna sausages exude their inner juices with the crisp snap of the casing.  Not so here. Throw it a soggy bun complete with finger imprints on it (gross!), you have yourself one of the worst hot dogs I've seen in a long time.\n\nThe sausage and beef sandwich was a bit better because we accepted that it was going to be messy and soggy in the first place. However, like I mentioned before, the sausage was definitely not cooked thoroughly. It was also very skimpy on the underseasoned beef. The addition of giardiniera, cheese and sweet peppers did make the whole thing more palatable.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the items that made the sandwich more edible were an undisclosed upcharge of $1.50.  Yes. the mere sprinkling of the scant amount of toppings were $0.50 each. We were not informed of this upcharge at the time of ordering and it does not appear on the front part of the menu (only briefly mentioned on the backside).\n\nThe bags of french fries were okay, but let's face it, it wasn't anything that were super special by any means. I would certainly not have ordered these if there was an upcharge.\n\nFinally, the ambience. Definitely not a place you want to take the kids because in order for you to use their rather dubious restroom, you're required open a firmly closed door and walk through an extremely smoky bar/vlt area.\n\nOverall, given the dismal service and the poor food, I would give this a 1 star review."

S'I have gone here a few times since moving to Buckeye and have been unimpressed each time.  This last time was the last time I will go here.  About 2 weeks ago my wife and I went inside to place an order for our entire family.   What a disaster.  The menu board and the signage in the lobby were showing different prices for frosty\'s and when we pointed that out the cashier, who I believe was the manager, said "Yeah we need to get new numbers for out there"  This was a .30 cent difference on 4 frosty\'s.  The staff was extremely slow in their attitude and urgency to take care of the customers.  Finally all of our food was made and we took our bags and drove home.  Every single sandwich was made wrong.  5 Cheeseburgers with no cheese or ketchup on them.  I double cheese made the same way.  2 fish sandwiches plain just fish and bun.....these were made with everything on them.  When I called to let them know....whomever answered the phone told me to call corporate and hung up.  Really?   It has been 2 weeks and corporate is blowing off all of my calls and has not responded to a single e-mail.  Wendy\'s as a corporation has officially lost my business as well.   \n\nI have eaten at Wendy\'s locations that were decent.  This one is a major beware.  Heed the rest of the reviews and stay away.  Trust us.'

S'The sad response I received from the owner of Jimmy\'s was right in line with their bad business practices.  Jennifer K. claimed I wrote a bogus review and that I had never been in her so called "restaurant". \nThis is  her comment and what she messaged me:\n\n"I apologize to our real customers as this seems to be a BOGUS review.   As all of our customers know, we removed a display case from our restaurant months ago.  It was an idea that an ex-employee had and it was a terrible one so we got rid of the display case.   We invite this reviewer to actually walk through the doors of our pizzeria and try our food." -Jennifer K.\n\n"As I appreciate your feedback, you obviously have not been in our pizza shop for quite some time.   And therefore, I have been  forced to report you to yelp as a violation of their terms of service." -Jennifer K.\n\nI\'m baffled for a couple reasons.\n\n  First, I was obviously there because I have a photo of the display cases with the old pizza wrapped up in PLASTIC WRAP! I\'ve been to hundreds of pizza places and never once had they wrapped up a nearly empty tray of "fresh slices" in a display case 10 minutes after opening!! I just joined Yelp as you can see by my profile date and I felt so strongly about my bad experience there that I wanted to let people know what they might expect.  I had the photo still in my iphone and decided to share.\n \nSecond, I\'m not sure what violation I committed as to Yelp\'s terms of service.  I\'m allowed to write a truthful review whether the owner likes it or not.  Yes, it was a couple months ago because I haven\'t been back.  As I have read there is no violation.\n\nThird, what kind of business discounts the reviews of customers  and attacks the reviewer instead of looking at their business practices and say "maybe you had a bad experience or caught us on an off day".  I have been in the restaurant/bar business 25 years and i know enough that every customer counts.  At least pretend to care Jennifer... \n\n In my first review I posted the photo I took of the day old pizza they brought out of the refrigerator and placed in their display case to sell that day!!  Granted, this was a couple months ago, and Jennifer K. said they had since removed the display cases because they were a "bad idea".  The bad idea was not the display cases, but the business practice they have of serving old pizza and garlic knots from the day before instead of just making a fresh product that any self respecting pizza shop would do and any customer would expect.  Just because you removed the cases, doesn\'t mean you are not still selling yesterday\'s pizza.\n\nI ordered a pizza to go that day and was not impressed by the quality.  The sauce tasted sour like it had fermented in the refrigerator after being put away warm.  It\'s the little things that a place gets lazy on that affects their whole business.  You may label your pizza shop as NY style, but growing up in North Jersey, I know it is not even close. \n\nJennifer, a piece of advice... When a customer complains it\'s because they really want to do business with you and want you to meet their most modest expectations.  The customers you have to worry about are the ones who never complain and just never return.  In this economic climate, maybe you want to focus a little more on your customer service skills and stop trying to make a couple bucks on old pizza and realize the repeat business will keep you afloat when places are closing down all around you.\n\nThat being said, I will go back and order a couple slices and try to give an honest appraisal of their pizza even after Jennifer K. jumped to conclusions about the validity of my first review.  I currently do not own or work for any restaurant or pizza shop so we\'re clear that there is no conflict of interest.\n\nBTW...Nice fake review by Carrie S.  She just joined, one review and it\'s glowing and includes suggestive selling...nice touch.  Great try, but no one is fooled.  Seems like business as usual at Jimmy\'s huh?  Sad...'

S'This place was absolutely the worst buffet I\'ve ever been to.\n\nHonestly, I\'m not even a picky eater. Even though I am Chinese, I would not say I\'m a Chinese food snob. I firmly believe that amazing Chinese food and dim sum can be found outside of San Francisco and yes, even in buffets. I love myself a good Chinese buffet and have been to much better ones.\n\nBUT, this place is just bad\n\nAs a disclaimer, I do not eat seafood, so it was partly my fault for coming here. I can\'t comment on those dishes, but I can\'t imagine them being very good based on the other dishes\n\nI started with noodle bowl station. This is really what convinced me to stay here since I love noodles. Well, the wonton were tiny and bland, while it seemed like they put three noodles in the bowl with a huge amount of broth. The beef stew noodle was also lacking in the amount of noodles and the noodles were still clumped up. The beef was so tough, and there were 7 or 8 pieces of anise in the bowl. Too much.\n\nThe mongolian grill was next as I figured, this will be better since I can choose my own stuff. NOPE. There was hardly any flavoring in the stirfry, the meats were awful quality, and no sauces really to flavor it all.\n\nThey have standard "Chinese" buffet fare like beef broccoli, spring rolls and orange chicken, in addition to some dim sum. The dim sum buns were hard and these dishes just tasted unappetizing. Blah. The spring roll was especially offensive. The only thing that I enjoyed were the fried wings, which I stuck to after discovering everything else was not good.  \n\nSave yourself the trouble and find another buffet if you\'re hungry.'

S"Italian Eatery? What? I thought this was just a pizza place. Oh  yeah, they do offer baked ziti and salads and lasagna, so I guess it is an eatery. \n\nI like Sbarros for two reasons. When I lived in Dallas, this was my place to stop by at the mall and watch all the ice skaters on the ice rink, fall, break their bones, noses etc. It reminds me of the good ol times when I didn't have all the worries of the world and actually had time to have a good laugh. Sigh~. The second reason I like Sbarros is because of their Mushroom Pizza! Yum. The taste is completely different than any other mushroom pizza I have ever eaten but having said, it has a nice buttery aftertaste which is what I look forward to each time I bite into that thing and it never disappoints. The pizza slices itself are pretty large for me to handle so I always ask for them to slice'em in half. I know, such a girl!\n\nThe baked ziti is good too. You can order the baked ziti as a side or as an entree. \n\nOkay, so here comes the minus two stars part. The last time I went to this place, there were three servers working behind the counter. All I wanted was a slice of mushroom pizza and a little baked ziti for my little'un. Well, they wouldn't have any of it. I felt like I was seriously trying to be up sold for the entree, and then the salad, and then the large drink and then the combo. It kept going on and on from all three of the servers. I think one of them was the boss and they were seriously trying to reel me in. I really don't like that feeling and hey, all I wanted was a slice of pizza. I felt like i was at a car dealership for a second there. \n\nWill I go back here for another slice? Sure. If they try to up sell me again, probably not the next time."

S'Besuch:  06.12.2014\n\nEinleitung\n\nSpontan ergriff uns an diesem Abend die Lust auf griechisches Essen. Nachdem bei unserem naheliegenden Stamm-Restaurant kein Platz mehr frei war, entschieden wir uns aufgrund einer Empfehlung f\xc3\xbcr das "Panorama". Im Nachgang gesehen hat es das Schicksal gut mit uns gemeint, denn wir durften das bisher beste griechische Restaurant in Karlsruhe besuchen.\n\nService / Bedienung\n\nDie zahlreichen Bedienungen erledigen ihre Arbeit professionell und mit Humor. Wir haben uns gut aufgehoben gef\xc3\xbchlt und wurden prompt bedient, wie \xc3\xbcbrigens auch die restlichen G\xc3\xa4ste im gef\xc3\xbcllten Restaurant. Lediglich die Bezahlung lie\xc3\x9f ein wenig auf sich warten, was aber aufgrund des Essens und des Ambiente ausgeb\xc3\xbcgelt wurde.\n\nGetr\xc3\xa4nke und Essen\n\nDie Bestellung und Lieferung der Getr\xc3\xa4nke ging schnell von Statten. Das Radler war sehr gut gemischt und gek\xc3\xbchlt. Bei der Vorspeise entscheiden wir uns f\xc3\xbcr gegrillte Peperoni in Knoblauchsauce. Lecker! Beim Hauptgang entschieden wir uns f\xc3\xbcr zwei unterschiedliche und typische Grill-Teller mit verschiedenen Fleischsorten. Als Beilage gab es vorab einen sehr knackigen Salat mit leckerem Dressing. Die daraus resultierende Vorfreude auf die Hauptspeise wurde auch erf\xc3\xbcllt: Das Fleisch war schmackhaft gew\xc3\xbcrzt und auf den Punkt gegrillt. Die Pommes dazu waren sehr fettarm und lecker. \n\nAmbiente\n\nDie Lokation hat einen recht gro\xc3\x9fen Innenbereich und ist mehr f\xc3\xbcr Gruppen ausgelegt. Tische f\xc3\xbcr Paare sind eher rar. Die Inneneinrichtung ist eher einfach und schlicht, aber sehr gepflegt und passend. Bei anderen Griechen ist es oft ein wenig zu bunt und kitschig, das blieb uns hier erspart.\n\nSauberkeit\n\nZum Thema "Sauberkeit" gab es nicht zu beanstanden.\n\nFazit\n\nDas "Panorama" wird nun \xc3\xb6fter mit einem Besuch durch uns rechnen d\xc3\xbcrfen und wir k\xc3\xb6nnen das Restaurant anstandslos weiterempfehlen!'

S"KFC always offers a tasty meal with quick service no materr what time you fancy it.  The prolem, however, is that it's a complete rip off.  For example, their Zinger meals cost about \xc2\xa36 and all you got was a tiny burger, some greasy chicken things, some chips and a small drink.  You could argue that ypour paying for quaity, but this is definitely not the case.  I invariably feel like gash after one of their meals.  Further, my hands seem to feel greasy for hours after handling their chicken. \nNonetheless, it's still tasty food and their popcorn chicken is undeniably amazing.  Their Bargain Buckets aren't necessarily a bargain, but they're definitely tasty and filling.  \nIn comparison to other fast food restaurants, KFC might have the best chicken on offer but it comes at a price."

Drinks are cheap and the bar is long there are plenty of places to sit.  There is a pool table and video poker (All Fruit Bonus).  Very Sconnie however a little seedy for the faint of heart."

S'A nice sushi restaurant on Bernard in Mile-End. They have quite a few innovative choices, if you are looking for something more innovative and less authentic. The prices are a little high and the habit of cutting rolls in 5 make sharing a little more difficult. Good atmosphere, good heating, even near the windows. Service are smooth and well done. Parking in the neighbourhood is difficult.'

S"Having only been to this restaurant once before years and years ago I think it was well worth another visit.\n\nWith Khushis having opened up just down the road, they have revamped the interior, which I think definitely encouraged us to go and give it a try. I wasn't sure what to expect but I really was surprised and will most definitely be back.\n\nWe had the poppadoms as an appetiser  - which came with a really good selection of different sauces - not just the usual mango chutney.\n\nI had the mixed kebab starter which was really good - especially the spicy mini lamb chops. I wasn't so sure on the shish kebab but my dad loved it! The chicken tikka bites were delicious.\n\nI had a special chicken bhuna with steamed rice - which was a nice change to the usual basmati. The portions were good sizes and for once I didn't feel too full after the main which was ideal.\n\nTheir selection of Movenpick ice creams was great - try the mint choc chip one! They also had a selection of Indian desserts also.\n\nThe bar list was not extensive but just what you needed and pretty reasonable.\n\nIt was quiet, although it was a Monday night but a fair few folk came in around 10ish after the Playhouse opened it's doors. Shame some of the people sitting next to us were very ignorant, 'do you do prawns? My friend doesn't like rice!' oh dear.\n\nI would definitely recommend, just a shame the staff have to put up with some really awful people!"

S"My Mum and I popped in here for lunch the other day and both quite enjoyed it. The website bills it as a New York loft apartment. I'm not really sure where they get this idea from as to me it's just a modern bar but it is quite nice. \n\nThe menu consisted of three printed pieces of paper. What no money for a proper menu? Maybe that means they change the menu regularly. Anyway, the girl who served it was very friendly and took our order quickly. I ordered a flat bread with chorizo and spicy tomato sauce. It was really tasty, the sauce was the right level of spicy without being too overpowering. My mum had a brie ciabatta which came with a mountain of chips. Neither of us managed to plough through the huge quantity, but it was good. \n\nThe only downside was I can see this bar getting very noisy and cramped if there is sport on. There was a group of lads who were heading off to the rugby, and while they weren't being too loud the noise they did make filled up the place. Plus they turned off the music and put the Hearts vs. Hibs game on which lowered the tone of the bar. \n\nHudsons should stick to being a little bit classier and serving nice foods instead of being a sports bar."

S"This is my favorite Jimmy John's in Pittsburgh. I work nearby, so it's easy to stop here and grab a quick lunch. Though the lines are enormous at lunch time during the week, the lines do move quickly. There is ample space inside as there is a lower level as well.\n\nThe veggie club is my absolute favorite. I'm sad that they have done away with the alfalfa sprouts, but at least the avocado spread is delicious and adds more to the sandwich than just an assortment of raw veggies. I enjoy getting the wheat bread instead of the usual roll (which is also delicious). The wheat bread is dense and has a delicious crunch to it because it is so stuffed with grains.\n\nCome early during the week for lunch, or else after 1:30. This will ensure that you get a seat if you'd like to sit down rather than carry lunch back to the office."

S"I was warned.\n\nI got called out to come here by some friends on a Thursday night and the experience went as such:\n\nEnter to be carded by a young lady at the hostess stand. Which is completely okay, I'm in my late twenties I don't mind being carded.\n\nI make my way to my friends and am informed of karaoke and a lack of waitresses. No sweat I say, I'll hit the bar. \n\nI visit the bar and notice the giant wall of TVs, plenty of space to sit and a patio. Good stuff so far.\n\nThe bartender cards me yet again and then gives me a wristband to prove my age. I oblige but can't help but wonder why the lady at the door didn't perform this function as well, odd. \n\nMy Kiltlifter is served in a plastic cup. Now, I work in a bar, we serve in plastic when we're at or close to max capacity. There were _maybe_ 20 customers in the building. We sometimes get rowdy, but I doubt enough to warrant plastic, so what's the deal?\n\nThe beer was as it should be, cold and foamy. We also ended up with shots, as our resident karaoke queen needed her nightly round. Interestingly enough the shots came in standard glassware. \n\nNo one ordered food, so I'll not comment on the supposed quality. I wouldn't expect much though.\n\nThe patio was visited as I chatted with a surly Scottish gentleman smoker. I definitely would like to see this patio during a nice spring/fall day. Looked great during the evening.\n\nThe restrooms were not visited on this maiden voyage, so I cannot comment on the condition. After reading the previous reviews I'm perfectly okay with that.\n\nI'd give it another shot, but I wouldn't recommend the place to someone looking for sports, beer or karaoke even. It was par to sub-par all around. Bummer, as it's a nice building and in a great location."

S"We utilized our little restaurant.com gift card this weekend at the Deck. We were able to get in right away on a Friday evening so that was  a plus. The decor was a beach bums dream - it was very cute and definitely had a comfortable laid-back vibe.\n\nThe deck highlights one of my favorite drinks of all time: The Mojito! Torn between the Strawberry Basil and Blackberry we decided to split both. My date did not care for either but I enjoyed both! I came to The Deck one other time just for cocktails and I remember our server mentioning that their mixes are homemade- and it tasted that way!\n\nNext we decided to try the crab queso which came recommended. What a total let-down! The cheese was barely melted (we asked for it to be re-heated) and even still after it was so grotesquely thick we could barely dip a chip. The queso had NO ruminants of crab- and honestly was probably one of the worst (overly-salted- heart attack inducing) things Ive ever had the displeasure of eating. I wish I had opted for the guacamole instead as the people next to us had it and it looked great.\n\nFor dinner my date had the fish taco's and I had the Neptune Roll. When asked how they compared to Cabo he said he enjoyed these better (but liked Cabos shrimp tacos better than both). He said he didn't like the rice and beans that came on the side either. My Neptune roll was pretty delicious but did not have much lobster or crab (very shrimp heavy) they also failed to fill the roll itself -so the bread was a main component-  I felt a little gypped. The red potato side dish tasted fine. \n\nWe decided to skip dessert but were given salt water taffy in place of dinner mints! I loved this idea and it was definitely a cute little highlight of the meal and reinforced the beach theme. We also had fun guessing flavors. \n\nOverall I wasn't overly impressed with The Deck but id give it a second go!"

S'Love this place. Never fails to rid me of the dreaded hangover. The Pizza\'s here are simply put as "delicious" although I\'ve never tried anything else on the menu... That\'s why you go to "Pizza Hut".. Well you go because you want pizza right?. You totally have to try the Veg Hot One... With stuffed cheese crust. Too die for!. I Always order the platter as a lite-bite starter which consists of 4 breaded chicken a mound of skinned potato wedges with a garnish of parsley, 4 garlic and cheese bruschetta\'s, two dipping sauces of your choice. My personal favourite being Chilli, BBQ. Just because I love the sauces that much...I remove them from my plate so there not taken by the waiting staff. Use it for sauce when your pizza arrives. \n\nAs for the staff they\'re very upbeat and very friendly. Even though they are rushed off their feet as it can sometimes get a little busy in the afternoons. As a touch they speak to you after your food just simply small talk but I guess they treat you like a human not just a contribution to a pay check at the end of the month.'

I have yet to have something that tastes like the smell.\n\nI've had the Penne with meat sauce. The pasta was overcooked and the meat sauce was average. The lasagna is above average and threatens to be good, but doesn't quite make it.\n\nThe side salad is okay as far as such things go. It consists of mostly iceburg lettuce with a middle eastern type olive thrown in and a sprinkling of some kind of field green. The salad dressings I've tried are bottled.\n\nThere is a daily pasta special."

S"Finally, a good place for Italian in this city.  The Firm has the BEST anti pasta salad I have ever had.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think about creating a salad like this.  Not much lettuce (not needed) roasted red peppers and rolls and rolls of yummy meat and cheese.  Not to mention, loaded with other goodies.  The dressing was fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and get this salad.\n\nI am not a brushetta fan but this is phenomenal.  it's like a little pizza with cheese and balsamic vinaigrette.  It's not your traditional brushetta.  \n\nWife had the chicken parm and I had the salmon picatta.  I was so impressed.  The portions were huge and the pasta complimented each dish.  \n\nOverall, you can taste the freshness.  Let me repeat that, YOU CAN TASTE THE FRESHNESS.  From the fresh pasta to the fresh tomatoes, it makes a difference.  It seems like everyone working there was family.  I talked to the owner and let him know what I think.  He was really interested in what I had to say and even asked me questions about my cooking I do at home.\n\nThis will be the place I bring out of town visitors.  The prices are more than reasonable and open for lunch and dinner."

S'I have to agree with Kate\'s review, though I will be more critical in mine.\n\nI\'ve heard the dim sum here is great, however I am only going to comment on the dinner service as I have yet to try the dim sum.\n\nThe first thing I noticed from the menu is that Chez Ping is noticeably much more expensive than other Chinese restaurant I\'ve been to. The prices of the dishes vary between 13$-23$, but the portions are smaller if not the same comparing to other restaurants. I am willing to pay a lot for good food, but 16$ for a dish of stir-fried vegetable with bean curd, it better be the best vegetable I\'ve ever had in my life. The second thing I noticed is that they really don\'t have much dishes for a Chinese restaurant.\n\nI do applaud the Mayo Chicken & Shrimp, it tasted very nice, the proteins were moist, and the shrimps were properly prepared. The broccoli tasted slightly undercooked, and was just bland and pretty much ignored. However, this was the only dish that gave me a positive feeling about this place.\n\nThe Steamed Tilapia had an earthy aftertaste and was way overcooked, it was not even comparable to any steamed fish I\'ve had before. On my way out after dinner, I noticed that their fishtanks were extremely dirty, covered with green algae and other microbes.\n\nOther dishes either tasted under-seasoned and/or overcooked, nothing too impressive. At the end, we paid 236$ for 12 dishes and a bowl of rice, which is not worth at all given the service and the quality of the dishes.\n\nWe waited in line for about 20 minutes to get served by the waiters; the long wait was not because the place was fully booked, but because many tables were not cleaned after the diners have left. Even after being seated, the waiters ignored us for a good 20 minutes before taking our orders. I don\'t blame him, he had a good attitude, and it was a demanding task for TWO waiters to serve TWENTY-THREE tables.\n\nWe ended up waiting 36 minutes for food.\n\nThe service was bad, the food quality was below average, and the place is overpriced. This place is "on par with places in Manhattan\'s Chinatown"? The guy who gave a 5-star ratings for this place must have been locked in a cage for the past 30 years and this restaurant was the first thing he encountered after being released.\n\nAll kidding aside, don\'t ever come to this place, take the metro or drive to Chinatown, trust me it\'s worth it.'

S"As a proud AJ resident I'm very disappointed that I must do the unthinkable and reduce my previous rating. I've returned two more times to enjoy the soup only to find that it consistently takes and hour to receive a bowl of cold to luke warm soup. The incredibly stale chips don't even begin to fill the void. \n\nTonight we sat outside, for the second time, at tables which have obviously not made it onto the cleaning list, again. As dusk approached it was clear that they don't have lights nor do they plan to use what appear to be misters. It's apparently just a smoking area for the few existing patrons. \n\nWhat a missed opportunity to capitalize on a beautiful outdoor area to enjoy Mexican food in the midst of this beautiful desert! \n\nI've called numerous times to ask if they have Happy Hour specials to which they always reply, she hasn't decided yet. We've give up and have agreed not to try again, they clearly have no intention of making things better."

S"I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, am I living in some parallel universe? Either this place has gotten progressively worse or some people just wouldn't know good food if it hit them in the ass. This place, while it is a good dive-type place to hang out, is terrible. We went on a Saturday and it was easy to find by its bright yellow paint and beer neon signs. Ordering was pleasant as the service was friendly, ordered some beers and went to go sit down. I really wanted to like this place because the atmosphere is pretty cool with pool tables, televisions and a jukebox. The men that were in the pool section were very loud and so was the music but I figured whatever, I'm not old so it's cool.\n\nHowever, when it gets so that you can't hear the other person across from you because the music and rowdy guys are so loud, then we have a problem. The girl told us she would bring us some chips, and when they came it was so pitiful I had to wonder if this was a leftover basket from another table. There was a ridiculously small amount of chips in the basket and they were cold and almost stale. The salsa was nothing to sneeze at either so I just stopped eating it. When the food came, it looked good but they got my order wrong so I had to send it back. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito which he said tasted good. The prices are pretty much the same as any Filiberto's or Armando's ect., and so are the food selections. \n\nThere are pictures of the meals on the wall just like at Armando's but at Armando's you get a big portion as well. The burrito he got was small. I had gotten my burrito enchilada style and when they brought back the right order it was overflowing off the plate with enchilada sauce, I was like, wtf? Don't they think they went a little overboard? The cheese on top was so fake and low-quality tasting. There was a big hunk of celery in the rice, and they put ranch over the lettuce and tomato garnish which is a huge no-no. The beans were the saving grace but the rice was almost flavorless. Just save your time and go to Armando's or Filiberto's, but if you want to just grab some beers then I guess this is the place to do it if your strictly in the neighborhood. I sat there the whole time thinking how much better I could have cooked the same meal if we had just bought the ingredients at the store. Maybe it's time to open that darn restaurant of mine if places like this can exist."

S'A shrug-worthy meal, at best. \n\nWent with a daily deal-type coupon and started off well with a tasty miso soup and gyoza, but when the sushi arrived, it was chock full of blah. Nothing special at all, and a really uninspired "chef\'s choice" selection. \n\nYou would think that a smart owner/manager would use the daily deal as advertising, entice people into his business at a small loss and serve up food that would leave the customer feeling like they must come back, quickly and often. That was certainly not the case. I left feeling like I was served the cheapest rolls I could be served. They were rolls that you could get in any sushi place, equal or better tasting and for less money. \n\nLeft very hungry and definitely UNsatisfied.\n\nOur server ignored simple requests that would have made our dining experience better. Seemed like he could care less. The asian "manager" seemed to barely understand, so I decided to not bother leaving comments. (I had the same phone reservation experience as a previous Yelp\'er.)\n\nA while ago, I visited Aikawa and reviewed it, saying that the sushi was amazingly fresh but way overpriced. I have since told people about Aikawa in the context of "if you have money to burn and want really interesting sushi..." \n\nAs for Zento, I have absolutely no reason to recommend that anyone eat here, and I will definitely NOT be back.\n\n1 1/2 stars for blah sushi, plus 1/2 star for very nice decor. Sadly, I didn\'t go to please my eyes, I went to please my mouth and stomach - and they both left unhappy.'

S"It's a sushi-themed family restaurant.\nThe food is pretty mediocre, the ambience is neither here nor there, and the service is chaotic. A good place if you're going out with a large group and want something mildly exotic for a reasonable price. Not a very good place for a romantic dinner a deux.\n\nThe sushi is not as horrible as Sushi St-Jean across the street, but also not the rich flavour experience of Wi Sushi down the road. The rice is a bit dry; the ingredients and seasoning are unremarkable; the fish and seafood are quite fresh though.\nAnd if you're not into sushi but your friends drag you there, they have teriyaki chicken and beef, as well as other standard oriental staples like General Tao and peanut butter dumplings. If not, they also have wings and fries.\n\nThe ambience is a little confusing. They look like they were trying to go for an upscale setting, but they also have giant screens broadcasting sports games. The crowd is mostly families with kids and large groups of friends.\n\nThe service was very disorganized.\nWe were missing utensils and extra order forms on our table; it took forever for anyone to pick up our order; we never got our tea until we asked for it, and even then we were given cups of it unlike the teapots other tables seemed to be getting; they messed up the amounts we ordered and brought us way too much; also brought us items we had crossed off the order; when it came time to pay, we left a credit card in the booklet, but were told to pay at the front, and when we got there were told to wait at our table for them to come around with the machine, then we saw them wave other people to pay at the front, which turned to be where you pay.\n\nSo if you're going out just to hang out with friends and grab a bite, it'll do.\nIf you're going out to impress a date or have a culinary experience, skip."

S'I believe that context is really the deciding factor in experiencing a place like Princesses. Located about 15 minutes outside of the downtown core of Montreal, near Olympic stadium, Princesses is a greasy spoon style diner that has one unique specialty; two words that are all it takes for my interest to be piqued: "Topless Breakfast". Seems hilarious, right?\n\nIt\'s an interesting juxtaposition to say the least. We went just after noon on a Sunday, hungry for our first meal of the day and we were greeted by 3 Waitresses that were, as advertised, topless. There was also one fully dressed man who had a commanding presence and quite the leer about him. I suppose his stink eye is to keep potential trouble makers in check, but still, it\'s hard to enjoy your eggs and get an eyefull of the scenery when you\'re getting an eyefull of your own from someone else.\n\nThis is where context comes into play - It was a lot of nudity for that early in the morning. I was hungry and totally sober, so it was pretty strange. Add to that, the fact that it was the capper to a 3 day weekend celebrating my friend Daniel\'s last days of Bachlordom. If we had gone to Princesses first thing, I\'m sure we could have sat their giggling and pointing like school children when their teacher tells them about puberty, but that late into the weekend, so much had already been seen and done and been done to us, We had sort of been desensitized to it. It was more or less business as usual at our breakfast table. Giddy giggling and knowning glances were replaced with aloof requests for more ketchup. It\'s sort of like if you had been wearing X-Ray Spex all weekend, after a while you\'d just order your coffee refill and not even bat an eye at someones junk as they give it to you.\n\nThe food itself was passable diner fare. As tasty as they looked, I opted out of the traditional breakfast, and had a burger, which was good, but nothing exceptional. Service was decent, the waitresses were friendly and Coffee was refilled semi-regularly. Also, to Princesses credit, I was impressed that one of our waitresses was still working there despite being visibly pregnant (if, by some chance, she\'s reading this, and by another chance and isn\'t actually pregnant - then I am really, really, totally fucking sorry). I don\'t imagine that would happen at many other establishments where toplessness was a requirement.\n\nOverall Princesses was a one of a kind experience. A better name for it might be "Emperor\'s new diner" (or maybe just "The Emperor\'s") because nobody seemed to even acknowledge the toplessness. It reminded me of the Toronto-Produced "Naked News" that made a splash on the internet a few years ago. Theres nudity, but once you\'re there it\'s not at all the focus. So, if it\'s the morning and you\'ve got a rumble in your tummy and a hankering for some present albeit understated nudity, this is your spot.'

S'I\'m not sure that the other reviewers went to the same restaurant as us!  I\'m not sure how this place has 4.5 stars!  My partner and I went to this restaurant based on the reviews and were sorely disappointed!  We arrived for our 7pm reservation on August 8th to be told that they had no record of the reservation I\'d made 2 days earlier.  After leaving us waiting at the entrance for about 10 minutes while they completely ignored us, they finally showed us to a table.  The table itself was dirty, the table cloth covered in grease stains and a few dead fruit flies.  We were tempted to walk out right there, but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  After sitting for about 35 minutes, the waitress finally took our order.  It should be noted that there were only about 7 other tables seated, 2 of which already had food.  About 15 minutes later our soup arrived.  After 1.5 hours finally 2 of the 7 rolls we ordered arrived (and one of them wasn\'t even one we had ordered, but we were so hungry we ate it anyway).  The food was fine, nothing special, but at that point we couldn\'t wait any longer.  During that time another couple who said they were there for 2 hours without being served stormed out after seeing our rolls arrive before their food.  We went to speak to the chef (the waitress did not speak French or English) and told him we would take whatever else was ready to go and pay for what we\'d eaten.  Only one additional item was ready!  The chef then left his post to spent 15 minutes adding up our bill, much to the annoyance of the other customers who had still not eaten.  On top of all this, they provided no beer or wine list and when we asked what kind of beer they had, the waitress made a "this size" motion with her hands.  They also did not provide napkins or soya sauce holders; we had to ask.'

S"= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =\n\nStopped into this busy JB's for their Lunch Buffet today, in hopes of having it be better than the one I tried four days ago at their Mesa location.\n\nHS, everybody in this busy place is OLDER THAN ME!!  Can you imagine??     :-O\n\nOk, never mind that.  The menu was the same here as Mesa, & the best value comes from ordering the Soup & Salad Bar Buffet along with a half-sandwich & fries, which only add about a dollar to the price.  Incidentally, don't waste your time trying to get a useful look at the menu on their Web site.  It's a nearly impossible to navigate & read this unpriced train wreck and parts of the pages are not even in scan range!  Did the moron who wrote this site ever try to proofread it before posting  to the server?  Does anyone on JB's management team have a computer to look at this mess?  Eek!     :-O \n\nSorry, I digress...     :-)\n\nSo I ordered a Ham & Swiss Melt half-sandwich on whole wheat, with Fries well done, to go with the Buffet, & then started on some Beef & Barley Soup (meh) and then some Cream of Broccoli (ok).\n\nBefore too long my half-sandwich arrived.  Instead of being on whole wheat bread it was on white, & the fries weren't well done.  I had to hunt down the waitress to ask for some napkins, & she eventually brought me two, the little 1950s style things.  That was the last I saw of her until she brought the check.\n\nThe 42 salad bar items (plus dressings) were ok but the whole thing wasn't well thought out.  For instance, there was salsa with nothing to go with it, and BOTH fresh and canned pineapple.\n\nThe bottom line?  Of the 6 other Buffets that come to mind immediately right along this same street, at least four are much better!     :-O\n\nLunch Buffet + Half-Sandwich & Fries:  $8.59/$7.73 Sr."

The fresh fruit side was pretty flavorless. I understand the fruit is out of season, but I've had fruit recently at many other restaurants in metro Phoenix that was much more flavorful.

S"The Clay Oven is a delightful Indian restaurant on the busy and bustling Morningside Road in Edinburgh, so it is in a great location for students to go to for their lunch or dinner.  It is quite small inside, but instead of it feeling cramped, it feels warm and cosy. The decor inside is authentically Indian with Indian music playing in the background. \n\nThe Clay Oven offers a wide selection of authentic Indian cuisine on its menu, with a good vegetarian choice as well. I had the Chicken Pasanda which was on their specialities menu and it was absolutely delicious as it was cooked fresh and the chicken was full of flavour - yum! It was very well priced too at under eight pounds, and it was a decent size with lots of rice which was also cooked perfectly. The Clay Oven also offers set menus which cost around \xc2\xa315 per person and include kebabs, nan, rice and a desert. I found the staff very friendly and accommodating. \n\nThe Clay Oven also serves takeaways which are always cooked very quickly, and they now do home deliveries which is incredibly handy if you want a delicious curry an don't want to walk for it.  Definitely The Clay Oven is the place I am going to when I next fancy a curry."

S"Went to Chez le Portugais in a party of six July 6. We were a trilingual party (English-French-Portuguese) and our waiter (Henrique? or was that the owner?) spoke all three. We had Octopus (not on the menu I don't think), squid, fresh fish, salad, tapas of some sort for appetizers - I wish I remembered the details but everything was good and fresh, lots of garlic, very authentic, and since the restaurant was not crowded (although it was Saturday) we had two tables by the front window and it was lovely. Our friend (Portuguese speaking) who brought us here has good taste and I concur with her selection. I do not get the bad reviews - this place was great and I am picky. Frankly I would probably give it 4 stars not 5 - I would come back - but I have to do something to balance those awful reviews! And to my fellow Americans - this is Montreal - be patient with your English and try to learn a few words of French, please? It seems like some complaints were from those who didnt speak the language OR ordered the most boring item on the menu."

S"Les Menus Plaisirs offers fine cuisine made with regional products. Mmm yeah, if you call ostrich regional to Quebec. I guess they make some poetic license available to their menu. But trust me; this won't matter to you, the foodie.\n\nLes Menus Plaisirs has been open for close to twenty five years and I remember going when I was a much younger chap and enjoying the Chinese fondue and the amazing chocolate mousse cake.\n\nWe are seated and offered some aperitifs. Time to test the bar, not on mixing skills; but on serving skills. I'm not a traditionalist on liqueur because I'm capricious when it comes to alcohol (as you'll read later) so I order a Southern Comfort with Orange instead. I say nothing more. It comes to me served in a Sherry glass (though I would have preferred an Old Fashioned) with the chaser on the side. Score 1 for the restaurant.\n\nThe soup of the day served was a Cr\xc3\xa8me de Volaille, poultry cream soup but lets face it, food just sounds so much better in French, like just about everything else. Well this soup had me spouting a lot of French adjectives and some religious swear words. It was that good. It was, duh, creamy and had more than just chicken in there. It had Guinea-fowl, chicken and probably some other birds like pheasant. It was easily the best soup I have ever devoured in a restaurant.\n\nUnfortunately when I queried the waitress on the content of the soup, she could not inform me on its content. This is a paucity of aptitude I despise when visiting a high-end restaurant. I tend to stand high on protocol. If the service staff is going to give my friend the eye for not having put his hand towel on his lap before being served his soup, I conversely expect the service staff to know what's in my plate they are serving me. The chef is supposed to give a briefing to the staff on what the menu consists of. It's not very complicated.\n\nSince we are in the context of demonizing the service, let's continue onto wine. I don't like wine. I never have and probably never will. I find it to be repulsive and horrid. Sue me. But please, stop giving me this dirty look every time I don't order a bottle of wine. I know there's good money to make with the wine cellar and if the sommelier has issues with me I'd like to see the bottlenecked nerd come and tell me face to face and I'll show him new ways to open bottles. I still drink from the bar and it's not a question of money, I don't mind paying 60$ for an 8 once piece of beef. I just don't like wine. Waiters should respect that some people don't drink.\n\nNext as an entr\xc3\xa9e I had the Bavette de b\xc5\x93uf Angus sur po\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e d'oignons au romarin, coulis marchand de vin or Angus beef flank steak over rosemary flavoured onions, wine sauce. This was the pi\xc3\xa8ce de resistance. It completely ruined everything. This is the little dish on which so many others will be compared in the future. The flank, considered the cheapest cut of meat by many but is one of the tastiest parts, it's all in the preparation and the way you cut the meat before serving it. And the chef at Les Menus Plaisirs understands this. It was tender, juicy and being almost deliquescent. The onion comfit was perfectly caramelized and browned and combined with the homemade craquelin was simply the ultimate compliment to my Bavette. And seriously it was so delectable, my eyes watered, almost shed a tear. Best dish I've had in years in a restaurant.\n\nNow for the main course. After the delirious orgasmic party-in-my-mouth-wipe-out that was the Angus Beef Flank insanity, the Fondue Chinoise just wasn't as appetizing as I remembered now. And it was a little bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong it was delicious but perhaps the salad days of fondue have gone by. But the broth was perfect, the beef cuts were perfectly red and delicious and the dipping sauces amazing. Simply not as much of an experience as I remembered. As soon as I saw the amazing looking rack of lamb go by I regretted my decision a little but the main course was still delicious and no slice of beef was left sitting on the plate, it's still fondue.\n\nOur helpful and gracious waitress comes over and recites the desert menu. It went like this: something, something, something, something, Three Part Cr\xc3\xa8me Brul\xc3\xa9e, something, something. Cr\xc3\xa8me Brul\xc3\xa9e was all I heard. The ramekin was split into 3 parts. One part was chocolate, the other was noisette (hazel nut), and the third was the real Cr\xc3\xa8me Brul\xc3\xa9e, vanilla. Normally, being a purist, I would scoff at anything else but vanilla Cr\xc3\xa8me Brul\xc3\xa9e, but this was amazing. Chocolate, excellent, noisette, amazing, vanilla, sublime.\n\nAfter this meal I needed a walk. Despite the evil eye for the wine and lack of explanation on the soup, Les Menus Plaisirs gets 5 outta 5 in my book."

I ordered the "Classic Burger" when it came out it was a well done hockey puck, it was cold and it came as a build your own sandwich complete with mayo and ketchup packets... Well so much for that atmosphere they spent all that money on! \nHowever I know how they paid for that atmosphere... My drink was a gin and tonic and when it came i was incredibly watered down and they charged me $10.69 for it!!! Really??!! \nThe food was terrible\nThe drinks are a complete rip off\nThis place looks nice, but that\'s it\nI RECOMMEND YOU STAY AWAY!!'

S"Just happened to notice this place as I was leaving the food court. We did because we are going to try El Salvador food when we take our trip to California. We have never had it before and we were curious. Everything on the menu looks really good. So we just decided to pick up a papusa. These looked popular because I would u of see people ordering and walking away with several on plates.  The nice girl that works at the counter did tell us the popular papusa was the bean cheese and pork and of course I ordered 1 to go.  She was also nice enough to say that it takes 8 minutes to make I was totally fine with that.  Now to the papusa ...it's a delicious flattened circle of masa filled with beans cheese and pork fried and seasoned to perfection it is served with a side of slaw like salad. I will give 4 stars now hopefully I can give 5 when I go back. And you have guess a the food is authentic if you see people from the old school in groups lining up to eat there."

S"Surprise surprise.\n\nAt a first glance, it's very suspicious. I thought it's just another Mexican restaurant on Park street.  Not really. It's actually a sister restaurant to the next door Inca Heritage. It's a very homey, casual version of it. The menu offers somewhat intriguing selection of latin fast food (sorry if my characterization is wrong). They offer a lot of grilled chicken dishes, sandwich with grilled chicken/meat, and rice bowls. \n\nWhile waiting for my gal pals for a lunch, I decided to order fried plantain and fried sweet-potatoes for appetizers. They were ok. For the main meal, I ordered their chopped beef + egg rice bowl. Wowza - unexpectedly delicious. The service was awkward but very pleasant. The good lunch experience made me wanting more."

S"Mambella's was the quintessential lunch spot for me as a former student at Waterloo. Located at the corner of Philip and Columbia, Mambella's is a Italian sandwich and pasta shop servicing mainly BlackBerry employees and Waterloo students. \n\nThe typical procedure to order lunch is to fill an order sheet with lunch options which consists of an eclectic mix of sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads and pasta. Sandwiches are also customizable to your liking. \n\nI find the form to be the starting point of a well-oiled machine - Mambella's kitchen. The form acts a form of quality control for the staff to ensure that your meal is made to your liking. No topping and option will be missing under their watch. Lunch orders usually take up to ten minutes. \n\nThe staple for me at lunch is the almighty veal sandwich. Imagine for a bit, a soft and crispy bun with a piece of tender veal, covered with mushrooms, green peppers, onions, provolone and mozzarella and smothered with a homemade sauce that is out of this world. I've also tried the paninis and each time I customized it to my liking. To me, it really provided the variety and selection that sometimes needed to escape eating a bland lunch.\n\nMy only caveat with Mambella's is its hours and location. However, they are opening a second location near Uptown Waterloo at King & Allen on the ground floor of the 144 Park condominium. \n\nAside from the hours, it is a great place that offers quality and fast food at reasonable places. I definitely recommend it to anyone in the area."

S"Enjoyed my end-of-year (now beginning-of-year) lunch there with my friend, Jeanette.  We brought a bottle of zin, which was very helpful in calming the spice.  We were told that the chef is formerly from Sichuan Gourmet.  There are several menus including an American Chinese menu, a traditional Szechuan menu, a listing of hot pots.  We ordered from the Szechuan menu and had fish filet in spicy broth, dumplings in Szechuan sauce, double cooked pork belly and ox tongue and tripe.  The ox tongue and tripe was the most flavorful with complex Szechuan spice, but it packs a wallop of heat.  It was served cold and the meat was very tender;.  I highly recommend.  The dumplings had a mixture of chili oil and soy sauce, which made them less spicy than I had thought.  The soy sauce added a sweetness to them.  The double cooked pork was served with green peppers and leeks.  It was tasty and very mild.  (The same dish from China Star is fiery).  Finally the fish, which was Jeanette's favorite, had lots of tender filets and spice, but not the same complex spice flavor as the tongue and tripe.  There were also chunks of what I think were celery and cabbage.  There are a lot more dishes to try, and soon they will have take out.  So we plan to return."

I was eating within 10 minutes of walking in there! The selection of food on the menu is astounding, but the quality is absolutely impeccable! I'd suggest anyone looking for decent Mexican food (inexpensive) to try it. They also have a truly awesome salsa bar!"

My luck there was one person ahead of me, while there were at least 5 cars waiting outside. I liked the counter displays. They were a variety of coffee cups and mugs presented in such a way as to look inviting. I thought it was a nice touch. \n Well, my turn came and I realized just how slow the cashier was. It was as if she had not a care Umbria world. After a few moments she finally took my order. Another woman actually made my coffee quickly, and I was headed to work.

I was really looking forward to a great Indian meal, but what we got was really bland food. Since this was the second Indian restaurant we had while in UK that was bland and flavorless, we figured this is just how it is served on the other side of the pond. It seemed like the food needed some more flavoring or cooked longer to bring out the taste. Was very disappointing, although the restaurant was very clean and the bathroom was very nice.'

S"While recently in Montreal, I stumbled upon Porto Mar. We were on our way to another restaurant near Old Montreal when, from afar, we saw the comforting Portuguese flag. The menu had classic Portuguese favourites, steak and various fish dishes. The service was a bit slow, but it gave me time to talk to my girlfriend. The food came and it was good. It was what I expected. The portions, I would say, were a bit small. Traditionally I am accustomed to huge slabs of steak, however the portions here were smaller and more refined. I wasn't really happy, but at the same time I wasn't mad. The food was good.\n\nOur waiter, and who I assumed to be the owner as well, was very friendly. He asked me where I was from in Portugal, and he later revealed to us that he was from the same region, and was from a nearby city. Small world. The end of the night was marked by desert and a somewhat pricey bill, however, I wasn't expecting something cheap, I wanted to treat myself and my girlfriend to a romantic meal in Old Montreal. For a full course meal with drinks, I guess the price was somewhat reasonable, plus we were family (kinda).\n\nIf you want good Portuguese food, in a romantic area, in a beautiful and warm restaurant, Porto Mar is the place to go. The service is good, the food is good, and your night will be too."

S'My parents are in the market for a more upscale joint, the type that doesn\'t advertise itself as "classy", you know? So naturally they started to look into hotel restaurants. So out of the blue we went to the Old Port, and ended up in the beautiful Intercontinental. Right off the bat, I\'m smitten with a place that has a couch for you to wait on. Fancy! You\'ll be glad to know that the restaurant passes the bathroom test with flying colors, but what about the food? The appetizers were lovely, I had some eggplant cakes, my father chose fat slices of salmon, but my mother hit the jackpot with the fried calamari. Those were among the best fried things I have eaten! We selected the table d\'h\xc3\xb4te, (which is a blackboard brought to your table). The mixed grill platter was humongous and looked pretty great, but nowhere was it written that my seafood casserole would be 75% rice! Hey! \n\nI liked the decor, which was pretty cosy (you get to sit in armchairs!) but it seems Osco! has a bit of an identity crisis: is it hip? or is stuffy better suited to the premises? Gaah! As some point the jazzy lounge sounds just got irritating. Speaking of irritating, look, my parents know they got an accent, but after two decades of Quebec potholes, winters and construction seasons, it\'s grating to sit down for a fine dining experience, and have the waiter go: "So you must be tourists! What brings you here?!". And SHUT IT DOWN.\nAlso, we sorta wanted to celebrate Mother\'s day, so it wasn\'t too cool on the staff\'s part to care mainly about my dad. So ladies, flash a wallet.'

That's right McDonald's is better which is the only time I have or will ever say that.  Their burger was flavorless and had the same consistency as burgers you find in the frozen dinner isle at Walmart. They have a lot of bells and whistles.

If you advertise yourself as a fast food chinese place I don't want to have to wait 5-10 minutes for you to cook a fresh batch the employees when something is running low should tell the cook hey we're running low on ....

S'AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!\n\nOur dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.\n\nI ordered what the waiter claimed was their "signature" dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had "re-heated" it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he "saw" the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 1/3.\n\nWe told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.\n\nThe following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as "Aquavina".  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!'

S"Fazoli's is not the first place you think of if you want some good pasta. Contrary to that comment, they actually are pretty good. Menu is small which is a plus for me. You're not overwhelmed by so many options that often times are repeats. The serve a variety of pastas, salads and pizza. I like their Chicken and Broccoli Alfredo Bake. The name says it all. Very simple dish with good flavor a even better portion sizes. It comes with a breadstick, however, you can ask for as many breadsticks as you want which is a really sweet deal. Someone comes around offering tables more breadsticks throughout your meal so you don't have to get up and ask for more at the counter. \n\n Price? VERY friendly!!! You can get a complete meal ( entree, side salad, pop and breadstick(s) for less than $9.C'mon! You can't beat that price!\n\nThey also cater which I would recommend if you're office is having an event.\nOverall, Fazoli's is a good place to dine."

S'Namaste Montreal - a tiny, unpretentious Indian restaurant and take-away joint - opened its doors two months ago in the McGill Ghetto, directly across the street from local favourite Amelios.\n\nFeaturing only 3-4 tables, counter service, and a small menu, Namaste is nonetheless quickly taking on the proud sheen of a popular neighbourhood gem. On a snowy Wednesday evening around 8:30 PM, a steady stream of both eat-in and take-away customers moved through the small space - with plenty of curious passers-by taking a moment to read the menu in the window. This menu is complemented by tasty daily specials. At the time of our visit, Namaste was already sold out of several popular menu items - like lentil dishes and the lamb curry.\n\nWe ordered a samosa, a large butter chicken combo, and a thali plate with chana masala curry and chicken curry. Both plates were served piping hot, with delicious naan, rice, and fresh (although limited) salad. You can choose your level of spice - "mild, medium, very spicy" - and dress up your meal with homemade chutney and pickle offerings. The food was quite flavourful and was excellent value, with the thali plate costing $8.99 and the butter chicken combo only $7.99. \n\nThe service is very friendly and attentive, and the overall experience is like eating in someone\'s kitchen. That being said, given the small space and the serving of even eat-in meals in large styrofoam trays, Namaste is strong on a delicious take-out experience. It\'s a welcome addition to a neighbourhood that\'s been lacking in very good, inexpensive Indian food.'

Which is why I think Gabbro really makes the Salisbury Hotel a cut above the others.\n\nIt's got a big garden area where you can make the most of the rare sunny days in Scotland were it's warm enough to eat al fresco, but the inside is just as gorgeous with all the dark brown leather and mirrors giving it a modern vibe.\n\nA lot of the food on the menu sounded quite predictable, which is why I only gave it 4 stars and not 5 - things like fish & chips or risotto that you'll find on menus everywhere. But they do offer one or two really quirky dishes such as the watermelon, strawberry, feta and black pepper salad that I had for my starter. Not only was it extremely tasty, at only \xc2\xa33.95 it was great value for money.\n\nDue to its location, tucked down a little side street off Newington road, not many people know about it.

I ordered a soupy noodle dish with duck and my wife had the pork over rice. We also split an order of pot stickers. My noodles were delicious as was the pieces of duck although I would have liked it had my pieces not been so boneheads. The pork over rice was even better it was ground pork nicely seasoned with Chinese five spice and it had sacallions tossed into it as well. \nWe were also tempted by the dim sum cart that came around but we opted to just stick with what we ordered. Given that it was an eatery in a first tier hotel on the strip the prices were a little on the higher side but not cost prohibitive. I would definitely go back I would just order what my wife did."

S'"Cheap Ass Breakfast" is what this place should be renamed. After a long night in Vegas and all your friends are sad they lost all their money you can come here and be happier. Because Coco\'s only asks for about $5 and you can have a decent breakfast. The breakfast specials are what I would say are equivalent to a "grand slam" at another restaurant. Other than that it is a typical diner menu. The wait staff was friendly and patient with our large group.

S"I've been here twice. The first time was when they first opened and I ordered takeout for my family at dinner time. We ordered three entrees. The serving sizes were great for the low price. The food was good but not amazing. The owner was there and was very friendly and easy to talk to. \n\nWe visited a second time and ordered takeout again for lunch. This time it was just my daughter and I. We ordered teriyaki chicken and two spring rolls. The owner was there again and took my order - he read my order back to me and said 'steak' so I corrected him with 'chicken'.  The food was ready quickly and the price was 9 bucks for the entree and two spring rolls. I did notice while I was there that he owner stood in front of the fryer eating while our food was cooking. He never washed his hands and didn't seem aware that eating while cooking someone's food isn't appropriate. He eventually took the spring rolls out and rolled them in paper towels, I assume to soak off the grease. I got over the 'gross' factor and ate the spring rolls surprisingly they were really good. Unfortunately he gave us steak instead of chicken even after I corrected him so I can't say how the whole meal was. I called to make them aware of the mistake (assuming he would apologize and offer to refund the entree or offer a free entree next visit) he said I ordered steak and he would be happy to remake the meal if I came back. I don't make a habit of driving all over town when a business owner makes a mistake. I probably won't go back. The prices are good, but the sanitation issues and the inability to troubleshoot a mistake doesn't sit well with me. \nI offer three stars because of the low prices. If you want good food and decent service, pay more and go elsewhere."

Der Laden ist nicht sonderlich gro\xc3\x9f f\xc3\xbcr ein Einrichtungshaus, aber man findet f\xc3\xbcr alle Bereiche etwas. \nDas bleibende Gef\xc3\xbchl nach meinem ersten Besuch ist allerdings eher negativ. Zum einen h\xc3\xa4tte ich mir bei einer Er\xc3\xb6ffnung ein wenig mehr Party erhofft und h\xc3\xa4tte gerne eine Wurst gegessen und ein Bier getrunken, zum anderen fand ich mich als Familie nicht willkommen. \nDie Gr\xc3\xbcnde hierf\xc3\xbcr sind folgende:\n- es gibt keine Wagen f\xc3\xbcr Babyschalen oder f\xc3\xbcr Kleinkinder. Man muss also die Babyschale in einen gro\xc3\x9fen Wagen stellen. Damit ist der Wagen dann aber auch voll und man kann nicht mehr einkaufen. Zwei Wagen zu nutzen geht alleine nicht. \n- Auf Grund der Tatsache, dass alle Eltern extra Wagen f\xc3\xbcr die Kinder nutzen und mit diesen im 1.OG rumfahren sind die schmalen G\xc3\xa4nge voll und es gibt kein Durchkommen. Die Gangbreite an sich ist schon nicht komfortabel in meinen Augen.\n- Um mit dem Wagen in das 1.OG zu kommen muss man den Lift benutzen. Hiervon gibt es in dem ganzen Einrichtungshaus exakt einen (!). Man wartet demnach mit seinem Kind in der Reihe und versucht sich nicht von dem Gequengel der anderen anstecken zu lassen. Irgendwie DDR Feeling \nAu\xc3\x9ferdem war ich von der Weihnachtsdeko und Baumschmuck entt\xc3\xa4uscht. \nZuletzt w\xc3\xa4re dann auch noch die Freundlichkeit des Sicherheitsdienstes zu bem\xc3\xa4ngeln  dieser tr\xc3\xa4gt auch nicht zum zweiten Besuchsversuch bei. \nAlles in allem eine Entt\xc3\xa4uschung f\xc3\xbcr mich, da einfach zu anstrengend. Dann doch lieber die 30km zu IKEA, da habe ich auch ein wenig mehr Vertrauen in Schadstoffpr\xc3\xbcfung und Haltbarkeit, hierzu habe ich leider auch keine Informationen vom Service erhalten (\xc3\x96kotest wird(s) richten). Echt seltsam, dass der Service auf Fragen zu Schadstoffen bei Babym\xc3\xb6beln nicht vorbereitet ist. \nEs handelt sich hier um meine eigene, pers\xc3\xb6nliche Meinung.'

Finally I give up and just order water, which is apparently unfiltered, right out of the tap and has a stong sewage aftertaste.

When I visited Istanbul as a child, I fell in love with the subtle flavourings, the hot and cold salads, the meltingly stewed vegetables and the honey-drenched sweets.\n\nSo, discovering Caf\xc3\xa9 Truva on the Shore was a real treat for me.  It's a fairly casual little establishment, where you can drop in for lunch or coffee, or else pick out some items to take away.  They offer competent versions of favourite dishes, such as stuffed vine leaves, green bean salad, and, of course, gloriously sticky baklava, which are all tasty, if not as absolutely stunning as this kind of food has the potential to be.  \n\nI haven't had a chance to try any of their sandwiches, but I was pleased to see that they have a good selection of vegetarian options - too many Turkish places offer kebab, kebab, or kebab.  Overall, this brightly-painted caf\xc3\xa9 is an inviting place to stop by for a light meal, and, while the Waters of Leith don't quite measure up to the Bosphorus, with a little imagination you might be able to conjure up an image of Turkey here."

S'A relative newcomer to Edinburgh, this unusual restaurant earned a Michelin star in under one year, and deservedly so. The 21212 name derives from the menu, which comprises 2 starters, 1 soup, 2 main courses, 1 cheese course, 2 desserts. At lunchtime you can go for just 2, 3, 4 or 5 courses. There is an extensive wine list, and there are several wines available by the glass also.\n\n\n The food itself comes in some startling combinations which work very well together, and is beautifully presented in a most elegant dining room. The lunchtime portions were fairly small, but by the time you have worked through five courses, you are amply satisfied. The prices are high, but worth it for the quality experience. The house itself is a fine Edinburgh Georgian townhouse magnificently restored to add modernity without spoiling the classical proportions or features. They also have a few bedrooms for those who wish to indulge in a splendid dinner and not have to go home afterwards.\n\n\n A place for a special treat rather than a routine eatery.

In these ways, Chingu provides better than anywhere else, plus has affordable prices! They also offer a broad menu of other tasty Korean treats (sweet and sour pork, sweet potato noodles with vegetables, spicy chicken cooked on a stone plate!)\n\nAnd the kimchi! They do it just right--tangy, tender, and deep red with spice--never orange from over-fermentation.\n\nAlthough I've been to Chingu with groups of people, and on my own, I think a table of 2-4 is best. The music is just the right volume, and the service is attentive and appropriate: you can focus on good conversation and sharing your delicious dishes."

On a summer night with a cool breeze, a server brought green fleece blankets to the young girls dining with their parents at the table next to us.\nMy husband, disappointed to see that most of the menu is pasta (which he doesn't love), ordered the veggie saut\xc3\xa9e. This turned out to be such an incredible dish- that we have been trying to recreate it at home ever since! This dish was a great surprise that deserves a larger font on the menu! I had pasta with pink vodka sauce, which was amazing! I am very discriminating about my pasta dishes and this is by far the best pink vodka sauce I have ever had. For days I talked about how disappointed I was that I didn't bring the leftovers back to the hotel with us.\nThe chefs special appetizer was also delicious. It was something that we never would have selected off of a menu, but the menu was prix fix, so we gave it a shot."

S"This little restaurant (which is just down the plaza from the inFamous Reyes De La Torta) gets overlooked because of its name and the simple fact that many customers go to this small plaza just for the Tortas next door.\n\nBut don't let the name fool you...This place serves Authentic Mexican food as well as a few Central American dishes like pupusas and platanos fritos. The food is very good and I've rarely been dissatisfied with anything I've eaten there. \n\nShe makes one delicious Mole Poblano. As a matter of fact its the only Mole I've ever had at any restaurant that I actually like. She also makes a few items that aren't on the menu, like her NacaTamales, Nicaraguan style tamales. They're a little more expensive than the average Mexican tamale, but they're so delicious and large, about the size of a Guatemalan tamale. Her enchiladas are very good as well. My favorite thing to order is the tacos al pastor...so so good!\n\nHer beans are rice are head and shoulders above what I've had at ANY mexican restaurant before. Her rice is nice and loose, not masudo like most restaurants put out. Her beans are red, not pintos, and very very good. She doesn't use lard like some places, or add milk...like her famous neighbors do. She also makes her own sauces, she doesn't use canned salsas. I think it makes the food taste better.\n\nHer pupusas are good, but not the best I've had since she uses mozzarella instead of the authentic cheese other restaurants use. But I take into account she isn't Central American.  \n\nOverall I'm very pleased with her food. The prices are reasonable and the quality and authenticity of her Mexican dishes are great compared to many Mexican restaurants around. Whenever I'm craving Mexican food, this is where I go. If you want the usual Mexican-American food you find at most restaurants, I suggest you look elsewhere. This is more homestyle food. \n\nThe owner is always there, she's the cook, and she's always willing to accomadate any requests you might make (hence her adding pupusas to the menu).\n\nThey don't really have waitresses. Its a small place that usually only has the owner and a helper or two. But the owner will take good care of you, even if she might take a while because she's in the kitchen cooking .  \n\nMake sure to bring cash, since they do not accept credit."

The meat was still juicy, and the fries were the slightly soft, dark brown, style that Montrealers seem to love.

Today the person working the register was also having to expedite the orders which made things super slow.  What was crazy was that the guy behind me ordered a chicken pot pie and they said it would take 35 minutes...and he decided to wait for it.   This place needs to hire more staff and TRAIN them."

The nice thing is that they have it all the time, and this place is open late (though they closed at 11 when I was there, despite teh giant OPEN TILL 3 AM sign). So maybe call first.\n\nIt was... fine. We had duck and char sieu on rice and hot and sour soup. Though the soup had nice flavour, it was SO corn-starchy and gelatenous that you could probably walk on the surface. Or call it hot n' sour custard. But maybe that was just that batch.\n\nHmm, I didn't see what other reviewers saw, but oh well."

I normally get  an egg salad sandwich on wheat bread.  They also have a light lunch option which gets you 1/2 a sandwich and a cup of soup."

S'Island Malaysian has opened their second location in the space that used to be World Noodle- stopped by last night wanting a hot, spicy soup with noodles and seafood to help me beat this illness but found it had been reopened as a new place. Let the server know I was feeling under the weather and what kind of dish I had originally been seeking, and they were able to accommodate and customized a dish! \n\n Seafood tom yum mee hoon is closest to what I got: thick noodles and plenty of seafood (crab, octopus, and overcooked shrimp) all doused in a medium-spice curry sauce with tons of flavor. Really enjoyed my meal, and at $10 including tip it was a steal!\n\nInterior is more upscale than expected. Menu at this location is smaller than the original but keeps the mainstays like satay and roti, but majority of menu is noodles, soups, and rices. They must have just opened, as they had no other customers while I was there and exterior has both the old signage for World Noodle and the new temporary signage for Island Malaysian.'

S'Worst and most unorganized location in town.  Pizza never "hot and ready" like advertised and you generally have to wait about 20 min for a basic order.  None of the employees ever seem happy with their jobs, they clearly don\'t communicate with one another, and most of them have no idea what customer service means.  I know it\'s only $5 pizzas, but common courtesy to your customers is free!\n\nToday I came to this location at 10:50 am (opening time is 10:30 am) and the doors were still locked.  I could see one employee inside messing with the safe and getting the drawer set up.  Shouldn\'t this have already been done?  Employee told me through the door that the manager didn\'t show up and it\'s gonna be at least another 20 min before he could start a pizza.  Clearly there is something seriously wrong at this location when the store manager doesn\'t even show up and leaves it to the employees to run the store.  I hope someone from corporate headquarters reads all reviews and cares enough to get over to this location and fix the issues in this store.  After today, it will be a long while before I visit this location and give them my business....if ever.'

This is something that the employees there need to take note of. My boyfriend and I were super hungry our way home from the Fashion Show and Chinatown. Alas, there's a KFC! We ordered, got our food and left, only to find that his meal's side dishes were missing back at home. He was really ticked since the side dishes were what he was most looking forward to, and the KFC was really far and out of the way to have to drive back to get the order corrected.\n\nMy meal was fine, but I wouldn't risk going back there. The employee handling our food was too busy talking to an off duty employee to make sure she had everything right. It was a very typical food order for them and they managed to mess that up? Not coming back to this location."

S'We were staying at the Fraser Suites Hotel which is great so we thought this restaurant would be great too. We came about 30 minutes before their breakfast ends. We decided to do their breakfast buffet. When we got to the food table, there were hardly any food left. We started with what they have at the moment thinking they would replenish the almost empty containers on the table. We waited but they did not. We asked and the only answer we got is \'sorry, no". We ended up scavenging the food containers for whatever food we can get which is just horrible after we paid about 12 pounds each. And whatever food we got, they were not great. They should have not offered us the breakfast buffet if they knew they willnot replenish the food. We would have just ordered food from the menu. \nThe interior is nice though... but you can\'t eat it. You\'d rather go to places like World\'s End, Rabbie Burn\'s and many other places that serves breakfast than eat here. You\'ll get your money\'s worth elsewhere.'

Burger : both of my friends ordered this and loved it. They absolutely loved it\n5. "Tenderloin steak": ordered tenderloin for $29 plus the shrimp and fingering potatoes. Decent but they brought me the side trimming of a sirloin steak which isn\'t even on the menu and they didn\'t even adjust the price. I told the waitress I was very hungry and that I would eat it. However, I expect at least an apology and I would think it fair that you reduce the cost of my steak plate because it\'s a cut of steak your restaurant doesn\'t even offer!!! I feel offended that they would think so little of their customers. \n\nService: Unrefined and just phostess too timid to tell you the table is ready. \n\nWaitress: appeared confused and afraid of questions regarding the beer selection. \n\nAfter I told her about the steak she said she would let someone know but it was never addressed by her or anyone else.'

I probably should add, however, that for most of our meal we were the only customers.\n\nI had the Chicken Tortilla Soup and the Bourbon Apple Pork Tenderloin with baked potato and green beans.

Even the green beans and baked potato were perfect for me.\n\nMy wife had the Bacon \'N Brie Mashed and the Fiesta Garden Cobb salad - both of which were excellent.\n\nPortion sizes are quite large - wanted to try the desert but didn\'t have the room.\n\nMy only disappointment was the very pedestrian choice of draft beer (well - that and the very loud bartender.)  \n\nThis was our first experience at the Great American Grill, but we will be back.

It helps that it's just up the road from my place, and it definitely qualifies as a hidden gem here in Verdun.\n\nSince the first few months, they've expanded their menu out to a solid bistro offering. It's always good to start with the calamari entr\xc3\xa9e (cooked to perfection). The house burger is cheap and tasty (and has brie on it!). The pizzas have a nice range of toppings - definitely on the 'fancy' side compared to most bistros, but you could say that about the whole menu. I've also had the filet mignon and salmon at various times, and been really happy with them. The desert varies depending on what's been made, which means they're always great home-made treats.\n\nThe staff are friendly, and have always given great service. The chef George is great, and has always handled any requests people asked for. They sometimes have wings specials on Habs (that's the Montreal Canadiens hockey team for you visitors) game nights. \n\nIf you're in the neighbourhood and need lunch or dinner, you owe it to yourself - and me - to try it out."

S"This place would have gotten a 5 star, but they got rid of their Happy Hour prices!  But still not bad for $13.95 per person.  Went on a Sunday for lunch.  The food was great that day, the last time I was there the consistency wasn't the same.  My main love in that place....the sukiyaki beef!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fatty beef with the broth, simmering with onions and tofu and cabbage.  Getting hungry just thinking about it!  I could eat plates of it over some rice.\n\nTheir sushi is normal fare, lots of California type rolls...some with roe on top, some with avocado, and even some with eel on top.  Their best sushi bet is the hand rolls (you have to ask to have them made).  They come out the freshest and taste the best.  For you beginners, go with the California hand roll.  Me, I like the spicy tuna.\n\nLunch that day had a good menu, of course the usuals like fried rice, noodles and tempura.  But they actually had fried oysters that day for lunch too which was unusual because I usually only see them during dinner.  Needless to say, the gf had like 2 dozen of em' because she loves her oysters  (heh heh...good for the libido too *wink**wink*).\n\nI wish they didn't charge for drinks, but their peach iced tea (I think it's peach) is really refreshing.  Just ask for iced tea, and it already comes that way.  Their dessert selection for lunch wasn't bad, some strawberry shortcake, some cheesecake, a green tea cake, couple other things I can't remember, and fruit with the chocolate fondue fountain.  They also had the shave ice machine going that day and ice cream too.  My favs are the shave ice with strawberry, and I like the red bean ice cream.  For you folks from Hawaii, ask for a scoop of vanilla ice cream in your bowl before the shave ice goes in there....almost like home!\n\nThis one is the nicest Makino's in LV, too bad the other new one in Summerlin had to close down.  The decor isn't so 'cafeteria' like the other 2 locations.  I still go here for lunch if I need a sushi fix on the weekends."

S"Fab gluten free options and great non-standard vegetarian options. Being GF can be a challenge and having to do the whole asking thing and then it being clear that staff don't have a clue what you are talking about then makes the whole thing a bit awkward and full of trepidation in case they got it wrong and you suffer the consequences later.\n\nNot here. Most of the menu is naturally gluten free - no cheap wheat fillers here clearly! Good quality ingredients and lots of choice. I could have crispy stuff (normally off limits), I could have chips without fear of contamination. The Apiary rocks and I'm heading back in a few days with a friend who missed out.\n\nBeware though. The whole menu is so damn tempting - from little bites, the starters, the mains and the desserts. Portions are on the hearty side for mains so I was full to bursting after dinner here. Crispy pigs ears were delish with aioli as were the whitebait starters. I opted for one of the specials - guinea fowl wrapped in pancetta with duck confit and sage and shallot mash - it was lovely but even I was defeated in not being able to clear the plate. Plus I had seen the dessert options and I wanted to test them out.\n\nDessert was a coconut sponge with lime and Malibu - it was delish. I never did the whole Malibu thing as a teenager but all the flavours worked out so well.\n\nEveryone appeared to love their food and there were lots of head nods and smiles as we chowed down.\n\nSo, I still think Newington rocks as an eating area and The Apiary is a great addition. It is cosy without being cramped and there are some lovely touches - little booths with coat hooks on the side, gorgeous prints and d\xc3\xa9cor and just a lovely warm, buzzy feeling. So I'm heading back in a few days and I plan on taking my next lot of visitors here too :-)\n\nPrices - bites around \xc2\xa32.50 (bread is cheaper and GF is available too), starters around \xc2\xa35 with mains around \xc2\xa310-17 and desserts around \xc2\xa36. Wine - starts from \xc2\xa33.50 a glass with carafe options (\xc2\xa38) and a decent price range for bottles."

I stand in line for 5 to 10 min just to get my order taken when there's not even a line. You will be standing there waiting while theres groups of employees talking...gossipping....cussing. The drive thru is just as slow except you better expect to go in to get what they forgot to put in bag....whether that be food...creamers and sugars for coffee...I recommend HOLDING UP THE LINE TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT IT RIGHT and maybe eventually these clowns will learn to get it right. Customer service is also horrible ..the kids that work there are feisty young black females who could care less to be there let alone deal with you. Out of all the times I've been there being a regular there maybe once have they said thank you when they hand me my food despite the fact I say it each time I get my food.

S'Apparently Packer fans aren\'t Yelpers.. well the awesome ones are (Dave B. and I). I\'d like to start off by saying that I was expecting to give Mabel Murphys a 5 star review as the best place to watch a Green Bay game in the Valley, possibly all of the southwest after going there for Packers/Vikings game yesterday.\n\nHowever, I never saw the game there, and therefore, can\'t say that.\n\nFor anyone that\'s a Packers fan that hails from Wisconsin, you should have a picture in your mind of the classic Wisconsin sports bar - Packers memorabilia EVERYWHERE, Leinenkugels aplenty, cheese curds on the menu, that surprisingly homey feel, lots of screaming and fanaticism.\n\nTypically this is Mabel Murphys. My first visit there was for the Bears/Packers Monday night game last year and it was complete mayhem, and I wouldn\'t have had it any other way. The typical "fight songs" played at Lambeau are played during commercial breaks and screamed by the fans. You can\'t find anyone in there not sporting their green and gold and it\'s hard to find a seat or standing spot unless you are there an hour or more ahead of time. It screams home for all of us that left the frozen tundra.\n\nHowever, I think one hazardous flaw was made this year. They closed for renovation and nothing on their website hinted at anything of the sort. Therefore, people that don\'t head to Old Town all the time and come those few times a year for the games where being with your own kind is of importance had no idea unless they would\'ve tried to call, and who calls to make sure a Packers bar is open the night they play the Vikings with Favre adorned in purple? Nevertheless, I arrived an hour before the game to find out they weren\'t open an that nearly a dozen people also did not get the memo. The construction worker there had no suggestions of where to go and there was no note on the door from management. They said they had been having people stop by all day asking, and had no suggestions.\n\nI missed pre game due to having to drive to another bar. Mabel Murphys really disappointed me last night. I really hope they can make up for it. Never get on the bad side of a Packer fan and never deny them of their game. I\'ve never been more sad about a Yelp review than now.'

I will on occasion stop at the Burger King on the Northwest corner.  A discount coupon popped up last week for this place and while I did not buy the coupon I took note of where it was and went looking for it today.\n\nThe address places it on Indian School when in fact it is unit 1 in a meandering strip mall and it actually faces 43rd Ave.  Parking right in front is crowded so it is better to park in the big open area by Payless shoes and walk up.\n\nGetting there just after 11 the place was almost full and there was a steady stream of customers the whole time I was there.\n\nI got the Mexicana torta which had grilled steak, onions, bell pepper along with cheese and a generous amount of avocado. I also had the soup of the day which was mostly shredded, seasoned chicken in a broth.  Both were pretty good.  I washed those items down with a pretty good Horchata.  \n\nIt helps to be able to count to 100 in Spanish here or you may miss when your number is called, the majority of the customers were Hispanic.  Everybody I dealt with was friendly.  They open at 8 for breakfast.  It seems they also offer baked goods for sale here.

S'I would give it 0 stars if I could. I went there today for lunch because I was hooked by the advertisement outside (Wow, $4.99 for lunch!). First thing I noticed was how cheap everything looked inside. The lights were off, even though it was overcast. When I got the tattered menus and sat down on the filthy table, I realized they had changed the prices. Lunch was now $5.75. I didn\'t know it then, but I would be duped two more times during my meal.\n\nThere was one guy who took orders, he didn\'t speak English, and seemed to not understand my order. (I ended up having to translate for my friend who is not Asian.) Finally he left and we thought we were going to get our food soon. Wrong again. He comes back 20 minutes later (not lying, I used my phone right when we got there so I knew exactly how long it took), saying they don\'t have the option I ordered, and if I want to order something from their regular menu. ("What the hell?" I thought, "I came here to get a cheap, decent lunch combo, not to spend $8 on one dinner dish.") So I asked him if they can replace the item that they\'re out of (I\'m not even sure what it is since he couldn\'t explain it). He went to talk to the boss. Comes back 5 minutes later saying they got that item and they can make my combo. Okay.\n\nTen more minutes later, my lunch was served. Except it was missing an item of the three-item combo. I asked him, "Doesn\'t it come with papaya salad?" He replies, "No, I don\'t think so."  "Can I see the menu? I\'m pretty sure it comes with papaya salad." And so I pointed it out to him, he followed the word "papaya salad" with his finger as if he doesn\'t understand it. Finally he agrees to talk to the boss. But not before he goes to the cash register and talks to all the other customers first.\n\nIt was another ten minutes until I got his attention and asked him about the salad. He says they\'re out of it today. "And you tell your customer now?" I thought. Instead I asked for a price reduction or a replacement. He went to the kitchen and brought back an old, angry man who is apparently the boss. The old guy yells at me, "We don\'t have papaya salad! We can only give you 50 cents off, or two pieces of fried wonton skin" (for those who don\'t know, they\'re like fortune cookies, but way thinner).\n\nWhat the fuck? I wanted to tell him to sod off and take his crappy restaurant to hell. Instead I got my wontons and finished my food as fast as I could. My friend and I got out of there right after we were done, the damn waiter didn\'t even fill our tea when I signaled for it. I paid, and as I left, I said "Thank you", just to see what the waiter would do. He ignored me. Bastard.\n\nIf you want to go to hell, this place is for you. Otherwise, I hope they close it down soon, so they could get a decent restaurant in its place.'

S"There are several eating options at this terminal, and since I didn't have a bagel my entire time while in Montreal, I thought why not? This was my one and only chance to get one, as I was hankering for one, and well, it was a major disappointment. \n\nIt was about 6:30am and was half asleep, and after going through security, and perusing my food options, I noticed a plethora of breakfast bagels on display. All were on sesame seed bagels, and were either egg and cheese; egg, ham, and cheese; or salmon and cream cheese. I opted for the egg and cheese, and anxiously anticipated eating one, as I needed a bagel fix (none for about 3 weeks).  Oh, I was so disappointed, as it was heated up by microwave, and was flat, chewy and dry. No flavor on the sesame bagel; and the egg was also bland and cheese was just way too much. Prices were fair, and not too pricey (thankfully)!\n\nAs I mentioned in my quick tip, this is a very mediocre bagel, but the only place in the gate where you can get one. I'd skip and go find another place to eat in the terminal.\nOnly positive side was that the coffee was really strong and robust, and there are a few tables next to Bagel Bar, where you can eat (quickly) and then board your plane!"

S'I\'ve just checked out the pictures of this place which make it look halfway cool.  It\'s not.  \n\nYesterday, The Man asked me what I wanted to do for the day (because two of the three houses we were supposed to view are now under offer, sadface).  I responded "get drunk."  He laughed and asked me again, and got the same answer.  This house hunting business is stressful, you know.  \n\nSo, about late afternoon time we took a walk down the canal to Leith.  We wandered around a bit because The Man wanted to go somewhere new, and we ended up on Constitution St which has a few places which looked good.\n\nWe started in The Constitution Bar and the minute we walked in we knew it wasn\'t for us.  The Man described it as "soulless" and I thought it looked like an upmarket canteen.  The dining area actually had nice dark wood tables and chairs which, if they were in the main room, would make the place look a bit more interesting than the sterile blonde wood does.  \n\nThey were playing football through some dodgy (probably illegal) foreign channel which had drawn a few people in, but the minute the football was over, the majority of people left for more interesting pastures.\n\nThere is nothing actually wrong with this place, the staff weren\'t rude and the beer wasn\'t off, it just wasn\'t an enjoyable place for a pint and I would definitely not go back.'

S"Wow I forgot how great Taco Bell is. I never realized they had so many zero calorie options on their menu. You might say What Taco Bell has zero calorie options you are crazy. To which I say no sir just about everything on their menu is zero calories because once you throw it up after you eat it you don't absorb any calories.\nI am sorry I don't usually rank on a place this bad but this was really bad. I am sure some people just love it but not this person. The staff seemed nice enough. Although it seemed like the guy on the registers second day on the job. Also when you just stuff the napkins still inside the wrapper in the place where the napkins go and tear open the end that is not really refilling the napkins. Just saying.\nThe food is tasteless and horrible. I wouldn't even feed it to my dog because the ASPCA might come after me. I know that is harsh and I am being mean to get a laugh but this is the worst kind of fast food. It gives fast food a bad name. I don't even dare call it Mexican food because it is so far away from real Mexican food it has never even met real Mexican food. Real Mexican food would beat up Taco Bell food if they crossed paths.\nLike I said I know people just love Taco Bell but as for me I will try, shouldn't be that hard, to never eat here again. Sorry Taco Bell."

I let the manager know the last time I was inside but am not sure if it's been updated. So, I have ordered the turkey and avocado croissant, Italian sub and a wrap. Both tasted good but it is expensive in my opinion for what you get. I've never been in when it's busy (even during lunch time) so that weirds me out too. Their chip selection is also limiting...they didn't even have regular plain chips! Oh well, this place is sufficient for a sub bite but can't say it's amazing."

Villa pizza was selling there slices half off!! So with a family of four, I ordered an entire pizza of course not forgetting to ask if the pizza was fresh, bc we all know if it sounds too good to be true, it more than likely is. Well the guy reassured me they had just made the pizza so I paid $10 for a whole pizza, went to my room and chowed down w my husband, two year old and one year old babies. The next morning, our guts bubbles and our Vegas/Red Rock experience was completely ruined by and constantly interrupted by sprints to the nearest restroom. It was bad. Really bad. Luckily my babies didn't feel the wrath until we made it home last night. They had low grade fevers and woke up this morning with 103 degree temps. I gave the baby motrin and booked them for a trip to the doctor. I hate seeing them sick and I want to really slap the guy who KNEW the pizza was no good and SAW me with my babies yet still sold it to me and everyone one else behind us. Anything for a dollar right, Villa Pizza? That includes selling rank pizza???? I wouldn't have given it away for free. Have some morals and ethics. Shame on you!"

S'Village Inn does a nice job with breakfast in the mornings, as well as lunch.\n\nOur little group comes here once a month.  We\'ve always enjoyed our food and the service is very good and friendly.  \n\nToday was a good example.  One of us had the egg white omelet, fruit and whole wheat pancakes (see photo).  Another had the "Pick 2 for $2.00 value meal" (photo). while someone else had the Country sausage & eggs (photo) on a whole wheat english muffin with grapefruit juice.  Admittedly, the coffee is somewhat basic, but good.\n\nAs you can see from the photos, Village Inn does a nice business with the Pies and cakes.\n\nThe tab ran us about $8.50 each, before taxes and tip.  I would recommend looking for coupons in the Sunday Arizona Republic.  It works for us.  \n\nEnjoy!'

S'I am not quite of the "you can\'t have too many cafes" school of thinking but not far away so I was pleased to see Constitution Street get another coffee focused cafe. Located on the corner opposite the Compass pub, The Hideout Cafe starts with the great benefit of replacing an eyesore empty site.  It\'s a bright space with a mix of furniture styles including a bench made of old pallets. One of its great virtues is the friendly staff with smiles and going that extra mile no issue. This good start is assisted greatly by decently prepared Artisan Roast coffee. Good selection of cakes and pastries.  The breakfast rolls and sandwiches are good too. Cost-wise the Hideout fits into the normal fancy coffee cafe bracket: around \xc2\xa32.20 for a regular sized espresso based drink. This is becoming increasingly popular including with the mums and occasional dad from local Leith Primary. It\'s obvious comparator business is Printworks 100m down the street. For the moment the longer established Print works may just have the edge for me but it\'s close and if Hideout continues to develop it could see itself become a popular quality cafe.'

I also ordered a cheeseburger which comes with lettuce, tomato, red onion and a pickle spear I got jacked for from Hunnie Bunnie. UGH. This wasn't bad at all - not dried out or anything and a decent size as well. \nHunnie Bunnie had a hot dog, the regular size, but there are footlong hotdogs which you can order like Matt P. did - also with a cheese, chili, or both option to add to the wiener!"

Of course it is no where near the menu of the actual restaurants they have outside of the airport, but obviously that is because it is a Kiosk in an airport.  The wraps are delicious and better than most of the larger restaurants in the airport by far in my opinion.  If you are wanting the yummy soups in homemade bread bowls, you will have to drive the 2 miles to University and Hardy Dilly's Deli, but you can still get a great ready to go wrap or sandwich in 2 minutes and still make the flight that has started boarding!

Pull up to the sign to order and wait for five minutes before I am even acknowledge that I am there.  Finally order and pull around, I wait another five minutes.  I could understand the wait if there was someone in front of me, or if the sit down area inside was packed, but there was no one else there but ME.\n\nI'd gladly tell y'all the employee's name, that is if where the name is suppose to be wasn't ripped off.

I was made to feel like I was interrupting her day and that I should have just went somewhere else to spend my money.\n\nYou know what really puts me in a tizzy (yes, I just used that word)?

Minutes more pass.\n\nTwo more BURGER KIND EMPLOYEES, two women, exit the store with a TODDLER in tow, but they are carrying huge bags of BK food.\n\nThe DRIVER of the GREEN SOUL, "This is ridiculous, we\'ve been waiting over 10 minutes, I\'m getting out of here.

Lucky I stopped them. You\'re the manager. Manage!"\n\nA few more minutes pass. One single ICE CREAM is passed through the window to the waiting passengers. Then, finally, a BAG with the burgers and fries arrives. The GREEN SOUL drives off down East Wash. Watching carefully to be sure the wandering TODDLER isn\'t in the way.\n\nSOUL PASSENGER takes a bite out of his burger, and spits it out into a napkin: "Oh my god! How in the hell did they ruin a Whopper, for chrissakes!? \n\nSOUL DRIVER: What\'s wrong with it?\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #1: "It\'s cold. And I mean cold. It doesn\'t taste like meat. It\'s just rubbery and tasteless... and where\'s the char-broiled taste? Did they forget to add it? The cheese is in no way melted. There\'s a wilted mass of white lettuce core shoved in the middle, like a bad surprise. The bun crusty and stale.... do I need to go on--?\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #2, sampling a french fry: "And my fries are soggy and cold, too.... and no ketchup packets in the bag. And my bun\'s stale, too!"\n\nSOUL DRIVER starts to laugh: "that was so bad, I expected cameras to come out of the door next, \'smile, you\'re on candid camera!"\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #1: "Or \'Punked."\n\nSOUL PASSENGER #2: "We were punked, all right.

S'A couple of weeks ago, my wife and I were planning to head to Mexico on vacation, and had a connecting flight through Philadelphia.\n\nThis doesn\'t quite explain how we ended up at dinner in Scottsdale.\n\nWell, partially.  Due to depart on 12/20, I was packing the day before while scanning channels, and saw a nasty, snowy video on the weather channel.\n\nPhilly.  Expecting their biggest 2-day snow accumulation since 1909.  Needless to say, we were going to have to find other options to Mexico, which brings us to our one-day delay and visit to Tutto in Scottsdale.\n\nJust a few days before Xmas, we picked the place out because of its huge outdoor patio.  We started ordering things, and started liking what we saw.  The food was (with one small exception) very tasty and impressed us. (one of our group is very Italian, and a very good cook, and SHE liked the Italian there... not an easy feat)\n\nThe service was... simply flawless.  Might\'ve had something to do with the fact that it was a couple of days before Xmas and the entire downtown was dead on a Monday night.  But, I like to think that they were friendly like that on a normal day, as well.  We had an ongoing conversation with the waitstaff, who\'d have been very at-home in any European restaurant in terms of their service levels.  Eventually they brought us a couple of free schnapps to thank us for coming and spending on a slow night.\n\nOverall, this experience helped salvage the beginning of our vacation.  This would have been a "5" if not for one small exception with the food.  My dish had mashed potatoes, which are not a delicacy by any means, but instead a good measure of how well a restaurant does the "simple things."  Granted, it was a slow night and they might\'ve been out of some things.  However, I have to be honest when I say that they tasted like powdered potatoes, instead of the real thing.  If I was paying $4.59 at a diner, no problem.  But at a reasonably classy place, dropping $350 for a party of four?  Nope - expect better than that.\n\nThat having been said, the service and everything else really made up for it.  Overall, a very solid place with great service that will provide a very pleasant night!'

Right, ok, so we\'re talking morsels and crumbs... plates the size of teaspoons... right?\n\nNo, indeed not, my aporetic amici! We\'re talking good-quality food, good-sized portions, and a warm atmosphere - the faux-Mediterranean decor might not be to everyone\'s taste but if you\'ve come for the food then you won\'t leave disappointed. By "good-sized portions", I don\'t mean the plate is so loaded down that you\'ll leave dragging your tum between your legs, but enough to fill you and put a big smile on your face (try the polenta and try to stop that smile from coming).\n\nIt\'s friendly and cosy, but probably because it\'s located next to several larger establishments, it seems to get overlooked a lot; each time I come here, I never have to wait for a table. That\'s not to say that it isn\'t well-populated with happy diners, but there usually seems to be space for a few more. If you find yourself seeking lunch in the area, I strongly suggest you make use of that space.'

S"So its Friday and I work hard all week and it has been a thing for the last month or two to have pizza every friday night and the kids love it\nWell needless to say I haven't had Domino's in quite some time so I downloaded the app to order a pizza for pick up which didn't work so I ended up having to call to get the price of the quoted special for the pizza. When I pulled up I noticed the bar next door and there was loud people and smoking and sounded like a few guys arguing so definitely not a place you want to take your kids for picking up pizza. The pizza was the main reason for the trip to Domino's especially since it's a few blocks from my house so why pay the extra 5 to 6 dollars for delivery. We got the 2 medium 2 topping pizzas and 16 parmesan bread bites the pizza had hardly any sauce and the crust was really greasy like they slapped too much of the butter flavor on it and wasn't all to appetizing as a family we can eat 2 medium pizzas no problem especially being that we have hungry kids but there is still a whole pizza left over rare for our family on pizza night. The bread bites didn't come with sauce so I paid the extra 75 cents for a cup of the most awful tasting marinara sauce and the bites were greasy and so salty it was hardly edible.\nSo on a fair note being that the cheese was the only thing good about the pizza give this Domino's 2 stars and I won't be going back probably for another year or so just to remind myself why we never order from Domino's."

S'I work relatively close to MMG, so I\'ve given it a few chances. \nNo more.\nMMG is WAY too expensive for what you get, and what you get is inconsistency,  salt, a weird wetness and mush.\nTurkey meatballs: salt.\nCucumber salad: salt and mush\nPasta with marinara: salt, mush, and wetness.\n"Premium" burger: see picture. Seriously.  It\'s awful.\nRocky Balboa wrap: wet, mush and salt. \nRice and beans: wet, salt, mush.\nPizza: salt. SALT SALT SALT SALTY SALT.\n\nOrder any of these a second time and you will get a completely different item from what you got the first time. \nWhich might be a good thing.\n\nWhen dining in at MMG, you will have the pleasure of listening to the cook sigh and huff his way thru screwing up your salty wet pile of mush while waiting at least 20 minutes. DO NOT LET HIM KNOW YOUR ORDER IS WRONG. It will take an additional 20 minutes to fix AND you get stink eye the whole time you have to wait. It\'s not worth it anyway, as you get a salty, wet, mushy pile of slop regardless. \nIt\'s like paying for dinner and a show. But with lots of salt. And mush. And wet.'

S"Despite the poor reviews, I really love MMG. I work for American Eagle's Corporate office and so this is one of the places in walking distance to my office. It's a couple more bucks than Subway but the chicken is grilled right in front of you and that to me is worth it. It just seems healthier. \n\nGranted, I only get the European wrap (grilled chicken/red peppers/spinach/and parmesan) but I am always satisfied. I also get the cucumber salad on the side that has chopped onions and dressing over it. \n\nI know exactly what people are talking about with that weird wet/sogginess. Sometimes the juice from my chicken settles at the bottom of the container but I just make sure to throw some napkins down. The portion size is pretty small but for me, it's perfect.  \n\nThere's not much to the place - It seems like it just opened but apparently they've been there for a while. There's a lot of empty space. No tables just a bar against the wall running the length of the grill.\n\nI have definitely recommended this place to people - It's good to throw in the mix. I wouldn't get it for dinner but it's perfect for a lunch or a post gym meal if you're willing to pay $10 for a hardy snack."

Nudelgerichte gut best\xc3\xbcckt mit den jeweiligen Komponenten, frische Champignons, \xc3\xbcberhaupt frische Zutaten, ausreichende Portionen, gro\xc3\x9fe Salate, alles appetitlich angeboten und flott serviert.\nDie Messer waren, wie so oft, eher eine Qual. \nDie Preise sind absolut moderat.\nEin angenehmes Lokal, welches ich mit Sicherheit nochmal besuchen werde.'

S'So I\'m looking at my rating distribution, and I realize that I tend to review spots that I love. Reward good behavior, compliment super service, cheer on tasty fixin\'s. But really, yelp is also for the opposite, too. Warn others of horrible experiences, bland food, shockingly rude employees...\n\nWhich leads me to Big Daddy\'s. Also I think it used to be just Daddy\'s Pizza, and I guess he felt like he needed to be a little more healthy, and then became *Big* Daddy. I dunno. Morale of the story is that I\'m skipping right over the 2 star, straight to "Eek! Methinks not."\n\nHere\'s the scene. Board game night with some healthy-eating type friends. I remember this menu that looked very tasty, so I presented it, feeling super good about myself for knowing about such responsible delivery options.  Skip to, over an hour late (maybe 10:30pm), our food arriving. Fine, tip the guy a little, and move on.  Two out of our four items were completely wrong, despite the ticket being written correctly. So we call immediately to ask for a refund or a credit or something, and they say they can\'t, they can only send more food ---- everyone is already going home, we\'re not about to wait til midnight for a turkey burger quesadilla. They tell us the manager will call when she gets in the next day at 10am. For the record, the two items that were right were so cold and bland... from being 110 minutes in the making I guess...\n\nNext day: Manager doesn\'t call - we finally have to track her down. She said she would send a driver with the card machine which is the only way they can refund. Things seemed fine... for 10 minutes until she called back...\n\n*Demanding* to know that we still had the food, and that we\'d be returning the food to her. (we didn\'t. it wasn\'t right, it wasn\'t tasty, not even worth the fridge space. plus who has ever had to return delivery food??)   She was appalled that we would expect a refund for something we couldn\'t return --- the only way she could ever explain this to her manager was to take it out of one of her employees salary --- etc. *yelling* (we were only asking for a refund for two of the four items --- thought we were being very reasonable... )\n\nFinally said fine. she\'d send the driver "right over." Driver never showed up..... unless it was the person ringing our doorbell in the middle of the night for 10 minutes. But I don\'t answer doorbells in the middle of the night, so I don\'t know.\n\nOrder at your own risk. Can\'t imagine $20 is worth not having one star reviews out there, but that\'s their call I guess. Their food, with decent service, would have gotten 2 stars from me.'

S"There is nothing positive to say about this buffet.  In the city where every hotel has one, I'd expect that excess competition would breed quality.  Clearly, this isn't the case. \nThe choices were few.  Hardly anything was very fresh.  Not a single selection stood out for it's flavor or, at least, appearance.  I usually have a hard time walking upright after leaving a buffet, but this time, I left still feeling some hunger.\n\nI've sampled a number of buffets in Vegas over the years, and while there are some that offer much better experience than others, Courtyard buffet is the first that I would definitely avoid.\nThere is only one reason to eat there, if you're staying at the Stratosphere, don't know your way about town, and are hungry.  I fit two and a half of the three.  While I'm somewhat familiar with Vegas, I was too hungry and tired to look around."

S"Worst buffet in Las Vegas\n\nThe Stratosphere as a hotel is what it is: decidedly average, geared toward the guest trying to enjoy Vegas on the cheap. The Courtyard Buffet should be an affront to any guest's sensibilities. It is undeniably the worst buffet in a city loaded with buffets, and one of the worst I have ever experienced. I only ate at the buffet because I had a free voucher as part of a promotion. \n\nI felt very alone in the dining room surrounded by the host of aged gamblers and tacky tourists taking a break from the tables and slots and eat their one meal of the day; they seemed more interested in the Keno numbers than the slop on their plates. I cannot blame them for liking the food; I am not sure that anyone of them knew better. I would never eat here again--even if it were free. None of the food was fresh and nothing was palatable."

Then I got local Kobe Beef steak, followed by homemade ice cream. \n\nPoint is, the flavors were awesome, the service great. Outside on a nice summer's night in Charlotte. You can't beat it.

Since we were there (and it was too cold to go further) we decided to try out their brunch. I have two words for you - HOMEMADE SAUSAGE! Wow! YUM! Ask them about the special ingredient. The place is really tiny (25 seats or so) though so you may have to wait a moment. My companion raved about the bechamel sauce and insisted I mention it here. The portions were perfect and well presented. Service was very friendly and welcoming to boot.

The only reason that I give them three stars is because they have an over saturated menu.  They have several really good items, but those are surround by even more bad ones, so if you are not in the know, you may end up having a bad experience.  That being said, I could never get enough of the Honey Chili Chicken.  There is also no seating, so it is only take-out and delivery.

One of the other things that I really appreciate of this place is that they deliver to a huge amount of neighborhoods circling around the downtown area.\n\nSince I started out on writing my review for this place I have ordered at least twice from here.  Both times I was not disappointed.  Both times I was full.\n\nMy first order was one of their bread twists.  I had the pepperoni variety.  If you need a visual for this, just think of everything that you would put on a pizza, minus the sauce, stuffed inside some bread that is in the shape of a C.  Only minus the sauce on the inside, why, because you get a side of marinara on the side with some ranch (more on that later) on the side.  It was good, so good that I ate it all in one sitting.  \n\nMy next order here was a salad.  With a mix of iceberg and spring mix lettuce I wasn't let down by this.  Add in some cucumbers, red onions, and tomatoes I was sold.  I had opted for some of that ranch dressing I mentioned prior.  What is so good about it?  It's homemade.  So good, definitely not store bought.  I thank you for this due to my allergies, I could actually enjoy a ranch dressing again.\n\nYou've definitely earned another repeat customer in me.\n\n\nWoot Woot!  Review #700"

S"City Tavern is an attractive restaurant in the heart of uptown Charlotte. They boast a nice menu with a great seafood selection, so we gave it a shot. For starters, we went here on a Saturday night at 8pm and were practically the only ones inside, which is never a good sign. I ordered a mojito, which was really good and refreshing - one of my favorite parts of our experience there. \n\nI ordered the seabass and it really wasn't anything spectacular. This is definitely one of those restaurants that gets the job done, it is clean and the food is OK, but I would probably wouldn't think to go here when looking for a good restaurant on a Saturday night. If you do head over, look for my second favorite part of our experience, our waiter. He was so cool and absolutely hysterical!!

S'Yeah, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) just doesn\'t taste the same as it did as a kid and we all know why... Crappy quality of ingredients and hormone stuffed poultry!\n\nBut I gave this KFC location 1-star due to the fact that they stole $0.39 from me. Sure what\'s thirty-nine cents you ask... Nothing, other than the fact that it was taken from me without my permission.\n\nThey have two signs that clearly read: "Additional fee of $0.39 will be added for debit card use." - or something to that effect. So I cleverly used my credit card... Only to find the fee had been added to that too.\n\nSo... here\'s to you, you piece of crap franchise owner who feels that it\'s necessary to make a profit from patrons wanting to use plastic, instead of eating the expense (which we all know is much less than $0.39 per transaction) like every other restaurant and business across the country does.\n\nI think I\'ll go through your drive-thru a couple of times a month, order $40 to $50 dollars worth of food, then refuse to accept the food if I\'m forced to pay an "inconvenience" fee when I hand them my debit/credit card. The thought of your KFC location having to regularly waste money by throwing out a $50 order here and there ought to make me feel better about your theft from me!\n\nI hope others follow suit until you start acting right!'

S'What I thought would have been a very nice and romantic Valentine\'s Day dinner at the Four Seasons resort Crescent Moon restaurant turned out to be a stunning disappointment. \n\nFirst of all, we were seated outside- twice. The staff member who brought us out there took us immediately back in because he thought the hostess had made a mistake. But no, the mistake was his, so back out we went. Did I mention there was a light drizzle outside? Fortunately, we were flanked by two heaters so searing I wondered if I would have to reach for the Solarcaine when I got home. \n\nWe got menus right away, but waited quite a while even for some water. When our waitress took our order for food, she did not even ask if we wanted drinks, even though my husband was holding the wine list open in his hands. When I asked for a gin, she did not bother to ask my husband if he cared for anything. When I got my gin, my glass was chipped. She apologized and brought me another. Unfortunately for all of us, this turned out to be only her first apology of the night.\n\nWe got a basket of breads which were just ok- some may have even been a bit on the tough side. Then a waiter came over and tried to give us entrees that were not ours, and we had not even had the first course of their special Valentine\'s Day menu. At last our sweet corn cream soup arrived, with a strip of poblano and a goat cheese empanada floating in it. Hubby liked it better than I did, but I do not care much for sweets at dinner. It was pretty good for what it was. \n\nOur entrees consisted of a petite filet, some king crab leg meat (out of the shell), and Yorkshire pudding with creamed spinach on top. We both ordered our beef medium rare, but what we got was overdone on one side and rare on the other. The crab was nearly inedible- it tasted like it had been previously frozen, and was totally overdone and chewy. Having just spent Christmas on the gulf coast catching and eating crab, we know what fresh tastes like and this was NOT it. When the waitress came to check on us and Hubby commented on the crab, she offered to bring us a new plate of it. We declined, not trusting they could get it right. We also had to let her know that steak knives would have been nice for our steak. The pudding and spinach were decent.\n\nThe dessert was the stand-out of the whole dinner: a small scoop of very dark chocolate ice cream (house made), a coconut cake (really more like a big soft cookie) topped with a layer of firm chocolate and then with a circle of flan. The presentation was nice and the small drops of super fresh caramel sauce as decor were so delicious that I would have purchased a jar to take home. Props to the pastry chef. However, I had to ask for coffee and cream, and then she did not bring sugar. How freaking specific do I have to be? It was just the tip of the iceberg in a night of thoughtless service. \n\nThe first reviewer commented that the "service was good- but you cannot expect less-- it\'s the Four Seasons!" I would have expected this to be true, but left completely astonished that the staff was so poorly managed or trained that we had to ask for beverages and proper utensils, that our menus were left on the table until the first course arrived, that the bread and butter were still on the table as we left, that I was served my drink in a chipped glass, and that we were seated outside when it was drizzling. Let alone the decidedly mediocre food- as DINKs, we do not mind spending $150 on a good meal. But when we left wishing we\'d gone to Arriba, that\'s a problem. Oh- and my last impression? No soap in the ladies\' room.\n\nUPDATE: I wrote to corporate- something I almost never do. I got a very quick response, and then a few days later another from the local food manager who offered to comp us a meal. Not being the type to complain just in order to get free stuff, I declined. I figured that if I were in charge, I sure as hell would want to know if food, service, and housekeeping were far below the standard that my "brand" suggested.'

S'I came here yesterday and had great service. Sandwich was great. Service was fast. But today I came here again and when I got to my car I noticed that there was no cheese in my sandwich so I went inside and asked for a couple piece to put on it. Max, a short Hispanic male worker, was at the register and started asking me for my order details then my ticket number. He started pushing buttons on the register for about four minutes, making a few pieces of cheese a huge deal. When another customer came in he told me to step aside and he will have to keep looking for my ticket so he can charge me for the cheese. I told him to just charge me then. He was very rude with every word that came out of his mouth. There were several other employees there that told him to just hit the cheese button at which point he snapped at them and said, "don\'t argue with me!"  I couldn\'t believe the disrespect, to me the customer and to his coworkers. This guy has no business being in customer service. He should be moved to the back to wash dishes if he can\'t handle being polite. After he snapped at the coworker, another one put two pieces of cheese in a sleeve and gave it to me. She said she was just going to pay for it.  \n\nI gave I\'ve star for this restaurant based on Max. If he gets removed from here then I will review my rating.'

S'Maybe my expectations were higher than normal for the LBS Patty Wagon, being a mobile kitchen extension of the sit down restaurant inside Red Rock Casino.  But after trying the "Perfect Burger", I thought it was just an okay burger, composed from more gourmet ingredients (i.e., frissee, gruyere cheese, herb mayo) compared to the other food truck burgers/sliders offerings.  At $7 it was a fair value, as you can obviously get less for your money trying other food choices from other food trucks.\n\nThe taste of the burger was somewhat disappointing for me.  Maybe that has a lot to do with the all-beef patty being cooked well-done, which is a major turnoff for me right there.  But the combination of the beef with melting Gruyere Cheese, Herb mayo, Smoked Bacon, LBS Burger Sauce, Frissee, Oven Roasted Tomatoes, and Red Onion Marmalade, which looks really good on paper, ended not doing anything for me.  Hell, even Carl\'s Jr\'s Original Six Dollar Burger was a better tasting and more "perfect" burger in my opinion.\n\nI probably will not seek out the LBS Patty wagon in the future. However, for those that are into the budding food truck culture of Las Vegas, I say give it a try and decide for yourself.  For all I know the dry patty was a fluke, and their burgers are supposed to be more juicy.\n\nThe best part of the LBS Patty Wagon experience are the sample nitrogen chilled treats.  It is definitely worth trying, especially since it is free.  Their Dessert Slider made with macaroons is a concept that I think needs refining, along with the flavor profile.\n\n2 Stars.'

S"I have always liked panera and this location is no exception. I always get the same thing (a chicken Caesar salad) and it always tastes  delicious. The service I got here was pretty decent. The line moved quickly, my food was out about the same time I filled my coffee and everything was about exactly what you expect... BUT...\n\nBut here's the deal. I know you can't expect to keep a dining room like this perfect all the time. But when I see an employee empty a trash can an walk right past tons of food on the ground some kid probably spilled... I mean really? It isn't the hardest thing to walk by once every 15 min or so (with as many people as they have working there) and quick sweep up big spills. Also, none of the tables were cleaned off when I got there or when Ieft. It would have been 5 stars from me... But alas."

S'Ohhh, what I wouldn\'t give for Waffle House to come to NY.  Maybe there is one, somewhere in the hinterland, where lumberjacks go to calorie up before a day of log hauling, but \'round NYC there is nowhere to go for hash browns 7 different ways including smothered and ALL THE WAY.  There is no place that has such perfect sausage gravy, such friendly servers, all of whom seem like they should have a sitcom named after them ("Verle", "Sherrie", "Mame", and that is just in one location!), no place where eating well and being full at the expense of your cardiovascular system is taken as seriously.  You can have your Cracker Barrels and your IHOPs and your White Castles, but a patty melt with bacon, sausage gravy on hash browns and a bowl of cheese grits at the Waffle House is really heaven on earth.\n\nI haven\'t been in one since college in Bloomington, Indiana, where a WH walking distance from my apartment was the first place we would go after a night of too much drinking when we were hungover...I would get a Reuben sandwich and my roommate would have an omelette.  It appears that Reubens no longer appear on the menu, but the food is as good as I remember, the coffee is as weak, and they are all still open 24 hours.  I saw a Phoenix one from the highway as we tried to find Roberto\'s, and we made a special trip out there the following day so I could have my sausage gravy.  I have no idea if this is the actual one I went to, but they\'re all about the same thing--cheap good food.\n\nEverything is made with love!  You\'ll love it here.'

S"I play pool at pool sharks, right next door, and order food from here every time I go.  This place is amazing!  My two favorite dishes are the orange chicken and the sweet and sour chicken. The main reason is the way they bread or batter their chicken. Most Chinese restaurants it is a struggle to find the chicken under the gobs of greasy breading. Or it's just the chicken with no breading at all. Here, they lightly batter the chicken so you get all the great texture of breading but can still taste the chicken! And the batter helps hold the awesome flavored orange sauce to each piece of chicken. \n\nThe service is incredibly quick and friendly. The chef should be given an award. The portion sizes are big enough for you and two or three friends. Three of us usually share one order with white rice and we feel like we over indulged afterwards. \n\nGoofy name...but oh so true! Tasty!"

S'The Big F heard a few good things about Redstone Grill, and we had an Entertainment coupon to use as well.\n\nWe walked in shortly after 6 pm and noticed that we just  missed happy hour.  They have two happy hours as well!  (Monday through Friday, 3 pm - 6 pm and 12:00 am to 8 am)  All appetizers are half off, breakfast is half off during the reverse happy hour and drink specials are available.  Not a bad deal when their appetizers include seared tuna, sea scallops, crab cakes, lamb chops, and lobster quesadillas! \n\nWe both ordered the Rib Eye Steak for $15.95.  "12 oz. choice Steak marinated in our signature Redstone seasoning."  You get two sides with it and I went for the Baked Potato and Cabernet Mushrooms.  The Big F went for the Baked Potato and Onion Rings.  When he found out Black n Tan meant Guinness was used in the batter, it was an easy sell.\n\nThe food arrived pretty quickly and the baked potato came with all the fixings - butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon bits, and chives.  We were both pleasantly surprised with the food quality as well, especially for the price.  After finishing our meal, which was a fair amount, we were offered dessert.  I was interested in checking out their dessert menu, but the waiter upped one on me by bringing the dessert tray over!  Fancy!  Although the desserts looked and sounded great, we were stuffed! \n\nService was good, our waiter along with his colleagues all came by to check on us and make sure things were good.  No shortage of employees here.  They also had a steady stream of customers coming in on this Thursday night.  \n\nOverall, a good place with a nice selection of food to choose from and a price that doesn\'t hurt the wallet.\n\nThere\'s also a full bar section to the left while the restaurant portion is the right.\n\nSidenote: On Saturday nights, the restaurant section closes and "The Loony Bin" takes over.  This stand-up comedy show is $14.95 per person, but we got a coupon after dining there.\n\n(Pics are posted!)'

But these subs are filled with so much more meat, cheese, toppings, etc. You get so much more food for your money, not your measly sub that Subway serves up.

S'I had a bad experience here coming in for the first time.  The food selection is below average compared to other vietnamese restaurants.  I usually drive by and the parking lot is always empty and so was the place when I walked in.  Never again!  The worse part was the waiter seemed desperate by trying to upsell me the most expensive dish there and saying they ran out of the food for the first two items I randomly chosed.  Don\'t know if he was lying or not but the way he said it seemed shady.  Also, at the end I paid for my meal in cash. As soon as he received the cash by hand, the waiter responded with a "Thank You Very Much" as if he assumed I was letting him keep the change (which was a lot) as tip when in fact I wanted it back.  The poor service there definitely did not deserve a large tip!'

Thankfully, that didn't mean that I had to skimp on absolutely AMAZING food.\n\nThis place was excellent. It was clean despite the unassuming storefront, and the decor set a great mood (despite the somewhat unnerving Christian art on the walls). But most importantly, the food was impeccable.\n\nOne of my friends didn't like Indian food before he arrived; he left the restaurant with a newfound respect for the cuisine. Their lamb was tender. Their curry was delicious. Even their naan and their Basmati rice, side dishes that came with every meal, were amazing. And our servers were extremely polite.\n\nAt the end of the meal we were given scented towels to wipe our hands clean. All in all, this place is excellent. Would do business again."

Then I'd notice that when I ate leftovers, I only had the chicken and didn't have any problems and figured that the only common thread was the coleslaw and that seemed to be the problem.

I've drove by this place prolly 20 times and always wondered about it so i decided to check out the reviews and found were very good so i took the wife tonight and we order Turkey Burger with bacon {wife} she really liked it and very juicy and lots of flavor. I was debating on the Fire Burger and the pulled pork sandwich. I ordered the Fire Burger {double} medium rare and was cooked to perfection and one of the better greasy spoon burgers i've had in a long time. I like that all the burgers are not frozen and fresh made to order. We also had the tater tots, Onion rings and Corn nuggets. Wife said the tater tots were good and i loved the onion rings. The corn nuggets were decent. The regulars were pretty friendly and the owner manning the grills was also very friendly. We were delighted to find this gem. I see this being a regular place to have lunch. Looking forward to coming back next week.  Pulled pork sandwich look out!!! \n\n Lance \n\nPS. To get into this place is a bit confusing just ask my wife, But you drive down about 2 blocks past hinson's and turn right before the shell gas station. If you are at the shell station you have gone to far. Also once you take the right you go down prolly 200 feet and take immediate right and go down what you would call a frontage road i guess and park out back. Don't let the outside fool ya it's worth the stop. We ordered 2 sandwiches and 3 apps and order was right at $20 pretty tough to beat that."

I took the unhealthy route with chips, but they're pretty good.\n\nTheir bagels are a staple there. My favorite is the French Toast and the honey walnut cream cheese is to die for.\n\nTheir breakfast sandwich, the Power Breakfast Sandwich, or whatever it's called, is really good and you should try it was sausage instead of ham and add some jelly.\n\nThe pastries are also really good. The mini Pineapple Upside Down cake is delicious and not too sweet. Their brownies are some of the best I've had from a to-go food place. The chocolate chip cookies (get them in the bag) are so good, I'm curious how they get them to be that good.\n\nI'm a die hard Panera fan and I recommend you go because there are options for everyone."

Our appie for two comprised of the best (by far) tzatziki I have ever had, cucumbers, tomatoes, great olives, feta cheese, charizo, dolmas, and this great salmon flavoured mashed potato dish.  I loved it all!  We saw that a couple got the calamari, fries, and salad that I was looking to try and it looked amazing - large plate and very reasonable!  We only come once a year for Grand Prix but I\'m bring my husband next time (the guys were doing the Thursday track day stuff).

I ordered the thai thai noodle ($13 online) and was charged $15- I pointed out this discrepancy and the cashier simply said, "Yeah I know." Really? Then why was I charged incorrectly? Don\'t like how this was handled.\n\nTHAI THAI NOODLE dish was just okay: ground beef, two shrimp, and some octopus with a ton of bean sprouts and a few rice noodles. PUMPKIN CURRY was tasty but way too spicy- ordered both dishes the same spice level (3) but they were drastically different. Lack of consistency is problematic, what\'s the point of a scale if you don\'t adhere to it?\n\nReceived a complimentary order of pad thai rolls (crispy spring rolls with noodles inside!)- they weren\'t given to me in response to the pricing issue, but seemed to be a Grand Opening special.

S'Third time visit. No reason to increase the stars. Rib Eye Steak tough but edible. Meat Loaf was high quality but not warm enough. Ditto for vegetables. This place has to do a better of job of serving food at the right temperature. This is a consistent problem. The shrimp bow tie pasta was ok, but swimming in loose sauce and onions.\n\nThe servers here are pleasant, caring, and efficient.\n\nThey were out of Salmon, and Smoked Half Chicken. A request for bread was met with " I\'ll see if we have any ". They did... and we were told that would be an additional $1.00. Really? Four people ordering 4 entrees, and you\'re going to charge them another $1.00 for bread? What\'s next? A charge for silverware?\n\nDoes this strike anyone else as being "bush league"?  How can management\'s thought process be so myopic? Do the owners  think doing this will ingratiate them,  or polarize the relationship, with customers. Inquiring minds want to know. You be the judge!\n\nHere\'s another rookie mistake. We had a coupon that the server asked to see before we ordered. She accepted it and logged it into their computer. When she presented it to management at the end of our meal, it was rejected because it expired 4/1/12. \n\nFirstly, tell us that upfront. Secondly, would it have been terrible to tell the cutomer that the coupon expired but would be accepted as an accomodation this time, but in the future they would adhere to expiration dates? After all, for a few bucks, management could have created much goodwill....especially in light of everything else that happened.\n\nWhen we mentioned the coupon incident to the person at the front desk, she said the server didn\'t handle this properly, and the server should have instead, gone to the manager. Yet it was this same person to whom we were talking, who rejected the coupon when the server presented it to her.\n\nYes folks...to err is human. To blame it on someone else is..... more human!\n\nAnd last, but not least. Three visits and three times there was chaos with the check. If you tell them to split the check down the middle, for some reason they don\'t know what this means. You wind up getting 2 separate checks with the wrong amounts on each. It\'s very simple. If the bill is $70.00, you put $35.00 on each credit card. They just don\'t understand.\n\nThis restaurant needs someone with good business sense to step up...before it\'s too late....and they wind up with the same fate that has befallen other restaurants both at this exact location and in this strip center. \n\nJust in case they can\'t figure it out.... that "fate" would be.......\n\nFailure!'

The food was all piping hot when it got to the table.  The chorizos were flamb\xc3\xa9d right at the table!! (And all who tried it said it was delicious and not greasy) two of our friends had a steak and cheese sandwhich with a spicy gravy and a fried egg on top - that looked amazing... two had the pork and beef skewers and commented that the spice rub was just right, flavorful with heat, but not overpowering.  My sister in law had steak with potatoes and an egg, she was impressed at how perfectly the steak was done to her order (medium rare)... \n\nWe didn\'t even wait for our mains to make our verdict - after the appetisers (the afore mentioned rissois, along with cod cakes and 2 chorizos) we had decided we were definitely coming back.  \n\nThe wait staff were helpful and attentive, I had trouble deciding between the two bacalhau dishes and with a single question "do you like salty food" our waitress helped me decide.  I\'ve never had bacalhau com natas before and wasn\'t sure what to expect, while I want to try more dishes, I know that\'s a solid go-to for me next time I\'m there. \n\nWe were all surprised, with the size of our meals - 6 mains, 6 or 7 starters - at the size of our check - only \xc2\xa399!! It\'s BYOB but still, that was a nice surprise.  \n\nWe live in the neighborhood and Tugas is always fairly packed so I\'d advise making a reservation.\n\nTugas Amor will, if it hasn\'t already, outgrow it\'s space, I hope it doesn\'t leave the neighborhood, but when and if it moves, I will happily go cross town for a fix.'

S'Von einem Bekannten erhielten meine Freunde und ich den Tipp, mal im Chruch-Chill einzukehren. Nach einem aufregenden Tag zusammen beschlossen wir eines abends, dieser Empfehlung nachzugehen.\nWir fuhren mit dem Auto in den Hof, in dem das Restaurant sein sollte. Leider gab es dort nur sehr wenige Parkpl\xc3\xa4tze, aber ein kleiner war f\xc3\xbcr uns noch frei. \nWir setzten uns auf die gem\xc3\xbctliche Terasse, die sich gleich neben dem Parkplatz befand und st\xc3\xb6berten durch die recht kleine Speisekarte. Die Karte war vom sprachlichen her sehr auf Mittelalter getrimmt, wodurch es anfangs etwas schwer war, zu durchschauen, was genau dort angeboten wurde. Vorwiegend wurden Hamburger und Schnitzel angeboten, ich jedoch entschied mich f\xc3\xbcr eine Currywurst.\nDer Kellner kam kurz darauf und nahm freundlich unsere Bestellung auf. W\xc3\xa4hrend wir jedoch auf das Essen warteten, fing es an zu regnen, sodass wir beschlossen, in den Innenraum des Lokals zu gehen. \nDie Einrichtung drinnen war sehr ansprechend gestaltet und ehe wir uns hingesetzt hatten, kam auch schon unser Essen. Es waren wirklich sehr gro\xc3\x9fe Portionen und ich freute mich sehr darauf. Leider wurde ich jedoch nach ein paar Bissen etwas entt\xc3\xa4uscht. Die Currywurst war zwar gut, h\xc3\xa4tte aber nicht sooo sehr angebraten werden m\xc3\xbcssen. Dadurch wurde der Geschmack ein wenig verdorben. Zu meiner Currywurst gab es noch einen Haufen Pommes. Obwohl ich einen guten Appetit hatte, war die Portion doch etwas zu gro\xc3\x9f f\xc3\xbcr mich, sodass ich meine Freunde bat, mir zu helfen. Das Ergebnis war dann, dass ich meinen Teller leer hatte, meine Freund hingegen bei ihren letzten Bissen kapitulieren mussten.\nDer Preis ist f\xc3\xbcr das Essen in Ordnung. Die Sauberkeit im Laden ist nebenbei gesagt gut. \nInsgesamt habe ich einen positiven Eindruck erhalten. Eine unbedingte Empfehlung ist es aber nicht.'

S"Hoocha wawa.  My take-away heaven. Fresh, simple and hot! The curry leaf in Bruntsfield is so unlike the standard take-aware fare that it deserves it's own yellow pages category.  I don't stray too much up and down the menu these days, sticking with the gourmet jalfresi and a brace of chapati. It's damn hot, but gets those endorphins screaming.  What's more it's licensed to sell beer so you're never going to get caught out at home sucking an ice cube and crying like a baby when you've chewed through a chilli. Portions are big, but probably match the price. I'm not a huge fan of the rice-the first couple of times I ordered i felt I had to have it, but I think it's better with a couple of chapatti now.\nI'm going to keep on coming back until my chilli gland shrivels and dies and leaves me to korma hell."

I'm beginning to think Yelp ratings are useless for chains like this, because we were ALMOST scared away by the 2.5. But a McDonalds is a McDonalds, how bad could it be?\n\nWell, we were very pleasantly surprised. Everyone was super friendly (like legitimately nice people friendly), and our order was correct and really good. Sometimes you get a dry burger, or old fries...everything was hot, fresh, and delicious. It really hit the spot, and we at least learned the lesson that there's no point looking at Yelp reviews for McDonalds. Ironic that I'm now writing one :p"

I suppose it\'s acceptable if you\'re planning a large party for starving people.\n\nThis review is based on a specific order. Some of my lovely coworkers ordered boneless hot and boneless garlic wings for lunch.\n\nSee my uploaded picture of what they received. \n\nThat\'s right. Breaded chicken breast (cut in halves) with some red-hot dumped on top. Talk about lazy! Moreover, the garlic boneless "wings" tasted like chicken-flavored salt.

S'Noodle Express has your regular, generic, Americanized menu of the same old Chinese food you get anywhere.   \n\nI gave them 5 stars because their buffet is extraordinary REAL Chinese food.  Call first; I think the buffet\'s only on weekends for dinner.  I stopped in yesterday for the first day of the buffet and everything was amazing.  Mussels were fresh, delicious, and cooked perfectly, not a spec of sand any where, no old fishy taste.  My wife asked about the crab and the lady said, "It\'s walking, and you chop it, and you cook it."   The duck was so tender it melted like butter.  The beef stomach was wonderful, soft and tender.  There were some tamer options on the buffet  that were still good like pork sausage in egg, but if you\'re afraid of real food there\'s always the generic Chinese Menu.\n\nThere were things that I couldn\'t tell if were animal, vegetable, or fungus; all I know is that they were delicious.  The staff didn\'t speak very good English, so it was difficult to find out what everything was.  I really hope they keep/expand the buffet because the only way I\'m going to get real Chinese food this good is if I travel to China.'

Well this new location isn't going to be opened for a year so in the mean time they decided to take it to the streets and experiment a bit.  He told me that their menu would be constantly changing. \n\nI have only eaten here once and I was blown away.  It was cheap enough that my wife and myself pretty much ordered everything on the small menu and the one thing I didn't order the guy threw in, awesome.  I might have had the most delicious mac and cheese ever, just a very simple, very cheesy mac and cheese covered in a in bacon streusel.  How about a brat covered in cheese sauce and caramelized onions and set in a very fresh and soft pretzel bun, BOOM!  I didn't have any desert though but I can't wait to try it after reading others reviews.  \n\nListen up you other food truckies, this is what it is supposed to be about.  A FEW items done extremely WELL but sold out of a food truck so it is CHEAP.  That is the winning formula.  The novelty of eating at a food truck wears off quick so you have to offer more.  In fact your food has to be BETTER than what we can get elsewhere because we have to drive the F%#$ about to find you and eat it in 110 degree heat on a damn curb.  Slider truck led the way (even though they aren't exactly cheap I guess)  and these guys nailed it too.       \n\nDo yourself a favor and hunt these guys down, it's worth your time and money."

The drive-through is kind of slow, and I always feel extremely rushed even if there isn\'t anyone behind me. I think they can slow down a bit...'

S"What a fun place to hang out at the Westin Kierland.  Waltz & Weiser Saloon had something for everyone.  In our case it was drinks for the adults, shuffleboard and the rest of the resort for the kids and food for everyone.  Even billiards.  It's a little hard to find.  From the lobby you have to go through the lobby bar, down the stairs toward the golf course, then take a left just before you get outside and go almost to the end of the hallway.  Unlike the rest of the Westin, it's dark and cave-like.  A little more informal and comfortable.  Like the rest of the Westin, we had excellent service and pretty good food at premium resort prices in the upscale resort atmosphere.   Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a place to relax for a couple hours."

S"If you are looking for a place to buy your lunch in the Haymarket area then you can't go wrong by coming in here.  As a lunch time stop it ticks all the boxes and will guarantee a pleasant and of course most importantly a tasty lunchtime - quite frankly what more can you demand of a shop.\n\nThe prices here are very reasonable for what you are getting and you'll be able to mix and match to suit your taste which is always a nice touch.  The only problem here is that it can get quite busy during the busy parts of the middle of the day - it's a bit of a victim of its own success in this respect - so give it plenty of time in peak hours when you think it might be busy.  I've never heard of anyone with anything bad to say about this shop and I'm sure the same will apply to you when you give it a try."

I would be tempted to give it another go, but there are just so many other good places to eat in the Bruntsfield area.\n\nSo, this review is really just about the drinks and ambiance.\n\nBisque is A-OK.  It's totally fine.  The staff are actually quite nice with a cheeky edge which is great, the drinks are completely fine if maybe a bit on the expensive side, and the ambiance... well it's reasonably beige but it's completely fine.\n\nI hear that this used to be an old man's pub.  I really like old man's pubs.  Sure trendy places are good too, but I think ambiance tends to suffer when a place is neither quaint nor trendy... it just becomes... well as I said, beige.  \n\nBisque is a completely acceptable place to go for a drink Friday after work, but it's not somewhere I would seek out for the fun of it."

The kids making your sub never seem to know what they are doing. The owner is constantly yelling at the sandwich artist as they make your sandwich.  It is shocking to see the owner treat his employees in this manner in front of customers. The owner is strange and aloof and not customer service oriented.  \n\nThere are plenty of Subways in Vegas, stay away from this one.

The lady pulled out two cups from a freezer that had frozen ice cream in them and popped them in the microwave. (A little odd if you ask me. Not exactly "hand scooped and hand made" as the ads would indicate.)\n\nThen when she had thawed the ice cream enough she pulled them out of the microwave and mixed the chocolate and the malt into them. \n\nWhen she served them they were way below the cup line. Looked like almost half of the product that was supposed to be in them. My wife and I asked about it and the girl said: "We can\'t put more than eight ounces in the cup." \n\nWe shrugged and took the malts and sat down. \n\nAbout halfway through my malt I decided to go to the Carl\'s Jr. website to see the actual serving size. \n\n14.6 ounces and NOT 8 ounces. \n\nI asked for the manager. She confirmed that the product size was only eight ounces. I then showed her on the Carl\'s Jr. site that the serving size was SUPPOSED to be 14.6 ounces. She shrugged and said that was what the owner told them to do and I asked for his name. She wouldn\'t give it to me. \n\nI informed her that they were ripping off their customers and that we would let Carl\'s Jr. corporate office know about it.\n\nI\'ve eaten at other Carl\'s Jr. locations with no problems but this particular store on Jewel should be avoided like the plague!'

S'Let\'s be honest for a moment. When I drove by and noticed this new resto location, I checked online to see what they have to offer and the first thought in my head was.... 90ies sitcom "Fresh Prince of Belair" and the Fresh Prince\'s favorite food place.... "Rasco\'s Chicken & Waffles"\n\nMy wildest dreams have come true.\n\nThis past weekend, I went in and grabbed a couple of large boxes of chicken, waffles and store made potato chips and burnt a few red lights to get home ASAP.\n\nSo, what is the verdict?\n\nHELL YEAH!\n\nWhile the chicken rotisserie isn\'t exceptional (I felt they were a bit too cooked and the skin suffered a bit) it was still really good. I personally didn\'t like their in-house dip (tasted like ranch, I hate ranch!!!) but the honey mustard was out of this world. They also have other spicier dips but that\'s not how I like my grub.\n\nWhat really sold me were the waffles and the chips. The waffles were expertly done and along with the variety of dips available such as chocolate, maple syrup and English cream one cannot complain... until there\'s no more waffles that is! The potato chips are made in-house and "large" is a really generous portion that can feed at least half a dozen people. We really loved them. They didn\'t survive.\n\nThe price-tag is quite reasonable and the food is prepared relatively quickly.\n\nOne can easily compare this to an Americanized KFC and I see myself more likely coming back here than KFC simply because everything was great.'

The operator (sounds Hispanic or White) answers" I\'m sorry sir, we cancelled the order due to the fact we no longer carry that type of pizza."

Is double diamond a 49er's bar? \n\nAnyway, the food took a little while to come out, but it was fantastic. Everything was just as good as you hope southern classics should be. Fried chicken was well seasoned, nicely crisp skin, juicy. Mac and cheese was RFG (really fantastically good). Collard greens were perfect. Yams were awesome. I would have preferred regular cornbread to the fried corn egg roll thing, but my kids all ate it just fine.\n\nDrawbacks would be that I wouldn't want to eat in that place-do takeout, and the bar does seem a little depressing to me."

A wagon ride to a prepared campsite, roasting hotdogs and s'mores and a beautiful sunset ride back.

S'When this place first opened - I don\'t want to think about how many years ago - it was a relatively "upscale" place to go for lunch.  We went there for lunch, and occasionally dinner.  The food was always great.  \n\nWithin a few years the food was... fine.  So we stopped going.  Every now and then we\'d go to the bar - it was in the neighborhood and all.  And the dance floor could be fun, and if the DJ was ok that night, you could have a good time.  \n\nI hadn\'t been there in at least 6 years, but the other night I was back on that side of town and was in a crowd of folks who "still wanted to do something" but they weren\'t willing to really drive more than 5 minutes.  (They considered this totally reasonable by the way.  How in the world did I ever get out???)  So once folks started talking about where the nearest Denny\'s was, or how there was a NEW Village Inn they could try - I volunteered Lagerfields.  It took a few minutes - but they were convinced.  \n\nGood things about Lagerfields - 1) Full menu until 10pm.  After 10 you can still get deserts and most of their appetizers.  In this part of town that\'s big.  2) Because they are a restaurant during the day, it\'s never hard to find a table.  Well, that and because the crowds just aren\'t packing it in over there... 3) It wasn\'t a bad time.  There was a decent cover band the night we went.  Between sets they played some muzak that was pretty cool for the crowd - we sang along to a few good 80\'s tunes together.  \n\nSo, is this your destination location?  Heck no.  But, if you\'re ever in the area, and you have a group of friends that you just want to sit and talk with while in a bar setting, it\'s not the worse option in the area.  \n\nAnd it beats the heck out of Village Inn.'

We peeked in the window and saw that it seemed to be a low-key kind of place, so we tried it. And, as Barry said, the food surprised us. My teenagers had pasta, which was very good, and I ordered osso bucco, which was actually delicious, and we all had a nice fresh and colorful salad. My impression was that the food is like good home cooking. The vibe is great if you are not looking for a sophisticated experience. There was a hockey game playing (silently, thankfully) on the TV, my son struck up a conversation with one of the cooks who kept coming out to check the score, and the waiter was attentive, professional and pleasant.

Because of the fact, that the food is no longer good, I come here maybe like once a year. Well, when I went in there at the end of July, I order the original chicken sandwich and it was overcooked and burnt. It was not worth eating it because the lettuce was brown as well. I took it back and the manager gave me an attitude and said I was wasting food. How am I wasting food when I paid for it? She did not want to give me my money back and after arguing, they made me a new sandwich. it was still gross and with brown rotten lettuce and a nasty burnt chicken patty.

I ordered the rice, tofu, carrots, pineapple, and corn bowl (which didn\'t come in a bowl at all). They give you plenty of rice, and a good helping of the meat, in my case tofu (they were in large chunks). For the sauce, I chose the Pineapple ginger. I mixed it all up and it was ok, not too flavorful. I crunched up the "chips" that came with it to add something to the meal, but still didn\'t work. I finally broke down and added 2 packets of soy sauce, which seemed to liven it up a bit. I chose the tofu because I didn\'t want anything too heavy on the seasonings, but I felt like they didn\'t season the tofu enough. You could definitely taste all the ginger in everything (believe me, ginger is in just about everything there), but it can be toned down a little. \n\nNext time I go back, I will try the pork or chicken....'

S"It is a weirdly configured McDonalds, no question about it; but I don't believe that is really a factor here.  Just be mindful that if you are going in, the doors are located on the sides and if you take drive-thru you have to circle the building at least once then exit by taking at least one u-trun back onto South Boulevard.\n\nThe location is relatively clean in the dining area and drink station; I don't know about the kid area though.  The speed of service is somewhat slower than the average McDonalds (both front and drive-thru); the front associate automatically will assume people are on-the-go, so typically no trays.  \n\nHowever, what makes this a one-star is the food quality.  Typically anything fried at this location is going to be both burnt and greasy (this includes hash browns, fries, apple pies, McNuggets, etc.).  The burgers are also surprisingly greasy as well.  And the levels of salt are surprising as well.  Probably the only bright spot is that the McCafe drinks were on par.\n\nOverall, this is not a McDonalds location to go to, just go down the next exit."

I mean $.75 cents for a full side order of noodles you can't beat that I said! Well then I finally got to sit to enjoy my meal and wow the chicken is so bland, flavorless and the wonderful deal with the noodles not so wonderfully at all they just taste like boiled pasta. So I drenched the pasta and the chicken with sauce and Siracha in hopes that it would add flavor yeah no, my mouth is on fire and it still tastes bland. The only good thing was the rice, yeah the rice cause I mean there is so much science in making white rice, right! Since I'm not for putting my mouth on fire again I won't eat there again."

Everything I've tried has been tasty. I recommend the iced cappuccino. The best I've ever had, puts all the others to shame.\n\nI am, as previously stated, not a coffee shop enthusiast by any means so my opinion may not be as educated as some, but to me this a four star coffee shop for someone with a two star wallet and a one star appetite (due to the somewhat small portions).

S'I would just like to preface this by saying that I have worked in the restaurant/food industry for the last 15 years.  Jimmy John\'s sandwiches are ok, nothing stupendous.  Their sign says "free smells" but all I can smell are cleaning products.  Every time I have been in this establishment (approximately 3 times, I have a friend who swears by the place), there are way more employees than customers.  They clean non-stop, which isn\'t a bad thing in terms of it being a very clean place.  However, they are always noisily pulling out tables and chairs, standing on chairs cleaning lamps, and other incredibly distracting things.  If I am trying to talk to someone and eat, it is hard to do when all I hear are the 15 employees talking and tables scraping across the floor.  Also, most of the employees that work the registers are not very genuinely friendly.  It seems like a forced effort, as though talking to you is the last thing they want to be doing.  We\'ll see how long they stay in business, but if they don\'t change some things, I can\'t imagine it will be long.'

The gentleman who took my order was very polite and got the order 100% correct. When I got to my worksite I had determined that the chicken nuggets that I ordered were cold. My work site with less than a quarter of a mile from this McDonald's and there is no reason for the nuggets to be that cold that quick. I did try several of them and all of them tasted as it had been sitting out for a while and were not fresh. I ended up throwing out all of the food that I lost my appetite due to the taste of the nugget. I am relatively sure that this is because it's the graveyard shift and is only two employees inside that McDonald's. I will not be going back to that Restaurants in the near future."

S"I give this location 3 out of 5 stars for the following reasons:\n\n1.  The owner/manager is a fun person, always friendly and comes out and greets you while you are eating, asks how everything is, and at no other Qdoba have I seen this.  This alone would have earned it 4 stars.\n\n2.  The food is 90% of the time delicious (the other 10% only subpar, and never because the food isn't good, but mostly because it's due to going there during their busiest times, meaning the food is thrown together in a rush, that is all), and they do have good options for vegetarians such as myself and my husband (except I do get irritated when they ASSUME we want meat AFTER we tell them we want a vegetarian burrito or a veggie quesodilla).  This alone would have gotten them 3 stars.\n\n3.  The location of this particular Qdoba, quite honestly, sucks.  The parking lot is small, you can only turn out of it one way (almost always the way we DON'T want to be going haha), but there is a back way out.  However, this back way leads to what looks like a one way street (only 1 car can fit, the parking stalls are all slanted one way) but people always try to turn down it when you are trying to make your own way through, causing traffic backups.  All in all, I still go here, but NEVER during the typical lunch hour (so not between noon and 1:30ish) or typical dinner hour (not as bad as the lunch one, though!).  If you do, you probably won't get a parking spot, and you'll either have to park way on the other side on the street and walk there or find somewhere else to eat a quick lunch.  When it isn't packed, this location is quite convenient and has a overall friendly atmosphere. This alone gets the location 2 stars.\n\nAll in all, I love this Qdoba more than the rest; the manager I mentioned always recognizes us and goes out of his way to treat us well, but the location needs to be much better."

S"I found this cafe/pub after wandering past the many kilt and celtic jewelry shops on the Royal Mile relatively early one Saturday morning.  I was on a mission to try Scotland's legendary (and rather intimidating) haggis, and since Rabbie Burns featured a Scottish breakfast complete with haggis AND fried egg, I was immediately sold.  Wandering into the quaint, primarily wooden interior, I was greeted with smiles and urged to sit wherever I liked.  I chose a seat by the window to maximize people watching.\n\nOrdering was extremely efficient and easy as I already knew I wanted to try the Scottish breakfast (~$7).  A mug of tea (~$1) was presented by the cheerful waitress, and the breakfast platter quickly followed.  I had 3 rashers of bacon (extra crispy like I asked), 1 sausage, 1 portion of haggis, 1 fried egg, 1 tomato, a small lake of baked beans and 1 flap jack.  Firstly, the haggis did not look anything like I pictured.  I was expecting an alarmingly intact stomach full of ground organs.  Instead, the pile of haggis looked rather like smashed falafel balls.  In fact, it tasted rather like a palatable hybrid of sausage and falafel.  I'm not sure if it was the real deal, but I liked it.  It was especially good with runny egg yolk and flap jack.  Everything was delicious, and I made quick word of the platter.  \n\nPARTING THOUGHT: Are there really enough tourists to support all the kilt shops on the Royal Mile?"

My bf and I waited 10-15 min before we got a table, and that was good for an extremely busy Saturday morning. I really enjoyed my hot chocolate, it was rich and tasty. My bf's smoothie tasted non diluted, not overly sweet and fresh. And of course, there were the cats! We sat near Gustave, a cat that was lounging around near our table at the corner. I really liked the fact that this cat cafe had nooks and crannies/crevices for for the cats to hide and sleep in. \n\nMy only complaint is that our food took FOREVER to get to your table. I think more than 45 min. It was crazy. I thought they forgot about us. However! My cat lady sandwich was excellent and the salad was tasty. It was a healthy menu and I appreciated that and the portion size not being too much. Nothing I hate more than huge huge portions.\n\nI would visit again for sure!

The tuna entree came out cold; not even lukewarm. The "Mediterranean" topping on the tuna (described as tomatoes, feta and olives) was just olives. The tomato cucumber salad was soggy as though it had been prepared many days ago and left to sit.

We went for fish as proclaimed to be the best in the area by one award or another. A small home town place with a long bar and booths on the opposite wall. The decor was old, tattered and torn. Although we were seated as soon as we came in our server was delayed in getting our drink order and bringing menus. This was not really her fault as she was the only server for both the bar and the tables, the place was full.\n\nI had the fish sandwich & Bev had the fish on a plate. Bev was also excited to order Haluski as a side. The fish was excellent in both orders. Delicious batter and cooked properly. My fries were cold but other than that the meal was great and price appropriately.\n\nWarning this a smoking permitted establishment so if that bothers you be forewarned. It usually does not bother us but on this occasion a patron came up to talk to the bartender / server with a smoke in his hand and paused by our table to converse with her for several minutes. \n\nSo the food gets 5 stars and the service atmosphere get 2 stars.

S"I lived in Chicago for 5 years before I moved to Vegas. While in Chicago, I was Educated on A Few Things, including what a hot dog can really be. A good dog is not about being perfect, or about being fancy; it's about the balance. The crunch, the sweet, the salt, the tang, that moment when the casing snaps between your teeth and the dog juices mingle with the neon relish and the tomatoes and the celery salt....It's a bite that takes you back to being nine. It's ballparks and summer break and the first time you rode your bike to seven eleven with five whole dollars of your own to spend on early onset diabetes. \n\nSo here's what you want to order; Chicago Style. Vienna Red dog, on a poppyseed bun, Tomatoes, mustard, neon green relish, sport peppers, mustard. Just order it, and eat it, and if you don't like it, you probably need to learn to relax. I suggest riding bike. Possibly with a card in the spokes. \n\n5 Stars because these taste just like the Wiener's Circle in Chicago. Ballparks. Bikes. Summer. \n\nThe only difference between this place and it's Chicago contemporary is the lack of insults. If you are familiar with Wiener's Circle Chicago, and do not love being called a variety of horrible fucking names while you order your pussy ass fucking dog, you don't have to deal with that here! \n\nI sort of miss it, but you can't fake the kind of attitude the wonderful, spirited women of the south side put on, and I'm pretty sure I'd be furious if they tried to fake it. \n\nIn conclusion; Celery Salt and Vienna Beef Dogs. There's a psuedo urban legend of Irving. Google it. I think This American Life or Radiolab did a bit on Irving. Supposedly Irving was an older gentleman that guided the Vienna Beef Sausages through the old factory, and when Vienna Beef opened a new factory, he retired...and the sausages tasted /wrong/. So Vienna Beef had to recreate the old process, and realized that Irving's Path through the factory infused the sausages with a rich and delightful flavor that makes them special, and then was forced to re-design their entire new factory to allow for the Irving Factor. \n\nTHAT is the kind of history and flavor you are a part of with a chicago dog from Wiener's Circle. Go eat one. For Irving."

S"Really missed the old Seoul Jung restaurant so when we heard that a new Korean restaurant opened in the same space we had to try it.\n\nThe decor is the same.  We sat in our usual table with the BBQ grill built in.  The menu was drastically different but that was expected.  Prices were a bit on the high side.  Kalbi was $22.95 and Bulgoki was $15.95 for cook at the table.  We always get cook at the table as it just seems to taste better.\n\nWas quite impressed with the number of side dishes.  They had at least ten (and miso soup) which is above average for Korean places that I have been to.  The kimchi, eggplant and potato were our favorites.  The fishcake side was disappointing though.\n\nThere was a problem with our table grill.  Couldn't get it to stay lit.  But they brought out a small portable unit and after a brief transition we were cooking.\n\nThe amount of meat provided was better than expected.  We got two full large rib bones which is pretty good.  The two entree's were more than enough for three people and we had enough to take home.\n\nSadly, no rice punch or oranges or even gum for an after meal cleanser.\n\nWe will probably be back.  I think the Takamatsu on Elliot and Arizona Ave is just as good."

The food was a letdown.\n\nHad the mussel app and for $10 it came with 12 PEI mussels in a decent broth. But they tasted bad like the previous review indicated. Eeeh.\n\nThe baked brie was nothing particularly inspired. The salads were ok.\n\nSandwiches came with a gratin of very thinly sliced potatoes with a cheese (asiago?). But it was not baked long enough and tasted somewhat raw. My daughters's wine braised beef sandwich was a mediocre and she didn't finish it, which is unusual for her.\n\nThe shaved turkey with cranberry chutney and smoked gouda sandwich was, however, extremely good. Three of use loved ours.\n\nI sent the coffee back as it tasted like instant and was, IMHO, undrinkable. The desserts were good, but small for the price. The pound cake with creme-de-cassis would have better with a good cup of coffee, but still was enjoyable.\n\nAll in all we spent $110 for 4 sandwiches, 4 small salads, 2 appetizers, and 3 desserts with water. And while Creme-de-cassis is one of my favorites, I think you can easily find a better meal nearby."

S"I was brought here for lunch.  The place is located in the tallest building in Pittsburgh, The Steel Tower, so it seems pretty fancy from the outside and when you walk in.  It's got a huge, modern looking dining room and was packed for lunch.  I was really hungry, so of course I went for a hoagie.  I ordered their Godfather hoagie ($10.95).  It comes with sopressata, capicolla, prosciutto, pepperoni, mozzarella, roasted red peppers, lettuce and tomato.  Of course I ordered it with fries, but you can also get a side of veggies or the starch of the day (which was baked potato).  When the sandwich arrived it was a good size, they put the leaf of lettuce and the two slices of tomato on the side, the bread was like a french baguette. I think it was way too thick for sandwich bread, it just got in the way of the meat. There was lots and lots of meat, then a big slab of roasted red pepper and cheese melted on it.  I am not a fan of big slabs of roasted red pepper, so I removed that.  I basically just ate the meat and cheese and fries.  I deconstructed the hoagie.  It was trying to be too fancy for me.  I like a plain ol' sub roll, stuffed with meat and cheese and shredded lettuce and tomato.  All my dining partners got burgers, which didn't look that great to me either.  I won't go back unless I have no choice."

I literally live across from mandarin express, and have always been skeptical about giving it a try. Parents were in town and suggested Chinese food for dinner. I was extremely lazy that day and figured I should try mandarin express since it was only seconds from my house.\n  \nThe place is very small, and looked closed because they never have the doors open. Don't get discouraged, and try it! I was actually surprised at how good the food was. Since the place is not busy, they make everything fresh right after ordering. Along with great food, I found the lady there to be very nice (she's not too fluent in eng, however she was very nice).\n  Will be going here from now on to get my Chinese food."

They sell soft baguettes for reasonable prices, with a decent amount of toppings. The fillings themselves are rated highly by me - it's not the kind of place where they dollop the mayo on in an overzealous fashion.\n\nA lunch in here will fill you up without making you feel bloated. I'd rather take my business here than to any Baguette Express or Subway since it's that bit better. No complaints, and very handy for people commuting from Haymarket Station!"

We knew it wasn't a coincidence as we would all order completely different items but within half an hour of eating our lunch, everyone who ordered would be feeling slightly ill. Because of this, we decided as a group to not get delivery from here anymore. We just figured it was a spice or something that wasn't agreeing with us as the food always looked great when it arrived. \n\nA few weeks after this decision, I saw that someone had posted a review regarding a large order their office placed and the obvious mold spots on the food. They posted pictures along with an account of how Johnny reacted to their pointing it out. (see filtered reviews). \n\nAfter seeing the pictures of the moldy food, it clicked in my head why my office mates and I always felt queasy after eating. I was beyond horrified to say the least. \n\nI really like Johnny as he is  a champ on the phone and always gave us GREAT  service but I just can't eat their food again after seeing those mold photos and after my office experienced the stomach issues. \n\nGoodbye Greenway Deli :("

That location is simply more charming, and the couple who owns it are especially nice. Having said that, there is nothing wrong with this location, although the more I frequent this one, the more I realize that their customer service here is somewhat hit or miss. Sometimes you will get a pleasant young man, other times a surly young lady who clearly doesn't know how to smile or greet people at work. Happy Wok, take notes. Put the aces in their places! \n\nThe SouthTown location is an excellent choice for vegetarians, and anyone else with a dietary concern, as they will make it however you ask. This Wok, however, is not very helpful in that department. All the order takers here act annoyed when requests are made, and only sometimes do they follow thru, so do not be afraid to be very, very clear!  \n\nThis location has a drive thru, which is a novelty, and, well, awesome. All in all, this is a solid location with a reputation for fresh food and good prices. They are consistently 3 stars behind the SouthTowne Happy Wok in customer service(which gets 5 stars), however, and, as much as I like this location, I have to recommend they be stricter with some of their workers. Only the friendly ones should be up front! Not smiling? Put 'em out of sight, guys!"

My family ordered pollo a la brasa (Rotausarie chicken) with excellent taste! Accompanied with a side of white rice and beans, lomo saltado (meat w/ French fries and white rice) excellent taste! The fish ceviche was different than what we are use to but with great taste! For dessert we had picarones that look like mini donuts but they are made of sweet potato and platanos Fritos (fried sweet banana) both very good! To drink my husband order chicha morada (made of purple corn) and he loved the taste. I preferred the maracuya which I believe is made of passion fruit. Excellent!!! Very refreshing.

Really really good.  Never too crowded in my experiences during normal lunch hours.  Staff are pleasant but not overly talkative.\n\nAnother reviewer gave parking 2 stars.  Not sure why - I\'ve never had any problem with parking a few spots away from the front door.\n\n2 things bother me, but neither enough to get me to not come back once a month:  1)  It\'s an old gutted Pizza Hut that is long overdue for a re-haul of the interior.  2) It\'s on Independence.  Making a U-Turn on Independence, at least in certain stretches, is nearly impossible for miles on end.  Just not very easy for me to get to regularly.'

S"Ah, ye old half star debate. Really, I think this place deserves 3.5 stars - definitely not a 3 but not ready for a 4 yet. But I want to give it positive vibes, as I think that the Birdcage is a fab addition to Musselburgh. If you can find it, that is. Be warned, it's off the main drag, in a semi-industrial estate (it's a converted cotton mill) and in the dark, an absolute bugger to find (first road on the left by the job centre, folks). I had all but given up when I saw my friend run out of her car, so followed her into a pedestrian quadrant where the Birdcage sat. \n\nIt's a very modern bar and restaurant, serving pretty modern dishes that are really rather unheard of in this town. Balsamic roasted beetroot with goats cheese and rocket salad? How on earth does that fit in with the local chippy? I don't think it does, but really, honestly and truly not a bad thing. Sadly, said salad didn't have the flavour I was expecting, the beetroot and rocket both overpowered by the cheese, and the vinegar didn't carry over any flavour at all, so I was a little disappointed, although overall it was a pleasant salad. \n\nMy main was a gnocchi (home made by the looks of it) with wild mushroom, drizzled with truffle oil. A little greasy for my liking, but I find mushroom dishes to be generally more greasy, so you can take that comment with a pinch of salt. My friend's angus burger and chips looked fabulous, and meaty (both chips and burger). \n\nWe both went all out with dessert - chocolate fondant for her, and sticky toffee pudding for me. Not something I normally order, but damn, the flavours were outstanding, with toffee and cinammon screaming out. Sponge itself was a little dry. \n\nSo you can probably see why this is a 3.5 star. Although the food was good, it wasn't amazing or hit the level of sophistication that this place is striving for. However, I don't want Birdcage to fail - perhaps, as it hasn't been open too long, it just needs to stretch its wings out a little more and will improve in time. I think that now that I have the option of old mans pub or trendy bar in my hometown as well, that I will be definitely back to drink some more here too, beats a bus ride into Edinburgh on a dark wintery night."

S'Clearly a great addition to the Indian Land restaurant scene, especially as it really is a sit-down place to eat with a full bar and onion rings.\n\nHave been at least six times having eaten breakfast once, lunch twice and dinner three times.  Menu is good, soup of the day as an option, generous salads (even their side salad which is more than enough), pizza (where you can ask for thin crust), dinner and lunch plates and...\n\nReally GREAT onion rings.  These crusty donuts from the lily family are not out of a bag or some other frozen source, but done in their kitchen from scratch.  They are wide, but thin, some kind of maybe pan-co breading and nicely fried.  When you get them as a side, say with a burger, someone, most likely you, will exclaim, "oh my" or words to that effect.  They are impressive both on the plate and traveling through your mouth.\n\nFried green tomatoes are available as appetizer, salad and as a sandwich.  I think you could also get them as a side with your burger.  Don\'t know but they could have named Reagan\'s Fried Green Tomatoes or Fried Green Maters. \n\nService is excellent, prices reasonable, there are TVs and did I mention the onion rings?\n\nBar is the real thing, so order what you want, like Gin Marys with breakfast or tea with a shot in cold weather or one of their drafts.'

Like I'll order a delivery again!\n\nI asked for a refund (reasonable given the circumstances) and, when pushed about the temperature of the food, I was told they would send a fresh order straight away & I would get 20% off the NEXT order.  They're REALLY not getting it, eh.\n\nQuite frankly, as bad an experience as I've ever had.  A true measure of a company is how they handle things when they inevitably go wrong.

Softspoken and pleasant, Francine is exactly the type of employee I'd want if I ran a fast food place.  She has to deal with surly tourists and travelers all day long but she had a smile on her face and she is genuinely great at what she does.\n\nThe food took awhile but my Whopper was appealingly prepared (the way I wanted it...no pickles or onions!) and the fries were hot and crisp.  \n\nWhat more can you ask for?

So many Mustache puns can be had.\n\nI went with a cappuccino, paid at the cash and sat down on the very large community table where a dozen patrons or so can sit down and enjoy their orders. There are also many smaller tables around the bigger table if you're the introverted type. The Cafe is small but the environment is warm and intimate. The decorations on the wall are obviously coffee related with the possibility of purchases such as coffee beans, coffee equipment and so forth.\n\nThe Cafe offers a variety of coffees and treats that was duly noted by my part for future visits. Everything is... well Mustache related and looked good. \n\nA few minutes later I got my cappuccino and I'll admit, it was quite excellent.\n\nWe sat down and chatted until we left, with the warm embrace of Moustache Cafe trailing behind us.\n\nOh and the FREE WIFI password is AMAZING."

KUDOS TO HIM!!!! HOWEVER the girl Elaina, not sure if thats her name she doesnt speak clearly... took our order 4 times. And still didnt get it right. She is a liar. And I will further elaborate but I wanted to express we are surprised the driver made it. We repeated the address 5 times and the phone number 6 times. She was short with me on the phone. We expressed the only reason we order from your store is for the cheese sauce. Which should be in the notes next to my name. THIS LIAR SAID SHE EVEN WROTE IT ON THE BOX AND BLAMED HER MISTAKE ON THE DRIVER ..... THE ONLY THING ON THE BOX IS A SMILIE FACE. AND IF I COULD INSTAGRAM THAT ON THIS SITE I WOULD TO FURTHER EMBARRASSE HER AND THE STORE. The driver did his job. She failed him by not doing her job. She exercised very poor communication skills. She spoke like we were some dam kid on the phone her only response was "I dont know; Ugh I. Just don\'t. Know".... I. Know how bout you place us on hold and find out! WE know it was a waste of our time but we called back to find out where the cheese sauce was and we knew after she gave us the run around the drive would have NO CLUE we\'re suppose to get some. So she needs fired or retrained if you think she is worth the investment. It is now 909pm and still no cheese sauce. Thats awful!'

I knew it wasn\'t going to be a good experience when I had to quickly swerve into the parking lot realizing that the place name had changed - or was no longer "Trailsend" and a large red, white, and black lettered sign proclaiming "Omega Coney Island Family Restaurant" outside.\n\nOf course it was Father\'s Day and it was packed.... and it was Sunday on top of that.  The hostess was really friendly - this is a type of place where you can walk in and they call you by your first name if you come here that often.  We waited about 5-10 minutes and were seated.\n\nOur waitress was nice and took our order - then it took about 30-40 min for the food to come out.  Granted the place was slammed, but I was noticing that the larger family groups were getting served before us - and were sat down after us.  It was just me and my mom so I don\'t know if it was a father\'s day thing or not, but man I was starving when the food finally came out.  I had the corned beef hash with 2 eggs... great flavor and eggs were cooked well.  It\'s a home-style corned beef hash that I wasn\'t used to and it was mixed in with hash browns which was a nice surprise.  \n\nHalfway into me digging into this large portion dish, the waitress came by and apologized that she gave me the wrong order.  I told her no problem and whatever I got was good anyway but she apologized profusely.  Later she came back and told me I did get the right thing and that she had just switched tickets with another table by accident.  Weird enough to think that you are eating someone else\'s food..... even weirder to not know what you are eating.  Oh well...\n\nPart of my mom\'s order was wrong, but at this point we were so hungry it didn\'t really matter.\n\nI will give this place another try since I am a breakfast fanatic.  But for now it\'ll get a 3 star from me.\n\nI did want to say that the food is the main attraction at this place... the actual building itself looks to be a bit dated and the inside is nothing to write home about.'

The service was quick because it was late, and the food tasted just fine. \n\nThe last time I went it was our last meal in Vegas and we wanted a sit-down dinner, but nothing too fancy. We ordered a round of drinks. The beer came with no glass, and the cap still on. My wine came in a single-serve bottle and the glass the waitress eventually brought me was wet. Surely it wasn't wet from being washed because when I wiped off the water with my napkin a bunch of brown stuff came off on it. Disgusting. We walked out. \n\nI won't go back unless there are no other options. On Freemont St., having no other options is really unlikely."

Today I took my dog into the dog groomers next door. I do not live in the area so I tried to kill time around the area. I came back to the area and I still had twenty minutes to kill... There's nothing in the plaza to sit down and relax at SO I found Long Wongs. It was about 4pm so I didn;t want a filling meal because, I had to cook dinner for my family... I had my two year old with me so, I asked for a kids meal.. The lady I believe they call mama looked at me and said that's it? I smiled and said yes. She got very rude with me and said you need to spend 4 more dollars for me to take your card. I said fine can I get a slice of pizza? She said Okay you don't want a drink? I said no I had a tea in the car. She sighed at me and took my card. She said is this to go? I said No, I will be eating here. She said I don't let people eat here unless they spend 10.00. I said are you kidding? She said no but, since we aren't busy I will let you sit down. I HAD A TWO YEAR OLD WITH ME IN 120 heat mind you! Wow! So... I was a little irritated needless to say but, it was better than waiting in the car in the beginning of July... When our food came out... i was appalled! My two slices of pizza looked like Dignornio.... My daughters corn dog was BLACK... and her fries... Were DISGUSTING so DISGUSTING... They were tasteless. We took a few bites threw it away and walked out. I will never ever ever go back to this place. You never know who is going to walk through your door as a business and your impression lasts... I own a store in the area... When they asked for a good quick bite to eat... it will not be long wongs.... I can't believe how we were treated and served. Sad!"

S"Food quality and flavour: 5-stars!!! Service and environment 2 stars!! So what's the average? I'll be generous, 4 stars. \n\nHere it goes!\n\nI remember a friend of mine trying out this restaurant with vouchers and highly recommended it. So I decided to try it out with another friend who has the taste card (two for one). He called them quite a few times on the phone but there was no reply. It was a surprise looking at their website: not updated since 2009? Really??? \n\nOn the plus side their glorious menu is available at Just-eat, so you can certainly be interested from there (no, there is no direct link for their website to Just-eat). I saw a gentleman going out with bags for delivery, and I think some people came in for take-away. \n\nThere we go, Friday evening after work, it's raining cats and dogs and we arrive at the restaurant. You can have a look at one of the Yelp pics: the titles on the windows look so old to me. \n\nThe waiter is friendly, letting us choose a table far from the door and he brings us the menus immediately. As we review the very-detailed menu, I notice an ant walking on the salt jar!!! I start making mental notes about my Yelp review... \n\nMy friend was more relaxed and removed the ant, and told me not to be harsh. Well, an hour later, we saw another ant walking on the wall behind my friend!! \n\nWe ordered the food: Ceylon lamb and vegetarian Malayan, both having coconut, with the second one being sweet as it includes pineapple. We were both so pleased and delighted with the food, forcing ourselves to eat it slowly to enjoy more along with a tasty garlic naan bread. Our Mixed Pakora was also of great quality with a special sweet and hot sauce that made the difference!! My friend who has tried lots of Indian restaurants in Edinburgh found it astounding! \n\nHowever it was another gentleman now serving us, who has been in that restaurant for less than a year, as he told us. \n\nAnd we started noticing his difficulties waiting for the other tables: there were big delays for some of them from the time they ordered till they got the starters. A couple must have been waiting for at least 15-20 mins (the guy hadn't manage to take their order yet), and they decided to go... \n\nMy advice: if you're a big curry fan, you need to try it!! If you value more the service than the food, you might want to think again. \n\nPersonally, I'm planning going back to try more!!"

The food is AMAZING not to mention visually appealing with short wait times for food. After a meal at Thai Sun I find myself craving the flavours their meals leave in my mouth for days. Although your typical menu item might cost $1-$2 more than it would at a competing Thai restaurant in Waterloo the quality makes up for it. The restaurant itself has a great aesthetic, although it can be alittle dim inside for me at times, and also features a very large patio for outdoor dining which is fantastic in the summer.\n\nAs a local to the area who frequents the various restaurants in Waterloo I highly recommend Thai Sun to anyone who loves good food. Make sure you try the curry; the panang is my personal favourite and if you get a chance to chat with the owner do it! He's great."

S'I don\'t understand the restaurant business these days. What\'s so difficult to figure out about the fact that if you want to open a fine dining establishment, you have to have fine food, and how can a place like this stay open? No, a stupid smokefish pate "compliments of the chef" does not count as an amuse bouche, especially if it\'s as uninteresting as this was with bought-in everything "flatbreads" (whatever you call those). No, you can\'t have a fine dining establishment with a menu designed so that any customer can pick any sauce with any available type of fish. That\'s one step up from a buffet. And no, you can\'t base your reputation on the freshness of your fish. If you\'re running a seafood restaurant, that\'s just a given.\n\nA chef designs fish dishes to work with each type of fish, and customizes the menu at least weekly based on what\'s available and in season. The specials should not be "this fish, that fish, and the other, prepared how you like it with your choice of the sauces on the menu". No, the specials should be individually designed to accentuate the wonderful, fresh, seasonal catch you got that morning (I doubt seasonal is in this restaurant\'s buyer\'s vocabulary anyway). What you have here is a kitchen full of cooks, and nothing more.\n\nThe server was annoyingly enthusiastic about everything on the menu. I was perturbed from the moment we walked through the door, but my fiancee and I were far too hungry and cranky to walk out and find something else. Our mistake. All I wanted was a crisp, hoppy beer and I would have been OK. I\'m not that hard to please, but all they had was imported piss lagers like Heineken, Amstel, the average selection of domestic piss lagers, and Bass was out. She had to go to the bar to find out that they had Anchor Steam; I was quite relieved. The wine list wasn\'t awful, but I wouldn\'t have found salvation there either, had they not come up with the beer I ordered.\n\nThe paella was pretty lackluster. Not the worst I\'ve had, but it would be pretty hard to stoop to Bahama Breeze\'s level. My mussels had not been de-bearded, and I bit into bits of sand in lots of my clams. Unacceptable at any restaurant, but at a seafood restaurant, just shameful.\n\nMy fiancee\'s cajun pasta was near flavorless, although red. I don\'t know how they got that color in there without any flavor. The shrimp in her dish were hammered; grainy and cooked beyond recognition.\n\nI don\'t know if the waitress was vying for tips, lying, or simply didn\'t have any taste in food, telling us what wonderful choices we had made. I should have played it safe and gotten fish and chips or a steak. Or walked right out after first glance at the menu. I would have been more satisfied with a can of spaghetti-Os (and $81 and change richer).'

I have passed by this place every day and not seen it till now. \n\nOnce inside I wad greeted well. The options are very straight forward but some how still confusing. I ordered a pizza. The guy slopped a lot of strange things around. He did not give me a full scoop of sauce. But they are gracious with the cheeses. As for the salmon on a pizza I was surprised by both that the server had never tried it and that it worked well with a lot of other dishes, say for the salad or pasta. Nevertheless they serve no alcohol but do have some select drinks like coconut water. He bedazzled me with how much basil he put on it. I think the amount wad a solid steel. My pizza has a nice crust with fine black marks that stain your fingers. You cannot eat this pizza with a plastic knife or fork so don't plan on it. Otherwise with the food great and the price not bad I sat down in plastic chairs. No booths in the whole place? The To-go section is great. Plates for serving but the napkins could use some help."

S"Firstly,  the two women students who currently work here are fine.  Anything that is lacking in their training is not their fault,  and they are perfectly nice.  I think they do their best,  and sometimes go above and beyond to be friendly. \n\nThat being said,  Charlies consistently provides some of the worst coffee and customer service I have ever experienced at a coffee shop.  The only reason I ever purchase anything at Charlies is out of absolute desperation. \n\nI'm constantly amazed at how bad the coffee is.  They use a  decent brand for beans,  so either the beans are old or the espresso and coffee machines have never been cleaned.  The drinks taste bitter and burned in a way even the darkest roast should not.  It is worse than break room coffee at a government job (which is to say that it is also worse than no coffee). \n\nThe fresh pastries are average,  and I appreciate the effort to have gluten free and vegetarian meals.  I have never had any of the sandwiches so I cannot speak to all of the food.  It would be wonderful to have some healthier snacks but that is probably asking too much. \n\nThe service is the true reason for the single star.  I cannot understand why there is only one person working during their busiest hours.  It regularly takes more than 15 minutes to get through a 3 person line,  and that does not count the time it takes to get your drink. Some of the employees are very rude,  and sneer at simple requests like for hot water or ice in your personal cup. Other employees who are more courteous are constantly overwhelmed by the amount of customers during peak hours. \n\nOh,  and the hours? Who knows what the are. I think they close at four, which is way too early for a LAW SCHOOL coffee shop where caffeine is in higher demand than adderall. \n\nWhen I have more than 10 minutes I always walk to Starbucks,  Dutch Brothers, The Well or any other place.  \n\nOk enough."

S'I\'m not quite sure of the name since they don\'t have a name on the building but its next to Harris Grill. They have posters that say "The Ave" and the checks they give out say "Stacked II". Went here during Equality on Ellsworth and aside from the worst service I ever had I would say the waitress sent a clear message that she was not interested in serving more than 1 table to become known as the "Flirt Table".  Never felt the need not to leave a tip but this was definitely my first experience where I did not leave one. We sat at a table outside to what we thought would be a great experience at a new place. The service or lack there of got worse the longer we stayed and the waitress was not shy about her dislike of us being there. 1) we politely flagged her down after she did not acknowledge us as she passed by our table more than a dozen times to give all of her attention and flirt with a table of gents (no biggie, flirt away, just don\'t ignore and be rude to all your other tables). 2) As it began to rain we rushed inside and grabbed a table. As we were walking in our waitress got to it before us and tried to save it for her "Flirt Table". She was irritated that we took the table before she could get the attention of the "Flirt Table" to get them inside. She abruptly moved away and did not ask if we needed anything. 3). After getting her "Flirt Table" inside and flirted and ignored the other tables some more she asked if we needed anything with as much disgust as I think I have seen a waitress or waiter able to muster. 4) Lastly, and my favorite part, her quickly bringing us our check. After dropping it off she showed up two minutes later and again as Pleasant as she was asked if it was all set despite us still having a pitcher of beer left.'

S'This place is pretty inconsistent.  Some meals are good, but others.. I\'ll get to that.  In general, most of the more complicated items on the menu are frozen and microwaved when you order.\n\nTheir breakfast offerings are not bad.  The breakfast burrito and breakfast pizza are both pretty cheap and reasonably filling.  In fairness, I have heard their grilled cheese and soup on Thursdays is good.  (I haven\'t had it myself.)\n\nThe lunch dishes are not as good; the options change each day.  The ones that are good are .. okay, and not that pricey for near campus.  The ones that are bad are pretty bad.\n\nThe nachos are alright - canned pickled jalepenos, diced up tomatoes, olives, thick tortilla chips, gloppy cheese.  There is a lot of it.  Not bad if you have a craving, but there are better options elsewhere.\n\nThe salsa and hummus plate\'s not bad for a snack.  Of what I have had here, I would recommend it most.\n\nThe hamburgers are gross.  They taste like school cafeteria low-grade meat and have the texture of frozen sausage patties.  My girlfriend\'s cheeseburger had a big piece of scorched .. something on top of the cheese.  Mmm.  The "albacore tuna with mango" sandwich is alright, but the mango is mixed in with the canned tuna, along with a lot of mayonnaise and relish.  There is not much mango to be found either.  (I\'ve noticed charred bits on the breakfast sandwiches too, which is baffling considering I think they are just microwaved.)\n\nFor sides: the low-fat cottage cheese just tasted off.  I have eaten a lot of cottage cheese and never had it taste like that - kinda chalky, kinda sour.  My girlfriend got the pasta salad, which was a little better, but swimming in vinegar with some pepperoni plopped down into it.  \n\nOur iced tea was very opaque and did not taste very fresh.  They charge for refills on soft drinks, too.\n\nService was alright, the kitchen guy is cheerful, but the food was unpleasant enough at my last lunch that I\'m not going back.  Within the same walking distance I can get to Derald\'s lunch truck and Espresso Royale - and I\'ve been much happier with the food at both.  Or Red Herring, or Bevier.\n\nIt is worth noting that I paid with gift certificates - none of my own money - and still felt disappointed at the cost of free.\n\nCan\'t comment on the baked goods, haven\'t had them.  What I hear is that the stuff made in house isn\'t great, but they get the cookies from elsewhere and they\'re okay.\n\nAlso, after hearing - from one of the staff - that they don\'t change out the coffee every day in the pots, I am knocking it down to one star.  Just, don\'t go here except maybe for the nachos.'

S'Don\'t waste your money.  Food was not fresh and there is not much of a selection.  A BOGO coupon got us die hard SWEET TOMATO fans to try Souper Salad again.  Paid $15 for lunch and were not impressed.  First the toddler high chairs were filthy, booster seat caked with food. Got my son settled and found the bathrooms to be dirty and out of paper towels. No spoons by the soup. No forks by the salad. There is no place to retrieve plates by the "hot bar" which had 2 potatoes, old selection of taco items and luke warm pizza. There was two pieces of bread sitting in the pan. The soups were cold and the ranch dressing was warm. Started looking around the restuarant and found that everything needs a good cleaning.  The plastic the sugar comes in was caked with food, so was the salt and pepper shakers.  I started to wonder how clean the prep area in the back was and how fresh the food really was.  Save your money.  Try Sweet Tomatoes instead - they are worth the drive if you are looking for a fresh selection.\nBTW - only two other couple were there - that should have been our first clue.'

S"went there for lunch with a friend of mine... all sick and ready to die... I hauled myself to Fat Daddy's for a nice breakfast. I didn't care for the line style of the resturant. It's like a fast food meets sit down resturant... I don't care for it. The menu is too vast for a line or a cashier. We needed some time to think and mow over our options. \n\nWe placed our order, I got the Grandma Laddies, I think, and my friend got the number two chicken meal. My meal came with: two pieces of bacon, one sausage, a waffle, two eggs, grits and a biscuit... what a meal! It was good... but not great. The eggs were fresh, I even saw the eggshells by the flat top behind the cashier. The grits were kinda watered down, but okay with some pepper. The waffle was good, I liked it - I dug the cinimmon sweetness to it. The bacon was thick and could have been cooked more throughily and the sausage was perfection. The biscuit was yummy and I wished I had honey to go with it. :)\n\nMy friend's meal didn't go so well... her chicken was very crispy and extremely peppery. Too peppery if you ask me. Then she took a good bite out of her chicken and discovered the meat was just pink and a vain was still bloody... ew. We told the waitress and she offered to have it recooked. She said that their chicken was cooked fresh. I'm willing to wait for freshly cooked food, but dang - that was way pink!!\n\nShe replaced it and even paid me back for her entire meal. That was a bit much! I wanted to refuse and we tried to leave but she insisted we stay. so we did and got like 4 pieces of free chicken for our trouble. That was awesome. I liked the meal, I'm not complaining... I just had better. I think I'll go back when I'm not sick and try it again."

Why, oh why, does it taste better when someone else crafts a sammie for you?\n\nI was looking for something quick to grab so I could watch the Nebraska game from my couch. This place is just minutes down the road, so I popped in this past Saturday.\n\nScanning all the sandwiches, I (as usual) couldn't figure out what I wanted. The guys behind the counter immediately jumped in to help. Really nice. They said their best sellers are the Italian (on the cold side) and the pressed turkey cordon bleu (on the hot side). Score, I already had my eye on the Italian. I got a small with chips and a drink for $8.55. \n\nThe Italian was loaded with meat. The toppings were fresh. Solid little place to get a sandwich. I'll be back to try that TCB. \n\nAlso, they have Cherry Coke. I don't drink a lot of soda, but when I see CC on the fountain... you can bet I'm ordering one."

S"Jack in the box eh? I have to agree with Chad; Jack in the box is worth a review. They have an item on the menu that I just can't get enough of. Call me crazy, but trust me on this. =) \n\nSo, every every Chinese restaurant here in Charlotte that I've tried has the worst, egg rolls in the history of egg rolls. They all seem to have the same bland flavor followed by a strange odor. Even the great House of Leng in which I enjoy oh so much has weird egg rolls. If I want a good egg roll, I will either go to a Thai restaurant or a Vietnamese restaurant. They are fresher and actually flavorful. \n\nIf a Vietnamese or Thai restaurant isn't in the vicinity of my cravings though, Jack in the Box is the next best thing. They offer crispy egg rolls, with plenty of meat. It isn't all filling and their sweet and sour sauce is much tastier then the traditional duck sauce offered at most Chinese places. As far as the meat in the egg roll, lol excuse my ignorance but its like a mystery meat for me. It's a white meat and I always thought it was chicken, but I think its pork. They can be purchased individually or in a three pack. \n\nAnother reason I praise Jack in the Box is because I and many friends practically lived off this place back in high school and college. They've had a dollar menu for quite a while and their two tacos for a dollar is the greatest deal in the world, especially after a late night of drinking. \n\nIf you've been searching for a good egg roll, look no further. Jack in the Box is the place to get em!!! I'm sure you have your reservations about it, but as you can see, they have a very eclectic menu. Their egg rolls are fantastic and I'm sure they won't disappoint. Please give them a try!\n\nDid I really just write a review on egg rolls? Yes sir I did! =)"

The food tasted pretty healthy, (mine and my boyfriend\'s) I ordered the couscous salad with strips of beef and dried up cherries while my boyfriend had a delicious turnip soup.  The service at first was great :friendly, welcoming. But then towards the end, one of the waiters was quite rude when I asked for the bill. He kept pointing to the bill and saying that was the bill several times. I was confused because there was no price on it, it just told me what I ordered. My boyfriend then told me I could pay at the cash. Um, why didn\'t the waiter just tell me to pay at the cash instead of wasting my time and continuously pointing to my bill and saying "That\'s the bill." Yes, I know that is the bill...Food was generally good though. Very healthy and tasteful. I give it three stars thanks to that weird waiter.'

S'Good food from an unassuming place.\n\nI had my meal here just before they closed up shop for renovations.  They\'ll be down a few weeks.\n\nMy wife and I started with some marinated olives.  They weren\'t served warm, which was a surprise, but they tasted good, and were still nice and firm.  I don\'t like mushy olives.\n\nI had the fish and chips.  They use pickerel (hooray!), which is abundant in nearby lakes.  It was well battered, and had great flavor.  Far better than the usual frozen cod or halibut you\'ll get most places.  The fries are among the best I\'ve had.  Highly recommend.\n\nMy wife had the "Black Bean & Quinoa Patty Topped with Tomato Crushed Avocado, Spicy Mayo, and Fried Onions on a Grain Harvest Farmer Roll".  We are not vegetarian, but do often dine with our health in mind, and it\'s great to know we can get a solid, flavorful meal like this, sans meat.  Really excellent.  The patty was nicely seasoned, had some texture other than "soft", and was served on a nice roll.  She substituted the usual side salad for a dollar, and had the apple/blue cheese concoction.  Also very very good.  \n\nIt will be interesting to see what becomes of the dreary interior when they\'re through with the reno\'s.  Hopefully it does enough to elevate the space to match the food.\n\nThe service was good.  The server was friendly, but did not seem overly familiar with each option.\n\nWe\'ll be back.'

S'Ich m\xc3\xb6chte unbedingt noch erg\xc3\xa4nzen, dass im China-City Dienstags bis Freitags abends ein Mongolisches Buffett angeboten wird.\nUnd das ist wirklich erstklassig. Es ist eine wilde Mischung aus chinesischem und japanischem Essen. So findet man sowohl Misosuppe und Suhsi als auch Fr\xc3\xbchlingsrolle und Garnelen.\n\n\n Das besondere an diesem Buffett ist, dass man nicht nur eine reichhaltige Auswahl an fertig gegarten Speisen (von Vorspeise bis Dessert) findet, sondern dass auch eine gro\xc3\x9fe Auswahl an rohem Fisch, Fleisch und Gem\xc3\xbcse zur Verf\xc3\xbcgung steht. Dieses stellt man sich nach eigenem Geschmack auf einem Teller zusammen, w\xc3\xa4hlt eine der angebotenen So\xc3\x9fen aus (von s\xc3\xbc\xc3\x9f bis scharf und Knoblauch bis w\xc3\xbcrzig) und gibt diese in einem kleinen Sch\xc3\xbcsselchen gemeinsam mit dem Teller am Grill ab. Immer am Buffettabend findet man am Tisch ein K\xc3\xb6rbchen mit W\xc3\xa4scheklammern, die mit Nummern beschriftet sind. So eine Klammer macht man vorher an seinen Teller, damit man ihn auch wieder finden kann.\nDer Grillmeister vermischt die rohen Zutaten mit der So\xc3\x9fe und grillt fachgerecht in kurzer Zeit auf der hei\xc3\x9fen Platte. Danach kommt alles wieder auf einen Teller, Klammer dran und abholbereit auf den Tresen.\n\n\n Mir hat besonders gut gefallen, dass dieses Buffett immer wieder aufgef\xc3\xbcllt wurde und auch die hochwertigeren Zutaten wie Rindfleisch oder Garnelen stets vorhanden waren. Bei anderen Buffetts habe ich schon oft erlebt, dass die g\xc3\xbcnstigen Sachen massig vorhanden waren und das "gute" Essen st\xc3\xa4ndig leer.\n\n\n Zur Auswahl stehen mehrere Suppen, Gem\xc3\xbcse, diverse in Teig gebackene Sachen, Pilze, Zwiebeln, Fisch, Fleisch und nat\xc3\xbcrlich Scampi und Garnelen. Super war auch das Sushi-Angebot mit viel Auswahl an Makishushi und Rollen mit Fisch und Gem\xc3\xbcse. Ich esse gern und oft Sushi und bereite es auch selbst zu und war mit der Qualit\xc3\xa4t sehr zufrieden.\nZum Dessert gab es nicht nur die obligatorischen gebackenen Bananen sondern auch Melone, Ananas und Eis.\n\n\n Wir waren rundum zufrieden und satt und hatten das Gef\xc3\xbchl f\xc3\xbcr unsere knapp 13 Euro Festpreis pro Nase einen angemessenen Gegenwert erhalten zu haben. Sch\xc3\xb6n war halt, dass jeder etwas f\xc3\xbcr seinen Geschmack finden konnte, selbst diejenigen die jetzt nicht so die ausgesprochenen China-Fans sind.\n\n\n Negativ ist in meinen Augen im China-City der Service da das Personal insgesamt sehr schlecht Deutsch spricht, zwar schnell da ist aber oft die Bestellung falsch versteht und einen bedient ohne einen wirklich anzusehen. Aber das ist leider in den meisten Chinarestaurants dieser Gr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9fe so.'

It's not real Chinese food and really caters towards the American taste, which is fine because that's what they do.\n\nOne time, I remember, it was a Chinese woman behind the counter and boy, what an attitude.  I think if I were white, she'd have treated me better.  Maybe Asians with their own kind, they feel they can give poor customer service to because we're willing to take it, but since there are plenty of other places to eat at, especially Panda's, it's not a good idea to treat your Asian clientele like crap.\n\nThe food is the same from one Panda to another and usually we get good service.  I've noticed if it's a Hispanic person, the service is awesome.  If' it's an Asian person, it's up for grabs.  And so so with a white person.\n\nBad services at places where there a lot of, we're usually more inclined to stop doing business."

Again another good place to bring our baby. \n\nThe prices were cheap for quality. We got two entrees, an appetizer and two drinks for $20. I got a chicken taco and asada taco dinner combo. The asada taco was amazing! Beautifully seasoned and not over cooked. The refried beans were the second best thing I ate on my plate. OMG. Best beans ever!

Anybody from the Boat Drunks to Tons of Fun Band.  \n\nPlenty of TV's that put a premium on Illini sports.  I will always remember watching the Illinois/Arizona NCAA game during the 04-05 season here.  Service suffers depending on how many people are here, and what is going on.

The prices are great too, a slider combo will only set you back about $7 with drink. Everything is made fresh and the food is cooked pretty rather quickly; i mean how long does it take to cook a little hamburger patty anyway? They also got fish for you people that dont eat meat. I would recommend this place over the neighborhood Ruby Tuesdays; unfortunately the drive from the vegas strip is a little much if you are looking for slider burgers in particular; but if you got the time then by all means go there.'

The restaurant is owned by the same family that owns South 21 curb service on Independence Blvd, which has been there since you could cross Independence blvd at numerous intersections, even on foot (way long y\'all).\n\nThat being said, its quality junk-food at its best.  Its by no means healthy, but its a lot better than any fast food you could put in your body.  The tartar sauce is famous and for good reason...its the best I\'ve ever had and cannot be replicated (the recipe is super secret).

The whole environment exudes a very simple and clean style. \n\nThe food is quite fantastic. The stir fry is superb and the sushi is delicious. Its major fault is that it\'s definitely too expensive. The specialty rolls go from $13-$15 for 8 rolls and the rolls are smaller than other sushi places. However, they have a unique "create your own sushi" menu item for $9 for 8 rolls.

S"Cafe Fiesta is basically a mom & pop sandwich shop inside of an old Quiznos.  I wouldn't call them organized, efficient, or all that interested in the appearance of their restaurant.  What they are interested in, however, is making a good sandwich and selling it for a reasonable rate.  For a businessman wanting a quick lunch during the week that fills me up and won't break the bank, this place is perfect.\n\nI ordered a chicken salad sandwich and a coke - I believe the total was less than $5.  They served it on huge slices of fresh bread with multiple mounds of chicken salad.  In case you are as picky as I am when it comes to chicken/tuna/egg salad, I'll warn you theirs has grapes, maybe cranberries, and nuts of some sort with just the right ratio of mayo to chicken.  I loved it.\n\nOnly two people behind the counter, so I am told there will often be a line at lunch during the week, but I only experienced one person in front of me.  I guess there is a training salon of some sort nearby (Aveda???), so many students frequent this establishment.\n\nCafe Fiesta is in the rotation."

S"I know its a chain, I also know its not authenic Mexican food, but every now and again I get a Taco Bell craving I just have to satisfy!\nPlus if you make some wise menu choices, you can eat good without ingesting a whole lot of fat grams. For example, I get 2 steak soft tacos fresco style which is pico de gallo instead of cheese and sour cream. The pico is very good and you can taste the fresh cilantro. This drops the fats grams to only 4 each. Add a side of rice (only 3 fat grams)  cover in fire sauce and add an unsweet tea or diet coke and you eatin' good for only 11 grams of fat! Pretty good from a fast food joint, huh? I also get a side of guacamole that really good, but I don't count it as it has it has all the good kinds of fats that are good for you! A win win situation.\nI aslo thinks its pretty damn tasty! Thats right, I said it, I LIKE TACO BELL!!\nPlus most locations I have been in are clean and the counter service is friendly.\nI don't eat here once a week or even once a month, but when the craving does hit, I'm  thinking outside the box and making a run for the border!"

This bartender did not disappoint.\n\nMy friends and I were celebrating our birthdays.  After two drinks, we had the courage to ask the Server if he could convince the General Manager and the Vice President (who were visiting that day) to come over and sing us Happy Birthday.  The General Manager did so with a smile on his face.\n\nIt's so sad when there is great service like this that the food is not better.  Where will these great Servers go when the place closes down?"

S'I used to really like this place. It was kinda like an outdoor adult playground in the summer time. Decent bands, cheap beer, beach volleyball. \n\nRecently Steve\'s experienced a fire and is now closed for renovations. What the news stories fail to note is that days before the fire, Steve\'s got a visit from their friendly neighborhood health inspector, and tanked. They scored a 71. Get a 70, and DHEC shuts you down. Below is copied from DHEC\'s website, where all sanitation scores are posted publicly.   \n\nSTEVE\'S BAR & GRILL\n2150 GOLD HILL RD\nFORT MILL\n071\n5/27/2011\nR\n\nI used to be a chef, my degree is in Culinary Arts. I\'ve taken sanitation courses and am ServSafe Certified. I almost can\'t fathom what in the heck you have to do to get a 71. Except that I can, and what you have to do to get a 71 is NOT good. It can\'t be blamed on a kitchen crew unfamiliar with sanitation requirements. Even a full staff of morons could keep a restaurant within B range. There is some serious stuff happening at Steve\'s, because a 71 doesn\'t happen by accident. People knew things were wrong, and they were turning their heads. In my experience this comes from the management and ownership level. \n\nI used to like Steve\'s, really I did. We were there all the time in the summer. I loved ladies night, when I could get a bucket of "Boat Trash" for only $10. Now I wonder if what was in the bucket of boat trash might actually have been trash. Short of Steve\'s selling to new ownership, and starting from scratch with a completely new management, kitchen, and service crew, there\'s nothing they can do to make me step foot in there again. Sorry, a 71 isn\'t forgivable!'

S"**UPDATE** Oneway has moved to 2316 Lasalle St. Charlotte NC 28216. It has not closed\n\nI really enjoyed my first experience eating here. It's fairly new so finding the location may be a little challenging for those not familiar with uptown Charlotte but it is directly adjacent from the courthouse buildings in between Quiznos and Pizzeria. It is certainly built to cater to the stop & go, fast paced lunch crowds which are usually there peak times but they operate from 7a-3p with breakfast and lunch offerings. Everything thing is made cooked to order and the taste of eastern style southern cooking is second to none. I had the Pork BBQ which was very tender, juicy and flavored well. The Smoked turkey was also very rich & moist, seasoned to a nice texture.  For my sides I had Sweet Potato fries and coleslaw complimented my meal just right. Best of all the service was great, made to order food takes a little longer to get, but it is worth the wait. Staff always asks how you enjoyed your meal when you dine in and there is a WiFi spot for those that want to stay productive & connected while enjoying a good meal. I was glad I stopped in and you will be too if you decide to do the same :-)"

They are always OUTRAGEOUSLY fast which is great on a 30 min lunch break. The place is always clean and quiet and they are always really polite here. The sandwiches never taste stale or like the ingredients have been sitting out for a while unlike some of these locations.\n\nIt is a little small for it;s location in my opinion but I have never had to wait very long even if it were packed wall to wall here. When I don't have time to leave work, sometimes I have them delivered. They come right out and have only ONCE ever taken longer than 30 minutes to get to me. So therefore, this little Milio's is one of the best places for lunch or dinner on Madison's west side."

Je suis pass\xc3\xa9e plusieurs fois devant avant de me d\xc3\xa9cider \xc3\xa0 y aller....et je ne l\'ai pas regrett\xc3\xa9! \n\nL\'ambiance est chouette et le d\xc3\xa9cor est tendance. Le restaurant est assez tranquille, m\xc3\xaame lorsqu\'il est rempli. C\'est un endroit parfait pour organiser un souper \xc3\xa0 l\'improviste avec des amis! Les employ\xc3\xa9s sont hyper gentils et dr\xc3\xb4les, ce qui rend le service tr\xc3\xa8s agr\xc3\xa9able.\n\n C\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 nourriture, toutes les pizzas auxquelles j\'ai go\xc3\xbbt\xc3\xa9 jusqu\'\xc3\xa0 maintenant \xc3\xa9taient d\xc3\xa9licieuses. Les garnitures \xc3\xa9taient fra\xc3\xaeches et tr\xc3\xa8s bonnes. D\'ailleurs, il y en a pour tous les go\xc3\xbbts, autant pour les v\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9tariens que ceux qui adorent la viande. Ma pr\xc3\xa9f\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9e : la El Gringo, garnie de piments forts, d\'\xc3\xa9pinards, de ricotta et de mozzarella. Elle est \xc3\xa0 la fois piquante et douce, miam! Celle au canard est \xc3\xa9galement excellente! Vraiment, je pourrais vous parler de toutes les sortes qu\'ils offrent, mais je vous sugg\xc3\xa8re d\'aller les d\xc3\xa9couvrir par vous-m\xc3\xaames! Vous pourrez profiter de la " table d\'h\xc3\xb4te " et ainsi d\xc3\xa9guster une bonne salade, une savoureuse pizza et un g\xc3\xa2teau fondant pour 20 $ seulement si ma m\xc3\xa9moire est bonne. Le F+F pizza offre aussi des sp\xc3\xa9ciaux du genre 4 pizzas au choix pour 39 $, la 2e pizza \xc3\xa0 moiti\xc3\xa9 prix (certains jours de la semaine seulement) et autres promotions int\xc3\xa9ressantes!\n\nIl y avait quelques petits points n\xc3\xa9gatifs, mais d\xc3\xa9finitivement pas assez gros pour m\'emp\xc3\xaacher d\'y retourner :\n\nLeur limonade maison : J\'\xc3\xa9tais curieuse, car j\'adore la limonade. Par contre, j\'ai \xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 tr\xc3\xa8s d\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa7ue... Elle \xc3\xa9tait vraiment ordinaire. \xc3\x80 vrai dire, elle go\xc3\xbbtait carr\xc3\xa9ment l\'eau. La propret\xc3\xa9 de la vaisselle et des couverts : Lors de ma premi\xc3\xa8re visite, j\'ai d\xc3\xbb demander au serveur de changer mon verre, car il \xc3\xa9tait vraiment sale. Histoire semblable \xc3\xa0 ma deuxi\xc3\xa8me visite : j\'avais vraiment l\'impression que mes ustensiles n\'avaient pas \xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 lav\xc3\xa9s. En jetant un coup d\'\xc5\x93il \xc3\xa0 ceux sur les autres tables, j\'ai remarqu\xc3\xa9 que c\'\xc3\xa9tait partout pareil, beurk.\n\nOh j\'oubliais! Pour ceux qui n\'habitent pas trop loin, le restaurant offre la livraison! Par contre, selon l\'endroit o\xc3\xb9 vous vivez, armez-vous de patience. J\'habitde \xc3\xa0 Verdun et la fois que nous avons d\xc3\xa9cid\xc3\xa9 de commander de leurs d\xc3\xa9licieuses pizza, elles sont arriv\xc3\xa9es au bout d\'une heure et demi...'

We had made a specific time for it to be ready for pickup, but he had to wait a few minutes - no big deal. Brought it home to my excited growling tummy...\nI had ordered it with "robust tomato sauce". We couldn\'t even tell if the pizza even had any sauce on it. Bleh. I had ordered the regular "hand-tossed" crust - but the crust was so salty and greasy it was almost inedible.

Then, a sampler of all the different types of momos (dumplings) which were artfully prepared, perfectly seasoned and came with the best mint sauce of life, I kid you not. We also had the chili chicken, which was also really, really tasty. \nTo top it all off, the prices are totally affordable. The wine selection leaves much to be desired, though, so next time I'll just stick with the super fresh mango lassie or the butter tea. This will be the place I take out of town friends from now on, and I'll be going back again to treat myself, too."

S"Ugh - I was horribly dissatisfied w/this place.\n\nI'd heard it hyped, and I was expecting good things, but when I finally got a chance go to, I was definitely disappointed.\n\nI felt bad for the server, he said he had a party of 23 in the next room over, and most of them didn't speak English.  I didn't see another party, or even another room - but was he really the only waiter working?  In that huge place?  At dinner time?!!  It appeared so.  The only other employees we had contact with were two hostesses who barely spoke to us.\n\nThe bar was practically empty, as was the rest of the place, but our service still took forever, I received the wrong drink, and my food was awful.  My burger was underdone, the bun was soggy, and even though I'd added lots of toppings - avocado, lettuce, etc - it was bland to the point of inedibility.\n\nI ate about half of it and left hungry.  My date thought maybe I was being a little picky - until he tasted my burger.  Case closed.\n\nAdding to the chaos - some dj was setting up, playing obscenely loud music as he got his equipment in order, even though there was NOBODY there, and it was extremely difficult to even have a conversation.  We ended up staring at each other mutely over the table most of the meal...and not in that lovey-dovey way ...\n\nJust overall an unpleasant experience."

S'I love establishments by families.  Mom and Pop shops just have a different feel than the chain restaurants.  I like the Early Bird Cafe more now because they really expanded their menu.  The owners are always friendly and they have tons of regulars.  Thats a really good sign when the customers know the wait staff.  Their food is like home cooking.   They have the typical American fare but also serve Mexican breakfast and lunch staples.  They just serve food the way they are supposed to be: fresh and unpretentious.

S'If not for the disappointing desserts, I would have given 4 stars.\n\nI went with a Groupon coupon tonight. The service was good and the quality of the food top notch. Everything was fresh, service attentive but not clingy.\n\nThe dessert was supposed to be a dessert of the day, the server advised was chocolate mousse. Not.\n\nWhat arrived at our table was a 3" x 3" x 1"  of chocolate cake (bought - not homemade). In what reality is that a value of $9? While the fried Gnocchi served with chocolate hazelnut sauce, sounded way more than it was, it was dense heavy and lackluster, they looked like 4 toasted marshmallows on the plate. We were pretty full so made no complaint.\n\nTwo of us started with Ceasar salad with pancetta and parmesan shavings, beautiful presentation, Caprini Salad - Mix of endives, pears, sundried tomatoes and goat cheese - looked better than it tasted, Caprese Salad- Sliced tomatoes with Buffalo Mozzarella - great eye appeal very subtle flavor.\n\nFoie Gras was no way near as rich as I\'ve experienced. Scallops au Pernod was subtle and fragrant - a delight. \nDuck carpaccio ($15 ) was surprisingly lean, still tasty.\nItalian sausage - more of rolls of ground meat - with homemade dip ($9 ) \nFried Calamari was a very generous portion.\nGrilled garlic shrimp was served with a lemony sauce with chives? My friend short of licked it off the plate.\nLamb chops were juicy and not overcooked.\n\nAll-in-all a good time was had by all. We\'d return with another coupon. This place is a bit pricey.'

S'UPDATE: 6/27/09: I\'ve been meaning to report the devastating news (well, devastating to ME anyway). The Chandler location of zPizza closed its doors earlier this year. The Central Phoenix locations are still open, I think, but this one wasn\'t doing so well. Heck I\'m surprised many of the other businesses in this plaza (including the Whole Foods Market there) are still open. Oh well... That sucks. :(\n\n-----------\n\nFinally! I keep meaning to check this place out. It\'s an 8-minute walk from my front door. And it\'s taken me this long. Anyway, I\'m glad I finally tried it. We normally choose California Pizza Kitchen, where we never stray from the BBQ Chicken pizza, so ZPizza\'s BBQ was our choice by default. Something to compare, you know? \n\nWe were NOT disappointed at all! Definitely delicious. I love that we were able to order online and get it delivered (a plus, over CPK), and we were able to choose whether we wanted whole wheat crust or regular, and whether or not we wanted low-fat cheese. Health conscious as we usually are, these were excellent options. The pizza arrived in less than 45 minutes (which was the wait time they gave me), and it arrived warm and toasty - well, duh, they\'re right down the street from me, so I guess that was a given.\n\nOpen the box and it was beautiful. Sliced tomatoes, sweet corn, red pepper, red onions, BBQ chicken and a sprinkle of cilantro. The crust tasted great, the cheese was moist but not greasy. I do admit that the BBQ flavor was not as intense as the CPK, and they lost some points on that... When I want BBQ, i mean i really want BBQ. That is the whole point, so that was the one of the negative things I could say. They could also have added *just a little more* chicken. There was a good amount, but not enough. \n\nThe price was just right, in my opinion, for that type of pizza. A 10" pie, $10.76, delivered. CPK is over $12 and you have to go get it.  And our delivery guy was a sweetheart, too. \n\nLooking at the menu, I may want to try some of their salads in the future. I saw that Dan L poo-poo\'d the price of the salads, but I guess it\'s different for everyone. I will gladly pay $8-10 for a loaded salad, like the greek or the pear and gorgonzola (Large is 8.49, small is 5.49, and you can add chicken for $2.00). It seems just about the same as any other place where I eat salad. Heck Pita Jungle\'s is just about that much, and when i go to Salad Creations in Tempe Marketplace, if I get the big salad with all the toss-ins, plus chicken, that, too comes out to like nearly $9.00. \n\nBut I digress...\n\nOverall, the place shows a lot of promise, and we\'ll definitely go there more often, now that we\'ve tried it!'

S'Visited here as a party of 6 for my Mum\'s 70th Birthday & we weren\'t disappointed. From the minute we walked in, the service was first class with pleasant decor, subdued lighting allowing the menu to do the talking. Our table had Mussels (what a plateful!), Pig Cheek, Scallops and the Chorizo with Morcilla for starters. All were superb. For mains we had Steak, Sea Bass, Chicken with Langoustine, Lamb & Haggis Parcels and the Lamb from the "specials". As the mains do not come with any veg, we ordered 3 fries & 2 potatoes with veg (green beans with baby carrots) to share. All were delicious resulting in clean plates. Finally, with just enough room for dessert we enjoyed Sticky Toffee Pudding, Pistachio Meringue, Chocolate Mousse (from the "specials"), Orange & Almond Cake (from the "specials"), Lime Sorbet & Passionfruit Sorbet. All finished off the meal perfectly. Although the restaurant was full with a turnover of tables, the service at all times was slick. Including a bottle of house white (crisp Italian \xc2\xa315.99) & 4 soft drinks the bill came to \xc2\xa3190 with a further 10% service charge which was excellent value for money. An absolute gem of a restaurant.'

The egg is more like the folded scrambled eggs from McDonald's (not the McMuffin) and actually softer. It's your basic breakfast sandwich and the croissant gives it a buttery fluffy texture that was ok. The orange juice comes in a Minute Maid carton which reminded me of elementary school cafeteria days... sigh. I didn't get the hash browns this time. Those are quite commuter friendly as they are served in bit sized portions.\n\nStill, the location is a bit sleepy, with not many employees at 7am. That's not a bad thing, it just doesn't exude the kind of energy that I'm used to with Sbucks or McD's. The cashier also had a pretty bad cough and didn't look happy. Regardless, if you like Burger King, here ya go! On the NE corner of Dobson/Ray."

S'The last two Mexican places in this spot failed bad. Third time was a charm. I tried the carne Asada and they actually let me try it before I ordered (which could in itself be a problem since that shows that the Carne is already made and in a warming dish). Either way, they cut all the fat off and it literally is just the meat involved in whatever you choose to put it in. Originally, I ordered the bowl, but they were out of bowls, and I declined the offer to throw everything into a styrofoam container instead. So I regrouped and ordered my first Torta. Ok, there was too much going on in there with guac (pretty good), lettuce, beans on the Torta and the meat is still pretty tasty, so I would stick to the tacos or maybe a regular burrito without anything but meat and rice on my next visit. As long as the carne remains void of fat (a huge rarity in my life) this is the go to place for worry-free Carne Asada now. Oh, I used the walk-up window and the cashier was muy bueno.'

My friend suggested sullivans pier, we used to go there years ago for fish and chips.  The restaurant seems to have moved or opened a new location on Southern Ave.  Nothing much for decor, seems to be a former burger king.  We were both drawn in by the coconut platter.  1 side, 2 HUGE coconut shrimp, and 2 big pieces of coconut whitefish for around $8. we also shared some friend mushrooms.  The shrimp were fairly fresh and tasty, the tropical sauce they server with the paltter is very good.  the fish were crispy and satisfying, and I tend to be a bit of a purist with fish and chips usually just Malt vinegar, and a lemon wedge, occasionally tartar sauce. The last time we had seafood together we went to Red Lobster and were underwhelmed with about the same amount of food except it cost around $60 for two.\n\nI only wish I had something like this on the westside of town."

The drive through option (I've never seen this at a Panera before this particular location) is pure money.  I was expecting slower than typical morning fast food drive through service, but received just the opposite.  Order was accurate.  Coffee was hot.  Breakfast sandwich was good.\n\nIf I could change something, I'd work on the value for the price paid.  $8 for a breakfast sandwich and some caffeine means I won't be returning very often, unfortunately.  The other ~negative comment I'd like to bring up is a lack of dedicated convenient parking.  They sandwiched (pun intended) this restaurant between a McDonalds and a gas station.  Combine this with their drive through lane and the parking options are quite limited.  There are a decent number of spaces across the main drive towards Walmart/Barnes&Noble, etc., but beware walking across traffic.  I went there ~2pm last week and couldn't find a spot."

I came here because I wanted quality Mediterranean food which they could not provide I keep my business in Gilbert AZ that is my community and like to support local small business this place will not be getting any of my business nor recommendations we did happen to go 1 mile away and find a wonderful place called flaming kabob with the most incredible service and even better food I HIGHLY do not recommend going here as it is a complete waste of time"

I was shocked to see how empty the place was. \n\nThey allow you to reserve different portions of the restaurant. We reserved the shuffle board, ping pong and pool tables (Billiard's East). The group enjoyed it and our server was quick with getting the orders.\n\nThe disappointing thing was we had to go looking for the pool balls and the wax for the shuffleboard table. We made the reservation so everything would be setup for us so that was kind of disappointing.\n\nI was surprised to see so many of the video games where out of order. \n\nI'd use Jillian's again but I wonder how long the place is going to last if they do not get bigger crowds or keeping the games working."

S"We came here because of the 5 star feedback and they were nearly walking distance from where we live. We were very excited to see a BBQ joint nearby but were highly disappointed with the food. Being from KC I know what good BBQ taste like and some of the best places are set up like this one but this wasn't even close when it came to good or even acceptable BBQ. They had a huge smoker in back but it wasn't used for the BBQ we had. Since we live very close we really wanted to like this place because the closest decent BBQ place is 20 miles away. \n\nWe bought a sample plate because we love BBQ and wanted to get a good idea of what their's was like. The food tasted old, like it was warmed up from days before and it had a lot of grease on it. The beans had a weird aftertaste to them and also had an old burnt taste. The smoker in back was for show only because the food tasted like it was done in an oven a week before. \n\nLike I said very disappointed... don't waste your money."

Do not know how this place stays in business? Never see any business there! i ordered a breakfast burrito, it had eggs, sausage, and potatoes. Nothing special, something I could have made up at home. This is my opinion, when you have a restaurant. You should serve food that has something special. Not food, we can serve up at home. Give me a reason to return!! The location is very out dated, needs a new coat of paint and get rid of all the pictures. There are too many options in this area to eat at. This place really needs to change.

I usually get some sort of double cheese burger, one time with bacon and the next time with the slightly healthier avocado. Both times, the burger was quite tasty, with a nicely toasted bun and great cheese. \n\nI can't vouch for the sides though, the fries were a little bit too crispy for me and the onion rings were, in reality, onion strings and came with a very very small amount"

S"Mmmm I love Buffalo Grill!! If ever I am feeling in a serious need for some meat, this is always my first and last port of call as it always does the trick. \n\nSituated just around the corner from the main University campus, George Square, Buffalo Grill is a great place for students to go for lunch or dinner. \n\nI completely and utterly adore Buffalo Grill's burgers. The staff always ask you how well you want your meat cooked, as it always comes out exactly how you have asked it to be done. I tend to order their Diablo Burger, which comes with sour cream, guacamole and jalapenos peppers so it is pretty spicy but amazing. The burgers come in two different sizes, and I always order the smaller version as that fills me up and costs about \xc2\xa35 and the bigger size costs about \xc2\xa37. The burgers come with fries, salad and, my favourite, pickles! \n\nBuffalo Grill also serves a huge variety of different Scottish steaks which cost no more than \xc2\xa310 - what a bargain! But the Buffalo Grill is not just a place for meat eaters, as they have a main menu which offers a good selection of vegetarian dishes too such as crepe's and eggs Benedict. \n\nA variety of deserts are also available including crepes and pecan pie which is amazing. Buffalo Grill also allow you to bring your own booze which is a much cheaper option than buying alcohol in a restaurant. \n\nI completely adore this place and cannot recommend it more highly - GO!!"

The cheese bubbling, the marvels of a HOT OVEN to bad others wont follow.\n\nThe sauce was even better less salty, but full of great savory flavors, with out the typical west coast sweetness.\n\nThey now have cups of water too which is the next best thing to a caffeine, and sugar free drink option.\n\nI don't think they realize they are in AZ and can get labor to bus the tables at a very low rate. This is the only reason they don't get 5 stars. On sat it was some what busy, some tables needed a wipe down yet there was no busser in sight. Also I am not a huge fan of the ASU colors inside, the yellow is just a bit overpowering, and out of place being over 8 miles from campus.\n\nGo in, order a 18 inch cheese pie, even the leftovers are decent.

But sometimes we just want to be waited on, and not go through all the cooking, and the washing of dishes and pots.\nSo when we have a really big craving for something Mexican, it is very specific, like Menudo, or Birria. Something that we know takes some time to cook, and we just want to have some right now!\nWell, this place was packed!! The rainy Saturday morning we ventured out to try it for the first time. Because all the empty spaces were taken by diners and people waiting for their turn, we had to wait like 15-20 minutes outside in our car. Which built some high expectations, we thought "This gotta be super delicious"! Well, once we got to be seated, we ordered our birrias, our kids had pancakes and Tacos de Birria, I know, don\'t even ask! Service was great! The ladies that took care of us, really took care of us! They were very friendly, and helpful.\nWe thought the the birria was "OK", but not mind-blowing. We added all the "Add-ins" and it still tasted somewhat bland.  But it is a really good place to go eat, by all means... We just haven\'t found a place that we can recommend a 100%. No, not this one.'

S'Terrible. Flavorless. Disappointing. \n\nThese are the words that come to mind when I think of our "meal" at Taco Maker. We stopped after walking the strip during the craziness of March Madness weekend and just wanted a temporary reprieve -- an easy meal and some peace and quiet. We stopped by the Fashion Show Mall - which looked pretty fancy - and saw the food court. Even though there was hardly anyone in the food court, we wondered, how bad can it be?\n\nThe answer: really bad. \n\nWe picked out poison: Taco Maker. It looked promising. We got veggie nachos and a veggie burrito. The person making it nachos barely put any cheese on it (and they first wanted to go cheese sauce on me) and thus it was disgustingly bland. The veggie burrito looked promising, but it had no taste (especially of course for the plentiful taste of salt). 0 for 2. We left the mall feeling disappointed, unsatisfied, and, of course, extremely gassy. They really should rename Taco Maker to Fart Maker. Steer clear.'

Based on the reviews we tried the Xin Jiang chicken which apparently is actually called Dapanji and translates to Big Plate Chicken.  Yes!~!  When the platter (not plate - platter) arrived - OMG there must have been an entire chicken on it!  It is one of the delicious chicken dishes we have ever enjoyed and there was a full take out box to take home.  I assumed they made an error and ordered the large size, but no, on our bill we were charged 11.95 for the dish. Unbelievable!!  We also ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce.  I loved every bite and it was hard to stay away from it.  My partner found it just a little sweet being used to a spicier and more savory eggplant dish.  Still it was a really great dish.  I highly recommend trying this place, especially if you are getting the Xin Jiang Chicken-  What fantastic flavor in this dish!  Service is excellent - prompt and very attentive wait staff.  Decor is casual.  We are not Chinese and don't speak the language and we had no problems at all with the service. This could easily become one of our favorite places."

S"really a 3 1/2 star. I'm not a fan but I also don't think it's just OK. I might be a little severe about it but the reason why I'm not a fan it's because it doesn't feel like it's adapted to the 21st century French Cuisine. In fact, the quality and price is really honest and the service good either. I had the winter gourmet menu with 5 services. The first entr\xc3\xa9e was a Cr\xc3\xa8me de Gibier and champignon sauvage. It taste more the mushroom cream then a game and mushroom cream. I enjoyed it even though I didn't felt it was awesome. The second service was a Baluchon with duck magret and some emulsion of balsamic and a small amount of what appeared to me has a mango or exotic fruit chutney. It was ok even though it felt like a piece of pineapple chicken with fancy sauce! ;), then a salad with a dressing that was really similar to a Hollandaise sauce and honestly I just don't like the taste of it. The main was really good and the cooking was perfect. I Ordered a blue Beef Filet and even though the plate felt a little empty, after the last dish I was pretty filled. I also had the chance to taste the lamb of a lady friend of mine who was filled up and the cooking was exquisite and the taste awesome. It's N-Z lambs that was serve and honnestly, unless they say they serve Quebec Lamb - which in my humble opinion has a way better taste, is also bigger than N-Z Lamb and more expensive as well. Finally the last dish was a desert, a chocolate cake with wild berries. Not my favorite but still a good cake. The weakest dish of the evening was definetly the Salad and the best one the main. Overall the biggest issue I have with this restaurant is that it felt like a really safe menu with no exploration of possibilities.  It's the kind of restaurant I would bring my Grand-Mother to on Mother's day, you know, the kind of restaurant your grand-mother will feel confortable and in a chic ambiance.

S'"You Can\'t Always Get What You Want " used to be the song I sang when thinking of Donato\'s. I craved it all the time yet it hadn\'t made its way down to NC yet but insisted my sister order it every time I went up to Indiana. Fast forward a few years and we have it in Charlotte-woo hoo! Except I didn\'t have it until tonight. Not in the mood to cook, I took the lazy way out and ordered online.\n\nI didn\'t want a huge pizza but ordered two individual pizzas (one so I can enjoy later this wk) and love that you can get the think crust on the individuals as well. Got the confirmation email from them-order would be ready in 15 minutes for pick up and bam, it was in my hands 15 minutes later. Still the same gooey, cheesy, heavenly pie that I\'ve been accustomed to in the past. They offer mad coupons in the Wednesday flier and have a few coupons in the Citipass book as well.'

S'Great food for a good price.  Not to be condescending, but initially I thought this place was going to be another fast food Mexican joint (a la Roberto\'s) and we stopped here only because it was nearby and we didn\'t want Subway.  We rolled up in here and I opted for the Camarrones al Mojo de Ajo, or the Garlic Shrimp to the non-Spanish speakers out there (sorry if I butchered it) and it was really good surprisingly!  Although it wasn\'t the best Garlic Shrimp I\'ve EVER had, this one was leaps beyond the Roberto\'s plate I usually frequent and it definitely worth mentioning.   Furthermore, is there anyone out there besides myself that doesn\'t like the "red" sauce?  Well try the Santander red sauce and be amazed.  I can safely say that the red sauce here is my favorite in the valley.  I barely even touched my "green" sauce and I love that sauce!  Plus, there is a wagon out front that they cook on nightly and you can even stop by for a quick bite if you\'re not interested in sitting in and eating. \n\nFood is great, price is reasonable, staff is friendly.. give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised like I was.'

First it is not in the tourist area but by driving it took us 10 mins from our hotel in downtown.  We meet one of the owners Gala, she mends the front and her husband is the chef.  She was great and we ordered the gastronome menu because it has everything we can taste.  She suggested that we share because of its portion.  It was great because it was just perfect.  Everything was so refine and tasty and we live in Brooklyn and we never even been to a reputable Russian restaurant that does not involve a cabaret.  So it was so great to eat and enjoy the food.  We loved it so much that we went back 2 days later!  It has to be the best meals we had in Montreal and the price is right!  We went to Toque, Au Pied de Cochon, L'Express and many others but this is by far the best.  Please make your way to this lovely neighborhood restaurant that's great price and great food."

Finally about 10 minutes at a standstill I asked one of the servers what the problem was; to which he rattled off a few kitchen machined were out of order and there was nothing he could do and quickly told me he would "just cancel my order". I replied "excuse me?" He sighed and walked off. Finally about 30 minutes after I ordered I asked to speak with the manager, who was polite and the only reason my rating isn\'t ZERO STARS! I explained I am irritated I have been in line for over a half hour because the machines weren\'t working and if I ordered something that required that machine why didn\'t they let me know it might take a while since by this point I am late for work!!

It's a great big new curry house in Newington whose full title is actually 'Imans grill - A taste of Punjab'.\n\nInside it's fairly tastefully decked out. The tables and chairs are a nice, understated dark wood, there's nothing crazy going out. It's the outside that gets me. The sign is an enormous what looks like leopard print, and it's got big banners everywhere. Just has the look and feel of a tacky place.\n\nOnto the food, then. The selection here is enormous. They've all different types of curries to cater to all tastes. They even have a British section. Why the hell would you go to a curry house for an omelette? Who does that?! Anyway, the curry I had (Lamb Saag) was OK. Not terrible, but not mind blowing. Just OK. I reckon this place would be great to take a huge group to, it's bigger than the batcave."

I probably had the most complaints re: my veganized pad kee mao.  The flavor was great, and they added chinese broccoli to the mix (bonus!), but UGH! the noodles were hella mushy.  That's a faux pas you just can't excuse.   Otherwise I really liked it.  My other complaint was that I ordered a lemongrass soda, which was CRAZY sweet and tasted like pandan, with no hint of lemongrass or lemony anything.  Oh well.

Also, you might end up in a sunny or shady side of the patio, so renember your sunglasses. There are bar seats, as well as high top and regular tables.\n\nThe cocktail prices here are in the 12-16$ range.

Apparently it was a problem because there was someone behind us and he would not let us make that second order. I have NEVER had that kind of problem at any other drive thru, and he apologized over the intercom and my friend even told him "i have worked at Burger King before and I was always able to do separate orders." We think he was too worried about his timing or whatever but either way it was bullshit how we had to go back around just to order her food.

I prefer to sit in booths, so I actually took offense to this - the proper thing to say would have been "would you prefer a table or a booth?" Asking me if a table is all right implies no booths are available or something is wrong with them. \n\nFor my meal I ordered chicken soup and french toast - but they just plain forgot about the soup. I had to remind them AFTER I got my french toast. They were nice enough to give me the soup for free, but the whole reason I get the soup is to hold me over until I get my entree. \n\nBeing in a casino, this restaurant has no divider wall between the gaming area and the restaurant, which is annoying (though fortunately it is higher up than the gambling, so the noise and odor of smoke aren\'t too bad.) This also means there are no bathrooms in the restaurant.\n\nThis isn\'t the best Denny\'s I have ever eaten in, though certainly not the worst.

But that\'s what makes this place extra special. I don\'t even know where to start on how great this place can be for the human species in Montreal, QC. \n\nThis place seems like a fast food joint you go to when you are not sober and craving some junk food. But I will tell you this place is much much more. Calling Centrale Bregham a "fast food joint" does not give the place one molecule of justice. \n\nFirst of all their staff is ridiculously nice, everyone I ordered from were very helpful in identifying what I would like and they are all very patient with customers. The price is also very fair compared to other Montreal fast food joints. \n\nI personally came here sober at least twice and thoroughly enjoyed my burgers and sandwhiches. It really doesn\'t matter what you choose, I truly believe everything on their menu will taste good and be mouth watering. They use a special type of sauce in all of their heavenly creations and any meal you order will fill you up. I mean the food is absolutely unique and different from any other sandwhich place or burger joint you will walk into. In fact, this is my favorite place in Montreal and this is coming from a pretty classy guy that guys to upscale restaurants periodically. \n\nJust writing this review makes my taste buds tingle and my mouth wetter than it was before I started writing this review. That\'s how powerful and tasty their food is. So if you come here, ladies and gentleman, bring extra lower body undergarments because this place has food that will make your body experience something pleasant that you will not forget.'

S'It was an Italian restaurant, now it is more of a "grill". I don\'t think the food is spectacular but I have gone back to eat there. In my mind, Waterloo isn\'t an eating out town. \n\nOliver & Bonacini is located in the Conestoga Mall, across the street from the Destination Inn. And, therefore, very convenient. Both times we ate there, we walked over for dinner. \n\nI really enjoyed the Cesar salad both times - maybe I\'ll make a meal of it if I go back. I had the spaghetti and meatballs the first time and a hamburger the second. Neither dish is something I typically have when eating out but they were both fine.'

Then I was charged 1.50 for a delivery fee....the box says FREE DELIVERY. To top it all off after I called....whoever I talked to....simply said the delivery fee goes to the driver and they are supposed to inform people of that....well I didn't get informed.

Nice TVs everywhere. Lots and lots of comfortable seating. Whoever designed it has the aesthetics on point.\n\nThe music also rocks. They play everything! And the sound system had an upgrade--you can NEVER have enough bass.\n\nBut I know you know you come here for more than sleek looks and cool sound. You wanna know about the drinks. On Tuesdays, specials include $4 Jager bombs and $2 PBR Tall cans. It doesn't get any better than that. There's also a little food menu, but I'll get back to ya when I try that. \n\nStaff was very friendly and down-to-earth. I can tell they genuinely enjoy what they do, and that feeds into a fun environment. Cheers has all the foundations of a successful mainstay in the west valley. Like any new establishment, they'll have a little market research and fine tuning before they develop a solid identity, but it still works smoother than any other new bar I've been to.

The lady asked how my day was and ordered 1 Jr bacon, 1 Jr Bacon plain and 1 breakfast jack. I asked if they still had dollar drinks and the lady apologized that the promotion was over. Had my order read back and pulled up to the window. On the way I decided to add an order of mini cookies I saw on the sign. No problemo. Got my order, the woman gave me 10% off my next order for no reason I could tell and asked if my service was as good as it was my last visit. I told here it was my first visit, but it was awesome and she wished me a happy thanksgiving.  That is like what it should be at the drive through.  \n\nPS  My jr bacon was plain and the cookies were delicous.   THANKS JACK.'

Zun\xc3\xa4chst dachte ich das l\xc3\xa4ge daran, dass wir am "Stammtisch" warteten- er ging aber auch zu den anderen neu eingetroffenen G\xc3\xa4sten, und ich erinnerte mich, dass Bekannte erz\xc3\xa4hlt hatten, dass es bei Ihnen auch so war. \nEine h\xc3\xb6fliche Geste, die mir ob der Tatsachge, dass mit jedem Gast gleich verfahren wird, irgendwie etwas aufst\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9ft.\n\n\n Der Serivce war dar\xc3\xbcber hinaus recht flott und freundlich. Auch ohne besondere Hervorhebung von Details. \nBesch\xc3\xa4ftigt sind scheinbar nur Griechen, was mir das Restaurant wiederum sehr sympathisch macht.\n\n\n Die Karte ist umfangreich- die Preise fast einheitlich im Vergleich mit anderen griechischen Restaurants in Karlsruhe. \nLobenswert finde ich, dass es Gerichte wie Stifado, Kleftiko oder Lammhaxe mit Okraschoten etc. auf der Speisekarte zu finden gibt.\n\n\n Und so etwas musste ich nat\xc3\xbcrlich gleich bestellen. \nDas Stifado war gut, das Fleisch sehr zart aber die So\xc3\x9fe f\xc3\xbcr mich ein wenig zu Fettig und ein Tick zu wenig zimtig.\nGleiches galt mir f\xc3\xbcr die gew\xc3\xa4hlten Vorspeisen. Das Tzatziki etwas zu sahnig, die Auberginen etwas zu blass...- aber trotzdem gut. \nEben gut, aber nicht herausragend. \nMeine Begleitung war mit dem Essen sehr zufrieden. Der bestellte Retsina (Flasche) war gut. \nDer griechische Cafe war wirklich ein griechischer Kaffee- vielleicht schon fast mit zuviel Satz in der Tasse.\n\n\n Auch beim Verlassen des Restaurants wurde man wieder mit Handschlag verabschiedet. Die Servicekraft wartete hierzu extra am Ausgang.\nDas fand ich fast ein wenig unangenehm, weil wir auf dem Weg vom Tisch zur T\xc3\xbcr uns Zeit lie\xc3\x9fen, und ich den Eindruck hatte, dass die Dame nun extra auf uns (etwas ungeduldig) warten muss.\n\n\n Fazit: Gutes griechisches Essen ohne besonderes Plus- au\xc3\x9fer den nichtallt\xc3\xa4glichen Gerichten auf der Karte.'

S"I just wanted a chicken wrap with ranch.\n\nWhen I visited Popeye's tonight, my sister and I went through the drive-thru. While we were at the speaker, we asked about what was in their chicken wrap. We asked a few questions (if there was lettuce and ranch in it, how big the wrap was), but the ladies couldn't hear us and asked us to finish our order at the window. Eventually, we decided on 2 chicken wraps. While cashing up our order, one of the ladies started talking in Spanish to the cashier. Fortunately for me, my sister understood everything. They called us spoiled, complicated, and picky. Just for asking about the products you were trained to sell? So unprofessional and plain rude! Haha, and to finish it off, she put one packet of ranch in our to-go bag for two wraps. Very poor customer service.\n\nAbout the food.. The chicken in the wraps were good. Flavorful like I hoped. The wrap itself was sooo plain. The ladies never told us they put rice and beans in the wrap when we clearly asked what was in it. Obviously ranch would be terrible in this kind of wrap.\n\nI don't like writing these kinds of reviews. I love Popeye's, but I will definitely not be returning to this particular store."

S'The first time I ventured into the Madison Club was for SloPig 2013. As a result of housing an event where I found myself mowing down on salted caramel Sassy Cow ice cream with piggy-inspired toppings on a Sunday night, I\'m officially a fan. By the way, clicking your sparkly red heels as you say "lard funnel cake toppings" will transport you no place but home. If you\'ve yet to fork up the $100 a ticket for this event, give in to those pork fantasies and live...or bask in the glory of your elite Yelper friend who wins free tickets and invites you along.\n\n6 chefs and 6 cocktail masters compete for the SloPig title in their respective categories while a number of other charcuterie, beer, condiment, cheese and seafood artisans dish out their best samplings throughout the tasting rooms. With this in mind, prepping for the night out meant I only allowed myself a serving of cottage cheese and a piece of toast before 6pm the day of. I actually intended to pick up a pizza afterwards because sample sizes...really? Looking back, I wouldn\'t have even eaten anything at all beforehand seeing as I found myself almost [gracefully] coma tucked into a corner of one of the space\'s very charming rooms an hour and a half in. \n\nChef Andrew Wilson of the Madison Club was one of the competitors with a menu that featured items like Country Ham and Miso Cured Vegetable Creme Br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, Schlitz Battered Pickled Porkbelly and Cheese Curds, Kobe Beef Tartare Tacos, Goat Brats and Bacon Baklava. The baklava was a bit dry but this really didn\'t stop me from getting seconds. The creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e was a pleasant surprise with its salty, sweet and creamy goodness. Even though Wilson did not win the SloPig title, I found his menu to be one of the most adventurous with the way he transformed the pig, beef and goat portions he was given.\n\nMy one complaint about this locale would have to be the shallow stairs. Mixing these with irresponsible cocktail management WILL lead to an unintentional view of the beautiful light fixtures hanging from the ceiling. This became clear when a loud thud from a woman taking the trip downwards lead my friends and I to glance over the banister and make sympathy faces. Maybe I won\'t entirely blame the stairs though because, as my one friend commented in order to make the drunk tumbler feel better, "gravity sucks".'

Over $30.00 is ridiculous in my opinion.  I figured it must be really great but that assumption was wrong.  It tasted like any other burger and hotdog out there.  The best part were the Cajun fries.  The order took about 30 minutes, which was also ridiculous.  If I am going to wait that long when there are only 3 other tables occupied, it had better be amazing.

I don\'t think she did know, though she eventually returned with the beverage.\nI ordered a breakfast taco, that was supposed to come with eggs and hash browns. I was served beef tacos instead, and when I took them back, was given something else I did not order. I  gave up. I was hungry and it did taste pretty darn good. The full restaurant probably has better service, and we would have been better off eating at a sit down, time wise. \n\nI think that management needs to fine tune the service here.

S'Today, I wrapped up a weekend of Italian food adventure with a trip to Pizza Fusion in Mesa to check out their organic pies and general vibe.  It\'s very hard to find restaurants that serve organic chow in Phoenix, and I\'m a stone-cold pizza fanatic, so I was uber stoked to experience this joint.  \n\nPizza Fusion is a small multi-state chain that started in 2006, but I never heard of it until local cool person K. Van Slyke (@KrysVS) mentioned it today.  They sling organic flatbreads, pizzas, salads, and beer.  We hit the joint at 3pm for Happy Hour, when drinks and certain appetizers are half-price.   \n\nFirst off, I\'ll express appreciation for Pizza Fusion\'s choice of brand in  my preferred libation, soda water : they offer Boylan\'s, which even for a greaseball like me is a welcome change from the ubiquitous San Pellegrino.  Boylan\'s comes in 12-ounce bottles with nice 50s-style graphics that please the lamp.  My co-diners K.J. Van Slyke, W. Nash, and T. Trainor filled their \'Lil Jon\' chalices with Lost Coast Great White and New Belgium Blue Paddle.  The draft beers were $2 per pint -- unbeatable pricing, especially on a Sunday.  There was a significant selection of organic beers on tap, including an $11 pint whose label insisted that the beer was free of crustaceans! \n\nNotes on atmosphere : the whole place is slathered in strangely-attractive green paint, with digital prints everywhere that are emblazoned with green slogans.  The prints are a little hokey, but nothing really bothered me until I got to the bathroom, the mirror inside which has the words "This person is changing the world" written on the bottom  BAAARF .   Some points were won back, though, after I tried the hand dryer, which appears to be a reclaimed jet engine from a downed MIG or something -- it\'s one powerful blower!  My hands were drier than a boozehound in Bridgewater, Connecticut after about ten seconds.    One thing that was really great was the countertop of the bar, which was made of concrete mixed with recycled glass and high-polished; a cool touch.  The manger told us that everything -- building materials, paint, chairs, etc, are totally green\'d out, made from reclaimed stuff when possible, and LEED-certified.  It\'s a nice gesture for sure.  \n\nVan Slyke ordered up and graciously shared the flatbread appetizer with marinara, which was pretty good.  The flatbread had good texture and wasn\'t too heavily-seasoned (the latter being a common pitfall of wack flatbread); the marinara was tangy and not bitter or overly-sweet.\n\nThere was no pizza Margherita on the menu (what the hoot!?), so we strong-armed our host into making us one, with a multigrain crust.  In reality, the guy was more than happy to make us the requested pie -- super nice fellow with fresh ink on his arm that offered us excellent service and didn\'t complain as we proceeded to nerdily occupy his bar for the next three hours.  \n\nA chicken -topped salad was ordered as well.  The chow was served with good speed.  The manager informed us that 75% of the ingredients are certified organic with the balance 25% being non-certified but \'all-natural,\' pesticide-free. \n\n [This last point is worth mentioning -- I\'ve been speaking about the iffiness of the "organic" certification for a while, as it still allows a fair number of chemicals both natural and synthetic, and foods only need to be 95% organic to meet certificate standards.  Places that eschew bad chemicals completely but don\'t jump through the government hoops to get certified, like Desert Roots Farm for example, are more desirable to deal with than mass-produced "certified organic" producers (many of which have lately been rocked with scandal).]\n\nThe pizza verdict :\n\nThe oblong pie was good, though the most crucial aspect, the crust, didn\'t have a lot to do with my concept of what pizza crust is about.  It was very dense and totally flat.  The denseness is probably partially attributable to the heavy multigrain dough; as an amateur pizzaiolo myself, I can attest that whole-grain doughs don\'t rise as much as white doughs do.   Still, there were no air pockets or structure at all -- weird. So I asked the nice manager guy if they rolled the dough out; it happens that they feed it through some kind of flattening robot before loading it into the fancy rotary oven.  I\'d have much preferred a nicely structured hand-shaped crust.  \n\nOveralll, tasty and worthwhile --- worth the trip.'

Popping in at 6PM, which should have been the peak of the dinner rush, there was only one other table with people eating. I should have taken that as a clue. But the buffet table looked okay (from a distance) and I opted to stick around.\n\nTaking a plate, I selected a few sliced chicken and sliced beef items that were not too dry and overcooked.  Too many vegetables that had been picked over, but if I looked underneath, there was some okay stuff. The plate was half-full. For the second plate, I tried some others. Unsatisfying. About the only thing that helped was that there was hot mustard on the cold table.\n\nDessert saved them from one star. In the ice cream case was a sliced pecan pie. Very strange to have something like this at a Chinese buffet, but with some soft serve ice cream, it was the best thing I had.\n\nCheap buffet eats. The kids will probably really like it."

The pizza was definitely above average, but not enough to make me want to come back for it again.  We chose not to have any alcoholic drinks here so I can\'t comment on the place as a bar except to say that they don\'t have any beer on tap.  As a beer drinker I do not go to a bar for bottled beer, I can have that all I want at home plus I don\'t have to always wear pants.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, but overall it was not memorable or unique enough to warrant a repeat visit.'

S"I come here every now and then since I'm in the area twice a week.  On my last visit the dining area was a little untidy.  And the service was unorganized.  Our meals are supposed to come with corn bread, but we were told they weren't ready yet and that they would bring them out to us when they were ready.  Halfway through our meals my brother checked on the corn bread and was told it still wasn't ready.  Mind you, we were not rushing through our meals since we were there mostly killing time. By the end of our meals I went up to the counter and asked if the cornbread was done.  The cashier gave me a look like I was bothering her.  (Um, the restaurant wasn't packed with people.). She said she could go to the back and get us some.  She could go back and get us some?!  Uh, didn't they say they would bring it out to us with our meal?!  Clearly, she forgot.  We're human, so no big deal.  What annoyed me was that we didn't get an apology from her and she made us feel like we were crazy for asking for the food we paid for.  Left here full, but annoyed."

S'The entire time I was there I kept thinking, "man I cannot wait to review this place".\n\nOkay, let me set the stage. I was walking on my lunch hour and happened to notice a new restaurant in place of the old Chinese buffet place (that was not good) on Liberty. The sign read, "$7.99 lunch buffet". I thought why not try something new?\n\nI could tell the did some general cleaning up of the building from it\'s previous tenants. I don\'t remember the hardwood being so nice or that the flooring was hardwood at all. It was simply decorated, but still decorated. Was it the best? No, but it worked.\n\nAt this moment it\'s only a buffet. Now here is where my issues with this place begin. This is not an Asian fusion restaurant. It\'s an Indian buffet with a few Chinese items mixed in. If I would have known that after I got in and sat down I probably would have left. I even Googled the word fusion to make sure I understood the meaning. I get that fusion means to blend (specifically cultures in this sense), but if it\'s Indian food you\'re slinging then just call it that.\n\nThe food I did try was decent. It bothered me that the food wasn\'t the hottest. There was decent size selection to choose from. I will say their chicken salad was amazing. I never eat anything mayonnaise based at buffets so you know I was struggling for food. Even the Chinese items had an Indian kick to them. This may be for you, but it definitely wasn\'t for me.\n\nThe servers were pleasant and the one waitress seemed very helpful to people who were obviously confused as to what they encountered. I didn\'t like how they don\'t give you a bill, but rather, you just walk to the front and pay. Seems kind of like poor business planning to me. I understand at this point you\'re only selling one food item, but how do you know what I had to drink? I think for the price it\'s worth it if that\'s what you\'re looking for, but I think this is a once is enough place for me.'

S'I\'m glad the 2 previous reviewers had a better experience, but this place sucks!\n\nFirst, we were so in the mood for delicious Thai food during our last day in Montreal. Finally we bucked up on this pedestrian way. We walked it top to bottom then decided okay, let\'s eat here at Wok Et Soupe. Well, what a waste of money!\n\nService - Grade F!\nI have a 15 month old, so they seemed a bit agitated that stroller was taking up space although there were barely any ppl sitting on deck due to the weather. Waitress didn\'t even come to move a chair or to make space. Plus she didn\'t offered a high chair (maybe they didn\'t have one, so ok). \n\nNext waitress (female with a frown), dumped all three menus on table and walked away. About a minute later she returned to ask if we wanted drinks. I asked do you have sparkling water? "yes" waitress with a frown replied.  Ok, so 1 sparkling water, a glass of house white wine - she stops me with an attitude as if I should know they don\'t serve wine and it\'s a B.Y.O.W joint. So I said, oh okay, no worries. Just the water and a hot Chinese tea for my mom. When she delivered the tea and water, my mom asked if she could have 2 packets of sugar, waitress with a frown says, sugar??? (with an attitude). Ugh, okay.  When she returned with the sugar, she tossed them where they landed in the middle of the table and no spoon to stir. At the same time, a male server decides to take our food order.  I realized the water is not sparkling, so I said I\'d like a sparkling water and not flat, he said we don\'t have, so I said okay. I don\'t want the flat water. We proceeded to order a number 22, another combo and my Red Curry Chicken, plus a Thai Fried Rice to go. Well all combos, plus rice was Disgusting! \n\nSorry, I don\'t usually complain, but really???! Bad service + bad food? I just don\'t get!  Now as the previous reviewers said, you have to know what to order I guess. Maybe they should call it the hit or miss restaurant. I didn\'t eat my Red Curry with Chicken dish. The chicken tasted like processed deli meat and the coconut curry was watered down from its original form at least 2x. It was more like coconut oil with spice. I love spicy, but with some passion to its content. There was no kaffir leaf, no basil, not a rich coconut curry taste. Nothing! I\'ve been to Thailand twice, and have enjoyed fine Thai food for years - this place was a joke!\n\nWhen my \'to go\' rice arrived, I got excited to just eat that and ditch my curry, only to open it and to my dismay, even worse. Not even worth getting into what was wrong with this dish.\n\nTo top it off we had no utensils when food arrived, had to call Ms. Frown Face to table to ask her for utensils. She brought 2 then dipped back to the table behind us that had 6 people seated, took one of their fork and knife sets and gave it to us. Lazy and tacky.\n\nAt this point, I was just over the nonsense. I decided I wasn\'t going to choke down garbage for dinner. I quietly went inside to lady at register and said I wasn\'t pleased. I told her I would pay for the 3 meals, although most of it was still sitting in plate, however I wanted fried rice removed from my bill. She didn\'t even ask why, or what happened, instead she decided to get an attitude like a child! I then decided that\'s it! You listen! Your service is bottom of the barrel and the food even worse. Take it off my bill - Thank You! She uttered words in her language to male server and he then tossed rice in trash behind him (right where it should have been in the 1st place) and she grumbled that many ppl eat there and I said - cool! I hope they continue because it\'s not very good. \n\nShe handed me the bill. I decided NOT TO TIP, because it is my Right! Why should I tip for bad service? Bad food is 1 thing, but both...No Way! I\'m a great tipper! I usually leave 18-20% anywhere service is rendered to me. If Ms Frown wasn\'t so awful, I\'d have had no issues tipping, as service is separate from cooks in the kitchen. I know they didn\'t cook the food, but this place was a complete joke. Bad all around. \n\nAs I\'m walking out Mr Server decides he wants to confront me and give me a lecture about ppl in Montreal tip 15% for good service and what did he do wrong? I asked what he did right? He wasn\'t even our server - only took food order. Take it up with Ms Frown Face...she can answer your questions bro. Here\'s your tip! Improve everything all around. Get a new chef, train your staff and rock it out! Otherwise, close the doors!'

Given the name, as you might imagine they have different style pizzas for sale but on this day I decided to go a healthier route and picked out a salad topped with some grilled chicken. The salad was fresh, cold and topped with a decent amount of chicken.\n\nI'm not generally a huge fan of any airport restaurants but this one I probably would eat at again.

Just good flavors and ingredients.\n\nWe ordered delivery last night too, about 8pm on a Monday, the food was here in 30min. I think if they're not busy, it's much faster than what others have stated. We actually planned on giving it 1.5hrs due to other reviews and were caught by surprise.\n\nWe had samosas, pakora, chicken korma, lamb saag, rice and naan. Everything was amazing. Especially the chicken korma.\n\nIt is on the pricier side though. But if you're looking for an alternative to Bombay Mahal type places, this is one of them."

S"As mentioned in the previous review, C's Tasty Bites offers somewhat of a consolation for those about to embark on a boredom drenched voyage up the desolate plains of Dalkeith Road.  It is a small place and primarily offers a takeaway service, although there is room for a couple of people to sit in if they so wish. \n\nThe food on offer is moderately yet surprisingly varied considering the small size of the shop. Breakfast rolls, soups, sandwiches and delicious looking home bakes are available and all offer good value for money. I ordered a square sausage breakfast roll for only \xc2\xa31.50 and was giddy with excitement when I noticed that I had in fact received a roll with ONE AND A HALF square sausages within.  Also, the staff were friendly and the service quick. \n\nAs mentioned before, it's not much to look at. But for a takeaway service, does that matter? I'll leave that for you to decide."

S"I'm not sure where the address comes from.  This place is on Normal (it's in the Memorial Union).\n\nAnyway, I come here relatively often when I'm on campus, and I have to say that I quite enjoy the place.  The food is all relatively fresh, there is a broad menu selection, and tons of fillings to choose from!\n\nI almost always go for the $5 combo.  It's a regular veggie pita, pita chips, and a drink.  Fill that sucker up with veggies, hummus, garbanzo beans, peppers, and toss on a dressing (maybe a bit of italian), and you've got a tasty, health, quick, and cheap meal.  It beats the hell out of the Taco Bell around the corner on freshness and nutrition.  Taco Bell may win on price, but this place wins on value (since you're, you know, getting food and what not instead of, well, Taco Bell).\n\nIf you're not going the $5 veggie route, it loses a bit of it's appeal since a lot of the other stuff can get up there in price.  I've tried other things, though, and they've all been good so far.  The meat, when I get it, is usually very fresh (they grill it right there).\n\nOh, and I know this is weird, but I like their packaging.  The pita's are wrapped in a handy two-piece wrapper.  You tear the top 2/3 off and are left with the bottom as a nice handle.  It's very neat and clean, especially when you get something liquid in there (like a dressing).  It also makes it easily to walk with it if you're in a real hurry.\n\nAll in all, not a bad choice on-campus.  It's a good meal at a good price, and way healthier than pizza or burgers.  Don't make a trip to the Tempe Campus for it, but if you need something while you're already there, you can't go wrong at the unfortunately named Extreme Pita."

I have to admit my expectations were pretty low when I decided to give Fresh a try. I figured it would just be another spot that served "healthier" meals; meaning smaller portions at higher prices. Yes, the prices are a little high. But the payoff is a fantastic little panini or wrap, made with higher quality ingredients, that kept me satisfied for hours.\n\nIf you\'re looking for a bite to eat before an event at the stadium or arena, Fresh is a fantastic alternative in the vast array of traditional fast-food and full-service restaurants that make up Westgate.'

All of which we enjoyed, but nothing to merit the exorbitant prices of the dishes.  The reason why I am giving it only two stars is because it was so over-priced!  Pretty much around 20 bucks a meal...and they even had the audacity to put on the menu that there is a required minimum of $15 a person even if you split a plate!  Kids meals were 10-12 dollars also!  Just ridiculous...I could see paying this maybe down on the strip, but in Southern Highlands?  And on top of that, they didn't even offer refills on the bread.

S"I love BBQ and I'm always looking for a new BBQ joint to try.  Thanks to @keith I found this place.  I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and was shocked that the place was dead.  Located inside Lucky's Lounge, a video poker bar, I expected it to be packed with people watching football....but it was not the case.  There were only 2 people in the restaurant and a handful at the bar.\n\nI decided to eat in the restaurant and sat at a table facing the TVs so I could watch the Chargers game while eating.  After looking over the menu, I decided I wanted to try the Hot Links Sandwich & the Beef Brisket Sandwich.  Both came with sides, but I didn't really want to have 2 sides and asked if I could get just the sandwich.  The server said no, so I ordered the Slaw and Sweet Potato Fries.  I almost got the Beans, but backed off.  To wash it down, i ordered Raspberry Iced Tea.\n\nAfter a short wait, the food came out.  Since I inquired about the Beans, the server brought out a small sample with my order....that was awesome of her.  I decided to give it a try before I ate the rest of my meal.....the Beans were delicious!  They were very tasty and not too sweet....instead of Bacon, they use some of the BBQ Pulled Pork to simmer in with the Beans...you can taste the Pork and I was beginning to think I should have ordered it instead of the Fries.\n\nI went after the Hot Links Sandwich next....there is no BBQ Sauce in the Sandwich, so you have to add it yourself.  I asked my server if they had a Spicy BBQ Sauce and she said yes and provided me a little cup of both the Regular BBQ and Hot BBQ Sauces.  I put a little of the Hot BBQ Sauce with the first bite....yum, it was pretty good, but not too Spicy.  I would rate the kick as Mild for both the Hot Links & the Hot BBQ Sauce.  I then tried it with the Regular BBQ Sauce...it was good too.  The Sauce is not too sweet....which is how I like it.\n\nNext up was the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich.  I decided to put my Slaw in my Sandwich as a topping....and added some of the Hot BBQ Sauce to it.  Again, the Sandwich comes dry, so you have to add Sauce if you want that flavor.  I recommend adding the Sauce.....after the first bite I knew I was in heaven!  The Beef was moist and juicy and full of Smokey BBQ Flavor!  The Slaw & Sauce only added to the experience....I didn't want the Sandwich to end!\n\nI had a few of the Sweet Potato Fries, which were just ok....they were are little bland.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal....I preferred the Beef Brisket over the Hot Links.\n\nWill I return?  Hell yeah!  I want to try the Ribs next time and there are two interesting pseudo-BBQ Sandwiches that I want to try."

S'I wanted breakfast that didn\'t require a long wait or making it myself.  I was probably off best by just sucking it up and making breakfast at home because Lantana Grille was pretty disappointing.\nWe arrived and thought the place was actually closed because there was not a single car in the parking lot and when we walked in, there was no hostess.  But we saw some people sitting so I asked if we just seat ourselves and they replied with "Sure!"-- I guess that is what I would say too if someone asked me mid breakfast at Lantana Grille what to do upon walking in.\n\nThere was a large party in the back, they mentioned that they were in town for a wedding so I am guessing they must have walked over from the Pointe Hotel.  (this explained no cars in the lot).\n\nIt is set up like a breakfast buffet, you pay $15 or $16/person and eat whatever in the buffet.  The choices are limited and not that good.  The best part was the made to order omlets and that is it.  Even the sauasage and bacon seemed to taste off.  HOW does that happen?  So the buffet had scrambled eggs (don\'t eat those-ick), sausage, bacon, french toast, syrup, cereal, fruit.  oh and the omlets-- best bet are the omlets. \n\nService was slow, only one gal running around for the whole place and even though not busy when we got there, there was still a huge group in the back, a small group up front and us.

S"New Restaurant.com merchant so we figured we'd try it and very happy we did. Seems to be family run, good service, very friendly.\n\nWhat I liked about the food was the dishes we ordered were not drenched in sauce. The style is different than other Mexican restaurants we've eaten at and I really like the style they cook in. Everything seemed to be fresh and home made.\n\nChips are different, I think they are their homemade tortillas sliced and fired, I liked them my 13 yo son did not.\n\nWe had two bowls of menudo\nCheese enchiladas\nGarlic shrimp\n\nAll were excellent. We'll be back even without the restaurant.com, although I'm glad they had one otherwise we would have never known about this great hole in the wall.\n\nUPDATE: Shortly after our visit this place stopped taking restaurant.com."

S'A very enjoyable desert course.  We had a fun here.  The ranger and cart girl were nice! The layout was excellent with the desert in play on every hole.  Being from back east, I got a rush trying to blast the ball out of trouble.  Of course, I failed miserably but who cares? The back 9 had more memorable holes than did the front 9.  All par 3s were interesting and challenging.  A few long forced carries over waste areas.  The course was green and lush when we played in mid October.  The only downer was a miserable woman swearing at my friend for driving his cart onto the fairway.  Bleep you if you read this review, sweetheart.  Overall, a must play for those wanting a good value on a course with a private feel.'

S"We decided to check this place out recently.  It was very busy and looks like an established business.  But we have learned that just because a place is busy doesn't mean that all those people have good taste.  It could mean something else entirely.  I think the crowd was mainly because this is a place where a lot of the locals gather for drink and conversation.  \nFrom the outside this restaurant looks a little fancy but inside it is very casual.  I think this works well for them as people feel comfortable to come here as they are and be able to order a variety of very nice entrees.  \nThe bar is nice and big, the sort of bar I like to see in restaurants like this.  Plenty of room.  The dining room is set up like a large dining hall with tables that allow them to create seating for whatever group shows up.  This can be a real positive for large groups.  They could put together a bunch of tables real fast and have you seated quickly.  But the atmosphere is very plain and dull.  \nOur table had a loaf of white bread on it with butter packets.  It was good tasting but pretty basic.  I would have liked a more dense and homemade-like loaf.\nThe menu was moderately priced.  I would say a little high for the atmosphere but some of the meals are a deal.  I got the fried cod which was cheap.  This came with choice of potato and salad bar.\nI also ordered a mixed drink which was well made and priced a dollar less than I expected.  The coffee was inexpensive too.\nThe salad bar is just the basics which was disappointing.  But it was fresh.  It was almost impossible to get to the ingredients in the middle of the service tray.  Thankfully I have contortionist training from time I spent in the circus so I was able to wind my arm down under, up and then down to reach the eggs.  Just at that time a server arrived and started to fill the selection next to where I was reaching which challenged my skills even further.\nOur waitress was pleasant and efficient.\nThe food was warm, not hot and the breading on the fish was soggy, not crisp as I expected.  The fish itself was cooked perfectly and was moist.  But overall our food could have been much better.\nWe were satisfied with our meal and quite full.  The bill was 30 dollars for two which included my cocktail.  So very cheap.  \nSo there are some positives and I can see why people may come here but it is nothing fancy and for some of the pricier meals I would be much happier eating elsewhere."

S"This was a pleasant surprise on an all too common Sunday afternoon.  This was the third choice on the list of lunch spots for Sunday.  We first thought we would try amalfi on 5th (old bruschettas at holiday inn), but they were closed...odd, for a hotel bar, then we drove by 17th st. grille and found them to be closed as well.  We are drawn into folino's initially by the outdoor seating and crowd.  I've been by this place multiple times and had planned to check it out for a while especially after I had heard that sienna miller (of sh*tsburgh fame) was denied entry.  So, we end up at Folino's... too hot to sit outside Annie and I walk in pass a big bar and friendly tatooed gal bartender to duck into the dining room on the right, get a good table in the back.  I'm not sure how to describe the atmosphere, but I really liked it.  There were real paintings on the walls.  THe colors of the wall were very loud, plus there were a few plasmas and everyone seemed to have a smile on their face.  Len joins us minutes later.  The menu is pretty big, I guess it should be mentioned that this family also owns tom's diner or vice versa and you have full access to the toms' diner menu as well as a few more upscale options.  THe gal waiting on us is pretty good, your typical yinzer (in a good way).  She steers Annie away from some dish and seems to have an opinion on most things we ask.  I never order liver and onions, so when I do I want to make sure they are up to par.  I ask the gal about these and from the expression on her face I can tell she's not a fan.  Now, as an aside I think I actually will try them because I'm thinking this has more to do with her disdain for this delicacy than the relative goodness of this liver and onions compared to another.  I settle on a gyro... It's fine, just like any other gyro I've ever ordered for the most part.  Len settles on the peach salad with some chicken.  He says it's good.  It sounds good if only I liked salads.  Annie has the chicken romano.  I'm typically not a fan of this dish, however having sampled this one I may need to re-evaluate my feelings.  It's moist and lightly coated with the egg.  I'm a bit surprised at how much I like it and think I'll have to try again.  I intend to back to this joint if for nothing more than to enjoy the al fresco dining, people watching, live music and to try those darn liver and onions..."

When we arrived, there were only 2 parties of 2 dining.  There were 3 servers & no manager.  We received no greeting & were told to take the 4th booth on the left.  We were neither walked to our booth nor handed menu, whatsoever.  We sat for 15 minutes without one serving coming over to us at all, not even to give us a menu or even offer us water.  We both stood up & walked around & still every server ignored us.  We stood at the cashier counter for about another 5 minutes, expecting the friendly attentive manager who usually checks us out so we could make him aware of our disappointment.  all 3 servers walked by & still ignored us.  so, we left & landed at to Coco\'s on Bell Rd. & 98th Ave., only to be greeted & served as we\'re to be served.  When Fey isn\'t there, things are not up to par.'

S"In an almost spooky coincidence, yesterday I had the exact Bacon, Brie and Cranberry sarnie that Emily T has just waxed lyrical about. It was only second choice actually, due to the fact it was half 2 and they'd ran out of pine nuts, but surely it must be the best second choice I've made in a while.\n\nOn a poppyseed roll, I didn't think it looked that exciting when they made it, but the frankly phenomenal taste sensation I experienced sitting outside Our Dynamic Earth really was something to write home about. You could spend 100 quid in a restaurant and not taste anything half as good. It really was tremendous, and if I remember correctly less than \xc2\xa33.\n\nThe slice of rocky road afterwards looked and tasted delightfully homemade, and I've no doubt that Thyme will be a regular lunchtime stopoff for me in days to come. I wish they had some seating however, as taking my roll back to the office staffroom and interacting with human beings is not something I want to have to do on my break."

S"Great food at a great price.  I ordered three carne asada tacos that came with sides of beans and rice with a medium drink.  My grand total came out to $5.95. I've spend $2-3 more for the same meal at Filiberto's across the street.  The beans and rice were quality.  I've stated before in a review for another restaurant that the quality of the beans and rice can make all the difference.  Many places are generally the same when it comes to the main event of the meal but so many places serve lackluster beans and rice.  Tacos Mexico does not.  Everything about the meal is quality.\n\nThe salsa is legit.  Very hot.  So much so that they have a sign warning people.  It's not too hot for seasoned salsa veterans but for the average, um, white person it might pack a wee bit of a wallop.  It must be authentic style salsa.  I've noticed that some places serve salsa that has a very earthy or natural taste (maybe even bitter).  I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe it but it's almost as if hot peppers were blended or pureed with nothing added.  Bottom line, this stuff is hot and fantastic."

I was near asking for someone else to fix my order because she was so incompetent. \n\nShe finally got it right and I went ahead and slid my card on their outside machine. It said declined.  Naturally I was confused so I looked up my account and all the funding was there plus some. So I tried again and again it didn\'t work. I pushed the button saying my card wasn\'t working in the machine. They said they would send a carhop to me to check it out. 15 min later my food shows up even though I haven\'t paid. So I tell the girl something is wrong it won\'t work. Her response it "well don\'t you have another card?"\n\nI was shocked and honestly peeved off at this point.  I said forget it we don\'t want the food any more and left. I called to complain that she was so rude only to find the manager on duty is a high school kid. Seriously?? You have a high school kid handling problems!? He says it\'s normal for their outside machines to not work. He goes on to tell me "it\'s customary in this day for people to have multiple cards" and that he doesn\'t find her behavior as rude. Are you flipping kidding me? This is why high school students shouldn\'t be the managers. They think it\'s ok to be rude to the customer. \n\nI am livid at this point so I ask where the manager above him is. He says he won\'t be in until six. So I say I want him to call me at six. The kid tells me well that\'s our happy hour. He may or may not be too busy to call me today. Overall the customer service STINKS. There are plenty of other burger joints around town where a person can get the same food with better customer service.'

The lentils were really soft and perfectly seasoned, but not so much so that they overpowered the chicken. I also think I tasted a hint of lemon juice in the jasmine rice, which was a nice counterpart to the heat from the marinated chicken.\n\nI threw on a few squirts of the green sauce for good measure, but after finishing my entire meal, I'm still not really sure if it was a hot sauce or yogurt-based sauce or what. There really is a lot of flavor in the adobo!\n\nSurco is definitely one of the carts to try if you are ever in the area for lunch. I know that I will be heading back really soon, and this time, I'm going to order one of those menu items that I can't pronounce!"

Watch out though they do charge an extra $.50 cents per hot dog to add cheese.  This was a great little snack after a long tough day of outlet shopping.

This is one of the few locations thy has been lucky to have not been remodeled, still the same layout of when I was a kid. \n\n  Employees at this location are nice and friendly. I have seen the same cashier lady for the last 3 years! That says a lot about a location specially since fast food had a high turnover. \n\n Overall the quality of Wendy's has declined for my taste. Prices have increased and portion size has decreased. Buns aren't even warmed anymore like back in the day. If you are missing the taste of a Wendy's burger then this is the place to be, location Is clean and employees are friendly, we were the only ones in the place this evening so it was nice and quiet."

S"I'm really disappointed at some of the other reviews I'm reading here and they are totally opposite of the experience i had a couple of months ago on a Saturday late afternoon.\nMy boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.  The bartender was friendly and attentive without making us feel like we needed to order.  in fact, dinner was perfectly paced (if you go out to enjoy an evening and aren't just trying to shovel food in your face, that is).  We basically already knew what we wanted before we walked in as we had some friends that had been there the week before, but we still browsed the menu to make sure.  We each got margaritas and we agree that they are the best margaritas we've ever had. They were hand-crafted.  no rose's lime juice around the rim here!  the lime was squeezed around the rim.  Keep in mind this was happy hour, so it cost all of $4.50.  \nWe decided to go with the ahi tuna appetizer.  Being a fan of good sushi, i was hesitant to get ahi at a non-sushi restaurant, but i was not disappointed in the least.  The sauce was great, but didn't drown out the flavor of the tuna and the chips were the perfect complement.\nWhen we finished our appetizer, the bartender took our food order.  We both got the surf and turf (crab legs and flat iron steak).  It's a good thing we had time to chat inbetween the appetizer and dinner coming because there was absolutely NO TALKING when food was in front of us as we were too busy enjoying the deliciousness.   during dinner we opted for another round of margaritas because they were oh-so-tasty.\n\nI really have no complaints about this place.  It's definitely a place i plan on frequenting, but haven't had the opportunity to go again.  Plans for that soon and i expect to have the same amazing food and service."

I think you can get pretty much any sandwich "Sloppy Joe" style, which is hilarious but not something I really wanted to try. Salad is a mix of romaine and iceberg. Whole wheat bread seemed like the fluffy wonder bread variety. But lunch is less than $5 i think, so hey, not complaining too too much. They also deliver on mopeds, which is sweet.'

S'Jah bombaclats mi bringing you most autentic review pon a austins carribean cuisine now. Dis aftanoon miya had a rumblin pon mi stomach and mi wanna yam da food. \n\nThat said i found myself near austins and decided i would try it once and for all. My first recommendation to you is to stay away from the jerk chicken. While im sure its fine, their method is inauthentic, they just bake chicken and throw a jerk sauce on it, you can do this at home. A proper jerk chicken is actually "jerked" whereby its marinated and slow cooked, smoked and or bbqd. I opted for the oxtail instead, and boy was i impressed. To the largely whitey  audience on yelp, you need not be afraid by oxtail or its cousin curry goat, they are both delicious cuts of meat and mostly are raised locally (my friend in town farms goats). Oxtail was succulent, saucy, not too spicy, and braised just right. Beans and rice was perfect and even the collard greens were good. Extra point for having Ting, which is Jamaicas sprite. \n\nDefinitely will return. They are even pretty friendly, which is unique for carribean spots.\n\nhear mi now, bob is ya uncle'

Must be something in your training, as it\'s universal. \nPage 236 of the employee handbook, "When a customer orders no tomatoes, you can assume they are delusional. They surely meant double tomatoes. Give them extra and they will see the error of their ways. After all, we know what\'s best for them. They will thank you for it, like Obamacare or the TSA."\n\nThey get three stars because the food quality was actually quite good (once I got my revised version). They were also very quick. \n\nThey would have gotten 4 stars if the lady behind the counter hadn\'t rolled her eyes, as if to say, "This PITA actually wants her order correct?

Although, as I walked around the metal rail to place my order, the lady (thinking that I was probably leaving) said "there is also a Pei Wei down the way if you\'re looking for something different".

The sauce could have been a little thicker though. The bread served on the side is phenomenal.

Our waiter didn't even see us when we sat down (apparently another party so big was blocking our table). He didn't really pay any attention to us either, when we needed the check. And my chicken pasta was quite dry. It actually tasted like chalk. But the rest of the pasta was ok."

S'My son\'s request for his birthday was "Old McDonald\'s"  so since my wife refuses I sucked it up and came here Saturday.  I am not a fan of McDonald\'s or a fan of what it represents, I have respect for Ray Krock but that is about it and I am not sure he would be proud of what he serves today either.  I hope the franchisee doesn\'t hate me for this review but since McDonald\'s targets kids with its toys (I know I used to love to go to this place too as a kid) then it gives me no choice but to speak the truth because I am a loyal Yelper that has kids.  My children of course ordered chicken nugget happy meals so they can get the stupid toy.  I made them get the apples and apple juice.  I had not been here in so many years that I noticed an Angus burger that was now on the menu and looked good in the picture.  Of course it was dry and bland, the fries here are always good but I have since learned that they are not exactly 100% potato so there you go.  I pretty much felt like crap when I left but I wanted to not keep my kids always wondering about this place with the desire to go inside.  Next time if he makes the request I will buy a slice of pizza from Barro\'s across the way and just eat that while my kids eat here.  Sorry McD\'s your food doesn\'t do it for me.'

La Bamba was forced out of State St. by rising rents due to that Pig, The Arts District. Unfortch La Bamba STILL hasn't caught on yet in Monona.

I prefer a Large, Steak, No Beans, Extra Sour Cream. Frankly it's all I've ever ordered at all three La Bambas. Don't confuse this with Pedro's, it's not designed to be a Pedro's,, but if You're hungry in Monona, and time is   a factor, try La Bamba for great Mexican Food... ,."

S"I don't usually review places that I've only been to once, but since this is a new place I'll make an exception to my little rule.\n\nByrd's is average.  That's the best way to describe it.  The decor is pleasant but not that interesting; most new restaurants in the Madison area have the same prairie-style vibe to them.  There are TVs all over the place, which I suppose is to draw in the sports fans, but when I was there there for lunch on a Saturday there were only two or three other groups of diners.\n\nThe food seems pretty good, but again, the menu is average.  They have a lot of burgers and your usual selection of sandwiches, pizzas, salads, and a few entrees.  Prices are average as well; the average at lunch is probably nine to ten dollars an entree.\n\nI ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with home-made chips and it was as good as I could hope for.  The chips were crisp and fresh.  The buffalo sauce on the sandwich was not too spicy and the breading on the chicken was really nice.  It comes with bleu cheese dressing, but the kitchen apparently forgot that (cut them some slack, it's a new business) so it was sent out sans dressing.  I didn't notice right away and had to wait for our waitress to come back to check on us so I could notify her.  She took it back to the kitchen and then came out with the sandwich untouched and a little container of bleu cheese on the side.  Uh, why did you need to take my plate when you could have just brought out the bleu cheese?  I was working on those chips!  Anyway, it wasn't really a big deal and the waitress was appropriately apologetic without sounding insincere.\n\nI was a little disappointed that the sandwich came with bleu cheese dressing and not actual bleu cheese, but I've come to expect it since lots of places do it.\n\nMy dining companions all enjoyed their food, although none of them thought it was spectacular.  I read another review that accused Byrd's of using pre-made frozen burger patties, but if my brother (who ordered a cheeseburger) noticed, he didn't say anything.\n\nI will probably be back if only to try the cheese curd burger.  However, I don't think this will ever become one of my favorite places to eat, given the large amount of similarly-styled competitors and the sheer averageness of this place."

The one thing I have to comment on is that I hate the new automatic response on the drive through. \n\n"Hi, Welcome to McDonald\'s. Would you like to try our hot chocolate today?" \n\nThen there is a pause... and you get a real person. \n\n"Hi, can I take your order?"\n\nUm... No I don\'t want a hot chocolate... it\'s July! Why would I want a hot chocolate? \n\nOh... and if you place your order at the first drive through order box, and you pull up to the second one, because you\'re behind someone you\'ll go through the same ordeal all over again and then you\'ll have to explain to the lady on the other end that you\'ve already placed your order.\n\nThat\'s the price you pay for going to McDonalds.. a headache.'

Quite honestly, being about as far north on Las Vegas Blvd. as you can go, and in a not-so-good part of town (that takes a long time to get to, no less), I wasn't expecting too much out of this place. \n\nI was definitely wrong. \n\nThis place isn't half bad! The food items are all superb, plus they have a decent selection of things to boot. The staff are pretty flexible, and had no problem preparing some chicken fingers for me, even though they weren't listed on the menu. Needless to say, it's mostly BBQ-type items on the menu, however everything I have had here so far was just fine.\n\nThe actual restaurant seating is behind the building, in a small patio area - this is also where the blues bands play that the restaurant sometimes has. There is a fair amount of seating - not a whole lot, but I have never seen every seat full either. \n\nThis place is in an obscure location that is difficult to reach, but ultimately worth it. The food and entertainment alike are both top-notch. It's easy to recommend."

S"I hate writing bad reviews, so much so that when I have a bad experience, I normally just don't write a review. \nBut this was just nuts. \nBrought my whole family here tonight for my parent's anniversary dinner, 7 adults and 3 kids. I happen to work across the street from this restaurant and thought it would be good to give it a try. And it was rated so well on Yelp!!\nWe get here and are seated quickly thanks to our reservation.\nWe get waters from the nice bussers, but it ends up being about 20 minutes before someone comes around to take any drink order. Red flag numero uno. \nFrom then on, it's just one catastrophic circumstance after another. \n*Apparently, as we were informed later on in the night, they only had ONE chef, although they had taken at least 4 reservations that we could see for parties of 10+. \n*Also, there was no manager on duty. At all. On a weekend night, no less. \n*Our server was brand new. She was very nice, and apologetic for the disaster that was our dining experience. Which we let her know was none of her fault. How the management thought it a good idea to throw a brand new server on for large parties with no help is beyond me. \n*They were basically out of everything. If you google the menu, you will notice there is not an extensive list of options. Great, fine with us. But when four different people at our table are told that the selections they've made are out tonight (including my son's pick of MAC & CHEESE), then that's just unacceptable and further illustration of the poor management. \nDue to all of these events and the unimaginable wait time between any kind of event (30-40 minutes between ordering and receiving anything, including drinks), we were pretty irritated by the end of our meal. \nAdded to that stress, the elderly table of 6 next to us was at the tale end of their similar experience, which lead them to complain quite loudly and argue at the table with a rather rude brunette server who was acting as a manager type and hearing them vent. After which, they started to ask our table if we were satisfied and having as bad a night as them. Ugh. \nI will say that at the end of our meal, after my little brother (who has been a bartender for 6 years and was FUMING) tracked down a bartender named Ruben, we were finally given an explanation (ill managed and unprepared) and apology, and were taken care of for out trouble. Ruben was very nice, and had great customer service skills. And although we were nice and smiled through the whole ordeal, I felt bad that he had to face the brunt of all the angry patrons that night, which from my count, was everyone in the restaurant. He's the reason there is an extra star in this review. \nUgh. On advice per Ruben, I may try and muster up the gall to give this place another chance, provided on a different day and only with the server he suggested. \nBut, we have all been warned..."

S'Flavor Flaaaaaaaaaav!\n\nI was driving by this place on the weekend and couldn\'t help but notice the huge sign by the road that said, "Flavor Flavs 99c wings." I returned today to give them a try, as well as snap a pic for my photoblog.\n\nI\'ve been here once before to try their 99c pizza slices. Those were pretty blah and I had no urge to return until I saw the sign. So this review is for the new Flavor Flav chicken wings. As I drove back to the office, the wings had an extremely oily smell and I was expecting a mediocre experience. Fortunately, they were surprisingly tasty, if a little salty. Probably not worth 99c a piece, but decent nonetheless.\n\nI was talking to Nell behind the counter. The Flavor Flav thing is a new endeavor. For now, they just have the basic fried wings that are breaded with some pepper. They will soon expand with a few more flavors, like lemon pepper (called Lemon Time because of Flav\'s clock shtick) and a sweet wing (called Love or something because of the whole Flavor of Love thing).\n\nI gave them my number and e-mail. She wants to contact me once they launch the new flavors so that they can get an opinion on how they taste. Honestly, I\'m not sold on the wings at that price, but I\'m down to try the new flavors when they come out.'

There were a number of things that were rude:\n\n1. The hostess looked like a deer caught in the headlights. She provided no info about the establishment and was not at all warm and welcoming\n\n2. The older male bartender advised me and my two friends to sit at the part of the bar with no machine games, JUST IN CASE the other patrons wanted to hop games\n\n3. He was very persistent that we needed to order our drinks before we can order our food\n\n4. In an effort to be nice, my friend asked "what drinks do you make best" he looked at her in acknowledgment and pointed to me for my order , thus ignoring her\n\n5. As i cash out from playing black jack for 5.50. He ask me to play again so i could lose and he only has to give me an even 5. He proceeds to start pressing the buttons for me.\n\nThis place may he lovely its regulars, but it cant be good for business to treat new comers like this. \n\nNot to mentions the spinach dip was like white nacho dip with green clumps in it'

While labeled as improved, it still was damp to the point of making the bun soggy. I think they keep these things in a bath of chicken broth to maintain moisture.

This gave the girl at the the counter a good laugh...as she said "Oh, how cute". \n\nService - Despite being made fun of...it was great.

S'Yay - a FTR for Gabi K!\n\nLocated on Market Street at DC Ranch, Autostrada is the latest concept in Chef Aaron May\'s "collection" of unique restaurants in the Valley.  Autostrada, which means "an expressway or highway in Italian" serves cuisine from all around Italy.  With a capacity of less than 50 inside and another 45 outside, it\'s small, but the design which includes glass, steel, wood and concrete, gives this hot new restaurant a sleek, industrial vibe inside which goes with the theme very well.\n\nI had the opportunity to attend a pre-opening dinner at Autostrada last night... I believe they will be open to the public in the next few days.  I cannot be tough on the restaurant, as it was their first night open, and I was extremely impressed nonetheless.\n\nWe waited a short while to get seated, but it was a pleasure since the bartender, Erica (aka Red for her red hair) was sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the menu.  They don\'t have their complete wine / drink menu going just yet, but I learned the majority of the wines will come from Italy, and they will also be offering a wide range of cocktails.  We enjoyed a pinot noir and cabernet while we waited.\n\nOnce seated, Shanda took care of us... For our antipasti course, I went with the cauliflower soup and J chose the caprese tower.  In addition to these starters, we quickly made friends with the couple next to us, and the next thing I know, we\'re sharing their cheese plate - hey, nothing wrong with that, right?  \n\nNext up, I had a tiella casserole of grilled veggies including eggplant, zucchini, parmesan cheese and a zesty tomato sauce - it was delicious! And J\'s fettucini with scallops and mushrooms was pretty amazing as well.  We could\'ve stopped here, but we kept going.\n\nFor the Segundi course, I chose the sea bass and J had the veal... this is where Autostrada has a few kinks to work out, but remember, it\'s their first night open... I didn\'t love the fish - wasn\'t a fan of the cold veggies on the plate or the sauce which came on the fish.  The veal however, was fantastic - and I\'m not usually a veal fan!  It was served on polenta - yum!  Our new friends at the table next to us chose the steak and the halibut... and again - steak was a hit while the fish dish - not so much.\n\nWe finished with the dessert that Shanda recommended, the crepes with chocolate and strawberries... omg they were scrumptious.\n\nAs you can tell, we had a lot of food... and our bill proved it coming in at around $100 before tip.  But, we had a lot of fun, made some new friends, and found several other menu items to go back for next time we\'re in the DC Ranch hood... plus, Autostrada will be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week.  \n\nWith the casual environment, friendly attentive staff, and the magical management/ownership team behind Autostrada, I\'m sure they will be a success.  Buon appetito!'

S'Good selection of apps, salads, ramen and udon, sushi and sashimi at reasonable prices. No frills and average to above average flavors freshly made.\n\nHad the veggie tempura (6 pieces mixed of onion, zucchini, sweet potato, and asparagus) with a sweet sesame sauce, small salad (chopped lettuce, red cabbage, carrot with simple soy and sesame dressing), and bowl of miso (very nice). Tempura and miso were very good, while the salad was just so-so. Not bad for $8.50. Wife enjoyed her California and Baked Lobster rolls.\n\nNice to have a quick and easy Japanese place in the area.'

S"I was meadow's mall and my family was hungry and we decided to grab something really quick. FYI - Meadows mall is across the street from spring preserves. I was really shocked how well these little tacos tasted.\nI ordered 12 Tacos, Carnitas (pulled pork) with cheese and guacamole.\nThe tacos had diced onions and cilantro, just squeeze the lime and ... WOW dam good for mall food. I am not sure i would drive all the way from Henderson to get a Taco, I would think about it though :) ... I think the gas in Chevy Tahoe would cost more the meal. If your at this mall for some reason give it a try. I think i should have ordered 4 more. The 12 tacos was shared by 4. The tacos it self is only $1.25 and to add cheese .25 cents and guacamole another .25 cents. Man just writing this review wants me to sneak off from work and grab a bite."

True?.\n\nThere is a wide range of dishes. All delicious to start, but then the wall sets in.. And everything starts to taste the exact same as the plate before?.  Also it could be doing with a little more oomph on the presentation of the dishes. I know it's a buffet.. But doesn't mean it has to look like it?.. \n\nAlso if you do attend on weekends be prepared to listen to drunken customers howl on the karaoke if there is function booked...

Food is of a high standard with all the regular dishes you might expect from a good Italian restaurant. 'Homely' food, rather than fancy....Owner always seems on hand if any queries or requests. Can be a bit noisy when the place is full - which is often! - but to me thats a sign of a good time being enjoyed! Next door take away also offers carry outs if you fancy a meal at home.

S"In a nutshell ... boring.\n\nFor some reason my friends like to come to this place and I've been several times so this review is actually a culmination of all my experiences.\n\nFor starters, ever time I come here they only have one server.  I'd like to say the service is terrible but that wouldnt be fair because there's only one person handling the whole restaurant.  The real key here is that the management/owners (whatever) don't ever get up off their asses and help out when the poor girl is swamped. Look around, you'll see lots of parched people sitting in front of empty glasses.\n\nAnd speaking of management, don't think about bringing a kid here unless you're interested in dirty looks from the old hostess.  Believe me I hate kids in restaurants too but it's 6:00pm and if it wasn't for my friend and his kids eating these mediocre $20 pizzas the place would be dead so sweetheart, yes, you with the grimace, lighten up.  You're bringing the whole dining experience down.\n\nAnd speaking of down.  I've seen several, several, several kids spill full cups of milk on the floor in this place because the owners refuse to stock plastic cups with lids and straws for the kids. You can find stupid metallic covers for your goofy menus but can't stock a lid. Talk about being obstinant.\n\nOK, on to the food.  Not bad, not great.  Not quite convinced it's Tuscan but if you're lost in North Scottsdale and can't find Grimaldis and you stumble into this place you'll walk away with a mediocre Italian meal."

S"6 f\xc3\xa9vrier 2013\nAu d\xc3\xa9tour d'un coin de rue, Bleury et Mayor, je tombe sur un petit tr\xc3\xa9sor de snack-bar qui ressemble, en apparence, \xc3\xa0 tous les Belle Province. Et pourtant, en entrant, on sent bien la bonne odeur de la frite fra\xc3\xaeche doublement cuite traditionnelle. On d\xc3\xa9couvre les sp\xc3\xa9ciaux trios hot-dogs, frites, boissons, etc... Et sans oublier le Club sandwich. Je choisis donc le Club ! Portions g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9reuses, et surtout la salade de choux .... enfin ! une salade de choux pr\xc3\xa9par\xc3\xa9e de la bonne fa\xc3\xa7on : assaisonnement fin, pas de liquide surnageant, une ar\xc3\xb4me marin\xc3\xa9e. Pour la premi\xc3\xa8re fois, je go\xc3\xbbte \xc3\xa0 la vraie bonne salade de choux. Vous n'aurez jamais vu un cuisinier couper un Club comme il le fait devant vous ! Des coups de couteaux clairs, nets et chirurgicaux.\n\nL'endroit est tr\xc3\xa8s accueillant, bien ordonn\xc3\xa9e, bien \xc3\xa9clair\xc3\xa9e, d\xc3\xa9cor\xc3\xa9 d'\xc3\xa9cran o\xc3\xb9 on vous pr\xc3\xa9sente la derni\xc3\xa8re partie de hockey avec \xc3\xa9criteau g\xc3\xa9ant \xc3\xa0 l'ext\xc3\xa9rieur sur lequel on lit les derniers r\xc3\xa9sultats du Canadiens.

Once you step in, you can smell the rich enticing odour of doubly cooked fresh french fries, traditionnal way. On the menu, usual trios, hot-dogs, cola, fries, etc... Don't forget the Club Sandwich. I pick the Club ! Generous portions and don't forget the savory coleslaw made the perfect way for clubs : mildly seasonned, not watery, sweet marinated aroma. For the first time, I taste a real coleslaw made for club sandwich. You've never seen a cook cut a Club like he will do it in front of you ! Clear knife cut, clean and surgery-like.\n\nThe place is well maintained, well lit, nice deco, sports screens with an outside screen band indicating the latest hockey score. The place was a fur store, before, called Hercules furs."

S"Being a UNLV student, I am always looking for a quick bite to eat between classes. I first came to Cafe Mitz with a friend from class and thought that the salmon teriyaki bento I got was a little lack luster, but for the price you can't really complain too much. I came here a second time because I had a major craving for nabeyaki udon, which they had, but the $9 price tag deterred me from getting it. Instead I settled on the tempura udon. The broth was savory and sweet, which I like (I can see it being a little too sweet for some), the noodles were chewy and for $6.75, it was a pretty good meal. All in all, I will definitely come here again (possibly with the BF) - for the udon."

Seriously, the service was absolute gold, and the food wasn\'t far behind that standard, either. Well worth a visit.\n\nOverall, we said: "I really enjoyed the whole restaurant experience in the Spice Pavilion. The service was just great, put you right at your ease, and allowed you to relax and enjoy your lunch at your leisure, in the smart surroundings. It was prompt and accurate, as well as being overwhelmingly welcoming. The food is fresh and flavour-packed, too, thereby ensuring that every aspect of our time in the place was a complete pleasure."'

Judging by the location on the map, I\'m pretty sure it\'s the same place on the Main where I had a poutine and my dining companion had a chicken breast burger: two connected rooms (with two entrances), more of a bar/pub with standard mediocre bar/pub food offering, and ample televisions broadcasting the hockey game...  That\'s the place, right?\n\nI ended up there only because Copacabana next door was packed to the rafters on this particularly exciting game night.  La Cabane, though I\'m pretty sure boasted more screens, had plenty of room to spare.\n\nThe poutine was made with shredded cheese and a peppercorn gravy on fries that were crispier than your average frozen McCain\'s, which was a pleasant surprise.  \n\nFor better quality and value on both the food and beer, I think I better just plan to arrive earlier to Copa next time.'

S"This place just opened so a lot of items on their menu aren't up yet. However if you're a fan of El Pulgarcito de America this is owned by the same people (and within walking distance of the other restaurant, just on the other side of Ben Thanh). You will recognize some of the menu items from El Pulgarcito, though when we went they did not have several things on the menu yet because of the recent opening.\n\nLike El Pulgarcito, our server had minimal English. Fortunately I speak Spanish fluently so this was not a problem for me. The parking situation is definitely better than El Pulgarcito, too. \n\nWhat I had isn't exactly on the menu - it's just the regular breakfast, but they were happy to serve the eggs Ranchero style with salsa verde upon request. The eggs were cooked perfectly, over easy with a runny yolk. The salsa verde was wonderful (a tiny bit spicier than the green sauce at El Pulgarcito). The nice thick Mexican crema went perfectly too, scooping up a little crema for each bite of egg. The steak was well-done, but tender and simply (but perfectly) seasoned. The refried beans come on the side and had a wonderful flavor as well. The tortillas served on the side were thick, like they are at El Pulgarcito, but the crispy tortillas under the eggs were nice and thin. I think this breakfast is, overall, a touch better than El Pulgarcito - which is really saying something.\n\nThe 4 stars is both high in anticipation of the quality and goodness at El Pulgarcito (just Mexican), and not yet 5 stars since my first 2 requests weren't available yet even though they were on the menu. So this rating may change after a few visits.\n\nI did snag one of the little take out menus (from my last visit to El Pulgarcito, actually) so I'll scan that and add soon."

Pretty crude) even still past the Starbucks and then you find the smaller steakhouse called AJ's. It's got a great 1950s styled interior with an open kitchen and really comfortable chairs. REALLY COMFORTABLE CHAIRS.\n\nThe low lighting adds a nice ambience, which is necessary after having to walk through the Hard Rock Casino to get there. Let's just say that I won't ever be staying in the Hard Rock Hotel after checking the patrons who frequent the public areas. I hate to generalize, but I saw so many asses hanging out of shorts and guys with no shirts on a tribal tattoos I was loosing my appetite.\n\nBack to AJ's. Sorry. The service was great. We had to play phone tag with our reservations due to delays at the convention center, but the staff at AJ's was very flexible and accommodating. The servers... All Handsome Men. All of them. Thank you. I love eye candy before my entree.\n\nThe appetizers were tiny. 3 small pieces of Ahi Tuna for $14. 3 shrimp. Clearly, three is the magic number for apps.\n\nThe entrees, however, were of a much more generous helping. And the sides were equally so. We ordered Asparagus, Mushrooms, and the Truffle Mac & Cheese (SO GOOD & RICH). I had the 2.5 lb. Maine Lobster while everyone else at the table had steak. Everything was delicious.\n\nJust don't go on a Friday night. As we were leaving, a concert was getting out and there was a complete blockage at the hallway to get out to the main entrance/exit where the valet is located. More of those 21-year old kids running around too drunk and obnoxious. Maybe a Tuesday night would be better? That's a gamble you'll have to decide for yourself..."

(Typical garden salad, but with mango chunks, but with a nice zesty vinaigrette that contrasts well with the sweetness of the mango)\n\nThere's nothing bad about it, service is always fast and friendly, it's just that nothing about it really pushes it over the top into a higher ranking.  \n\n- Recommended if you just need a Hawaiian food fix and can't be bothered to go to Aloha Island."

S"I LOVE this place. I've been coming here for about 5 years, mostly for breakfast, but occasionally for lunch and dinner, and I've never had a bad meal. There's almost never a wait, great service, and you'll get your food quickly, even when the place is full. We even came on Mother's Day and waited maybe 7 minutes, had great service and wonderful food. This is rare in the Madison area. The owner, Nick, is hilarious and a great businessman. All of the staff are friendly, funny, and professional. \n\nI usually get an omelet or skillet for breakfast. Either one will leave you full - I usually can't finish the skillet. Lots of fresh and delicious ingredients across the board. They have a great club sandwich that I often get for lunch, along with burgers, french dip, and many other standards. Lunch is usually served with fries and your choice of soup (or a salad with a slight upcharge). Coffee is good and your mug will be kept full. Oh, and they just started offering fresh squeezed OJ which is truly delicious!\n\nDinner comes with a bread basket, as well as the soup and fries or other side. They have really nice looking senior specials that are extremely affordable. That being said, the whole menu is extremely affordable. It's a great place for a casual meal."

Good location, easy to get to off of Park  Ave.  There is a free parking deck out back and metered parking on South Blvd.  Outdoor seating is in the shade and the place was very clean and friendly.  Free WiFi is always a plus. Only 4 stars because it is a little pricey; sandwiches are between $7 & $8 and come with either a drink OR chips (other sides available), so expect to pay $10.  Right now there are specials here on Yelp and also at Restaurant.com.  If I could have given 4 1/2 I would have. I would like to try breakfast but they don't open till 8am and i'm already at work.  Not many people in there when I went and I would like to see the place take off because I really liked it; the sandwiches are that good."

S"Staying near the airport in Charlotte on a business trip, I was looking for a dinner place nearby...found the Ranch House on Yelp.  First off, it is one of the only real restaurants in a wasteland near the airport.  Fast food and gas stations abound, so if you are there and looking for a dining option, this is the one.  Don't be thrown off by the hulkin security guard in the parking lot either....the place is fine.\n   One piece of advice...when folks say it is dark....it is DARK.  If you are getting old and you forget your reading glasses, forget about reading the menu.  Hell, bring a flashlight.  \n   At any rate, we were seated immediately (there was a large party having a really good time on the other side of the restaurant) in a booth.  Nothing fancy like tableclothes here...but there are clothe napkins. The menu is very simple....steak and more steak.  I ordered the 22 ounce cowboy ribeye medium rare and that is exactly what I got.  It comes with a salad (chopped iceberg lettuce and two radish slices) and your choice of side (steamed veggies or potatoes).  The steak was fine. I wouldn't put in par with the finest steak houses, but it compared favorably to Ruby Tuesday or Outback.  It was well prepared and was buried under three large onion rings.  A little on the fatty side, but tasty.  I would liken it to the best supermarket steak you would buy and grill yourself. \nUnfortunately, I was under the weather, so other than the house merlot and a shot of glenlivet after dinner, nothing else to report.  Our waitress was sociable.  The atmosphere was utilitarian.  I wouldn't rave about the place, but considering some of the eateries I find on the road, this one was okay.  In other words, I'd go back (for a meat fix).  \nPricewise, this ain't cheap.  My ribeye was $29 and my colleagues 13 ounce boneless ribeye was $22.  \nStrangest thing about the Ranch House....although it is a steak house, there was absolutely no smell of food in the place.  No charred meat odor, nothing at all."

Seems a bit pricey when you can get BBQ buffet style for about the same price. We ended up getting a lunch box and a bibibap. The entrees come with more sides than other restaurants (miso soup, and about 4-5 kimchi type sides) so the portions felt quite generous for our entrees (at about $10 pp).\n\nRestaurant was nice and clean, and service was great. But given the price point for BBQ, I don't think we'll be back unless we're really craving a bibibap (which was great; the lunch box was a bit disappointing as the chicken wasn't very flavourful) when we're in the NDG area."

S"Asian Taste: A home away from home. It is the go to place when I feel homesick and want some Vietnamese food. \n\nI just visited this place in the fall of '14 and I have to say, the atmosphere has improved from last year. Gone is the mainstream American music and in its place is Vietnamese music. They added a few cosmetic items to give the place a more Vietnamese vibe and even a couple fish tanks. Now on to the food.\n\nThe menu has improved from last year and the variety beats anything other oriental store offers for Vietnamese cuisine. I personally enjoy the bun thit nuong. \n\nAs a kid from the suburbs, I've been to Argyle in Chicago and had the experience there. In particular the banh mi is a different experience, flavor and texture wise, from a place like Nhu Lan or Ba Le, but I enjoy the banh mi here. It is also authentic. \n\nIf I were to compare their pho and bun bo hue to my parents, then they would be in serious trouble. Of course, nothing beats a meal from you parents right? I've ate at a couple places on campus that served Vietnamese food and although they were in some aspects tastier, they lacked the authenticity that Asian Taste has. The soups Asian Taste has may seem little bland to other stores, they provide all the condiments that should be included in the dish. Frankly if I were to score the soups then it would be a 4/5.\n\nI think this store will to continue to grow and improve and I do believe that this will continue to be my home away from home."

It was apparent by the fresh flavours that the tabouli salad was prepared only a few minutes after we ordered it.  My Lebanese friend states that you can judge a great Lebanese restaurant by its tabouli and this one is as authentic as they make with fresh Italian parsley and abundance of herbs, tomatoes and lemon (many places cload it with wheat bulgur and not the right amount of parsley; that method is not Lebanese but more Egyptian or other countries calling it taboule; might as well call it a couscous salad, Daou has the real thing)\n\nThe grilled meats were wow factor; especially the sheesh kabob which has some of the  leanest sirloin cubes I have had in a restaurant for a while.\n\nWe finished off with dessert; lebanese crepe filled with ricotta style cheese and rose water drizzle; mmmmgood the Lebanese espresso coffee was perfect to end the meal.

WTH!\n\nWent here today for lunch, it is in the Overstreet next to Brad's.  The restaurant is bright and has dine-in tables or just takeout.  The instructions and options on how to order are very clear and easy to read.\n\nIf you are intimidated about the thought of custom-designing your sushi roll they do have some traditional rolls you can pick from and you don't have to make any choices.\n\nI ordered the Traditional roll which starts out pricing at 3.95.  You can pick seaweed wrap (white or brown rice).  They also have soy wrap and some other options like bowls etc etc.  You can add three veggies (or 2 plus cream cheese).  Then you add a protein - I picked Spicy Tuna and it was 3.00 extra.  You can add what sauce you want like spicy mayo or wasabi mayo etc.  I added 'crunch' on top of my roll for 99 cents extra too.  \n\nThe entire process is very fast and efficient.  All of the ingredients were very fresh and beautiful.  My entire order ended up costing me $7.95 because of my choices.  \n\nAll in it tasted fine.  The only complaint I had was that there was way too much rice and the pieces were so big you can barely fit them in your mouth.  Probably they have so much rice so that you feel like you are really getting a lot for the the price but what it meant for me was that i could BARELY taste the ingredients I picked out.  :-(  I had to throw out the last two pieces because it was just too much rice.\n\nNext time I may ask for seaweed wrap or soy wrap with no rice so I can get some flavor and hopefully the pieces will be smaller.....\n\nAll in all it was A-OK and I will be back since the prices are reasonable and the ingredients are fresh."

Been a year or more since I've been here, but it seems like they've changed. \nFirst of all Chicago dogs are served on poppy seed buns  not sesame seed buns!!!!\nMy companion ordered a PLAIN Chicago dog and they wanted to charge a dollar more for a pickle spear, no relish, no tomato, nothing else but a pickle on it. Its not a Chicago dog if its plain!!!. Its just a hot dog masquerading on that pathetic sesame seed bun.\n The $8.99 Italian beef is incredibly small, and I'm not sure what kind of beef is actually used, but not positive its a Vienna product.  Tables dirty, 1 worker there, incredibly understaffed for prime hours at the airport. Not to mention  I stood there for 3 minutes while my beef got cold under the ledge out of my sight ready. The one employee had 8 people in line . Dear Al, step it up,  your squandering a fantastic opportunity to serve quality Chicago food, and seriously, a $1.05 for a pickle spear when I just spent 20 bucks?

S'My son and I decided to go here after the Anthem Christmas tree lighting; it was well after the crowds had died down. I\'ve been here once before and was not at all impressed so I wasn\'t expecting too much. Well, it was even worse than the first time! My son, being a kid, opted for a slice of cheese pizza which was still in the oven so at least that was fresh. I opted for some spaghetti.  I watched the server put some noodles into a black plastic bowl and top it off with sauce. I looked away for a second and the bowl was no longer on the counter. We stood there  for a couple minutes, looking at the server and others behind the counter for some sort of a cue to see if we should stay there or move toward the register or something. The next thing I see is our server kneel down and pull my spaghetti out of the abyss. I asked if she had just pulled it out of a microwave and she said yes. I told her I didn\'t want it then to which she replied "well, we microwave all of our food". I guess that explains part of the reason why it tastes so bad! I think almost everyone knows that you DON\'T microwave anything in a plastic dish that isn\'t meant to go in the microwave! Even the ones that are meant to go in the microwave are questionable. If my kid wouldn\'t have REALLY wanted pizza we wouldn\'t have bothered to purchase anything from them. Don\'t waste your money here or risk your health by getting toxins from microwaved plastic!'

S'Got a burrito this time ($5.25) for meat, salsa, beans and rice in it. Came with a small amount of chips.\n\nIt wasn\'t a big burrito or loaded like say a Roberto\'s, but it tasted alright. It had about half meat and half everything else so for the all meat burrito fans, maybe this isn\'t the spot. \n\nIf you are a bit meek on spice and say no to them asking if you want hot sauce and ask for "mild", mind you it isn\'t mild. Hot is hot and a red sauce, mild is still fairly spicy of a green salsa. Just sayin\' might want to stick to the pico because I like spicy and it crept up pretty good on me.\n\nEven though I work in the area nearly everyday I haven\'t eaten here except one other time...I guess that says a lot.'

A recent trip to Chandler Mall included lunch at Ruby's followed by a trip later in the shopping spree to consume some milkshakes.  Not a bad way to spend the day (and 5,000 calories!)."

S'Do you ever get that conspiracy theory moment where you think that a business is actually some sort of front for something much more sinister?\n\nLa Fondita is a little hole-in-the-wall mom and pop "restaurant" in beautiful down town El Mirage.  Please do not drive to downtown El Mirage based on my past sentence.  The "beautiful down town El Mirage" statement is what one might call sarcasm.  Remember when you were a kid, and you\'d enter a neighborhood and your mom would tell you to lock the doors?  Now, you are picturing the beauty.  Moving on...\n\nLa Fondita is closed almost as much as it is open.  I drove by last Saturday at 8pm and they were closed.  \n\nI usually just get my food to go from the little window.  The dining room, if we are calling it that, sort of makes you wonder if you have made the right choice eating there.\n\n...but...why, oh, why would I go back?  I really, really like the food.\n\nSome additional fun facts:\n\nOnce, the husband, ordered some sort of burro/burrito type thing that cost $4.95.  He asked for guacamole and sour cream.  When we went to pay he saw that he was charged $2.95 for the guacamole and $1.00 for the sour cream.  He almost doubled the price for his meal!  I laughed heartily.\n\nWhen I went yesterday to pick up an order I discovered another comical sign... Due to increasing cost of fuel and paper products they are charging a $1 per take out order...for me to drive there and pick it up they are going to charge me an extra $1!  Lovely.\n\nSo...anyone know any good recipes for salsa?  It seems I need to learn to make my own.'

S"I just want to say that I am writing this review SPECIFICALLY for the service that we received.  I hope that management reads this and recognizes a fantastic employee.\n\nA friend and I recently visited Montelucia to attend one of their 6 week yoga under the stars classes.  We popped in on 11/12/14   (side note, I can't wait until this series comes back in the spring.  It was very enjoyable).  As the class wrapped up, they announced that Centro was featuring a wine & cheese plate special for anyone who wanted to pop in.\n\nMy friend & I opted to head over.  I could see that there was some type of large dinner party (30+ people) for a special event out in the courtyard and then there were a few tables that were occupied in the restaurant, along with 1 party of 8-10 people.  Otherwise the restaurant was pretty empty.  \n\nWe walked in and my only issue was that we were unsure if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated and we weren't really acknowledged when we came in.  We assumed that we could seat ourselves (lack of a hostess stand) and proceeded to grab a small table outside.  We were promptly greeted by our server and brought menus, both for the wine & cheese special and for the restaurant's regular selections.  Our server's name was Christin.  She was bubbly and friendly and immediately made us feel welcome.  We each ordered a glass of wine and a cheese plate (this plate turned out to be quite large and had 3 generous servings of cheese, a large portion of grapes and some crispy flat bread/cracker type things, along with a small bit of green apple).  Our plates were so large and our table so small, that Christin immediately grabbed another small side table and put it next to us.  Although I wish I'd known what our cheeses were, we dug in and thoroughly enjoyed our food.  The restaurant manager stopped by to be sure that we we were well taken care of.  We never lacked for a thing.\n\nThe ambiance was great.  Despite being local, I'd never been to Montelucia and I had no idea how beautiful it was.  The grounds are gorgeous.  The atmosphere was wonderful.  Christin is a gem and I will definitely explore a little stay-cation with Montelucia in the future.  I hope all of your employees are as wonderful as she is.  I was a little sad that the manager was tending to the large party when we left.  I wanted to call his attention to Christin and how great she was.  Turns out that he was busy being a great manager."

It has 1 pot of oil for frying, one wok for stir frying and 1 soy base sauce and everything goes through all three.

HOT CHIPS?!@()*!()#)!(*#)(@*$ _@($*_ WTF_)*@$_@($_#$()) ... being used to your "more authentic" Chinese food from Hong Kong I was trying to keep an open mind \n\nWe had the chicken chow mein. beef and black bean, egg fried rice and I had the equivalent to mapo tofu (pork and tofu, spicy). Food was good - my Edinburgh-born-and-bred friends said it was really good in quality and taste. Yes, it\'s not traditional but I don\'t think that\'s what they\'re aiming for (or what the local palate demands)..The tofu dish I did have had small slices of pork in it (as opposed to the "more-traditional" minced pork) however I\'m assuming this is again a "regional variation :)" catering to local expectations.\n\nService was fine, as were the prawn crackers served before and fortune cookies served after our meal. Place was busy (with both eat-in and take away orders) which is always a good sign.\n\n\nIn short, food tasty, hot and fresh. Service fine. Reasonably priced.

S'My friend has been telling me of the amazing food delights available in this tucked away little restaurant for a long time now. On a recent Friday night I found myself a couple of pints in and in need of some good food with little fuss. Wandering along from the west end of rose street and really not in the mood for pub grub I remembered about the tall tales of amazing food and inexpensive prices, so I dragged the missus in for some meze. \n\nThe decor is simple and straight forward and the restaurant clean and presentable. I am guessing the man that greeted us with a smile was the owner, as he seemed to take great pride in telling us about the food. He made us feel welcome and was happy to adjust the meze platter to be veggie. Good start all in. On taking in the surroundings a little more I realised the other tables all seemed to be turkish people enjoying food and mint tea. This is always a good sign for me.\n\nOur food arrived and wow a giant plate of what was definately home made salads, hummous, pickles and meze. The Sarma and Zulma in particular were excellent. All this was served with home made pita breads. Big thumbs up all round.\n\nWhen we went to pay I thought the meze platter was \xc2\xa38 a head it turns out this was for us both, so including drinks we had a great meal for \xc2\xa310!! Bearing in mind this was a friday night and easily for bad pub food you are looking at a tenner a head or more. The bench mark is now set for me in terms of turkish food and I will be back next time I find myself in this end of town.'

We went inside and had to convince them that we really didn\'t get everything. They got what we were missing and we went home.\n   My son was disappointed.  I ordered burger plain for a reason.  They were too busy chatting behind the counter to pay attention to the order they already screwed up. No apology. Nothing. \n   I would let this slide if this was the only time.

The staff was helpful in making my portion decisions and even offered a sample of their Adobo Rice...sadly, they were out. BUT THE OFFER WAS NICE! ^.^\n\nThey offer catering \n\nWhen I'm back visiting the fam bam, I'll be back to Rock Spring's Pancit Adobo! I can't wait to go in for some breakfast!

The cheese fries took the longest to come out, but it was understandable as they were fresh cut and firm without being goopy or burned.

S'I thought the food on offer at Blonde was smart and flavour-packed, with a nicely balanced menu featuring a good range of local produce. I went in the evening and boy was it dark! Seriously, the "mood lighting" was so dim that people were struggling to read the menu, and it did impair the appreciation of some of the presentational touches that been applied to the dishes. \n\nIt made me think that this would be the ideal dining venue for a "first date" with someone that you\'d met in a dimly lit pub or club, taken something of a shine to, exchanged numbers, then arranged to meet when less sozzled. If you didn\'t happen to have perfect recall of what they looked like, but vaguely remembered their size and shape, this place could cut through any "cold light of day" embarrassments ;-)\n\nOverall, we said: "I did enjoy my visit to Blonde. The service was a real strength, and the food was quite impressive, without quite unifying in to overwhelmingly convincing dishes. The price tag was very reasonable for the fare on offer, though, so I\'d happily go back, and take friends, as I\'d be confident that the broad appeal that Blonde delivers would please many different tastes."'

S'During the Grand Prix weekend my father and I have found it very difficult to find quality food in Montreal.  We suspect that because of the crowds, normally excellent restaurants are churning out sub-par food for above average prices.  \n\nPrimi Piatti bucks that trend.  \n\nDesperate for high quality food, we ventured away from the city center and explored the beautiful St. Lambert neighborhood.  After a few positive reviews on Yelp we decided to try Primi Piatti.  We did not have a reservation, nor, embarassingly, were we properly attired, however the host Pino took pity and seated us in the outside patio area.\n\nA quick review of the wine list revealed true taste and selection went into putting it together. While some wines that americans are accustomed to having inexpensively are a bit pricey due to import taxes, there are a number of excellent bottles under $50.  We selected the Cellar 8 Cab Sav. for $30.  The bottle was brought along with glasses proper to the wine.  A quick look around and I saw that every wine was being served in the glasses appropriate for that wine.  I also observed that most of the "newer" (2006 and up) vintage old world wines were poured through an aerator.  When our host Pino approached I mentioned my observations and he told us how he is a somolier and he ensures all of the staff is well versed by trying new wines every night.  \n\nOur waiters, Hubert and Pat, made very educated suggestions on their menu and were incredibly attentive and personable.  The ladies reading this will appreciate that every waiter in the house could model underwear as a side job. \n\nThe food delivered to our table was amazing.  I had a wood oven fired pizza with prosciutto and arugula and my father had the prix fix menu which included a creamy vegetable soup, the filet mignon and dessert.  The filet was perfectly fired and the accompanying veg and mash were nicely done.  My pizza was easily the best pizza I have had since Italy.\n\nThe food, wine and service was so exceptional that we returned there for dinner the following 2 nights, appropriately attired of course!\n\nI can\'t recommend this restaurant more highly.  \n\nFinally I would like to thank Hubert, Pat and Pino for being so warm and welcoming.  I look forward to meeting you again.'

The mushroom calzone was actually very tasty and I loved the rosemary garlic bread with sea salt on top.  Not bad price too with the voucher.\n\nI ordered a sprite and asked for no ice and a straw, they did a weird thing of pouring into a short tumbler but then adding a long straw that just kept falling out the glass as it didn't fit.  I quickly ditched that.  \n\nI liked the food and the new d\xc3\xa9cor but the tables were squished too close together and it took an age to get the bill.\n\nThe d\xc3\xa9cor and food are great, the staff were wandering about a bit and not achieving much!"

Upstairs they have a lunch buffet, all you can eat for less than $7.00 dollars.  During the lunch the buffet is always packed and sometimes you have to wait just a little bit to get a table.  \n\n  Anywhere from 2 to some times 3 nights a week I get dinner here, while I'm working.  Lately I have grown fond of the combination lo mien, and crispy crab rangoons. The servings here are  very  generous, I only regret that that the brown sauce doesn't adhere to the lo mien noodles that well. In some dishes I have had in the past the veggies were limp and tasted as if they had been made hours before.  \n\nBecause of having items like beer and broccoli that was less than stellar I haven't been to adventurous with trying other menu options.  The shrimp fried rice also leaves a lot to be desired. \n\nBut because the proximity of this restaurant is so close to my  job, I eat there when I want Chinese."

S'First of all, I\'ve been recommending this place repeatedly to everyone I know since it opened a couple of months ago--it\'s really close to my apartment and I LOVE it, so I want everyone else to go and ensure its success so I can keep eating there.\n\nThe menu is very simple, but it offers a wide array of choices.  A previous reviewer complained that they had to "make too many decisions," but I see that as a positive.  The menu allows you to mix and match pastas or cuts of meat (fish, chicken, steak--portobella for vegetarians) with various sauces, all of which are really delicious.  You can also do a build your own pizza, and I know from experience that they\'re very accommodating about doing a topping that\'s not actually on the menu--bleu wasn\'t listed in the cheeses, but they were happy to put it on a pizza for me.\n\nTheir breakfast menu is a similar model, but they have nice classic entrees like eggs benedict and scramblers.  I got one made with only egg whites (they also offer Egg Beaters), and it was delicious and HUGE--I saved half of it for breakfast the next day and it reheated well.  This is typical of their entrees; the prices are quite reasonable ($10-$16 for most entrees) and virtually everything will make at least two meals.  Their biscuits are awesome; I highly recommend them as a side.\n\nI also particularly recommend: their coffee (I had the medium roast; they also have a dark one), their pesto sauce for pasta, their eggplant "meatballs" (delicious even to non-vegetarians like me and my boyfriend), their french fries (moderately thick-cut), and their wine selection ($5-8 a glass, and all very nice).\n\nI would avoid: their bacon (not very crisp) and the pomegranate martini (almost bitter and not very strong).\n\nIt does seem to me that a lot of their staff is fairly new, but everyone who\'s served me there has been very friendly and attentive and worked very hard to ensure that I had a great meal there.\n\nI haven\'t had a chance to try their bag lunches, but they look good (you can also build your own sandwich at lunchtime).  They also do take-out, so you can call ahead and place an order to pick up, which is easy and fast.'

The deal is absurd.\n\nYou might avoid the coffee, but the fresh baked goods are top notch. Please read this review and never go to the Lakeview Deli so it can remain my little secret..."

S'Ok, I have been meaning to go here forever.  As a Jewish Girl, I like to know where to get Kosher stuff.\n\nI really did not know what to expect when arriving.  The store was smaller then I had expected, but carried a full line of items.  The meat case is where I hung out at most.  I decided to not get any meat here, as I was more just kind of getting an idea of what they carried more then anything else.\n\nThey also have a resturant here, but it was being revamped, so it wasnt really open.  I was kind of dissapointed, but its only temporary.  The staff here is small, but personable and will answer your questions if you should have any.  Please do not be intimidated when shopping here-its not just for us Jewish folks!! Its for everyone!\n\nI would return here in the future, but probably not on a regular weekly basis.  They have Challah, which I love, and one or two other things that I like to have around the house that are hard to find elsewhere around the Valley here at times.\n\nYou should also know that due to the Sabbath, the close early on Fridays, and are closed all day Saturday.  They are open Sundays though!!'

We ordered hot sauce, which the chef/cook usually prepares upon request,  and had to explain it several times to waitress and still never got it!  Even the couple seated next to us had a hard time ordering Chai tea.  The server didn't understand what Masala Chai Tea was?  Not impressed with the server.\nWindowsills, floors and chairs were all filthy!  I had to look for a clean chair as the fabric was filthy and very stained.  Makes us wonder if the outside area where you can see is not clean, how clean is the food prep area that we can't see?  They need to improve their standards.

I recommend locking car doors as a safety measure, especially at night as their drive through is pretty dark. During the day it's probably not too bad but at night, be aware. \n\nThat being said, my son (and I) prefer the cheese they use here, to that of Filly B's.

This was my first scone in over two years and lets just say it met and exceeded expectations! Gf products can often be dry n crumbly but Angelina's fruit scones were just perfect!! Of course the home made raspberry jam and fresh clotted cream just added that little but extra!! \nThe choice of cakes (many gf) made it soo hard to choose.. Lemon drizzle, pistachio, courgette, banana & walnut, pecan pie, apple frangipani, rocky road and I can't not mention the gf caramel slice to name but a few!! All the cakes are baked on the premises and Angelina has a fantastic knowledge of dietary needs which she incorporates into the most amazing cakes! \n\nI'd like to say it's Edinburghs best kept secret but from the constant stream of customers it seems its definitely no secret so if recommend booking in advance to secure a table in the fabulously quaint tearoom! Gf afternoon tea is easily accommodated with advance notice so I will definitely be back soon!! \n\nCannot recommend it highly enough-a must visit in Edinburgh!!"

S'According to yelp, 3 stars = "A-OK."  This place, for me, is exactly that because it\'s cheap, convenient, and surprisingly tasty.  How much can you expect from a bean burrito that is $0.99?  Not much, right?  Well, here at Del Taco, the beans are slow-cooked from scratch.  They\'re not a mushy mess.  Hubby likes the strawberry shakes -- there\'s REAL ice cream in them things! -- and the chili cheese fries (cardiac arrest on a plate, but you only live once).  It\'s a great option after a hike, when you\'re ravenous and want calories NOW.  \n\nI\'ve never experienced less-than-friendly service and you can get as much hot sauce as you want!'

In my previous review, I was very critical of the overall experience and lack of consistency compared to the flavors served at their other Charlotte location. This time around, the food/flavors were good. I order the same crispy red curry duck, the duck was cooked and more tender than the pervious. Also the spice was tack on! They could afford to put a little more sauce on the plate but it was fine nonetheless. Overall, glad that this particular Basil is not a bust; thankful it's closer to the homestead!"

I wanted to complain to manager but was  in a hurry the douche working there is a lil punk.I suspect he made me wait just so he can act like a douche.(on  a power  trip).I work in a restaraunt n the rule is if you\'re ready to order,the time u pull up should be counted.not the long time it took to be acknowledged.

I believe it was 3 AM, and how delicious that all star breakfast was. \n\nMind you, I wasn\'t drunk at even the slightest. So that definitely makes me a credible review. This Waffle House is on of the close ones near my parent\'s house so I come here often. That and it it\'s a mid point between my friend\'s house. It\'s clean, and it\'s not like most other waffle houses.\n\nSo I get this, every time I come here. The all star breakfast: Over easy, hash browns, sausages, and waffles.

However food was delivered promptly and was most delicious.\n\nWe went for the Frascati white wine whcich was crisp and dry and complimented the italian food well. \n\nWe went for a selection of breads with oils to start with - more than enough for two people, whilst our other two companions had mozzarello 'bites' with tomato salsa.\n\nI went for Chicken Medina, a pasta-type bake with chillies, pepporoni, chicken and tomatoes - delicious comfort food! :)\n\nMy friend had the Chocolate gateaux which was very moist and delicious!

I wanted beef samosas but they didn't make them anymore.  The chicken patty is also no longer made.  They had pakora's but I don't want vegetables battered and fried. (I'll eat my calories at Hagen Daaz thank you.)  My eating partner had the chicken boti which comes a la carte but they added about a half a cup of rice as a bonus.  Very nice.  We had the roti which was puffy but nothing to write home about.  I had a beef dish (can't remember name)  that consisted of a piece of beef with a sauce that seemed to have file(fee-lay) powder in it --the stuff they use in New orleans to thicken Gumbo.  First, I had to scoop out about 8 tablespoons of oil from the top of the dish onto another dish.  I spent some time doing this so much so that the owner realized what I was doing.  He politely assured me that it was only vegetable oil (as opposed to butter, I guess). I told him that I really didn't want the calories of the oil (also concerned about stomach's reaction to so much fat, but I didn't say this to him).  So all in all, my eating partner had an average meal and I ending up packing the meal and frankly I don't know what I am going to do with it.  By the way, they served a very tasty hot sauce which is house made.  As I said before, the owner/server could not have been nicer.  I was so disappointed considering I adore this type cuisine.  Wish I could have had a better experience.  By the way, there was no one in the dining room on a Friday night.  Not a good sign."

Go early-pregame to reserve prime real estate; though TVs are visible pretty much everywhere. \n\nOh, and I don\'t advise going within 50 yards of the place if you happen to be wearing Cowboys or Giants regalia or you may... no no... you WILL be harrassed....

They explained how their menus work, one is solely ALL VEGAN and the other is regular. We were also explained how the vegan food is cooked on separate sides of the grill. Overall, great food, fresh made salsas and welcoming staff. It was so darn delicious I had to buy 1/2 dozen of vegan tamales in order to bring them over to my home and share them with my family for these holidays :)  Try it you will not be discontent :)'

I liked the waffle, but Lo-Lo's is crispier and has a little something extra- cinnamon, maybe? I also liked the chicken- at first. It quickly became super heavy and greasy in a way that neither of the aforementioned restaurants prepares it, especially Stacy's. \n\nThe restaurant is fairly small, with a stage at the back for live music on Fridays. I got quick and friendly service. The credit machine was down, so good thing I had some cash. \n\nI will probably be back once more to try the catfish and sides. There wasn't really an option for chicken and sides for their lunch specials. The sides usually make or break a soul food place for me, if their protein isn't stellar."

We ordered a dragon maki which was served in a wine/dessert glass with special sauce. YUM-MY. We ordered an assortment of regular makis and some special ones like the dragon. I came here twice and both were spaced apart. The first time they had only a Japanese menu. The second time they added Thai. Szechuan food which made me a bit skeptical of the quality of the sushi. But that actually made no difference, the sushi was really quite delicious. Very fresh and not too much rice in the makis like some places. The rice and ingredients were well proportioned. (not too much of either rice/fish...but a good balance) Their presentation is nice as well, serving our sushi on a wooden elevated plate. It is pricey though, so expect to spend at least $30-35 per person. Ambiance is nice as well."

S'I popped into La Mirage today to try them out. Their lunch specials are very reasonable. For $5.99, you can choose any sandwich (served on a pita), choose soup or salad and get a fountain drink included.\n\nI ordered up the potato and vegetable sandwich with house salad and an iced tea. The meal also came served with a basket of cut pita bread and some cabbage soaked in some type of yellow oil or sauce. The green house salad was very tasty. Good dressing with a good amount of herbs & spices mixed in. It would have been nice if it had feta on it too, but I can\'t really complain due to the awesome lunch special price.\n\nThe sandwich was good, but it was a little dry. Luckily, my very friendly server brought me out a side of tahini sauce at my request. So if you\'re going to order up one of their "dry" sandwiches, ask for a side of some sauce or dressing too.\n\nOne thing that really surprised me is that they don\'t make or even carry any tzatziki sauce! Seriously?  A Mediterranean spot with no tzatziki? Yep. I overlooked this one small flaw due to their tasty food and their awesome lunch special deals. I\'ll be back to try some of their other stuff.'

S'Russell\'s Restaurant at the College of Southern Nevada is a secret gem that has been flying under the radar for years. Although I love singing its praises, I also am hesitant to write about it for fear that it might become so popular that it will be impossible to get a seat anymore.\n\nLike the Westside Bistro, this is a "teaching" restaurant where all of the staff (cooks and servers) are students. For $7.95, you get a three-course meal with a drink. Each day, a different cuisine is offered. Today\'s meal, for the American Regional Cuisine class, focused on Cajun/Creole. (I also visited last week for Eastern European Cuisines, and the menu for the French Cuisine class is always a standout.) I had lunch with my husband--whom, I might add, is a CSN grad who served his time at Russell\'s years ago. \n\nFor our starters, my husband had the gumbo (sadly, not very good), and I had the Oysters Rockefeller (VERY good!). We both had the muffaletta sandwich for our entree and Bananas Foster for dessert. I\'ve had better muffalettas (including the one my husband makes), but the Bananas Foster was fantastic, from the awesome homemade ice cream to the perfectly balanced caramel sauce on the flamb\xc3\xa9ed bananas.\n\nAs today\'s meal proved, not every dish is successful, but the menus usually offer some surprisingly high-end products that you can rarely get for under $10 per course, let alone per meal. You can check out each week\'s menus online (http://www.csn.edu/pages/740.asp) before heading over to the college. Just make sure to get there well before the doors open at 11:45; once the tables are full, you\'re out of luck.\n\nAs I said, this is a teaching restaurant, so you have to cut the staff some slack. But my one gripe with Russell\'s is that they need to teach their students to speed it up a bit. Service is usually slow, but today it was SUPER slow. Not many of us can take a two-hour lunch! (Although there was a large group of ladies from the Red Hat Society who were eating at a leisurely pace...)\n\nIf you\'re not pressed for time and you want some fine dining at a reasonable price, head over to Russell\'s for lunch. Just don\'t expect five-star service to go along with the five-star menu items.'

That kinda sucks...except we just get our chips and queso and eat that while we wait.  Then they always make us a TON of tofu and it's nice and fresh and hot.\n\n3.

There were two other (obviously retired) people in there playing video poker and listening to country music. The bartender was very nice. If you put in $20 into the poker machine you get free drinks. I had no idea and only put $10 but he still honored it gave us free drinks. I had my usual Jameson and Ginger, and he did not skimp on the shots. There is a jukebox machine, several flat screen TVs, video poker at every seat and ATM machine inside for your gambling convenience.

The sauce is not as rich as other pizza joints. They seem to use a lot of cheese and veggies - meat lovers looks hearty with meat also.\n\nMy main issue is the amount of time we wait each and every time we go in for pizza. The other night rather than call it in, we went there and ordered. One cheese/pepperoni pizza, Veggie Pizza, Turkey Club, and Howie Bread. Not a lot but we ended up waiting 25 minutes for our order. The thing that made me the angriest was the fact that our pizza and sub sat on the counter for an additional 7 minutes while we waited for the howie bread. They did bring the order out to us at the table and apologized for the wait. \n\nI am hopeful in the future they will get there act together. I just don't feel like there is any rush there unless you call in the order and get it delivered? But than we must tip and get charged a delivery fee. Just not worth it.\n\nWe will continue to eat there because it is a great value for a larger family. But might have to see what other competitors can match them ;)"

S"N.D. - I feel your pain because I was there last night too.\n\nWhen I imagined Spain I thought of the wonderful discovery of the tapas concept when I went to Barcelona. Those quick, but delicious bites of food washed down with beer, cava or sangria.... Instead, I now imagine Spain as the longest dinner of the worst tapas, saved only by the company of good friends. \n\nWe also had four people serving us - each so eager to tell us about how they were closing for a week for a wonderful remodel. New lighting, new colors, yada, yada, yada.\n\nTrue, Imagine Spain doesn't exactly conger up trips abroad when you walk through the door. But a new coat of paint and cozy lighting ignores the bigger issues here. The owners should be imagining a new kitchen and wait staff and a new menu.\n\nThere are serious kitchen problems with this restaurant. They could have been overlooked with good service and good food, but this restaurant fails on all accounts. \n\n- Our clearly inexperienced waitress started the night telling us about the remodel - and how they were out of some of the tapas because they weren't restocking their kitchen. Great - would anything be fresh that night?\n\n- It was clear no one was running the kitchen when it took a very long 20+ minutes for our soups and salads to come out. \n\n- No bread refills in that time or check ins to explain why. Just frantic servers standing by the kitchen window.\n\n- When our food did arrive, that's when the co-owner decided to chat us up. Hey, did they hear about their fantastic remodel? Could they make anything better? Trust me I had plenty to say. But I really wanted to eat my salad and I still wanted to give the food a chance to save the day.\n\n- The first tapa out was our fish croquet. My hungry vegetarian friends dived in - only to bite into a ham croquet.\n\n- My friends and I have all traveled or lived in Spain. These tapas were OK, but hardly traditional.\n\n- The final tapa out was the muscles. I love muscles and thought the this dish could save the whole evening. I grabbed one, popped it into my mouth and can't even describe the confusion I had when I realized it was still frozen!\n\n- Our clueless waitress didn't even seem stunned by this. She just took them away and took them off the bill. \n\nAll I can say to the owners is: Imagine This:\n\n- a neon sign to tell people where you are on a dark night.\n- a new kitchen staff - with someone in charge who can run a line and time dishes.\n- step up and talk to your guests. Acknowledge problems before you bring them their food. Bring out bread, olives, drinks to fill the gap if the kitchen is behind.\n- hire experienced servers. It's all nice and good that you're family run. But if your family can't handle more than two tables without stressing out you'll never get more than two tables."

S'This is by far, my favorite restaurant in Montreal.  I try to visit it on every vacation.\n\nThey have one of the most knowledgeable sommeliers I have ever met in my life.  Their wine selection is fantastic and properly priced despite this restaurant being expensive.    \n\nThey have a great wagyu steak that will be prepared as rare as you like.  (which I like).  If you have allergies they will change the menu to accommodate you.  Be prepared for the chef to send out small tastings between courses.  This the fun part!\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant is fantastic.  Request a booth if you can get it.  Very cozy, and discreet for making out.\n\nMy biggest whine about Bronte is that you have to go through the hotel to find the restroom.  And the lighting is all bright, messes with your head after being in a dark restaurant.'

S"I'll be honest. I do not like writing bad reviews, but, I have had way too many bad experiences at this KFC to not comment. I have been coming here on and off for several years. The facility has been renovated and looks amazing. The bathrooms are always clean, but that is where the positive stops. \n\nMost of the time my order is wrong when going through the drive through. Often times there is no flat ware with my order. The wait is always long inside and in the drive through, even when there are no customers in line. I waited in line inside for over 30 minutes with no customers in front of me and no one else waiting for food. Then, my order was wrong. The staff are not necessarily unpleasant, but certainly not customer focused. The food is inconsistent. Got 3 biscuits, one was almost raw dough and the other two were dry and crunchy. The chicken is much the same. \n\nI keep going back hoping for change, but never see any. \n\nAgain, I would usually not say anything rather than write a negative report, but this KFC has been continually under par with bad customer service, wrong orders and inconsistent food quality. Add in the long waits and this is certainly a place to avoid."

I found myself waiting for extended periods of time for service. When I was finally able to receive service the staff was very brief and more concerned with what their friends were up to.\n\n I would not recommend this place. I was able to get a cheap Corona this Thursday night but I had to deal with an incredibly uncomfortable atmosphere.

Wonderful salads and sandwiches.  Even the ketchup is different. As always the golf course and mountain views are beautiful.  Only thing that keeps me from giving the place 5 stars has nothing to do with the food.  I can't wait to try all the different entrees.  It is the staff that needs a little fine tuning.  Hostess seemed in the dark as to the style of food.  No offer of a dessert menu, water glasses not refilled. Maybe the staff just  needs a little more training.

S"Put simply, this place ticks pretty much all the boxes on the Good Sandwich Place list...\n\nThey have a good range of predesigned sandwich fillings if you're not feeling creative, but they're also really patient if you want to make your own...even if you do keep changing your mind every two seconds like I usually do.\n\nThere's the usual choice of white/brown/seedy/crunchy/soft breads to choose from as you'd expect, but the best thing is that when it's full you'll struggle to spend more than \xc2\xa33 on your work of sandwich art.\n\nSpeaking of the fillings, they order them all in fresh every day so you know you'll never get any nasty surprises - no fizzy humus or brown lettuce like you get in other lunchtime sandwich places.\n\nBut the fact that they order it all in that same day does mean that if you go later on at lunchtime they are likely to have run out of the more popular ingredients. Also, they're only open until 3pm-ish so if you get the mid-afternoon munchies then Picnic Basket will not be there to save the day. Instead, you'll probably end up nipping across the street to Scotmid, spending the same \xc2\xa33 on a pre-packed sandwich, and realising all over again just how great Picnic Basket really is."

This turned out to be more food then I thought, almost enough for a full meal.\n\nThe fries were seasoned very well with seasoned salt and came out in just a few minutes. Most of the fries were well cooked but there was an undercooked one or two in my cone. I had the mango and the teriyaki sauces. Both of the sauces were thick white sauces. They both tasted good, but they didn't taste like mango or teriyaki. My wife and I couldn't even agree which was which. The sauces were labeled on top and the one label appeared smudged. I'm curious if we possible got one wrong sauce.  The two sauces my wife got were better, but I don't remember what they were.\n\nThe decor was simple, but nice.

I got the "pina colada" orange Julius and I was totally in Heaven! It was soooo rich and creamy and refreshing! Thats what I needed on that scortcher of a day! It was 5$ and change for a large and worth every penny!!\n\nMy son seen the "triple chocoholic" blizzard and since he did a great job at the HOT mall I rewarded him! I got the mini which was 3.99$ and it took a few minutes to get. Our order was up and the guy hands me the blizzard... it was over flowing with ice cream. Others may have felt happy for this, but I was pissed! It was like 100 degrees and my son had it in his hands less than 2 minutes and the blizzard was ALL OVER the place! I was like ughhhh! Now normally having extra blizzard woulda been ok! But since it was hot as balls out and we had to walk to the car I woulda thought the dude woulda just filled it to the top and not over load it! \n\nWe ended up throwing it away after both of us got it all over our white clothing!

We went on a weekday, so we didn\'t have to deal with cover and there weren\'t that many people present at around 9pm. We are Americans; so I got to use my token French phrase: "parlez vous anglais?" on the bartender as she greeted us in a slew of French. She was real sweet and responded in English "yes, I speak English." Drinks were a little pricey. We also ordered spinach dip and chips, which was very obviously out of a jar, (or maybe it was just that well made, I\'ll never know), which was a very generous portion for only $6. The piano player performed real well. She sang a mix of french and english songs. I couldn\'t understand her when she was trying to engage the audience since I don\'t speak French, but this is definitely a decent place to go for a little live music.

Lunch hour was misery for the Ubisoft building, until B&M opened. All jokes about the name aside, the place was carefully crafted with a mission - large portions, reasonable prices, and variety. Everything on the menu is designed to satisfyingly stuff you - no ulterior motive. Just get in, eat, and get out.\n\nThat being said, it's really nicely decorated inside as well. Everything is white and bright, and it looks very clean and trendy to boot. Service is excellent and prices are reasonable. By the looks of it, the formula is perfect because it's mobbed during lunch hour and on weekends for brunch, as well. And deservedly so. Great spot, try it out."

I ordered once and asked for no green peppers. Green peppers are something that even if you pull them off the flavor stays. I let it go because I seriously am so tired of having to complain. All I want is a decent meal. So, the next week I ordered again. When my pizza showed up with no black olives I called. I told them about the previous results and that I hadn't complained or requested the meal free as advertised. The manager told me that he would credit our bill by $10 and he never did. \n\nThe time spent on the phone when all I wanted was the meal I ordered and for it to taste like every other pizza hut....\n\nI ordered from the Pizza Hut on Watsons and picked up.

They loose a lot of money by loosing customers. I went so far as to contact corporate only Pizza Hut about a year ago about this same Pizza Hut. They didn't bother to answer so it's pretty clear that they just don't care.\n\nI remember back home, we would go 20 miles out of our way to go to the Pizza Hut and eat... Such a shame.

S'Decided to try pizza from here because it is a new place. Service was great. Called in for takeout and food was prepared very quickly. Very pleasant to deal with on the phone too. Thought the salad was great (fatoush), but disappointed by the pizza. Thought the sauce on the pizza was a little too spicy--the spice made the rest of the toppings on the pizza taste like nothing! Also felt like the toppings were skimpy. Might visit again but probably only to get the salad.'

The waitress walk all the way to my place and asked for a specific amount of tips. They don't deserve any tips with such long and terrible delivery service but I do give them since she walks all the way here. However, this is not how delivery service works! You don't walk 30mins to a customer's place and ask for huge tips! And just to be clear, I live in an apartment building so it's absolutely driver friendly. \n\nThis is my last time order for this restaurant ever. Goodbye Chuan Xiang Qing.

S'If you decide to eat at a Jack in the Box in the Sahara and Decatur area, quadruple check your order before you step off the premises (for to go orders). \n\nThey CAN NOT manage to get my order right, even though I eat there 2+ times a week. Either forgetting to include all of the tacos that we order, or just decide to give you whatever sandwiches they want to provide for you.\n\nToday, for instance, I was able to get the last of the forgotten items from my last visit, before leaving, I looked through the bag and verified the proper number of items. I get back to work, divvy up the food and notice that instead of giving me one each of the 3 sandwiches that were ordered, they gave me two of one, and one of another.\n\nThey decided not to bother answering the phone this time, so I guess it is time to go to corporate to try and get this rectified.'

S'We came to Aliante casino to enjoy their new restaurant Cabo. I received a email to come and try the $7.99 All U Can Eat Taco special that is available all-day. The wait time to be seated is about 20 min but that is expected because the restaurant is brand new to the Aliante community. Sitting at the bar is quicker and the bartender is pretty cool. \n\nBut this entire experience turned into something very horrible. Once we were seated and placed our order for two tacos each, it took Cabo exactly one hour to bring the first order of tacos out to us. Prior to receiving our food, we had to complain to the manager that its taking forever and he advised us that our food is now ready to be delivered to our table. Moments later one of our many waitress\' advised us that our order has been lost and they have to start over on making our food. This really had me beyond upset. Once again we complained to the manager and he offered to comp our drinks from the bar and food.\n\nNow, once our food finally came out after many complaints and waitinf for 60 minutes to get it and eating through two baskets of chips, we all thought everything was going to be smooth sailing from there until the one person in my party, who\'s allergic to tomatoes and onions, began to feel really really sick while eating. She distinctly told the manager and a waiter and waitress that she\'s allergic to those ingredients three times before ordering. They didn\'t put the ingredients on her tacos but failed to tell her that they marinated their meats in a tomatoe and onion sauce.\n\nAfter she ran out the restaurant to puke all of her food up the manager kept asking me if I would like another drink and I\'m like "No! You jerk! You guys just poisoned my friend!". Cabo eventually called security who then called the EMT\'s who had to treat her. It was so embarrassing. After being treated and filing an incident report with Aliante Casino\'s Risk Management department we went back to Cabo to get a business card and info of the manager. His name was Joe, he refused to give us his last name, and gave us a business card of Cabo\'s food and beverage director who\'s not even located in Las Vegas. How unprofessional is that?!\n\nOn the other hand, Pricing on food ranges from $4-$18 depending on what you order. They also have a 3p-6:30p on Fridays and that includes $4-$6 and a drink special that include beverages from $4-$6.\n\nOverall, the new addition to Aliante casino is horrid! I will never again in my life order food or even a glass of water from this horrible restaurant. We even told the manager that we\'re affiliates of Yelp.com and he gave us a serious blank stare and asked "What is Yelp?". Really sir?! Smh at this unorganized establishment and its rude staff. The only reason I give this restaurant one Yelp Star rating is because its not available to give them a negative five Yelp Star.'

S"Kudos to this location for pulling of a great fundraising event for my sons elementary school. I only attended this location because my son's school used them for a fundraiser. 10% of the sales were being donated to an elementary school. I opted to park and dine in because it has an indoor play ground. The parking lot is pretty small. They share a lot with a plaza which has at least 2-3 more stores. The drive through access is a little awkward, but what fast food place isn't now-a-days. \n\nAnyway, upon entering I initially thought long line, long wait. Well, they had workers stationed all throughout the restaurant to offer assistance which was very helpful. I was able to find a table for my family and the manager made sure to bring my food which is not usual for a fast food place. I was impressed. There was not much moving space in the dining area. I am not sure if they added more tables because of the event or not. There was staff always visible cleaning and assisting the guests which was great. The food quality was good.

S"This restaurant is associated with the culinary academy so you are the guinea pig of future Executive Chefs.  They start you off with complimentary homemade potato chips and creamy dipping sauce.  The menu items change monthly and the buffet items changes daily.  Therefore, I won't describe what I ate because different items will likely be served when you go.  This is nice because you can go back frequently without getting tired of the options.  The buffet is not super big, like the ones at the casinos, but it has approximately 20 items.  Everything I tasted was very good.  Fresh and flavorful.  They may be students, but the food is prepared under supervision of instructors.  The dining area, kitchen, serving area, and all workers were very clean.  Every person that I interacted with was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The cooking and serving staff are in training and being scrutinized by instructors, so expect everyone to put their best foot forward.  The buffet was around $8.  I think Yelp check-ins get another dollar off.  Great experience.  I recommend everyone try this place.  You won't be disappointed.  Excellent deal for the price."

S'First, let me preface my review by saying that this restaurant is the latest addition to the Montreal restaurant scene, and has only been open for about 3 weeks. I typically wait a month or two before checking out a new place because the first couple of weeks are usually spent ironing out the bugs and perfecting dishes.\n\nLocation: In the heart of Old Montreal, on St. Paul West. Use transit or take a cab unless you want to spend the apperitivo portion of your night driving around aimlessly, looking for parking. \n\nThe space: I loved it! It\'s not too big and not too small, and reminds me of he 40s for some reason. It\'s beautifully decorated, has a great bar area and a beautiful terrace. Dimly light with great music, this place would make for a good date spot. \n\nThe food: I would love to report back with a 5-star review but it\'s just not going to happen. The concept here, is like many other restaurants in Montreal - tapas style dishes that are meant to be shared. Thus, the concept is neither original or exciting, especially when you\'ve got a great place like Dolcetto right next door. These are the dishes we ordered:\n\nButtercup squash gnocchi with duck confit, walnuts, micro arugula and parmesan: Both my date and I loved this dish. It was incredibly flavorful, with doughy soft gnochhi that could easily melt in my mouth were it not for the sheer pleasure that  I took in chewing each delectable bite, one by one. \n\nScallop ceviche, avocado-jalapeno mousse, wild coriander and fresh lime:\nAgain, this was another hit for both my date and I. The scallops were fresh, the avocado mouse was amazing and the combination of flavors just worked damn well. My only note on this dish is that there should have been more coriander, and less lime, as it was borderline vinegary. \n\nGrilled  jumbo shrimp, smoked paprika, garlic flowers on white bean puree: This was a miss for me. First of all, the shrimp were nowhere near "jumbo." Secondly, they lacked in flavor and were a little dry. Lastly, the bean puree didn\'t really taste like anything and there was no hint of garlic anywhere in sight.\n\nRabbit-stuffed beet cannelloni, wild mushrooms, aged cheddar, Pasito wine, Gorgonzola reduction: Absolute, total miss for me. I was looking forward to this dish but was extremely disappointed. I wish I could describe the flavor but I just can\'t. It wasn\'t bad but it wasn\'t great either. I don\'t recall seeing or tasting any mushrooms or Gorgonzola  and well, the dish was just weird, not to mention TINY for the price. The cannelloni were more like large penne than cannelloni. \n\nBison short ribs, slow-cooked in wild spices, black beer marinade on sun-dried tomato polenta: Another miss. My date had to send this dish back because the meat was so tough, she couldn\'t even chew it. When the manager (or someone) came over, he actually said he didn\'t know if the problem was the cook time or the meat. Who says that? Anyway, after much confusion about ordering a new dish vs. getting a new order of ribs, a waiter randomly showed up with new ribs while we were looking at the menu for a replacement dish (as the manager or whoever, suggested). Communication is key here, people. The only up side is that the sauce was good, according to my date.\n\nPrice: NO. Yes, that\'s how I\'m describing it. For the amount of food that you get per dish, these guys are overpriced. For example, those teeny tiny cannelloni (there were TWO) were about $15.  That was the average price per dish, which is ridiculous when I can walk over to Dolcetto, order more food (and a nicer quality) and probably pay about the same or less than this place. Not to mention that I was charged $6 for still water which is ridiculous. The majority of restaurants in Montreal don\'t charge for still water. Furthermore, if they do charge, they advise their clients in advance that the \'still\' water is bottled, which did not happen with us. The up side? The glass of Pinot that I had was quite good and only cost $10. \n\nService: Our waitress was lovely and very friendly. She immediately removed the $6 water charge because we weren\'t advised of the cost when we ordered. That said, there were a hell of a lot of wait staff and bus boys on the floor for the number of patrons that were in the place. I felt like we were playing musical waiters, what with all the different people that came by our table in such a short period of time. Also, some of the wait staff (or bus boys - really couldn\'t tell the difference) looked constipated. Smile - it\'s free! \n\nVerdict: Overall, not a bad experience, but I think the menu needs to be sorted out and the prices need to be adjusted. I\'d be willing to give these guys another go in a few months to see if anything has changed. For now, though, I\'ll have to pass.'

This McDonalds is actually located in the Wal*Mart across the street.\n\nThey used to have workers there that were really unprofessional, but they shaped up their workers recently, I think.  The food is pretty good, can't complain.  Being in a Wal*Mart, they bring out the food pretty fast because it gets pretty busy at certain hours.  I do like this McDonald's and it's good because they're pretty much 24-hours.  Except for that one hour they close at 1am.  ^_^"

This has happened almost every time I\'ve been to this location. My fave thing on the menu is the teriyaki turkey burger. Each time I order it I stress that I do NOT want mayo. The response is always the same "mayo doesn\'t come on that sandwich". Then when I get home and unwrap my meal I find loads of mayo on it. When people say they don\'t want mayo.... it\'s because they can\'t stand that disgusting lard and any trace of it will completely ruin their meal! \n\nSo make sure you check that your order was done correctly before driving home.

However, if you live local, then it\'s a great place to go to.

The beans and red sauce are yummy and I am a red sauce kind of girl.  There are a lot of traditional dishes to choose from and the menu is extensive and full of things that I don't see at other Mexican food joints. \n\nThe decor isn't that creative, but they have a wall of booths snuggled up to a large row of windows. It's neat to eat here on a stormy day, because you can watch the storm move in.  Lastly, I have never had to wait for a table because it's pretty big with lots of room, so it never gets completely filled up."

S"This was one of the few actual culinary experiences that I have had so far in Arizona.  I'm giving it 4 stars, its really a 4.5 review but I'm rounding down on this one because the little things that would have pushed it to a 5 star review just weren't there.  (No amuse bouche, no sommelier, server failed to know what cheeses on our cheese plate were which)  I have other 5 star reviews for places where these things are not present, but here at Methode I expected them since they are trying to be a fine dining establishment.\n\nWe started off with a good bottle of wine, a nice French white recommended by our server that wasn't on the wine list.  It really went well with everything we ordered.  For an appetizer we started with the Camembert cheese baked in croissant dough which is served with jam and a side of strawberries in orange.  It was good and large enough to split, but felt slightly as if we were eating a glorified grilled cheese.  The selection of a more flavorful cheese would have really set the dish apart.  For an entree I chose the gnocchi with braised pork.  The gnocchi was savory and the pork serving was bountiful and tender.  My husband selected the roasted chicken with sage beignets, he was intrigued by the idea of a sage beignet which turned out to just be a deep fried sage leaf and not really at all like the beignets we are accustomed to.  The chicken itself was moist and flavorful, and the portion was much larger than what he was expecting.  For dessert we selected the cheese plate (which was good, although limited) and followed that with a chocolate pot du creme which was heavenly.  My husband also had a cappuccino which was very good.  \n\nThe atmosphere and service were perfect compliments.  Even before we had arrived, the host was very cordial and accommodating when making our reservation, trying to fit us in even though he had a full dining room and a private party in the lounge.  Our server was attentive without being obtrusive, replaced our flatware between courses and folded my napkin seconds after I had excused myself from the table.  I liked that even the host would periodically stop by between courses and make sure everything was going well.  Since there was the private party in the lounge/bar area we were in the side dining room but the bar/lounge looked lovely.  (They offer a happy hour that I really want to try, 3 tapas for $10 and half off all beers and wines by the glass)  There is one table in the dining room in which we were seated that was a large old oak table topped with candelabras with gobs of melted wax and a beautiful flower arrangement.  I loved that table so much I wanted to come back with a group of friends to be able to sit there!  (If you are coming with a group I would definitely request it)  Although there is no dress code I noticed that most men were wearing jackets, and failing that, collared shirts.  \n\nAll in all Methode was a lovely dining experience, one that I would not hesitate to repeat.  Our final bill came to $150, including a $55 bottle of wine, which is very reasonable.  For a small bistro in a strip mall in Scottsdale it was quite a find."

S'Loved this place. The family run restaurant instantly set us at ease. It was rainy and windy out and this place became our sanctuary from the unforgiving elements.\n \nWe started out with a lovely garlic bread bruchetta. The bread was homemade goodness and the tomatoes vine ripe perfection. My only issue was that I had wished I wasn\'t sharing it because I wanted those two pieces of love into my mouth. \n\nNext I had the breaded chicken which came with a very traditional side of spaghetti with marinara sauce. Now let me say something, normally when I go to Italian restaurants I don\'t go for pasta dishes unless I know they are homemade pasta and absolutely glorious bits of food. Otherwise in my mind I feel like its a waste of money to order something I can easily enough make at home myself. So after having said that I wasn\'t thrilled to have received the side of pasta with marinara sauce BUT (yes this is a very big BUT) I LOVED IT. Once I tried it I couldn\'t stop eating it til it was all gone, and after it had all gone into my belly I wished there were more of it. The sauce was perfection, fresh tasty vegetable love. I was sad until I took a bite of the truly glorious breaded chicken. WOW! That was amazing.  I love deep fried food, but am very fussy cause I don\'t like it to be stodgy or too greasy. This was golden and juicy and just fried enough to make my mouth water and want to bite into it again and again and again, til it too was all gone. And I wanted more. But thank god after a few seconds my brain finally received the "i\'m nice\'n full" signals and I sat back with a big smile on my face feeling like I had just eaten some food that was going to do my body some good. \n\nAbsolutely delighted with this place. Defo coming back.'

S'Blue Burrito is the little place that tries hard.\n\nGo back, say ten years, and this store would be a very hot item.  That\'s before Chipotle started their global conquest. But we cannot go back in time. Well, at least not yet.  \n\nBlue Burrito makes your burrito along a assembly line process.  You choose how you want it -- burrito, bowl or salad.  Sound familiar?  Then you choose which meats or fish options you want.  Finally, you add your veggie fix-ins.  And, poof!  You\'re on your way.\n\nOkay, I need to back up.  The meats and fish are basic, though good. The tortilla comes in either  flour or wheat.  Most recently I tried the wheat and found it tasty.  The veggies they offer, come in only a small quantity and appear to be reasonably fresh. \n\nSurprisingly, I\'ve found their Veggie Burrito the best and more interesting than either the meat/fish option.  It had a lot of flavor and they didn\'t up-charge $2.00 for the Guacamole!  LOL  I\'ve never understood Chipotle on doing this, since avocados are normally two for a buck.  \n\nSo, go to the Blue Burrito. It\'s what Yelp\'er Matt D said, a: "good mall burrito".'

It seems to be more vegetable trays during the evening. \n\nSeating can be an issue especially with the middle aisle. Spacing is sort of like Rubik's Cube.. very tight and difficult. They could alleviate the table congestion by removing one table in the middle. But then again, I don't think comfort is an encouragement. Obviously, the longer you stay the more food you'll consume. LoL\n\nThe foods are authentic home style heavy and rich Filipino cooking. If you can ignore the casualness and sometimes the playground atmosphere when undisciplined children are present, it's an eating experience that may trigger an instant gout attack."

S'So, my client in Montreal decided to take a New Yorker to a place called "Madison\'s NY Bar & Grill". I knew from the beginning that this wasn\'t going to be a 5 Yelp experience, and it wasn\'t. I\'ll keep this one brief:\n\nRestaurant:\n+ & - It\'s a chain, I loathe chain restaurants but it was large, clean and the staff was friendly.\n\nService:\n+ We had a really quirky waiter whom at first, confused us if he was a man or a woman. His wack-a-doodle hairstyle, his feminine ways of speaking and conducting business had us quite confused...however upon further visual inspection of his chest area, led us to believe he was a male. With that said, he was still a fairly efficient waiter handling our party of 10\n\nFood:\n- I stuck with a grilled chicken salad as everything else on the menu seemed unappealing to this New Yorker. It\'s not any different than any other chain restaurant and the calorie counts on the dishes they\'re serving are quite high\n\nOverall, this seems to be a very popular spot for the local professionals and gets quite busy during the lunch hour but I don\'t think it\'s worth a re-visit upon my next trip to the beautiful city of Montreal.\n\nTHIS has been a review by Gaurav'

S'I ordered the Triple Play, which includes spaghetti w/ meatballs, salad, and garlic knot.  I arrived there at 12:15 and they had no spaghetti noodles prepared...huh?  They told me it would be a 5 minute wait but it turned out to be 15 minutes, much longer than I would want to wait at a food court.  They offered nothing as consolation for my longer than expected wait.\n\nThe salad was packed in the same to-go box as the spaghetti, which I really hate.  This always results in spaghetti sauce getting in the salad and dressing getting in the spaghetti....disgusting.  I asked for a separate bowl for the salad so I could separate it, so I was saved this time.  The garlic knot was very small.  Had to order a second one, which for some reason seemed to annoy the cashier.\n\nThe food was decent.  Everything was fresh and tasted fine....about what you would expect from food court italian food.  Based on the food, I would give a 3 or 3.5 rating, but because of the long wait, single-box packaging, and sad garlic knot, I give it only 2 stars.'

Meadowlark Cafe is part of Meadowlark yoga and serves food and drinks (primarily juices) to cater for people with allergies and the health conscious. That said, aside from juice and soup there are a few sweeter options, many interesting looking cakes and quiches (one vegan option).\n\nUnfortunately the vegan cheesecake which I read about in other reviews wasn\'t there, so I decided to opt for a pint of the "Green Godess" smoothie. It consisted of kale, kiwi, banana and probably something else. For a green smoothie it was quite sweet and tasty though the kiwi made it a little bit too tangy for my liking. Regardless, it was a good energy boost and powered me through a bit of uni work.\n\nThe staff were very nice and the atmosphere in the cafe was quite relaxed.

The Chicken Chow Mein tastes absolutely delicious though, which happens to come with all of the Combinations and All-Day Specials...which are a good deal at $4.95 and $6.95 respectively.\n\nThe items are rather hit and miss on the menu. I enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken and Szechuan Chicken, but everything else has proved to be rather disappointing. I was very disappointed to find that the Honey Garlic Chicken is essentially the same thing as Sweet and Sour Chicken, only with a nastier sauce. \n\nAs mentioned before, the Chicken Chow Mein is fantastic, but the Chicken Fried Rice is pretty horrendous. The two times I\'ve had it, it was relatively tasteless and there were pieces of uncooked rice in the mix. The meals also come with an unremarkable Egg-Drop soup...neither good nor bad.\n\nAlso, they REALLY skimp on the meat to vegetable ratio. I order my food without vegetables at this place, and the guy behind the counter always cheekily asks,"So, you want Chicken Chow Mein and a little bit of meat." That\'s already sort of what I was expecting, but I thought it was a bit goofy that he would just come out and say it.\n\nHonestly, this place is worthy of skipping. The only reason I ever tried this joint is because I did my laundry at Launderland three doors down. Now that ithe laundromat is out of business, it\'s likely I\'ll never return to D&B.'

S"Mio was a delight.  The flavors were unique and rich, but the food was refreshing and not too heavy.  The wine list is extensive and sommelier is available at the drop of a hat to advise you about each and every possible combination of wine and food Mio offers.\nThe decor is dim and soothing.  It was quiet and peaceful when we arrived, but got louder as the later reservations arrived--although it was never too loud.\nMy one complaint would be that there is an extremely limited number of options for vegetarians.  In fact, there is nothing on the entree menu.  However, when we asked we discovered that there is an off-menu vegetarian plate that proved to be quite delicious according to my boyfriend.  I enjoyed an amazing mesculan salad, delicious monkfish (which I've never tried before) and finished off with a petit lemon tart--yum!"

S"Finally got to go here after ages of trying to get organised. I'm really glad I tried it, and would have given more stars if the service was bit better.\n\nFirstly, let me say that the sushi is great here. The rolls are big, and the nigiri sushi is good sized and nicely done. It's pretty good compared to any of the other sushi places I've been in Montreal, and great when you consider it's an all-you-can-eat place. \n\nThe decor is nothing special, but that's not something that really bothers me when the food's good - and it's good here.\n\nWe came nice and hungry so that we'd get he most out of our meal, but unfortunately the service was really slow. The servers were really nice and helpful, but the food took ages to come out. From what I hear from friends who go there regularly, it's completely normal. It didn't help that they waited to bring out most of the table's orders at the same time (there were six of us). While I appreciate the effort, this isn't fine dining - it's ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi.\n\nThe Chef's Special (lightly fried chicken) is a great way to start, and the tempura was really good too. If you order too much and don't eat it all you might get charged an excess fee, but we had a few pieces left over (about 6, after ordering 50 pieces) and it wasn't and issue.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it (especially if it's convenient for you/in your 'hood), but just be aware that it might take a while."

I was dumbfounded how average every single item on the sushi and hot bar was, and how forgettable pretty much any detail about the place was. The price was good, but to be dredged in such mediocrity seemed like it wasn't really worth it after all. \n\nGo here if you want a lot of food that won't make you sick: The American Dream."

S'I was highly impressed with La Garrigue. The onion soup was the best I\'ve been served in a French restaurant in Edinburgh. We had an issue with their coffee, so shared our review with the restaurant. Next day they commented on the blog to say that they\'d spent time re-training their temporary staff, who were working when we were there, to ensure that better quality coffee was served in the future. I don\'t think you can ask for more responsive service than that, so well done to all concerned.\n\nOverall, we said: "On a rainy Edinburgh day, La Garrigue offered heartening dishes, and sent me nutritionally and spiritually restored to face the slings and arrows of outrageous afternoon fortune. I\'d heartily recommend that you pay it a visit, to sample its good quality, well-presented dishes."'

I love the pizzas from here, they are really tasty and crisp, good toppings and you can see them being freshly made infront of you. They also make a mean calzone.  \n\nThe chip shop side is where my hubby comes in as I can't eat the chips as they are not veggie as cooked in beef dripping.  My hubby says that's why they are so good!  I will have to take his word for that.  They also make their own chip shop sauce.  In Edinburgh you don't get asked if you want salt & vinegar, you get asked if you want salt & sauce.  anyway they make their own and it must be good as their is permanently a bottle of it in our fridge at home that apparently goes with EVERYTHING!"

Streamers doesn't quite fill that void, but it's the closest I've seen.\n\nThe food was pretty good.  My hamburger didn't have enough salt, but that was easily remedied.\n\nThe big plus for me, anyway, was the chocolate malt with chopped up cherries in it.  I love cherry-chocolate malts, and their version was the best I've ever had!\n\nMy wife got the Skookie (skillet-cookie) which was also excellent.  It takes about 10 minutes to cook, so if you're ordering it as a dessert, you might want to place the order before you finish your meal.\n\nOur server, Nicole, was positively amazing.  She took our order without writing anything down -- which wasn't too remarkable for a table of two -- but then she also took orders for a table of more than six people without writing anything down!\n\nDon't visit the East valley without stopping by Streamers."

I go here almost every sunday and promise myself to try something new, but keep going back for the same amandine and pistachio 'thing', not sure exactly what it is, a rectangular treat with an incredible taste and base, served on a little gold piece of card with a mini knife and fork. It is an absolutely delicious treat, melt in the mouth. Another thing I love here, the apple and salted caramel treats with an equally delicious base. I wish the chef lived in my neighbourhood! Or maybe I don't, or I would spend way too much money and constantly be on a sugar high. That said, the portions are small and so beautiful that I take my time with them, savour the deliciousness. \n\nThe tea menu here is also fantastic, and the leaf teas are served in pretty little oriental teapots.

S'Honestly, I\'d give them zero stars after today\'s lunch but that\'s not an option. Hubby and I realized that we needed to eat lunch before hitting Sam\'s Club. Especially Hubby, he\'s the King of Impulse Shopping and, at Sam\'s, that would mean junk in bulk!\n\nWe had two combo meal sandwiches, total cost of $19.42 (just think how many cases of licorice he could have bought for that!)\n\nFirst, his... he got the chicken salad with the broccoli-bacon salad on the side. His description: "I\'ve had better chicken salad from the gas station, two days old and wrapped in cellophane." I declined his offer to have a taste. The broccoli-bacon salad was almost good, but not quite there. It was dry, and needed "something". Hubby ate about 1/4 of his sandwich and one taste of the salad, tossed the rest.\n\nNow for mine, the smoked turkey breast. I had wanted to try the pasta salad but they didn\'t have any, so I got the potato salad. The potato salad was boring, just an average mayo covered potato salad (tossed after tasting). The turkey sandwich was the main crime. The sandwich was smoked turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato & mayo on a bun.. along with what they called hickory honey mustard. I could only taste one thing, honey. MASSIVE amounts of honey, it was like an entire bear was dumped on there. Hubby tasted it, he gagged also. \n\nOn a plus note, the cans of Coke were fine. \n\nThe clerk had asked for our phone number when I was ordering... my  phone number?!? I asked why, the owner/manager guy said that it would use our phone number to access a database and pull our email address so they could send us coupons! I declined, horrified at this massive intrusion and misuse of data. When did it become acceptable to invade privacy like that? Never, when it regards MY life!\n\n8/15/14 Update: Added a star for the owner\'s great customer service attempts.. she did everything and then some to try to make up for this. I refused her offers, because I thought the sandwich was THAT vile, but her stellar attempts are worth a star upgrade.  \n\nIf she had offered to let me take all their containers of "hickory honey mustard" to a shooting range and promise to never allow that vile concoction back into  the store, then I might have agreed to give them a 2nd chance.  ;-)'

A few times I have been there at closing time, and they did not try to rush me or make me leave. I am always very impressed with them. \n\nThe wine selection is amazing. They have wines you can't find anywhere else. They also have some craft beers, but I'm not a beer person. I've only ordered food there once, but it was pretty good."

S'I have not visited the restaurant itself, but my wife and I ordered from them recently. I\'m actually writing this review because we just ordered from them again and are waiting for our food to arrive.\n\nHere\'s quick breakdown of our last order:\n\nThe catfish fillets are really awesome. Putting a chunk inside the included bread and slathering it with tarter sauce was as delicious (and junky) as you\'d expect.\n\nThe fried shrimp are of reasonable size and taste fine, but they\'re nothing special. One way to judge fried shrimp is to ask yourself if you\'d still enjoy them without any cocktail sauce, and in this case, it\'s hard to give a "yes".\n\nThe fries were good and reasonably crisp; maybe if they had been fresh (instead of delivered), they would have been great.\n\nThe fried mushrooms weren\'t so great. It\'s hard to pin down exactly what the issue was, but something about the flavor just wasn\'t doing it for me.\n\nMy wife ordered the chicken tagine. I only took one bite, but it was pretty delicious.\n\nOverall, I really, really, really want to give them four stars for the delicious catfish-and-fries combination and for the interesting Moroccan menu items, but the lackluster shrimp and mushrooms is holding me back.'

S'We had a problem with EVERYTHING here.  Literally everything.\n\nWe had a school function at 5:30, so 3 of us went here for dinner beforehand.  Got there at 4:30 and were the ONLY people in the restaurant section (other patrons were just 2 people playing pool and 2 ladies at the bar drinking).  We looked at the menu and ordered at 4:40.  The waitress repeated the order to us and had everything correct.  That\'s when the problems started.  Here are my list of complaints:\n\n1.) We ordered at 4:40, but did not get our food until 5:15.  Remember, we were the only people in the restaurant and we had to be back at school by 5:30.\n\n2.) Because we had about 10 minutes to eat before we had to race back to school, we asked for the check right away.  The waitress disappeared with our cards until 5:25.\n\n3.) While stuffing our food down our throats because it took 35 minutes to make 2 wraps and some sliders, we noticed many things wrong.  The french fries were burnt and hard.  My friend ordered a club wrap, but they sent out a bikini wrap.  We didn\'t have time to order another one and, oh yeah, our waitress hadn\'t returned still.\n\n4.) She brings back the bill and my friend lets her know that the wrong food item was made for her.  The waitress says, "Oh. Sorry.  I must have entered it wrong."  and WALKED AWAY.  No offer to take it off the bill.\n\n5.) They charged me $0.75 for my side of ranch to dip my burnt fries in.  Really?\n\n6.) Waitress never checked on us or refilled our drinks.\n\nNeedless to say, the food was poorly prepared, service was nonexistant, our order was wrong, and they charge for ranch dressing.  We were also 10 minutes late getting back to our school.  I will never go here again.'

S'Fail.\n\nCame here for iced tea. Why is it so difficult to find iced tea? Anyways, I asked specifically if they can make an iced tea, was told yes. So after telling them the two teas and sizes I needed, they brewed them in their appropriate hot cups and then handed them to me. I asked if there was ice for them "ohh yes!"\n\nSo she pulls out this tiny little plastic cup, maybe MAYBE half the size of what the hot cup was and said "this is all we have for iced tea" it was literally a sip. So it being all hot and steamy i just said fine, and watched as she poured all of the tea down the sink to put just a little in these tiny cups. \n\nAnyways, the rest of the cafe seems like a nice place to hang out in.\n\nI think i am all set unless its hot tea.'

I\'ve had my fair share of diner-type restaurants in California; being that we have Denny\'s and Norm\'s in abundance over there. I\'ll have to admit though, this Village Inn. has good food like most I\'ve tried but truly stands out for their fantastic customer service! I\'ve been here on three different occasions and all have been pretty consistent (food and service). One other thing that I like about this location is that it\'s one of their newer restaurants and I personally like "new" and they have FREE WiFi to boot.

S"It was late Wednesday night/early Thursday morning.  The fianc\xc3\xa9e and I were hungry and wanted something to eat before calling it a night.  We made our way to 24 Seven Caf\xc3\xa9 in the Palms where we staying.  Oddly (but fortuitously), the hostess seated us in Fortunes, the Chinese restaurant inside 24 Seven Caf\xc3\xa9.  Other than the fact it was newer looking, had a fresh coat of paint, and was minus the stereotypical Chinese knick knacks and prints/posters depicting Chinese landmarks or scenery, we felt like we'd been transported from a casino to a family-run Chinese restaurant in a non-descript strip mall.  I say that as a very good thing.  \n\nFortunes' late night menu offers a wide selection of Chinese fare to include an abbreviated (from their regular menu) dim sum menu.  We split orders of the Fish Maw and Crab Soup ($7.99), Hot & Sour Soup ($3.99), Szechuan Black Pepper Steak ($14.99), and Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf ($4.99) and Shrimp Dumpling ($3.99) dim sum.  First, portion sizes were generous.  Second, the food tasted surprisingly fresh made and not as if it had been sitting around for hours waiting to be served.  In the case of the black pepper steak, it came out sizzling hot like a plate of fresh grilled fajitas.  Third, and most importantly, the food was for the most part outstanding.  The bowl of fish maw and crab soup held an ample amount of its namesake seafood.  The beige colored soup's flavor was mild and without an off-putting fishiness.  It was my first experience with this soup, and I liked it.  However, I loved the hot & sour soup.  Its natural earth tone colors were pronounced, as the ingredients didn't look muted or washed out.  It was properly salted and, unlike many hot & sour soups that I've tried, it didn't shy away from showing off its spicy and sour notes.  It was the best rendition that I've ever had!  The previously mentioned black pepper steak possessed the trademark Szechuan spiciness, but not to fear, it was far from taste bud searing in its peppery heat.  The three shrimp dumplings were plump with filling and nicely steamed.  The shrimp were flavorful and, thankfully, not overcooked and rubbery.  The only miss of the evening/morning was our two lotus leaf wrapped bundles of sticky rice.  The rice wasn't that sticky and seemed under seasoned or missing some key ingredient.  It wasn't bad; it just wasn't nearly as good as everything else we received. \n\nI'll be the first to admit that I don't know how truly authentic Chinese food should taste.  That said, I do know what tastes good and the Chinese fare at Fortunes, even after midnight, tasted good.  What a pleasant surprise!"

The cupcakes were the red velvet and the chocolate with strawberry icing, and I would highly recommend both of them. Extremely moist and the frosting was delicious and tasted faintly of coconut. The cinnamon bun was good but a bit dry, and the carrot cake was so-so but had delicious chunks of walnut and raisins in it. \n\nI also ordered a coffee and the chai rooibos tea. The way they serve beverages is really cute--there were mismatched cups and we had our own little teapot with an infuser. The employees working there even offered to give us more hot water for our teapot, which was really nice.\n\nOverall, a really delicious experience, and a nice place to hang out for a bit.'

We were out of there in 40 minutes, which is perfect when you only have an hour for lunch..\n\nI wanted sushi so I ordered the Shrimp tempura roll with deep fried shrimp, imitation crab meat, avocado and cucumber for $6.95. Of course I would have preferred fresh crab meat, but was ok with the imitation. I liked the meal presentation. Food is served on large rectangular plates. \n\nMy coworkers also enjoyed their meals, except one said the salmon was frozen and thawed.

Now upon eating here I can agree it is like Swiss Chalet, only better.\n\nThe staff were friendly and helpful even with their limited English and our limited French.  They have English menus, you just have to ask.  \n\nAfter placing our orders the waitress asked us if we like our coleslaw traditional or creamy.  We all figured that our meals came with it and we had the option of which type and just hadn't noticed it on the menu.  NOPE! A minute later she comes back with a heaping side plate of slaw to share.  I found the slaw to be a little heavy on the oil and not heavy enough on the vinegar.\n\nWhen our meals arrived we were surprised at the large portions for a lunch menu.  I ordered the double leg meal.  I devoured the meaty thighs on my plate like Neil would devour breasts at a fried chicken place (or in a busty woman's bedroom).  The meat was tender and moist, though slightly on the greasy side, and fell off the bone.  \n\nInstead of fries I had a caesar salad, which was also fantastic.  It was rich and heavy on the garlic.  It was a caesar that I would expect from a 4 star restaurant.\n\nUnfortunately my group and I were running late and couldn't try the dessert that was included with our meals. Next time I guess.

The Chips were good and there is a salsa bar, I only like the mild one, the salsa verde didn't taste like anything . My husband ordered the American tacos, he thinks it was just ok. This place has an arepa and empanada special on Thursday and I will be coming back for more."

S'Was staying at the Stratosphere and went to top of the Tower to try this Sandwich shop. Was not disappointed at all. Not only was the food wonderful and delicious but Eddie and Luz had great customer service. They following night (after bragging about it all day to our friends) we took our friends to try it . Eddie went above on beyond to make our experience sitting there eating our sandwiches while looking at the view to a VIP status. He remembers his customers!!!! The Sandwich Carvery 108 will be a must when ever I visit Vegas. Even if I have to pay to get to top of the Tower.'

S'Great restaurant located in scenic old Montreal.  A must if you are looking for imaginative cuisine made from local products.  For me, it was a new twist on French Canadian cuisine.  I had flank steak served with poutine (gourmet style).  I enjoyed some tasty Canadian beer too.  They also have a great wine selection and a comprehensive menu with a variety of meat, poultry, and fish options.  A must....check it out!'

S"I dined here Friday, Oct 21st with 3 friends. We trenched all the way to try their \xc2\xabXiao long bao\xc2\xbb Steamed pork dumplings. We were giddy with excitement. \n\nAt 7ish PM on a Friday night, we were asked if we had reservations which we hadn't. The girl consulted a humongous reservation book and arranged us in a corner spot. Not a huge place but pretty comfortable and clean. Our waiter explained that they were out of the Xiao long bao, the main reason we came there. Damn. Was it really 7pm, how could they be out of steamed pork dumplings?!\n\nWell that is not going to deter us from getting a great dinner. The waiter confided that in order to get the dumplings, it's better to make a reservation ahead of time to guarantee us having some next time. Good to know fellow yelpers!! See if that works for you. \n \nOnto the food...\nWe all decided to do their $35 tasting menu. It was something like an 11 course meal. First 6 are appetizers. Not going to list the full menu but we all agreed as a group that the soup (fish broth soup) was excellent, and almost all of the appetizers were superb. The main dishes were not as glamorous or anything special to mention. It was pretty average, although their General Tao chicken was different from all the other's I tried (which I usually dislike) but this one was actually great. \n\nI think if we had stopped at the appetizers this would've been a 4 star review. \nThe service and staff were excellent, and attentive. The restaurant filled up pretty nicely during our meal and there was only one waiter, one runner and the reservation girl also helped bringing in dishes. It seemed a harmonious working order and they covered all the tables quite well. \n\nEnd of story, I would def recommend this restaurant. Bon appetite!!"

Naturally, I ordered the first thing I saw because I am frightened by gross fast food like this, but I had to "try it" since I was in North Carolina for the first time. I ordered the Southernest thing I could find which was the Cajun chicken with biscuit buns and potato fries. It was gross, but delicious at the same time. If I am ever in the state, I will never try it again. But if Bojangles is at the airport, I will stop by on a layover.'

S'I do have to say that before you read this review, I am the last person usually to like pizza from the large chains. But even bad pizza is still pretty good. I have to judge the pizza up to true pizzeria standards though. I decided to try ci ci\'s because I am always hearing people talk about it. Well it did not live up to the hype. The restaurant itself was not very clean, the food was sub par and honestly I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. Everytime people walk in they say "welcome to Ci ci\'s". But everytime there was a couple of workers that would have to drag out the ci ci\'s part and it got really annoying for me to hear every 30 seconds. As for the pizza.... they do have some interesting types of pizza. However, the pizza was very bland and tasted like cardboard. It was very obvious that they do not value good and fresh ingredients. I most likely will never go back to any ci ci\'s'

I rarely see them seating on the back patio, i dont' think it ever gets THAT busy.\n\nthe used to have pretty good HH specials, like half off apps and half off draft beers and well drinks. it's been about a year since i went, so don't hold me to that. they have a large bar seating area, with booths, so if you're required to sit in the bar area to get HH specials it's not a pain.\nwhile dining on the patio once a bird literally crapped right on my plate, which was funny because i had just been told by a friend who worked there that when that happens, they don't HAVE to do anything about it (like give you another meal or a refund). but i was cool about it, not a jerk, and the server happily took it off the bill ( i was pretty much done eating anyway).\ngood little mill ave pizzeria with lots of action to watch if you're not feeling particularly discrimantory about really great pizza."

On a great weather day, sitting outside and watching the people stroll by, there isn't much better.  Mind you, you can't do that often, but it's wonderful when you can.  It's the closest I've seen for feeling like you're sitting at a Paris market outside a busy street.  \n\nThey have great sandwiches too.  And if you aren't in the mood for my ideal lunch fantasy, they can still help you pick out a great glass of wine to go with your sandwich before you run over to see a move at Esplanade.  Or, buy a whole bottle of wine to enjoy after the movie.  I've always been given great assistance in picking out the perfect bottle.  I can almost taste it now...."

And when I say regularly, I mean weekly. I'm sure I've ordered several hundred pies from this place, so I know what I'm talking about. The crust at the Sahara location is definitely a little thicker. \n\nBut even if that is indeed the case, it's still the wonderful greasy New York pizza that I've come to love and crave. \n\nI highly recommend the cheese pizza. I am not  normally a cheese only kind of gal, but there's something special about their cheese blend - it's just so sweet and luscious.\n\nAnd their buttery warm garlic knots...mmmmmmmm!\n\nChicken fingers and wings are available in plain, mild, medium or hot and their french fries are big and thick, no shoestring fries here.\n\nTableside service and quick and friendly."

It looks a bit more lush than the others from the outside with a stark black and gold sign to attract the customers.

I went for their doner with salad, mayonnaise and chips.  The meat was fairly greasy and I've certainly tasted better in the area, but the salad was fresh and the chips weren't bad.\nMy mate had a pizza which looked okay, although there seemed to be a bit of grease on the top.

An old gentleman approach me who I'm assuming is Baba and greeted me. He was very friendly and asked if it was for there or for take out. I ordered the special which was fried rice, 1 entree (orange chicken), egg roll and egg drop soup and a drink for $5.99. Pretty sweet deal right? With tax it came out to be $6.45 which is no problem. It took about 10 to 15 minutes to prepare my food which I thought took a while for chinese since I was the only one there but I it could be just my stomach being a pansy at the moment. While waiting I used the rest room to wash my hands and to my surprise was a very clean looking rest room so I thought that was nice. Anyways, I got my order left and ate my food. I was a bit disappointed with the portions though. Maybe I got used to the portions you get from Panda Express where they blob and pack your to go box with your order but this one had a lot more room to put more fried rice in. The food was okay. It wasn't what I was expecting for Chinese either as the fried rice didn't seem at all greasy. You can look at these in a negative or a positive way. If you're trying to lose weight, watching your portion control and craving chinese, then you'll get a bang for your buck and satisfy your craving. If you're feeling pigging out on some authentic chinese and have a few more dollars to spend, I'd say look elsewhere. Over all, I'd definitely come back to this place, especially if I'm on a budget. \n\nLocation: 3/5\nCleanliness: 5/5\nCustomer Service: 5/5\nTime: 3/5\nPortions: 3/5\nTaste: 3/5\n22/30 =73%"

Their chicken is always downright tasty and moist (I'd suggest asking for some side bbq sauce - it brings the meal to a whole other dimension!!) and I have a hard time deciding on sides. You can't go wrong with mac n cheese, vegetables, corn, stuffing and sweet potato yams. The cream spinach however seems to be different each time we order it. The cornbread while still good seems to have been reduced in thickness. I've also had the chicken pot pie and so scrumptious.

It costs $5, and includes a coupon for a free drink when you get back from the game.\n\n+1 star: The bowling alley looks nice. It's a small space, but clean-looking. I don't know prices. I'll give them the +1 for appearances.\n\n-2 stars: The food is terrible. TERRIBLE. After the WIS v UTEP game, the wife ordered boneless Buffalo chicken wings. They came out deep fried and hard, with almost no flavor -- there was NO BUFFALO SAUCE ON THE WINGS! (We think the B-sauce might have been fried onto the chicken, but, if so, the flavor was lost in frying).\n\n-1 star: The service was lacking. Following the game, with all 50+ people who had just come back on the Badger Bus, there were only 2 servers, and they were also the bartenders! Service was slow, haphazard, and careless -- the guy never once asked how the food was, nor did he ever actually stop at the table except long enough to take our order. Drinks were dropped on the fly, the food was all but thrown as he whizzed by ...\n\nOverall, 2 stars. I'll go back for the Badger Bus and the bowling, but I will NEVER eat there again."

S'From the looks of the place, you probably wouldn\'t have high expectations.  They have a very limited menu: rice (white and brown), veggies, beef, and chicken.  That\'s about it.  But, of what they do have, I will say: good flavor, good quality, cooked well and very reasonably priced.  "The Works" plate I ordered was only $6.50 and it was huge.  The beef was rib-eye (one of the tastiest cuts of meat in my opinion) and it, along with the chicken, were perfectly grilled.  Not undercooked, not overcooked, tender and moist.  Also, I was impressed by the fact that they offered both white and brown rice.  Comparable places only offer white rice.  Sometimes, its those little things that make a difference.  \n\nIf you liked Mai Island Grill, but not the price, the crowd, the line, or their hours, then you will most likely like Chix.  Personally, if Chix added a tasty mac salad, I would say it would serve as a suitable replacement for Mai Island.'

Give them a go, and drink in the oh so fruity amazingness!"

S"Since I work late, I stop by here about once a week to pick up dinner on my way home. This is usually around 1 a.m. when there is no long lunch line. Still, there always seems to be at least one customer hanging around. I am usually greeted pretty quickly, food is made very quickly to my specifications, and what can be more simple than that. I only give it 4 stars because once I came to give in to my sweet tooth and they were totally out of cookies. But, it was 3 in the morning and if I would have waited a whole six minutes I could have gotten some. But when you're tired and you just want to go home, six minutes is a long time.  Other than that,  no complaints."

S'I moved to the area about 6 years ago, found this place quite by surprise while on an early evening stroll. Very much in an unassuming place, it would seem only the locals would known it exists if not for the menus that arrived in my mailbox that I finally found it. Since I had been a fan of Mamma`s and Coronet for the past 5 years I decided to try this place to compare. I ordered the pizza, special no1 (minus the olives) and was FABULOUS!! A hefty pizza for a `small` the bacon was perfectly fragrant & crispy, the dough was cooked through and the cheese was nice and stringy. Although I have only tried the pizza I feel this place deserves more merit and support as it is on my shortlist for return visits.'

It took them close to 45 minutes to make the sandwich. The sandwich itself was average at best with pretty basic ingredients. I think that $9 for a basic roast beef sandwich is a bit steep too.  The waitress had no idea what any of us had ordered when she brought the food out (I ended up getting charged for a Reuben). The bright spot of the lunch were the potato chips. The chips were excellent with a subtle ranch seasoning. The whole lunch experience took almost an hour and a half.\n\nI probably won't be coming back."

What has bumped Bristo up from a 3 to a 4 for me though is the fact that they serve West beers - oh what a lovely site to behold, the West chalkboard of deliciousness!

A friend of mine went today and we are writing this together.\n\n"Expensive, bad food" was the first thing out of his mouth, as he soothed his stomach all afternoon. Seriously awful, if there was a zero stars button. . .  Palomino is stuck in time, and probably never had a heyday. \n\nI have to disagree with one of the reviewers below as it is not a good spot if you are in a hotel in downtown Pittsburgh.  There are a handful of downtown dinner spots which are far superior, and family run to bout. Seek out Greek, Indian or even classier \'Nine on Nine\' for a lovely treat.'

S'We just picked this place out of an Entertainment coupon book. Yes, we just went to some place because we had a coupon. Trashy, I know. But something good came of it. \n\n(I also found a Siena Bistro coupon on restaurantdotcom: http://www.restaurant.com/microsite.asp?rid=317919&mcn=00013609) \n\nSo we had trouble finding this place because I\'m a retard and I didn\'t know it was on a golf course in a residential area. And the building is kind of inconspicuous. I mean its not camo\'ed or anything, but there\'s no obvious signage. Anyways its part of the clubhouse. \n\nWhen we got in, some guy was just like, "you can sit where ever" so we sat by the windows. We got a nice view of part of the golf course and some waterscaping. Yo man, it was like the National Geographic up in that place. We saw humming birds, ducks, and a heron. A motherf\'ing heron! Our waitress said there used to be wild horses, too. My ass. \n\nThe dinner menu we ordered from was surprisingly short. But looking at the menu online there\'s more of a selection. Did all four of us miss two whole pages of items? wtf, mate? \n\nOur waitress was really effervescent. She said she worked there because the food was so good. But I dunno if I belee dat because she was super skinny. \n\nAnyways, my mom asked for some recommendations on a wine. After she ordered, the waitress brought her a taste of something else before giving her the wine she ordered. Nice hard sell, lady. \n\nShe dropped a basket of dinner rolls. They were really tastey, but hello ghetto. They were covered with what looked like a slice of melted parmesan cheese. Yeah ... But they were good. Shoot, I had two. Apparently they only serve bread on Wednesday and Thursday nights because those are the only night they\'re open late, 9p (psh). Otherwise they stay open to 7p. They open at 530a. \n\nHard-sell waitress also convinced me to get the Toasted Pecan Salmon Steak Salad ($10) over the scallop salad and she told my aunty to get the pesto because its "swear to God, the best" she\'s had. I don\'t know if she was convincing or if we\'re easy. \n\nI asked her to ask the kitchen to undercook my salmon and the temperature was actually perfect. \n\nMom got the Chicken Angelo ($15), a really good dish. It looks like spaghetti but its spaghetti squash with other veggies. I would\'ve got that dish, sans the chicken, but its a big honkin\' chunk a chicken. \n\nMy aunty got the Chicken Pesto Orecchiette ($12) which was pretty good. It was a creamy pesto. I don\'t know. Pesto is pretty hard to eff up. Saying you have the best pesto is like saying you have the best rice. Yay. \n\nMy cousin got the Surf and Turf ($25). One of the other waiters was like, really excited for him. Are these people new? Or does their employer just take really good care of them? I do need a new job ... Anyways. My cousin said it was alright. The surf part was prawns (looked like scrimp to me). \n\nFor dinner my cousin got the ecalir. According to the menu, "The Best Eclair Ever." If its says in print its the best, you better bring it. Cousin said it was a\'ight. Maybe it was the biggest eclair ever ... \n\nMy aunty got the Bananas Foster, which was made "traditionally" where they light it on fire and let the flame cook off some of the rum. Presentation was nice. A scoop of butter pecan ice cream sits in a Florentine cup made of caramel and almonds. All in a rum caramel sauce (really rummy! Hello, DUI) with sliced bananas and candied pecans. \n\nMom got Cajun Fire-Flashed Strawberries. Whole strawberries in a lightly spiced caramel sauce, with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Okay, this was weird to me. The spice was just enough to make me think I was allergic to strawberries. Weird. \n\nWe got there at 6 and didn\'t leave til 8. Service or the kitchen was slow and we were only one of two parties there. There was another server working, meaning we were our server\'s only party. There must\'ve been something fun going on in the kitchen. \n\nBut we got to watch the sun go down and we could almost see the whole strip. \n\nThe whole vibe I got was we were paying more for ambiance than the value of the food. But the portions were perfect for me. And with three glasses of wine, three drinks, four entrrees, and three desserts, the whole bill was only $124 before discount and the tip. Really reasonable. \n\nI would totally bring my grandma, aunty, and mom here again. I would never bring my friends here. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino'

The only healthy thing on the menu was a tilapia dish which they wouldn't let me order cos I'm not a 'senior.' Am I not a paying customer? Who cares how old I am?! So anyway, I ordered a veggie burger with fries and rushed back to my hotel. Why? Cos I just couldn't sit there any longer! As I waited for my food, I noticed a humungous hair ball on the floor which kept blowing in towards me in the wind each time the door opened.

S"The Haven is a tale of two stories. On one side, delicious 'Taste of Haven' - a rather tasty, sleep for an hour after consumption, tray bake treat that the Silent Reviewer and I shared. On the other side, was the paninis and service. \n\nWe were in a rush. The SR wanted fish and chips from Porto and Fi, I, looking at the time, said, no - let's go to the cafe/deli on the corner and grab a quick sandwich. \n\nThis was anything but a quick sandwich. I read a whole magazine in the time it took to make our sandwiches, for the ladies behind the counter to flirt with and serve other customers, and do the washing up. It wasn't busy and there was only one other customer I recall actually being served anything in the entire time we were there. The paninis, once made were barely warm (lightly toasted, not burnt which is of course a good thing), and really made me wonder why it took so long to put some mozzarella, tomato and pesto in a bun. The time we were hoping to save was hopelessly lost, with us waiting a good 30mins+ for a sandwich to be toasted. While I enjoy a nice long relaxing lunch, when I want a takeaway, it is because that option isn't open to me. The Haven is nice, but I find the menu limited and service just too slow for me to want to make a detour again. \n\nStill, nice baked goods, can't deny that."

S'I guess I shouldn\'t have expected much from a place that sounds like a Bollywood "Twilight" sequel (New Moon of India.) Turns out it was, predictably, just as bland and unremarkable as its film namesake.\n\nFirst off, they delivered a flyer around the neighbourhood that said all orders were 10% off AND tax (15%) included for pick-up order. Upon inquiry, the latter was "no longer valid". If there\'s a printing mistake, a restaurant should honour the better of the two discounts, at least.\n\nSecond, they\'re one of "those places" that take credit cards, but not debit. I can\'t stand that.\n\nLast, and least, was the food. We ordered the Afghan Special, which we learned included the following:\n2 broken papadam\n2 food court quality samosas\n1 barely passable chicken korma (for which they receive their first star)\n1 lamb bhoona that was so different from its picture (ie: it had nearly no meat OR vegetables in it) that even McDonald\'s would accuse them of false advertising.\n1 order of the driest basmati rice I\'ve ever had.\n1 random KFC-style iceberg lettuce salad\n2 larger-than-average Naan (for which they are getting their only other star)\n\nOverall, this ended up being arguably the least impressive India food I have had in Montreal (incl at take-out only places, which this is not.) The folks working there seem friendly enough, but their joy is not derived from a pride in their cooking.\n\nMy advice to the owners: When you\'re not a super busy place, and a new client responds to your advertising, you need to do your best to woo their business, long-term. Your specials/combinations should be representative of the very best you have to offer, so that someone who order on impulse will plan to come back for a more involved meal. Unfortunately, we never will.\n\nThere was only one couple eating there on a Sunday night, so perhaps the rest of the neighbourhood knows what I just learned....to avoid "New Moon" of India, as you would avoid the next Twilight movie....unless, of course, you\'re a big Twilight fan....in which case, with your taste, you\'ll probably love this restaurant.'

S"Where to begin with this embarrassment of a food chain. Before starting, let me just say my expectations are not set high as if it's any other fast food place (del taco, McDonald's,  ect.). I expect the workers to typically be a high school student with a bad attitude. That being said they've somehow managed to lower the bar. They're reliable for bad service, screwing up your order & being easily overwhelemed. Recently they have gave away an order to the wrong person of the lady in front of me. They made her get back in line and start over and she still had to pay seeing the person in front of her got away with a free meal! They have screwed up countlessly, for example my brother got a subway MELT & because he requested the bread to not be toasted the sandwich was cold, meaning NO melted cheese & the bacon was RAW. I mean unthinkable situations they make possible. & if you dare order toppings they scarcely clump each selection on one area of the sandwich. Common knowledge of making a sandwich is easily overlooked. Avoid this location at all costs. No matter how many workers or managers this place goes thru they will never get it together. As noted, I'm not requiring a gourmet meal and over the top exceptional service. I don't imagine working at subway is the highlight of anyone's career or reason to get up in the morning but it is your paycheck so a little effort won't hurt. Sad other restaraunts in anthem seem to close down but a disappointment like this sticks around with multiple locations just minutes away with much better service. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place no matter what!"

We like the roast sausages, spicy pizza, chicken and potatoes, the hearts of palm and bocconcini salad, and two of whatever the nice Italian lady behind the counter recommends. \n\nThey do use too much terrible-for-the-environment packaging, tons of saran wrap and styrofoam. I wish take-out places would properly tackle this problem. I would consume a lot more if they did, I swear.\n\nAt the bakery counter the baguettes and donuts are amazingly fresh and light. The churros were a bit of a fail, but who orders churros at an Italian bakery anyway? My fault really.'

S'Being a Phoenix native, I almost felt embarassed that I only ate at Pete\'s for the first time seven years ago. \nI had gotten back from England and was trying to recreate the orgasmic fish and chips experience I had there. Pete\'s was around the corner from my complex and after all, I DID see so many  of those "I\'m Addicted to Pete\'s Fish & Chips" bumper stickers all around Tempe. I had to try it.\n\nI ordered the two fish combo, and my reaction was...what the..?..are they serious? \n\n1.) The "chips" suuuuck. No salt, overcooked and stiff. I couldn\'t even eat them. \n2) The two squares of fish I got were alright, but I may as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of Gorton\'s fish sticks. \n3.) The red "special sauce".  Wtf? And you have to pay extra if you want tarter? Lame. \n4.) No malt vinegar. Enough said. \n\nWhy there is such a collective hard-on for this place is beyond me. It\'s a laughably bad example of Fish and Chips.'

S"OK I know that nobody goes to PPP for the good food... but I was dragged here for a kid's party. Worst pizza EVER, worse even than Sardella's. Tomato sauce like battery acid. Tasteless cheese and not much of it. Cardboard dough. Domino's or Papa John's is a step up from this. I can't believe I liked this crap when I was a kid. It's not inexpensive, either. These places must make a killing between the shit wages, the shit pizza, and the prices that are comparable to what you'd pay for a pizza worth eating.\n\nOn the bright side, PPP performs a valuable public service by keeping the hyperactive rugrats contained in a place where they belong, so that they don't disturb the adults at places that serve pizza that's actually worth eating."

S"I just went here for lunch for the first and last time with my husband.  The restaurant was pretty empty, only one other table when we got there, but the service was still not very good.  They were not very friendly towards us, maybe because we were not golfing?  They seemed to be nicer to the golfers.  My husband has the fish sandwich, which was actually pretty good.  I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, and it was not good.  The sandwich was dry, some of the meat was very fatty and some was so tough I couldn't bite through it.  It is supposed to come with coleslaw on top of the sandwich, and I ordered it on the side....Thank goodness I did because I think it was rotten and spoiled.  I actually had to spit it into my napkin, which I've never done in a restaurant before.  Oh, and our food sat in the window for about 15 minutes before our server brought it to us.  Disappointing...we will not be going back."

S"Brought up with a huge variety of Asian food, I do find it hard to be content with most of the Asian food I've had in Edinburgh (The boons and banes of being a Malaysian). \n\nStrolling down the street one day, with my other favourite kebab stores either out of reach or not open during the time, I made my way into Lanzeez Tandoori! NO REGRETS!!\n\nSlightly different from your average Edinburgh kebabs with mayonnaise and garlic sauce, Lanzeez has an Indian authenticity to it, which I enjoy.  The marinade of the kebabs has a herbal tinge coupled with an very aromatic Indian tandoori flavour. If my Indian friends say that the food tastes very Indian, enough said.  \n\nSmells great, tastes even better! \n\nVery affordable and other than its kebabs, has a wide selection pizzas options, biryani and other Indian/Pakistani type food. I particularly enjoy their maddenly sweet Gulap Jamun as a desert. \n\nSince then, I've visited the place a few times and always pleased. While service isn't quick since good food needs time for proper preparation, the people at the place are very cordial. I've always had a nice chat with the staff there (Specifically the lady boss) while waiting.\n\nWhen I am feeling lazy, their delivery option is good too."

S"Three strikes -you're out! Went for lunch and had to go into the kitchen and find someone to wait on us. We asked them to hurry even though we were the only table there. 90 minutes for lunch.\n\nWent to UFC fight a few weeks ago. Other than Sean the bartender the rest of the staff thinks they are celibrities and only talk to customers who compliment them and think they are going home with them\n\nStrike three was Staurday when we went in for Anderson Silva UFC fight. Plenty of tables open but had reserved signs on them. Hostess said she reserves them for her guest who aren't there yet? We stand around and wait and a couple leave and we take there table. It is so hot its stiffling. Were sitting next to a group who tells us it is 87 degrees and climbing as the crowds start coming in.  We should have left.  \n\nOur server wearing a silver headband came without menus and asked for drink order. She had no knowledge of what was on tap and never found out for us. We ordered two 25oz beers and they arrived in just under 20 minutes. Without menus she insisted we get our food order in???  She brought us menus and 30 seconds later wanted a food order. We told her we were going to be there for four hours and would order when we had time to discuss it. Yep 30 seconds later she was back. Those saying the pizza here is great have got to be family of the owner, I am not sure the cheese was real cheese.  It might have been 60 minutes before we saw our server again. She was a mess and running around like she forgot where she was at. We knew it would get crazy at the end of the fights so we ask for our check. Over an hour to get the check. We watched people come in and order food and then just get it to go as they were too busy wiping the sweat off of themselves. \n\nWhat a whacked out place and I am not sure they will make it. If they want to try they need to have a quick staff training class and let them know they are not the show!"

S"One day when my jeans were fitting a little snug (I think it was a day after Cheesecake Factory) I waddled my fat ass to Soma Express. This place has taken healthy eating and made it delicious - how about that?  Let me caveat it by mentioning it's not for everyone.  But if you're on a diet or are into low-fat, low-calorie and veggie options Soma Express is your place.  \n\nHighlights\n* Service and restaurant set-up is counter style ala Pei Wei.  \n* The people who work here are REALLY nice - which is something you just don't see much of these days.  \n * Fat grams, carb counts and calories are PRINTED on the menu - (omg I think I'm in LOVE, what a socially responsible restaurant?)\n* Free wifi - (lots of yuppies working on laptops here)\n\nI've had breakfast and lunch here and was pleased.  Omelet dishes are very healthy (think mixture of eggs and egg substitute) - mine was a sirloin steak and non-fat mozzarella cheese with cinnamon raisin toast, all with under 300 calories.  For lunch I've had their extra-lean and 99% lean turkey burgers served with baked French fries.  For those of you familiar with Topz in CA or Better Burger in NY - the taste is very similar, flavorful without the grease.  Soma is about as close as we get to those places for healthy burgers.  The menu had a number of veggie options (salads and burgers with tofu, eggplant, ahi tuna and salmon).\n\nPrices are little more than one would expect ($8 for a burger), but I for one don't mind paying a little extra for healthy quality."

S"Eh.... 2.5 stars, maybe? 3? Not sure, yet.\n\nAfter looking at the menu online, I really wanted to like this place. The menu has some creativity to it, unlike the template-North-Indian-restaurant-menus you find at many of the Indian restaurants in the Valley. Aside from offering things like korma, kadai, vindaloo, etc. with a variety of options (chicken, lamb, paneer, shrimp or fish for each) they also have some other more unusual choices, like one of my favorite dishes, mattar malai methi (creamy fenugreek and peas). And dahi vada in the appetizers... I couldn't wait to check it out.\nUnfortunately, three friends and I went at lunchtime on a Saturday - and there was a buffet. So I didn't get to try any of those tempting dishes.\n\nThe restaurant itself, while  decorated a little haphazardly (Chinese paintings?) is bright and clean. There's a TV on a wall, which happened to be playing one of my favorite Bollywood movies...so I was still excited about the place.\n\nBut...after tasting the food...meh.\n\nThe buffet was all right.. but nothing to write home about. Pluses? Once again, it had something different..fish curry as well as an Indian-style Chinese dish or two. So that was cool. But the food was just so-so. I was there fwith three other people - one of them said the cuts of meat, especially the chicken, were of higher quality than most Indian buffets. But he didn't like the sauces so much. One other friend said he liked the tikka masala, but that was about it.\nAs for the vegetarians, well, we didn't have a lot of choices. Veggie manchurian (which was pretty good), a very bland chana masala and some pea/carrot thing that reminded me more of baby food than anything else.\nThe dessert was just all right, too. And the rice was very bland.\n\nSo, overall, I wasn't impressed. But I don't want to judge the place too harshly based just on the buffet. After all, Curry House was packed on a Saturday afternoon, so I'm thinking maybe it's got something better to offer me.. I'll have to go back for dinner and see what their non-buffet selections taste like before I totally write this place off my list."

Yes the staff were friendly, which is nice, however I found the food uninspiring, average, and bland - and isn't that one of the main reasons you go out to eat, to have good food? \n\nMaybe it's due to the fact that I've been watching a lot of professional master chef lately, but when I go out I expect to eat something that tastes great, which I would have trouble cooking on my own (I'm not a good cook so that isn't hard to do).  The food was just average, and kind of expensive for what you got. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was not cold enough - this is a pet peeve of mine...

On a visit earlier this week, I was pleasantly surprised by the efficiency of the service.  They were certainly mindful that many people that dine there have a limited amount of time.  We were swiftly served our salads/soup (though the menu says that certain entrees come with a salad, they let me swap for soup).  The chicken pastina soup was not- not strongly flavored, but a pleasant comfort-food.  I had the Virginia Spots, which involved a nice sized portion of fish cooked nicely. It could have used some more sauce. For a side, I had mashed potatoes.  They were very good, but had an aftertaste all afternoon. I can't quite put my finger on what it was - garlic-like, but not garlic.  Prices are a bit high-ish, but not unreasonably so.  Overall a solid choice for a business lunch."

S'I have been to this Village Inn maybe three times in the last 2 1/2 years. Each time could have been much better. This most recent was tonight. Everything seemed to be going well right off, but as we waited for our food a cashier asked a customer if they wanted their receipt to fill out a survey. The older customer complained about how she didn\'t want to do it if it involves anything with a computer and some other things. As she left out the door the two waitresses gossiped and carried on about the lady and were quite rude and even though we were sitting right next to the front desk, it wasn\'t hard to hear anywhere in the area. Many servers walked by and kept filling my brother\'s Diet Coke. No one touched my water for the longest time and it wasn\'t even a 1/4 full and it was maybe a 6" tall glass (heard another server telling other customers they ran out of regular glasses) and figured they would be back more often. They refilled it twice with water. However, brother got 6 refills no second thought on pop. It wasn\'t just one server, she hardly came back. Others noticed and tried to take care of us. I got the fish and chips with carrots. But it came with coleslaw and no toast. She said the toast wasn\'t done yet and would be out in a minute. Waitress didn\'t notice the carrot mixup. When she came back we were halfway done and I said that I thought I was supposed to have gotten carrots. She brought me carrots right out, still no toast or word of it. The carrots were very soupy and over cooked. They were said to be honey glazed carrots...\n\nWhen we were done our waitress came over and announced she was going on break and so and so would serve us now. Cleaned our table of plates and no one, not even other servers ever walked past our table again. Someone at one point laid pie on the table and was gone before I could see who it was. I thought the pies were to go, waited for a while, still no one ever came by. Stood up and laid my ticket on the counter and asked for a box and stated "No one has been back at all." Took my money, asked if I wanted a receipt, that was it.\n\n\nMy brother\'s fries looked like \'bottom of the barrel\' fries as he put it. They were indeed very greasy and soggy looking while I was given a 1/4  of a lemon slice to put on my fish. My brother also stated the onion rings were very tasteless. I must say the fish was very good compared to fish I have had other places lately. \n\nThe manager was at the front desk a few times trying to show workers stuff. Hopefully he\'s new and can straighten things out there. I won\'t be going back after the terrible past service and to see that nothing has really improved and people were a little off this round, might not change soon.'

S'I found this place completely on accident. I tried to go to Off Da Hook shit hole down the street but was treated horribly rude so I walked out. I saw this place when I drove by so I thought I would give it a try. I was angry when I walked in so I vented a bit to the poor young lady who was trying to help me. I could tell she felt bad for me and she mentioned something to the guys in the kitchen before I ordered. I went a head and ordered the chicken and waffles with the mac and cheese and onion rings. The price was less than $10 which shocked me. This was 3 pieces of chicken, a large waffle with 2 nice sized sides for less than $10. Thats one hell of a deal in my book. i went out and sat down to wait for my food. While I was waiting the owner came over and actually apologized for the rude assholes (my words not his) down the street. He started up a nice conversation and we talked a while until my food was ready. Everyone there was incredibly nice and extremely helpful. \n   I drove home and dug into my dinner. The chicken was INCREDIBLE!!!! I cannot stress this enough. Some of the best chicken I have had. Nice big pieces, the crust was nice and crispy with tons of flavor. The meat was extremely juicy and cooked perfectly. The mac and cheese was very good as were the onion rings. Now I had a feeling the poor waffle was not going to fair well on the drive home and sadly it did not. It kinda steamed itself in the clam shell and was a bit soggy. No way I can fault Chik-a-Ribs for this. Some things just dont travel well and waffles are one of them. It did however have a very good flavor and now im dying to try one in house to get the full experience. \n    If you want fantastic food with great service, really nice people and dirt cheap prices this is where you want to go. This place is one of those pure luck finds that doesnt come along very often and im glad it did. I will be back time and time again for that fantastic chicken. GO, thats all I have to say, JUST GO!!'

S"I have no choice because it's close by work. The staff is a who's who of crack-heads, drop-outs, and ghetto birds of all degrees of fabulousness. Efficiency is not exactly a hallmark quality of this location so best to avoid coming during the lunch rush.\n\nIf you come at any other time you can get your sandwich about as quickly as they likes of the aforementioned can muster. Once in a while they'll get someone who has their shit together and can run things efficiently. Unfortunately much like a progressive priest at my old Catholic School, they never last.\n\nLack of sufficient pre-planning is also apparent because one of the drawbacks of coming in after lunch time is that it's not unusual for them to be out of your preferred kind of bread (usually wheat) If the staff are busy chit-chatting in the back room you may have to wait until someone ventures out to find you waiting (wonder how many bags of chips have been lifted). \n\nIf you work downtown you don't have a lot of options so all there is to do is deal with it. It's not God awful but it can be ghetto and I would LOVE to see the collective rap sheet of my local sandwich artists."

S'I order online from here. The pizza building website thingy is awesome. You can tailor your pizza by the 1/2! Tonight I went with the Fiesta! Beef, sausage, jalapenos and a couple other things. Was pretty tasty on a thin crust! $9.99\n\nYou gotta click the link for specials - there\'s always a bunch of deals going on, so you can save some $. The downside to that is not all the deals are well-described. (e.g., You can get an AZ Cardinals deal, but you only know the price...not what it consists of until you click into it)...that\'s kinda lame...\n\nAnyway, the toppings are fresh, the guys at the shop will open your box and show you it matches your order. Good for special requests like "well done crust".\n\nI usually pick it up ( It\'s in the Fry\'s market/Hobby Lobby shopping center), but sometimes we have it delivered. No problems there either. They always offer cheese/red pepper packets either way. The garlic sauce and pepperoncinis are 75cents ea extra, but ya gotta have \'em! Don\'t forget to add those onto your order!'

We took the opportunity to try Sea Stone. \n\nI've always liked the decor in that building. Its very appealing and its also practical for the staff. The one thing I wish they would've got rid of is the stupid water table. That thing is tacky. And its broken. \n\nSince we just had drinks and an app, I can't review the whole dining experience. We sat at the bar. Our bartender was a young kid with bandanas, tattoos, piercings, and remnants of black fingernail polish. All of the other patrons sitting at the bar dressed likewise, the Vegas rocker punk demographic. \n\nWe got the porcupine shrimp appetizer, which tasted very similar to Chinese honey walnut shrimp. It was a really small portion for $11. If you go to Joyful House and order honey walnut shrimp, you'll get twice as much for the same price. \n\nFor our appetizer and one round of drinks, we paid $26 before tip. \n\nSea Stone is just like Hannah's but more Korean than Vietnamese. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino"

S"My fiance and I were trying to figure out what to do on a Saturday night and I remembered someone mentioning a new place in the Strip opening up. I did my research on the drive up and I was curous to see how their idea would be laid out. Upon arrival, you are greeted with a very ornately decorated foyer and smiling employees buzzing around. We are arrived shortly before 7pm and were told about live entertainment starting soon and I said seat us there! I was handed a stack of napkins by a server and assumed that was a polite gesture to let me know something was on my face. Then the music began, napkins started flying and two bellydancers came out into the area. As they were performing, they encouraged patrons to get up and dance as well. My fiance, who is a bit more on the conservative side, got up and participated. Their dancing was not vulgar by any means and the crowd definitely followed the silk donned women around the room. After their performance and the excitement died down a little, we ordered a few small plates to try some things out and a couple specialty drinks that were jumping off the menu at us. About an hour later, the ladies returned for more shimmies and napkin tossing. This is definitely the place to go with friends and family when you don't want to experience just a dinner. This is probably the only place that offiers this level of excitement and vibe without any extra charge. We will definitely be returning to try out their full menu and I'll make sure it's a night with the bellydancers- I may learn a thing or two :)"

The owner says that she uses 100% lamb and the Tzatziki sauce she makes using both Greek Yogurt and a small amount of sour cream, to thicken it up as the cucumber is moist, is really good. I have to say that it is very good and the whole experience was one of my favorites. It would be well worth the visit for either the sandwich, which I had today, or the platter which I have had at a previous visit. The lamb is so tender and flavorfull. Must try. \n\nThere is a large selection of other items to choose from that I have yet to try ranging from Cajun Classics to the more regular American fare.

The subtlety of the flavours were very impressive with the swoosh of curry for the perfectly done pork belly, to the wasabi mayo on the also perfectly roasted and rare striploin and potato pave, and the starter was delicate arugula, thinly sliced cantaloupe, prociutto and other goodies that was so well balanced and refreshing.  Looking forward to the next one, heard it was going to be more asian influenced and smaller courses - can't wait.  Get in in advance the places was fully booked even at the bar.\n\nDuring the week the specials are usually Brandon's and still, the crepes are great healthy and tasty treats for lunch or for dessert.

I didn't have a plan B in mind, so it was time to wander round the area and look for other options.\n\nKatie's Diner came to rescue. I have always wanted to try this place out, as it seems to have good reviews so this was a good opportunity.\n\nThe restaurant had no other diners when we came in, but filled up eventually. We were greeted warmly by the owner who gave the menus and took our drink orders. \nI had a glass of house red, and it was a very reasonable \xc2\xa32.95 for a small (175ml) glass. The wine was ok, not great but not bad either :)  I now know that they do BYOB as well, which I might consider next time when I visit this establishment (there will be a next time, definitely!)\n\nI shared a starter of jalapeno peppers stuffed with cream cheese and coated with breadcrumbs. They came with a little pot of chilli sauce. The peppers were very tasty, a nice start for the dinner. \n\nOooh and the chicken! I was so happy I went with my choice of Hawaiian chicken, which was a chargrilled chicken breast with a chargrilled pineapple ring on top. It came with salad, coleslaw and chips. The chicken was absolutely delicious - a really good charcoal flavour and well on taste. The chips however were just 'ok'. \n\nI loved the simple but delicious home cooked food at Katie's Diner. The atmosphere was also very relaxing and the owner Jeff was very welcoming and friendly.\n\nSome reviews mention the decor as being outdated and perhaps it is - but I think in a way it just adds up to this places own character. I personally am not that bothered by the decor, as long as the food delivers and here it certainly does!"

The first time for cake and coffee, and today for breakfast.  \n\nThe cake was nothing special - pretty standard and most likely purchased from the same place that makes these kinds of traybakes and cakes for the vast majority of Edinburgh cafes.  The coffee was nice, but nothing compared to the likes of Artisan.\n\nBreakfast today was actually pretty sub-par.  The staff are nice, but there are too many of them.  There are 11 tables with no table service, and there were 4 girls behind the counter who spent the majority of their time chatting because there was nothing else to do.  There could easily have been two less members of staff - they would have been busy for a bit, but it would have been do-able, easy.  I feel I can say this because I used to properly wait 8 table sections, while making drinks, coffee and salads, as well as bussing tables, and we were just fine.  \n\nThe food, though, is what left us unsatisfied.  We each had eggs benedict, I had it with bacon and the man had it with sausage.  The eggs, bacon and sausage were well cooked.  The eggs were actually impressively well cooked - though maybe I'm impressed because the art of poaching an egg is something that is so amazingly beyond my grasp it's embarrasing.  \nHowever, the hollandaise was obviously out of a jar and really not nice at all.  It was thick and a bit bitter tasting, not the dreamy fatty creaminess which it should have been.  The toasted muffin as well had an unusual taste to the extent that I actually just resorted to eating around it.  I can't even describe the taste but whatever the description, it wasn't nice.  \n\nWe walked away \xc2\xa315 lighter with full bellies, but wishing we'd stayed in for breakfast."

S'BEST BUTTER CHICKEN in the whole wide world!!\n\nOn our recent visit to Scotland, we stayed at Sheraton. Just as we stepped outside the hotel, we spotted this Indian restaurant, across the street.\nWe ordered Chicken Korma & Paratha for dinner. When the Chicken Korma arrived on the table, my husband asked the waiter for some hot sauce in order to spice up the dish,like most Indians would do. The waiter went back, and instead of the hot sauce, arrived a very polite & cordial gentleman - Alok Singh, the Manager of the restaurant. Seeing we are Indians who might not prefer a mild dish like Chicken Korma, which we had already ordered, he asked the waiter to take the Korma away from our table. He proactively offered to order a dish of Butter Chicken to us. We both were a little startled, embarrassed but definitely appreciated his gesture eventually. Great customer service indeed! Once the Butter Chicken arrived, not only did my husband NOT ask for any hot sauce this time, he heartily enjoyed the lip-smacking dish and inferred this is "the BEST Butter Chicken I have ever had"! He meant he had never even tasted anything close to this flavorful dish, even in any restaurant in India.\n\nWe couldn\'t help going back to Kama Sutra on the following night for dinner....and no prize for guessing - we ordered Cheese Naan & OF COURSE...... BUTTER CHICKEN!!! :)'

S"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh, the food here really is delicious. I first heard about it when I was in first year and on the last day of living in halls we decided to treat ourselves to some decent food. Ever since, we have always ordered from Shapla to celebrate- birthdays, end of term or any little event good enough to get an excuse to get one!\nAlthough the restaurant describes itself as serving Bangladeshi cuisine, you will also find Indian and other Asian dishes being served up here. You can order online via their website and the delivery time was about half an hour, which is pretty good. I have been trying to work my way through their menu and there hasn't been one meal where I had finished it feeling dissatisfied, all the meals are full of flavour and are well portioned to ensure that you are full by the end of them."

We say (with a full mouth) good and before we can ask for a refill she starts to bolt.... what about the 2 empty glasses?? I have to ask for a refill!!?!?

S'I am surprised at the negative reviews on this  restaurant.  My sister and I went here last Saturday, ( Nov. 25,2011) right before the Janet Jackson concert. I had had coupons for the buffet , but they were not being honored as it is Holidays.  So.. we saw a sign for Pizza Palace.  Me being one to NEVER turn down Pizza ( or lasagna for that matter). we were game.\n  Now, the only thing was, we were in a hurry to get to the concert on time. ( we should have stayed longer cos she didn\'t go on until 10PM).  We get in there and its got ambiance- good music (top 40s  from the 80s - super points)., dim lighting as well. The  oven in back was doing it\'s thing, because it smelled so good.  So, we order. Now, service was a  little slow, but our waitress was nice and  wasn\'t crowded either.  We got our menus and quickly ordered a whole pepperoni pizza and half of it had jalapenos ( for my sister *cough cough* not for me).. We had the special: a ten inch  pizza and  a pitcher of beer. ( I had a Sprite). The soft drink was tasty and refreshing. Our waitress was pleasant and answered our questions.   \n   We waited for the pizza  hoping it\'d be out fast. I was like" this better be good"   Low and behold, it was soooooooooooooo good. And not just because we were hungry.. I love  pizza with  a robust sauce.  Not only did it have full flavor that  I could savor, but it also had crispy pepperonis!!  POINTS !!!  It\'s like they had the magic oven. it was perfect. Not to greasy and the  dough was not too thick. OH MAN!  We each had 4 slices. We wanted more, but we were  needing to leave to get across the street to Ceaser\'s.  \n  I  have to tell you: the place was clean. the food came hot, and  it was not a let down in the  least.  I also have to say, i have been dreaming about going back to this place since I left. I will be back and I am bringing friends!  Its a small place, but enough that you can definitely bring people and have a really nice time.  \n\n What did we pay you ask? I\'ll tell ya; for all that we got our bill was about  $22 :-) so worth it too!\n\n  I would suggest this to anyone that loves a good meal and has time to sit down and eat.  :)  \n\nP.S. The Janet Jackson concert was really good too :-)'

S'My husband and I stopped for a late lunch today and will never eat at this restaurant again. We ordered our food and sat down in the dining room to wait for it to be brought to us. There were very few people in the restaurant and all had their food so we knew ours should not take long. After about 18-20 minutes our food was sat up in the pass through window by the cooks and just sat there. The cashier was in the lobby at that point emptying trash and there was no one else out front to bring us our food. As we sat we witnessed a female employee come from the kitchen with a paper towel or tissue in her hand. She BLEW AND WIPED HER NOSE and threw the tissue in the trash can under the counter and then immediately reached up and grabbed our plates of food with her dirty hands. She reached in and scooped cole slaw onto our plates contaminating the entire batch sitting there and proceeded to walk to our table with the contaminated food. We refused it and demanded a refund immediately asking to speak to the manager. The manager never came out and I left but not before getting the number of the district manager for Long John Slivers. I have contacted her and the health department with a complaint. Do not eat at this restaurant.'

S"I came here with my boyfriend's family (who are Mauritian) on a Sunday night for his mom's birthday dinner. The decor is decent, nothing too outstanding.\n\nAlthough the place was only 1/3 full, it took the waiters awhile to acknowledge us. Five minutes of waiting around later, we were finally seated, without menus. I had to go over to another table where they were all set on and picked up some. A waiter finally came over to bring us water and although we asked for utensils, as only chopsticks are offered on the tables, he walked away with them in hand instead of giving them to us. He finally came back to bring them to us, and took our order. \n\nWe ordered the seafood soup, crab balls (YUM), beef & Chinese broccoli, crispy chicken, chow fun with black bean sauce, chicken chow mein, shrimp fried rice, Cantonese-style lobster and just regular steamed rice. We had asked to have the crispy chicken and steamed rice served simultaneously, but the waiter got all in a huff and said he can only bring things out as they are ready from the kitchen. \n\nOur food started to trickle out slowly but surely, and here is what I thought;\n- The crab balls, although were pretty tasty, were a lot smaller than say at Kam Fung (for 3$ a piece you'd think they'd offer a little more sustenance).\n- The beef & Chinese broccoli was pretty good, although the meat could've been less tendon-y. Good flavouring though.\n- The crispy chicken was a let-down; it was pretty dry, and didn't taste too fresh.\n- The chow fun with black bean sauce was pretty delicious; it was my first time having it and I enjoyed it.\n- I have nothing but good things to say about the chicken chow mein; it had a good mix of crispy noodles and fully cooked ones. And the veggies weren't soggy as they sometimes end up being. \n- The shrimp fried rice was pretty good, mind you they were pretty cheap with the shrimp; they sprinkled maybe 10 mini shrimp throughout the whole dish.\n\nI don't eat lobster, and didn't have any seafood soup, so I can't critique those.\n\nI was really hoping to get the lentil soup for dessert (soooo good), but, and I know this is stereotypical, I have a feeling because I was at the table (I'm Caucasian, and my boyfriend's family, as I mentioned is Chinese-Mauritian) the waiter brought orange slices and fortune cookies. \n\nSo all in all, it was ok, but I will stick with my tried and true Kam Fung."

They always have deals as most pizza places do. When they have the deals for any pizza, any size, any crust, I wish they would honor that and not charge extra for stuffed crust. Any crust means ANY CRUST. Okay... I got that out. \n\nThe wings are bomb-diggity! if you don't know about Wing Wednesday then you should check it out. Wings are 50 cents each. I get an order of 8 buffalo burnin' hot (boneless) for $4 and it comes with a side of dressing. There is a good selection of flavors.\n\nSometimes I order for delivery but usually just pick it up since it is close to my home and quicker. I always order online and never have any problems."

S'Based on my first meal there I can only give 3 starts for now. My 3 star is rating the food, not the complex or the interior. I will explain. \n\nThe complex has been there for 300 years, it was updated once about 150 years ago. There is a Pep Boys, Country Boys, Ghetto Boys (just kidding) there is a MEGA liquidator, a RC Hobby Store, a lawn mower place, a guitar place, car audio and maybe 3 other places. \n\nThe complex is in dire need of cleaning, paint and general upkeep. \n\nHumbertos is a dive, the interior is sparse and ugly, The decorations are strange and old. The paint is gross, the floor is decent but the entire seating area needs rehab-ed. \n\nThe KITCHEN is Immaculate, I am talking clean. The cook knows that that is his domain and likes it clean like his 67 Impala. \n\nThe food was priced reasonably, I had carne asada quesidilla, Ryan had pork and chicken tacos. The food was good. Right on par with other bertos, nothing stood out as bad or as excellent. \n\nThe service was friendly and the food arrived quickly. If I were in the area getting my car worked on or picking through the junk at the Mega store, I would go back. I doubt I would go out of my way to come here.'

The smoked salmon eggs were undercooked and underseasoned, although the dish was very creative and was an intersting spin on classic brunch ingredients. The mediteranean omelette was just ok. The restaruant has a charming, clean atmosphere and the decor focuses your attention on the architecture of the restored Elizabeth home. I will give this restauraunt another try during dinner hours.'

Despite being at an rather empty bar, it's like I'm begging for them to take my order, refill our drinks or just plain take my money.

So walking by the newly opened location starving, it seemed to be as good a time as any to sink my teeth into their highly successful burger format.\n\nFirst off, the burgers are different. They look like they have been flattened and rounded. They float in a sauce, their famous hot sauce... in fact, at a quick glance I thought they were serving me a small stack of pancakes.\n\nI order the the trio, consisting of a hi-top burger, fries and drink (can of Pepsi products or water bottle) is under $7.\n\nThe burger is one ugly motha. And not ugly with a great attitude. No. Ugly, with no real substance. A burger that is flat, with barely any meat in it at all, a single slice of tomato and an end piece of lettuce. Hot sauce and onions spilled out of the bun and created a pool around the burger. The fries are not great... not bad, just nothing. They are lightly fried, mid-sized, if someone said they were McCains, I'd totally believe that. \n\nThe hard part is that the burger and everything wasn't bad, it just wasn't good at all.

I'm not too sure why, however, as my experience in this place didn't really stand up to that of the others in the area.  It looks inviting and stylish from the outside, and the interior decor is also contemporary and comfortable.  The menu has the usual pizzas, bruschettas and pasta dishes as well as some tempting deserts like their homemade tiramisu.  I went for the pepperoni pizza which tasted pretty good when it arrived some forty mintues after I ordered it.  Also, it was barely warm when it arrived and the last few mouthfuls were cold.\nThe place is virtually always busy, but even so the staff just don't seem to care.  I douibt I'll be back here again, but plenty of locals seem to visit reguarly so it must be doing something right."

S"Always wanted to try a Fatburger ever since Ice Cube told me that he ate one at two in the morning.\n\nWell I had my eyes did at Lasik Plus about 2 years ago which is right next to the fatburger, so after my initial consult we moseyed on over to try it out.  The burgers were aight, Thanks alot O'shea! Foo, I'm just trickin'! No, but seriously they were good, and where else can you add an egg to your burger?.  The relish was a bit strong, so I recommend that you get it on the side, or not at all.  Hey, it was clean, and the staff wasn't all loungin' around when I went. Maybe the boss was there!"

I always enjoyed Hungry Howie's, and now the closest one is about 13 miles away at 107th Ave & Lower Buckeye.  I will say the last time I was at this location in April, they gave me a hassle for using a birthday coupon that said Tempe on it.  They scolded me saying that I needed to go online and change it to their location, but they will accept it this one time.  Even though, I didn't appreciate how they acted; I still didn't want them to go out of business!"

S"[I can't believe that I am the second person to review this restaurant. I may be the last; Mary Elaine's closes its doors for good sometime this month (Feb 2008). Perhaps I am the second person because a proper dinner for two (and I mean that that includes a _real_ selection from the best wine list in the city) will cost you $700 to $800, easily the cost of a coach ticket to Paris for the real thing. But make your reservations in advance. Dinner at Guy Savoy must be planned 4 to 6 weeks ahead. In case you don't realize it by the time you finish this one, I _AM_ a food snob.\n\nI feel a very heavy burden here because Mary Elaine's has stood for everything I have hoped for in the finest of service and detailed preparation in a dining experience since I was a member of the Plaza Club, also now defunct. That I could presume to review this establishment and the professionals who take each and every part of their job as their personal quest in life is totally ludicrous. Instead of a review, I can at best present some of my fondest memories of this wonderful place. OK, Now that I have set the bar high enough for myself, let me begin.]\n\nI can't remember if the team that comprises the army of staff that will serve you at front of house numbers 12 or 21 people, but by the time your dinner is over, you will have had a dinner to remember for the rest of your life.\n\nTake your pick from one of two seatings, 6 to 6:45 or 8:30 to 9:15. Give the reservationist every last detail of your preferences. Some of my favorite requests: (1) seat me as far away from that wailing wanna-be Lisa Addeo who thinks she can replace Nancy Gee -- she's still singing the exact same songs in the exact same order she was eight years ago in the lobby. If I have to hear her make those Time-to-Say-Goodbye octave leaps one more effing time, I'm going to kill myself; (2) give us relaxed timing on the courses, we're in no rush; (3) my guest does not drink alcohol and is from Iran, find a formal drink for her that she will appreciate; (4) my guest loves Chateaubriand, could you scrape some up?\n\nAmong my most memorable experiences:\nThe time Todd (manager) knowing my love of late 80's California cabs found a bottle of '88 Heitz Martha's Vineyard and surprised me for my birthday dinner.\nThe time my guest surprised me by calling in and requested hot sourdough for my bread choice knowing how much I love it.\nThe time our party sat at Chef's table in the kitchen and I watched first hand the quietest kitchen you can possibly imagine.\nThe bottle of '62 Chateau Gran Larose that left my mouth black and from which I was still drunk the next day.\nMy one and only ever sliver of Louis XIV cognac at $750 a slice.\nThe way Nancy Gee used to sing Angel Eyes, my favorite.\nThe time Sommelier Paul introduced me to the rasiney sweet pleasure of Lusteau Emilin cherry.\n\nMary Elaine's took pride in finding the most extravagant yet excellent ingredients in the entire world. It would not be uncommon for the special to include some extremely rare fish that had been flown in that afternoon. The wine list boasted 5000 bottles. Where else could you splurge on a $10,000 bottle of champagne? (The answer is Etienne's Different Point of View at Pointe Tapatillo Cliffs.) What if you feel like having a '60's bottle of Lafite Rothschild? Paul and his staff were always happy to oblige.\n\nI'm talking about the subtleties of food preparation such that a single course may have but six or seven bites, but each of those is a symphony of tastes that overwhelms the senses. On my last visit, the sauce chefs had perfected their entries to each course to such an extent that their excellence sometimes overshadowed the main ingredients themselves.\n\nIt was fun to gulp my entire glass of water to see how many seconds it would take to be noticed and refilled (no more than 15).\n\nMary Elaine's celebrated what might be called a sacred relationship between a host and his guest. You will be missed."

S'i think i\'m only giving it three stars instead of two because it wasn\'t as bad as i thought i was going to be. you know when someone drags you to a movie that you know is just going to be awful, but then you laugh at like, three parts of it, and only think about stabbing the main character\'s eyes out once during the whole thing? by any other standards, that would warrant a "yeah, i saw it, that movie sucked!", but you find yourself telling your coworkers the next day, "yeah, it was OK."\n\nmy special gentleman friend and i were post-Borders and trying to think of a semi-decent place to get food and drinks as we walked down Mill at 9:30 p.m. on a Monday night. Caffe Boa was too pricey, Z Tejas and Gordon Biersch never even come up on my taste radar, Slices was closed... We settled on Rula Bula and were headed north when a girl sitting on a plastic chair right outside La Pita picked us out of the pedestrian traffic and stated flatly, "$1 Bud Bottles."\n\nThat\'s it; not even a complete sentence, but she knew it would get the job done. we looked at the menu of generic mediterranean hummus/falafel/pita fare taped up in the window before committing with a " What the hell?"\n\nLa Pita has about 15 small cafe-style tables and i was surprised to see a fairly long bar for bellying up. we setttled into a huge corner booth right by the big window that looks right onto Mill Ave. they were rocking 100.7 and it was pretty dead in there, so we got our groove on to Blue Oyster Cult while our very nice and girl-next-door sweet waitress took our order. \n\nhere\'s the official stats: Chicken Schwarma ($7 or $8)- awful, terrible, disgusting. it came out looking like a giant taquito and the inside had the consistency of tuna and the taste of nothing. Gyro ($6) - this was a gamble, but i took it and sometimes the risk pans out. there was plenty of large cuts of gyro meat (which was not super salty - a sure cover-up for tasteless gyro meat) , the tzaziki was pretty good and the pita was alright, too. both orders came with a fairly large order of fries on the side.\n\nservice was good and friendly, not incompetent and dismissive like most college-y cafes in the area.\n\nso, three stars it is, apparently on a sliding relative standards scale: cheap beer (that girl, by the way, wasn\'t a server and didn\'t appear to work behind the bar either. in fact, she disappeared after we sat down, never to be seen again. weird), 50% good food and decent service at the oh-so-late hour of 10 p.m. on a monday night.'

S"First things first. Before you take a seat you must realise that this place is cash only. The nearest cash machines are RBS on North Bridge or the Tesco on Holyrood Road. Both a good 5 min walk away.\n\nSo after a detour to get cash (am I the only one that is over reliant on the plastic in my wallet?) we returned to a cozy table in the corner. Except the staff kept opening the front door to get rid of the incense smoke & each time I was hit with an icy artic blast...\n\nIt's byob which is cool. Neither I nor the new Mrs G were drinking. She had the mint tea & I tried the pomegranate juice. Both were fine. Water was presented in a lovely silver jug. \n\nFood wise we each opted for a 3 dish meze. I had the chicken, the meatballs & the olives. Mrs G had the halloumi, stuffed peppers & something else I can't quite remember. What we had was nice & tasty. We weren't told that they were out of pitta so it was a bit of a surprise when our plates arrived with some brown bread. Not what I was expecting & no comment/acknowledgement from the waitress either.\n\nUnfortunately the bread had seeds in it which Mrs G can't eat (allergies) so I asked if we could have an alternative. The waitress was polite but adamant they had no pitta & even when I asked if they had anything else. Eventually I spoke to another member of staff & eventually we were offered some rice. Fair enough. Too much palaver though. It should've been much easier to sort out.\n\nThat's why it only gets 3 stars."

S'The Classic Grille is a hamburger place in the food court of the of Fiesta Mall.  We had excellent hamburgers a with real meat and they make their own patties, fresh ingredients in a nice toasted bun. I really like that crunchy toasted bun. The french fries were a little better than average.  At first I didn\'t think the chocolate milkshake tasted very "malty" but when I started slipping it out of the straw instead of eating it with the spoon off the top  I began to taste the rich malt flavor.  It was made with real ice cream too, you could tell. I even doubled back and told the employees how good everything was. I paid about 14 dollars for 2 meals including a $4 dollar malt which I didn\'t think was bad.  I would definitely go back, and I\'m not a big hamburger fan.  Just when it\'s done right!\n\nDec. 10,2012: Came back here tonight because the Catfish Grille was closed, which I mentioned to the employee, who then told me about their fish items including a Grilled Tilapia sandwich on toasted bread. It was under $6 including fries and really good. You can tell quality of ingredients and preparation is important to these guys. I\'ll bet their fish and chips are good too. I\'ll have to try them next time. They are super nice to you too. They need to give lessons to that server over at Village Inn!'

S"Fired Pie is a fast/casual sort of build your own salad or pizza kind of place that also features a suggested menu in case you don't feel like making decisions. \n\nI've been to another one of the eight Fired Pie locations and had the pizza before and do prefer the salads from Fired Pie over the pizzas but that is just my preference and not necessarily yours.\n\nI picked the Field Greens with Roasted Vegetables Salad. I soon received a nice big fresh salad with lots of vegetables. I particularly liked the roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes in my salad, they were cold but still tasty.\n\nMy husband had the Steak and Blue Salad. He said it was pretty good but would have liked it better if they warmed up the meat in his salad. Oddly a meatball was found in his salad. Well I guess it was a free bonus like a prize in Cracker Jack because he ate it and we weren't charged extra for the cold meatball.\n\nThis place is brand new and the people working there have to read instructions on how to make the salads so bear with them.\n\nAt the time of this review 10-26-14 There is nothing better to eat at Tanger Outlets unless you want to eat the sandwiches next door from that popular chain that carries spongy chicken and soft fluffy fresh baked YOGA MAT bread.  So you have to grab your bite at Fired Pie.\n\n3.5 Stars"

Interesting paintings on the walls and they are looking to turn downstairs into another room which is great.

S'This Lebanese restaurant we gave a chance because it was convenient and we were pressed for time.  This is a half cafeteria half service restaurant underneath the Palais de Congress Montreal.   Whenever you get a gut feeling about a place or something, remember to follow it, with me after a few minutes the waiter that sat us had already rubbed me the wrong way.   This is a half cafeteria half service restaurant underneath the Palais de Congress Montreal.   When we first walked in my parents saw something from the "cafeteria" side that they wanted to order.   When we sat down I guess on the service side, he said he could not bring the food from the cafeteria side ( even thought it was the same food), and that we had to order form that side, I looked at him and he looked like he was almost going to kick us out off that area, so I told him I was gong to order something from the service side, so that made him less grumpy.   So I quickly ordered what was the simplest and basically safest thing off the menu I believe was hard to screw up.  Hummus, fallafel and salad combo, while my parents ordered from the cafeteria side and had to bring it to our side.   15 minutes later my Mom arrived with their food, I watched them eat half their food before I thought I saw my order up on the pick up area of the service side, but I figured with the long wait for something simple they were making it fresh, but no..... I caught them pulling it from the cafeteria side.  So if they pulled food from the cafeteria side, why couldn\'t they have served my parents food over too?   So in 25 minutes I got my order,  very disappointing, I knew it was going to suck, the falafel was colder than my hummus and salad.   Feels like it has been there for days and dry.   I dunno maybe they do falafel differently, but I have always had fresh falafel out of the fryer or pan, this was like dried out  and 2 days old form the refrigerator, they could have at least tried to fake it and microwave it.   I ate  some of it because we were pressed for time, the hummus was ok so that and the salad I basically finished.   I left 3 out of my 5 falafels untouched to send a message to the waiter and chef.\n\nWhen we left and paid we complained about the food, they were surprised we dared to tell them that in almost disbelief like what do you mean you didn\'t like it.   Oh well just saying folks..., and letting everyone here know how you guys run.    Oh and what rubbed me with wrong way with the waiter?  When we first walked in we were seating ourselves because nobody greeted us to do so and no sign to wait to be seated.   The guy came rushing out yelling in an irritated manner  at us not to sit where we were about to sit, loud enough to cause attention for all in the restaurant to look, normally I wouldn\'t give a hoot, but I was with my parents and one of them handicapped and they are very private people who wish no attention brought to them esp with a walker and such.   So I barked back well you better seat us in a spacious place because we need handicapped seating.   This caught him off guard, and his tone changed a little.   Anyways that was the beginning, I understand it\'s a cultural difference, French Canadian Lebanese trifecta going on here, but hey you should be nicer to customers in any restaurant in any country!'

I haven't been to Subway in so long that I pretty much forgot their entire selection of sandwiches, except for the obvious meatball marinara one. I didn't want to hold up the line, so I just ordered the first one that stood out to me, which was the Spicy Italian - pepperoni and salami, topped with cheese. I probably would've ordered something else if I actually took a second to read the description rather than order by picture. I got it on the Monterey Cheddar bread, not toasted, with provolone, cucumbers, green peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, and chipotle southwest sauce. The service was very speedy, just not very friendly or talkative, and I was in and out in about 4 minutes. \n\n*Tip (if you care about nutrition facts!)\nIf you look up your sandwich on the Subway website, you can actually pull up a customized nutritional info chart on exactly what you ordered. I almost want to cry looking at mine. My footlong was 1300 calories with 3830mg of sodium! Good thing I've only eaten half so far!"

There is less of a breakfast selection, gone are the old favorites. No substitutions either. Talk about corporate menu unfriendliness. \n\nI do hope corporate makes a few tweaks to improve the food.

S"Awww bijou is so... bijou! I see from other reviewers I am not the only one to fall into this trap. However, let me talk more about Bijou than my lack of originality in writing reviews. \n\nI've been eyeing up Bijou for so long I was convinced it would close down before I got round to visiting the place. But, happily for me, that wasn't the case, and we were able to take our non hungover behinds there after a wedding in Leith. \n\nIt's such a pleasant, quiet place, and the waitress who served us was lovely. We had the fry ups (veggie, non veggie) and to be honest, the veggie breakfast wasn't much different from any other breakfast I've had (less oily, mind), but it's hard to vary something when what it comprises of remains relatively static. \n\nHowever, the ambiance of the place is great, and I am looking forward to trying out their evening menu for size. It definitely is a gem, and worth keeping around."

Genuinely you can walk in there and say "Kim said that the fishcakes are one of the most delicious things in Montreal" and they won\'t know who you\'re talking about or anything, but you\'ll probably get the fishcakes if you ask for them and they\'re really delicious.\n\nThey come in orders of three, so you\'re going to want at least two orders, but you might as well get five or six because why the heck not? You can afford it, they\'re like $3.50/3, plus you can put them in the fridge and they are just as good cold.\n\nFishcakes!'

The food was delivered in about an hour, after the delivery person drove away I opened the appetizer box and it was a cheeseburger.  I called immediately thinking the guy could turn around because my order was switched with another in his car.  The lady told me they would get the platter right out to me.  Well, here it is 3 hours later and they never came back, or called (phone number entered on grubhub.com).  Finally decided to heat up the cold cheeseburger and eat it.  Very unprofessional.'

He apologized and left to get me the right one, but he didn't bring it to me until my husband had finished his lunch.  When it arrived, it had shrimp with the tails attached and olives with the pits in it.  I am not really sure how this makes for a pleasurable eating experience.  It was terrible.  The second time I went with a group for dinner, and I ordered a scallop dish.  The scallops were not fresh and were very poorly cooked - still raw in a dish which required them to be seared.  Out of the seven of us who dined, only one person enjoyed their entree. I am surprised that this restaurant seems to be so popular.  One plus was that the bartender did seem knowledgeable about wines and was happy to help us choose what we were looking for."

S"Well, we had tried take out pizza before with okay results and tonight gave the dine in a full chance.  They are disorganized and understaffed, this is obvious when patrons are seating other patrons and serving themselves butter, hot sauce, grated cheese from the server's stand.  With only 3 visible staff members and no management, they are lucky the patron's all seemed so willing to wait on themselves.\n\nNow, for the first course; the soup was a salt brine and the house dressing was nothing special.  Still, the seafood we ordered redeemed this place in that quality was present all the way.  The Baked Orange Roughy  was very generous, cooked to perfection, the sauce lacked the lemon usually associated with a Francaise style.  The Shrimp Scampi was again a salt brine - whatever base they are using is far overused.  The Shrimp Fra Diavolo, while the shrimp was nice the sauce, like the sides of pasta came with raw marinara.  It made us think they mixed the spices into the  tomatoes and forgot to put a flame under the sauce pan for a few hours - a very big mistake in an Italian eatery.  I can see they are trying, so maybe we'll give them another try, but we won't be rushing back."

Once we have decided my husband starts speaking. Places the order & greeted with silence. He asks if she got all that. Still nothing. Then we reverse the car less than an inch and the woman says 'welcome to Panda Express, how may I take your order?'.  I am confused as to why she could not hear us when making the order the first time around but whatever. Midway through ordering she tells us to hold on then comes back and asks what we ordered again. Pulled up to the window to pay & get our food. The lady hands us our food and then walks away from the window. Does not say have a good night or even say good bye. \n\nThe food was fine. Seemed fresh and portion size was good. Obviously it's fast food chinese so not the best thing I've ever eaten in my life or anything. \n\nBut due to the terrible customer service I will not return to this location ever.

It was such a nice way to end our time in Edinburgh. \n\nI was a Tapas virgin until I came here and the waiters were super friendly and helpful. I think even the manager of the restaurant came by at one point so I feel like they are making a real effort since the time the other reviews were posted. The staff was friendly and gave us plenty of time to ponder and order, explaining as they went and asking about whether we had been previously. In fact, they were so attentive that I was surprised when my boyfriend told me it was a chain!\n\nThe food was pretty much an A. I have had Tapas a couple time since then and the food has basically tied with this place with no clear surpassers in terms of flavors. However, the menu seems to have changed quite a bit in the past 6 months or so?\n\nThe interior is quite the contrast to the formal facade. It's rustic with truly Spanish inspired art and warm yellow coloring. The lacquered wood furnishings and bright accents really make you feel like you're in the country itself. Many different kinds of people sat amid the animated pillows making it comfortable and welcoming. Good for date nights or family dinners and anything in between!"

Beyond the sterotypical fried chicken and collard greens, you\'ll get the idea of how our grandmas cooked.  The heat lamps and excessive seasoning puts a slight damper on taste, but it\'s better choice than Golden Corral or Shoneys.  *Shudder*\n\nIf I\'m jonesing for some comfort food and sweet Southern hospitality, this place is it.  I\'m a creature of habit, so I\'ll list some of my favs in no particular order:\n-Roast beef (sliced when ordered) with au jus\n-Mac n Cheese, homemade, baked, using slightly sharp cheese\n-Garlic Texas Toast\n-Chocolate Pie loaded with fresh-tasting whipped cream\n-Glazed carrots (is there any other way?)\n\nThe line moves pretty fast, even at busy times.  You can expect the after-church crowd on Sundays, but its otherwise steady flow of traffic.  Hint: If you abhor the idea of cafeterias, this is NOT your restaurant.  But if you can stand a dozen sweet grannies asking "What can I get you, hon?" (which is about as intolerant as Sunday afternoon naps in my opinion), you\'re gonna love it!'

S"Perhaps the best Filiberto's in town certainly superior to the any rivals around it. It may seem silly to rate a fast food joint that is part of a franchise but unlike Macdonald's, Wendy's, In and Out, etc. Filibertos are not all equal and it is important to know which berto's to go to at 3am; the one 3 miles west of your home or the one 3 miles north of your home.\n\nBut in general Filiberto's is well known among Phoenix locals, although everyone stands on either one extreme end of the spectrum or the other. For those who share my love for 24 hour taqueria this the best the north valley has to offer. \n\nFor those of you that are new to filiberto's and are perhaps just visiting the valley for short time or are moving to one of our great cities i would use this rule: Treat Filibertos food like you would the tap water in Mexico avoid it if you aren't going to be around that long but if you are here for the long haul give it a few chances to let your stomach acclimate then enjoy."

Well, I was not in an actual bistro, but the meal certainly made me forget I was eating in a food court. \nThough, I have been to this place many times before, their food has not ceased to satisfy my hunger and I. \nThe concept is great. Bistro food served quickly, yet taste and quality remain high. This afternoon, I ordered the grilled chicken with nicely seasoned potatoes and grilled vegetables. All meals include salad or soup and portions are big compared to the average meal size at a food court. \nMy only problem with this place is the price. My meal cost me almost 23$ taxes included. Perhaps my hunger made me forget to check the prices beforehand, though I was not expecting the meal to cost more than 15$. I find this to be WAY too expensive for a bistro in a food court. Yes, the quality is greatly above food court average, however paying 23$ for my meal made me feel foolish. \nBut aside from the price, to reiterate, the food is great. They have other options such as pastas, fish, and steak; some equally expensive others more affordable.'

Tonight they had goat cheese with fresh strawberry topping, manchengo with sauteed onions and mozzarella with tomatoes. \n\nWine pours were huge, reminded me of the Keg size 8-9 ounces. \n\nThe Seafood Meritage was great, two small crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, and rare tuna on wonton-like chips. The tuna was perfect. \n\nMarinated Tomato Salad sounded very interesting and tasted better. Fried tomato, stuffed with marinated tomato, feta, and mixed greens.\n\nCheesecake with salted caramel . . . Are you kidding me!! \n\nTop it off with some decaf and call it a near perfect meal! \n\nBottom line, everything was delicious, service was top notch, food was high quality, and prices were reasonable. \n\nDon\'t walk, run . . . to Lava!!'

S"Moti Mehal has really good food, especially if you know what to order. That said, order one of the balti dishes! I love the Paneer Balti, which is the fresh cheese in a slightly chunky sauce of tomatoes, ginger, onion and cilantro. Their Butter Chicken is very creamy and my sister says it's one of her favorite versions. We both like their Veggie Samosas, and they also have meat-filled ones, which is sort of more rare to find. Over the last couple of years, we've ordered delivery from them a number of times and they are always very prompt (maybe 20-25 minutes). Everyone is nice to deal with on the phone and in person, so if you want to experience some delicious balti dishes, stop by this restaurant or order in for delivery."

S'Home of the de facto best GT in the downtown core.*\n\nCash only. Why? SQUARE SQUARE SQUARE https://squareup.com/ca/\n\n\n*Wok Cafe really has the best overall GT if like, you entered all the Chinese places in the neighbourhood into a GT cook off and everyone had like, just, all day to prepare the single best GT dish of their lives. Except in the regular world where people go and eat GT everyday unannounced like, just, to feed themselves, Wok Cafe has plain ol\' lost the ability to consistently prepare a good plate of GT, mostly on account of obviously having different people prepare their unique flavour of GT sauce every day with varying degrees of skill and success. I imagine at one time there was just one cook responsible for GT sauce making at Wok Cafe -- he was either the originator of the recipe or a disciple of whoever came up with it --and life was good. Then I guess he left or whathaveyou and all the other cooks figured "How hard can it be?" Pretty hard it turns out. At Nouille Express, the sauce doesn\'t have that level of complexity, but whoever is working the kitchen on any given day can produce a hot mountain of always crispy, well battered morsels of chicken covered in gooey sweet orange GT sauce that\'s maybe second fiddle at the GT cook off but wins my heart any other day of the week because it never disappoints. All I eat is GT so who knows about anything else on the menu. Seriously, cash only?'

S'Oh myyyy gosh. Why didn\'t I come to this site before ordering from these people??\n\nI\'m on vacation and I use an online food delivery service, so that I can relax in the hotel room and enjoy my meal. I placed an order for the vegetarian pizza, vegetarian sub, the combo platter, and zeppolis. \n\nLike everybody else commented, the delivery woman was 40minutes late. I recieved my food cold and was lucky enough to have a microwave in the room. \n\nThe Flaws:\n1. The vegetarian pizza was literally flattened white cheese, very litte sauce, 3 toppings on each slice... The pizza literally looked and tasted like cheap grade school cafeteria food. \n\n2. The vegetarian sub- well It was decent but the avocados were actually brownish. The bread was also somewhat stale. \n\n3. The combo platter- The cheese in the cheese sticks was already solidified and the entire platter is fried so by the time it got to us it was super soggy. \n\n4. The Zeppolis- just plain hard. as hard as old pieces of bagel. \n\n\nI am so dissapointed and even even though I contacted the restaurant, I have not received a refund or apology. This place is honestly a "Kitchen Nightmares" episode/experience. Never again will I order from them!'

S'let me start by saying that two of my best friends (practically my sisters) are korean.  this means that i have a pretty high standard when it comes to korean fare.  i know that i can always count on some good grub when i stop in at thier house and, becuz of that, i have expectations when i walk into a "korean restaurant".\n\none of the officers that i work with said this place was great.  i\'m thinkin the army didn\'t send him to korea.  i ordered the bi bim bop (to go...i hate eating in restaurants by myself) which is a personal fave and is different every place you go.  i have yet to find a place that does it better than my friend\'s oma, but this place wasn\'t even CLOSE to my standard.\n\nfirst off, lemme say that i have never had bi bim bop served with an ASSLOAD of chopped lettuce and some other random green with a totally offputting taste (good for one bite, nauseating after that).  when i initially opened the container holding the bulk of my food i thought the girl had given me the wrong box...wtf, i didn\'t order a goddamn salad!  *sigh*  after pushing the masses of green shit aside i discovered my beef...what little of it there was to be found.  i felt like mrs. lovett on a quest to find some poor animals dying in the street to bulk up this meal(oh yeah...ally references musicals...get used to it).  it\'s kinda sad when you eat a big bowl of bi bim bop...of ANYTHING for that matter...and only end up with about five bites with meat.  it was almost like a scavenger hunt...which would be fun, if i wasn\'t hungry and craving the deliciousness of cow.\n\noverall, my portion size was okay, once i threw out the green nonsense (it has no place being served with this meal) and mixed all of my shit MYSELF.  oh, and btw, korean resaurant, i know i\'m white but that doesn\'t mean that i don\'t like kimchee...don\'t skimp on my sides, motherfuckers...it makes me cranky.\n\ntwo stars for filling me up, even tho it was a total letdown.  *sigh*'

The wait staff was very friendly, clean, and helpful.  \n\nThe sushi was nothing extraordinary.  I thought it was rather fresh, for a sushi spot in the outskirts of Montreal (an industrial area of Longueuil), and the place had some very interesting interpretations of rolls.  Deep fried dragon rolls, a roll with red eggs, ahi, shrimp and carrots... all in all, not BAD, but some of the flavor combinations were certainly questionable.\n\nWe ordered a large tray of a variety of sushi, and each of us had a salad or miso soup.

That's what made the idea of the restaurant fun, but no one told me about how delicious the goat is.  I assume they are slow roasting or stewing the meat, because it was so tender and so juicy.  It comes with fresh cilantro and diced onions.  I certainly felt I had overdosed on meat afterwards, but loved every bite."

S"We'd made up our minds to grab a bite in the National Portrait Gallery but decided to pop across the road to the Square for a change of scenery.  Have to say the jury's out on whether we chose wisely. \n\nInside is pretty standard 'sandwich shoppy' though there are some comfy seats to grab. We sat near the door - mistake number one, and ordered a steak baguette (not bad) and a chicken and sweet corn chowder - mistake number two.\n\nFor some reason folk coming in and out didn't quite grasp the concept of a front door that can close as well as open so it was a chilly dining experience.  Got up to close it once but hoped the staff might have done something after the double doors were left open for the fifth time. Not good.\n\nI'd opted for the steak, but sweetness and light thought the chowder would be more up her street.  Golden rule for chefs - you can't take salt out, so better to under do it than over do it.  I could almost see her mineral levels rising in front of me and said goodbye to my can of San Pellagrino as she tried in vain to combat her saline intake.\n\nThat said, I thought the steak baguette was pretty decent but I don't think we'll be rushing back."

S'The Blue Parrot is a quirky little place in Stockbridge. The chicken and cashew chimichanga I had was extremely good, packed with mountains of succulent chicken. Their soup was tasty, also. Service wasn\'t quite what it could have been, and their cellar-conversion toilets will divide opinion, but it\'s well worth a visit.\n\nOverall, we said: "I was impressed with the Blue Parrot. It served me two good dishes, in quirky surroundings...I\'m not the world\'s biggest fan of Mexican food, not least because over the years I\'ve eaten in some very ropey Mexican places around Edinburgh, but I\'d happily head back here the next time I\'m feeling the need."'

S'Though I would "sneak" an occasional cone at Mickey\'s or a hi-brow gelato now and then, or more frequently rationalize a frozen yogurt, post-middle aged expansion of the mid-section discouraged me from returning to DQ, THE original frozen dessert-centric franchise.  It\'s been too long: DQ is still the queen and king of soft-serve ice cream (or ice milk, as may be proper).  \n\nWhile I haven\'t tried the sandwiches in years (they used to have a killer BBQ sandwich), ice cream desserts still reign supreme at the Dairy Queen. From simple cones to sundaes, to shakes, banana splits, ice cream cakes, to the trademark "Blizzard" with mix-ins, DQ is still the dominatrix of frozen dairy delight. \n\nOn this day I succumbed to the  call of the Blizzard , a thick soft-serve slurry of ice cream with mix-ins blended in, the obvious inspiration for McDonald\'s "Flurry", and I don\'t regret the indulgence (if I can now just keep my freshly requited passions under control). As I was mulling my choices the friendly counter help offered me a suggestion I hadn\'t noted on the menu, the combination known as "the cookie jar", a blend of cookie dough and crushed Oreo. I think I love you. \n\nI decided to sit and savor and watch the insane 5 o\'clock traffic on West Camelback go by. A family of 3 were the only other customers enjoying the cool of the smallish seating area, though there appeared to be steady business at the drive-thru. I suffered a moment of banana envy as they brought those picture-perfect banana splits to their table: three smooth, gleaming rounded minarets of vanilla, complete with the DQ curl on top, each topped with the venerable toppings of my memory from  DQ back home: strawberry, chocolate syrup , and the third  perhaps pineapple. (I\'ll finish page 2 of that sentence another time.)\n\nThis is a small, older DQ, set close to the road  on a moderately drab section of West Camelback, just off the 17 that undoubtedly was widened to take up a good bit of space out front.  The walk-up counter is small and your field of vision is crowded with menus and color posters and pictures of most every cold comfort you\'ve ever known and probably more, including a bright-colored free-standing sign announcing that DQ now serves Orange Julius smoothies.  The dining area is small, but not cramped, a tad worn-looking but clean. Every table is spotless and there\'s no trash on the floor.  Both young women working the counter and drive-thru were pleasant, offered genuine smiles,  were courteous, competent on the register,  and quick on service. A return trip will be required to report on the restroom. That\'s my ticket anyway.'

The large 18" Christina\'s Special pizza we ordered was made with fresh dough and sauces.

Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck.\nThe lo mien was also horrible. There was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around. \nIf I wanted to order leftover's I would order leftover's!\n\nThere saving grace is their hot sour soup. Very tasty. But...... I had one bad experience with it where I ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container, they put the left over/bottom of the pot in and filled it up only 3/4 of the way. Talk about shady service! I even watched them do it from behind the counter. Trying to pull a fast one on me. I think NOT!\n\nI'm still giving it a solid 2 stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too (other than the tasty soup, that is when they have it available). But in all honestly, nothing special. I can go to any Chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week. \n\nSo yeah.....If you want good Chinese. this is not the place I recommend. If you want quick Chinese just because your craving it....well maybe rethink it or just settle for the China Inn."

S"when organising a work night out, it can be hard to find a venue that is willing to host a dozen plus women (and one man) from HR that are looking for a decent meal without paying loads of money.  fortunately New York Steam Packet fits this criteria quite well, a three course meal for \xc2\xa315.95, BYOB and \xc2\xa31 corkage.  so last friday night this is where i headed...\n\nnow this place is well hidden, thankfully getting dropped off right at the bottom of the alley way with the driver telling us it's right up there made it a bit easier to find.  however we were confronted with a short cobbled alley that had seen better days and us in 4 inch heels.  arm in arm we walked as daintly as possible to the door only to be greeted by a rather ominous like spiral staircase.  we walked up to the restaurant with a rather massive fear of how we would ever make it back down those stairs at the end of the meal!  the restaurant itself is small and they do two seatings per evening.  one at 6pm and the other at 8:15pm.  it's good for large parties though as they can accomodate about three large groups at each seating and don't seem bothered by loud laughter and chatting.\n\nthe menu is fairly simple, three courses for \xc2\xa315.95 with about 6 choices per course.  i went with the deep fried potato skins followed by the beef burger.  the potato skins were ok, i had expected them to have melted cheese in the middle as this is what potato skins are like in the states.  but they were literally just deep friend large wedges of potatoes with a chilli mayo on the side.  tasty enough, but not exciting.  the beef burger was much better though and i did really enjoy this.  however the fries were a bit meh with a lot of them being soggy.  my last course was chocolate fudge cake which was lovely but i was too full after only a few bites to try and finish this.  the meal in total with tip and corkage fees for 12 of us was \xc2\xa321 each.  hard to complain as i brought my own bottle of wine which i drank most of...\n\noverall, i thought New York Steam Packet was ok.  i had a decent meal at good value, but i wasn't overly impressed.  Also the cobbled lane and stairs up to the restaurant are pretty much a death trap for any woman that wears heels, so i had to knock a star off for this.  i'd return if it was suggested for another night out, but wouldn't rush back."

S"Edinburgh is a city with a proliferation of sandwich shops and most of them are not very good. Fresh Cut is one of four (yes, four) that sit next to each other on Lothian Road. I'd always given it a wide berth as, from the outside, it just looks like any other bog standard sandwich place selling uninspired food to hoardes of office workers. I went there for some scran today though and was pleasantly surprised. The ciabatta was still warm from the oven and there were lots of lovely fillings to choose from: I ended up going for chorizo, goats cheese, roasted red peppers and tomato chutney. It set me back \xc2\xa33.50, but I was the envy of the office and nicely full for the rest of the afternoon."

S"This is my ultimate swanky lunch cafe. If you are looking for an ever-so-slightly overpriced sandwich salad or soup with a bit of southern California feel, then this is the place for you! Everything is basically a la carte, but worth it. The crowd is typically business folks on their lunch breaks, so don't even try to get quick service around noon. The sandwiches are all homemade recipes, and come with a bit more flavor than your regular sub or soup in a can...and they have italian sodas! Yay for that! Every month or so they feature a local artist on the walls too, so you can enjoy your sandwich and some nice artwork. When it is cool out, the patio is always packed. It's a bit hard to find because of its corner location, but look for it. You will not be let down.\n\nRecommended sandwich: The chicken salad on sourdough.\n\nRecommended salad: The baja. The avacado is so fresh everytime.\n\nRecommended drink: Strawberry Vanilla Italian soda with cream."

S"This place is definitely the best Chinese take out in Madison! I'm a pretty tough critic as far as Chinese take out goes, so I'm glad to have finally found a place in town that I'm willing to eat at. \n\nBig note here. They close before Yelp or Google lists. They're part of a chain of similar named restaurants, but they run themselves and function differently. The food is better than the other locations and the hours are shorter. I tried to submit a time change, but Yelp hasn't responded. I believe it was an hour and half earlier for  closing time than what is listed. Either way, I suggest calling to double check.\n\nI went under the impression that they were open. Turns out they hadn't shut the lights off, locked the doors, or anything else, but had cleaned and broken everything down. We went in to order and they didn't mention being closed. My boyfriend and I  had a feeling what was going on so we asked. They said they had closed, but they were more than willing to make our food. We tried insisting that we could go elsewhere and it would be absolutely no problem, but they insisted back. So we ordered. 10 minutes later and we had steaming hot, delicious smelling food and the entire staff jumped into their cars. \n\nThanks guys! You definitely have my business!"

S"I came here on Saturday for breakfast. I knew that since this place is still new that it wouldn't be as busy as most breakfast places in town. I was right.. there was only one other couple in there when we got in which was nice. The decor is tastefully done I just didn't like when they turned on the overhead fans because things were blowing off the table a bit. \n\nI was going to just order crepes but my husband suggested I do that as a side order because he wanted some too. We decided on their Sundae Crepes it had banana, and strawberries in them. Those were huge especially if I compare them to IHOP crepes. I'm not one to complain though...the more crepe the better! They were really good too! \n\nI had an Omelet that had tomatoes, bacon, cheese, and topped with avocado. It was good but it was missing something so I asked for some sour cream on the side. ..perfect! It also came with a side of potatoes which reminded me of the ones at the Cracked egg. They were just as delicious!\n\nMy husband had the Denver Omelet with a side of hash browns. Judging from the empty plate he liked it ! His only complaint was that the coffee tasted funny...I tasted it just to check. It did have a weird after taste to it. \n\nI liked this place especially because they offer crepes. I think they are pretty good competition for the other breakfast houses in town!"

The place was pretty busy, as it was during the peak lunch hour. I was in the mood for a salad, and since there was only one on the menu, my choice was made for me. I got to pick the protein though. I chose the tuna salad. The boyfriend got the hook & ladder combo (cute). We were both amused by the large selection of hot sauces that were available (we both LOVE spicy food & hot sauce). I was largely underwhelmed with the salad, which consisted of large leafs of lettuce, a few thick bell pepper slices and a large wedges of tomato. It was topped with three sizable scoops of tuna salad and provolone cheese slices. I just wasn't psyched on the salad at all. Yes, I know I'm at a sub shop ordering a salad, but it really isn't that hard to throw a decent salad together. The boyfriend said his sub was meh. I personally prefer Which Wich."

There was an omelet and pancake station, salad area with a delish caprese salad and smoked salmon among other things, huge hot food buffet with eggs benedict and Spinach benedict, sausage, bacon, biscuits & sausage gravy, monkey bread, scrambled eggs, Florentine quiche, cheesy hash browns, tater tots and breakfast enchilada\'s and honeyed chicken.  Desserts included were a brownie dessert and pineapple upside down cake.  They were running a buy one get one free bloody mary\'s or mimosa\'s .

It's a little gem In an industrial area with not a lot of dining choices sans the JITB down the street. \n\nThe service is always quick and pleasant, prices reasonable, generous portion sizes and above average food. The Chipotle Steak Sandwich is the bomb! I also like the Albuquerque Turkey Sandwich. All sandwiches/entrees come with a side choice, the normal prefab frozen fries (always served hot), coleslaw, cottage cheese, etc. Daily lunch specials like Italian Beef Sandwiches and Friday Fish Fry are both excellent choices. A co-worker recently had the shrimp basket and she ate everything, fries, coleslaw and the huge breaded shrimp, said she would be ordering it again. \n\nThey have happy hour and televise UFC fights but I can't vouch for either. \n\nIf you work in the area give them a try for lunch it's a great little family run, neighborhood business serving good food."

Hot Rods has quickly become my favorite place to go after work with collegues and friends alike to de-stress from the day and get a little blitz'd.  Happy Hour from 4 to 7pm makes for a good time.  Finger foods half off, cheap beer and discounted shots are all on the menu.\n\nThe bartenders are pretty good eye candy for men and women alike.  They're friendly, will make you some wild-ass shots and are attentive.\n\nWord of warning to the non-smokers out there...if you can't hang with the smell, stay out of the bar.  I smoke off and on, and it doesn't bother me, but it seems like there isn't a soul in the bar that doesn't smoke, so prepare to walk into the cloud and leave smelling like a Marlboro factory reject.\n\nBest part about this place?!?!?

We ordered 2 chicken Shwarmas in pita, one with an order of fries and garlic sauce & the other with a side of tabbouleh & humus as well as a can of pop & a pellegrino, total price $28. We love Shwarmas & have tried many different ones all over the world.. These were the greasiest Shwarmas ever! I have never experienced such a greasy mess before! The side of humus was very tiny, I think it was served in a toothpick container. In the tabbouleh we could barely find parsley (the main ingredient), it was a heap of bulgar wheat. The garlic sauce for the fries tasted like it was mayonnaise with garlic, not the traditional middle eastern garlic sauce that we know & love. One positive, the fries were crispy. \nThe waitress asked if I wanted all the left overs to go, I told her no, I found the food too greasy & we were given 2 complementary baklava pieces on our way out. Definitely still not enough to make us want to try this place again.'

From their Goat Cheese Filo to their Chicken baguette served with this marmalade chili dressing to their perfectly cooked Steak/frites - it was one of my favorite restaurants in the city.\n\nIf I ever return, I would love to go again although it seems like they don't stick to that old menu anymore. Perhaps since their reviews are so terrible, they might want to go back to their roots and figure out what they did well back then. \n\nAlso music, lighting and beautiful server Lydia lol...I can still recall all of it..."

They put my fries in these old classic car trays and would post them up in my room.  I went here for a nostalgic feeling, but the food was shabby.  I used to love the hamburgers, but they don't have many options for vegetarian folks.  The service was good, but I just don't get down with Rockin' Robin jams.

S"The place may have a really nice ambiance, deco, looks nice, and have a pretty looking menu, but when it comes to the food, it's just an average place serving Indian cuisine with jacked up prices. I can't fault them for the prices because almost all restaurants on this strip in the Gay Village are such and tend to target the tourist market. \n\nIf you know Indian food then you'll know that the food is not prepared in an original Indian manner but its more Bangladeshi style which makes sense given the fact that those who run this business are Bangladeshi.  The appetizers and some curry dishes are alright but items such as Biryani misses the mark. In terms of service, the wait staff is somewhat friendly but they lack in checking in when you need them to. I noticed that they tend to mingle around the bar area for their chit-chat and bonding. One odd thing that they did is that they made us walk over to the bar area when we wanted to pay with a credit card, instead of running our card through the system and bringing a slip for us to sign, like every other restaurant does. \n\nI can say that I tried this place but it's not my favorite and I doubt I'll be returning unless I'm chased down the street and I need a place to hide and blend in with my people! :-)"

S"I've been trolling all the Mexican reviews lately and have seen many people talk about beef tongue and beef cheek tacos. I got it in my mind that I had to try this somewhere. Search for lengua brought up a few places and this was closest to home.\n\nCompany always makes a food adventure more fun so I dropped NormR a message and asked if he wanted to grab some lunch.\n\nWe arrived at 1:30 on a Saturday and the place was empty. This appeared to be a family affair type place and were greeted by who I would assume was a son with a spiked mohawk. I already liked the place but this was a little weird for a Mexican joint.\n\nAfter looking over and menu and doing some guessing as to what things were he came over to take our order I asked him a question about something. He informed me the English version was on the opposite side.. Ahh the DOH moment ;) been having way to many of those lately.\n\nThis is a really cool little restaurant. Someone had painted Mexican jungle themes all over the inside and outside of the place. It was a really homey, cozy type feel. I think Norm was able to get some good picture of the interior. They had a great patio area that would be fun to make use of the few times a year you can in the valley.\n\nOnto the foodz!\n\nChips/Salsa:\nNot the high point of the meal.. The chips were a little on the stale/heavy side. The salsa was very runny and was far from the most flavorful I've had.\n\nTacos:\nAll these were served in soft double corn tortillas with onions and a verde salsa. The verde sauce was very good. Garlic, tomatillo cilantro, citrus, salt. Just the thing you want on a street type taco.\n\nBeef Cheek:\nThis had a nice strong beef flavor with a decent but not overly amount of gristle. Honestly I'm not sure what I expected it wasn't anything super mind blowing. I've had much better beef tacos and I didn't pick up a huge different between the cheek/head and some other cut of meat.\n\nPastor:\nWOW! that's right.. a full blown WOW. This stuff was freaking amazing. For those who are unaware this is a marinaded pork which is cooked the same as a shawarma. Its stacked on a vertical rotisserie with onions and peppers and cooked slowly and shaved as ordered. I want a freaking 5lb burrito filled with this! This was almost enough for me to change my entire cheat meals plans just to go back here tonight and stuff myself with this.\n\nBeef Tongue:\nI've never had this before but Norm had and said it was very mild. To me it tasted like beef with a strange texture. I was kind of disappointed because I was expecting something very different. I'll let Norm comment on how this compared to other tongue dishes he has had.\n\nLiver:\nThis was VERY strong. Like I had to take very small bites because it was kicking me in the face. We weren't sure if this was beef or pork liver. I believe its something I could really like after I've had it a few times. This may have been the first time I tried liver beef/pork. The more I think about it the more I like it. To me its kind of like learning to enjoy a really strong cheese. Gotta get your feel wet before you dive in.\n\nGuacamole:\nI have regained faith in humanity over the last month. Most of the Mexican places I've been to recently have been making this correctly and letting the avocado be the star of the show. This was really good here and very fresh. No tomato ruining things. The guac had mild green onion, garlic, cilantro, citrus notes which is just how it should be.\n\nAll in all I was happy with the meal. I will be back here for some more pastor. I'm curious how the rest of the Mexican staples are here."

Carhops inside looks more like an old bar with few tables for dinners. We ordered Z28 and Carhops special. Z28 is nothing but cheesesteak sandwich with almost minced meat and few onion pieces. The steaks are thin and minced. The sandwich is tasteless.   The Carhops special consists of thinly sliced Italian meats, cheese, lettuce and hot pickled peppers. The seeds from the pickled peppers over taken sandwich, which leaves a taste of vinegar and pulps of peppers after each bite. After the meal, we miss Charley's Philly cheesesteak sandwich, which is a chain restaurant. Big disappointment!"

I live nearby and thought I would pick up a burrito to take to school with me for the next day.\n\nWhen I went to eat it in the morning, I decided that I would like it to have some cheese. As I opened the tortilla a found a piece of a metal sponge on the tortilla. I let that issue slide and I ripped that piece of the tortilla off.\n\nAs I ate it later and fought the horribly over-cooked flavorless meat (I had also ordered the Green Chile Burrito per the employee's recommendation) I found A BUG inside of the burrito!!! I was so disgusted!! I have never had something like this happen to me before and I ignored the metal to only find something even worse.\n\nI then called them to explain to them what had happened and they asked if I wanted another burrito. I refused the offer, because really, WHO would want to eat there after that?!? I told them that I was just calling to let them know what had happened so that they could be more careful and clean and then they HUNG UP the phone on me!!!! They wouldn't even take responsibility for this nastiness!!!\n\nI paid $4.50 for the burrito and I left a $3 tip so that I could eat METAL and BUGS?!?

I guess they've moved a ways down the street to 2010 E Broadway since there is another creole/caribbean restaurant in the place it used to be. Anyway, the parking at this place is behind the building and it's not paved, so I drove behind the building to park and there was a group of guys just standing back there hanging out. I was almost afraid to get out of the car, but I did anyway and went around to the front to go inside. The place was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon, there was just the owner's kids sitting watching TV. The lady at the counter was not very friendly, which is what warranted the three stars instead of the four stars I would have given them since the food was really good. I had the curry goat (my favorite) which came with cooked cabbage and rice and peas, and a beef meat pattie. The portion was HUGE! Enough for two meals. The goat meat was tender and flavorful, like I said, had the woman at the counter been a bit more pleasant I would have given it a four to four and a half stars. I would probably go back to this place, I want to try the brown chicken stew!!!"

There is a very cozy and hidden cafe waiting for you in the back. Wooden tables, fluffy red pleather seats, free wifi, and probably the best fresh hot mint tea in all of Montreal.

To our pleasant surprise, our experience was similar to Brian C.'s in that we found no wine snobbery at all. Our server was very happy to advise us and answered all of our questions without making us feel bad. I cannot remember exactly which wines we ordered, but I do remember they were very nice. \n\nFor food, we ordered the Leather and Feather and the Charcuterie Platter, to start. Both were delicious! The Charcuterie Platter had a very nice selection and very reasonable portions (not teeny tiny like I've had at other places). I would go back just for that! We all very much enjoyed our main courses (2 had lamb, 1 cod, and 1 steak). And to finish off, we shared the Mignardises Platter. Tiny little deserts, just the right size to have a little taste without exploding. \n\nThe prices are ok, not overpriced, but not cheap either. The atmosphere is also ok. We at no time felt rushed and very much enjoyed a leisurely meal, but the place was not full on a Friday night. When I go out on a Friday night in Montreal, I expect it to be a little more hustley-bustley, but it was nice to really be able to chat with my dinner companions. \n\nWill absolutely go back, if not for a full meal, then for a nice glass of wine, the charcuterie platter, and the teeny tiny mignardises."

Don\'t you refund it by entering it in the register? Strange ... and then, I commented my food was ice cold at this point. Told her I did not want any of it, she offered to bring over fresh food.

Very reasonable Prices and great family meal specials. \n\nLarge Pepperoni Pizza + 2 liter of soda for $10 bucks. (requires a coupon, but they print millions of them) You can't beat that!"

This is for all the all the Jack in the boxes that helped me make it through the day!\nJack in the Box has everything you craving for. Starting with the most basic fast food items. Burgers and fries. Want Mexican? Best tacos for only .99 for two! If you looking for some Asian how about chicken teriyaki bowl with egg roll. Get a deli trio Grilled sandwich if Italian is what your looking for. they also have some healthy selections like salads and grilled chicken if counting calories is your thing. With all the selections, even if you don't know what you want,  you're surely will find something to suit your fancy. What else can you ask for? 24 hour breakfast? You got it! No matter how late I wake up I never miss breakfast when jacks' around. \nThank you for being there for me!\n..........If you are what you eat, is that makes me a Jack?"

S"Yelp makes you give a place at least one star, I wish I could give this place less. Fuddruckers is a hole. I lost a bet with a friend and had to buy him lunch, he chose  Fuddruckers. We walk In and I order the least damaging thing I could put in my body, a salmon burger. I notice they have whole grain buns so I ask for that with grilled onions. My friend orders the one pound burger because anytime someone else is buying he always gets the most expensive item or biggest on the menu. So we sit down and I'm wondering why my bill was 32 bucks for lunch. Then I see this rip off burger joint charges 50 cents extra for whole grain buns, 85 cents for grilled onions and 4 bucks for endless sodas. He ordered fries which are also extra. 32 bucks for lunch?!?! For burgers?!? My salmon burger was ok, moist and flavorful, unfortunately the grilled onions made the bun soft and it fell apart so I ate it with a fork. His burger was cooked to order and flavorful, he said. The fries were nothing special. Overall I think you can get better burgers elsewhere, and not have to shell out almost 35 bucks for them. This was my first and last visit to Fuddruckers. They can go Fudd themselves!"

S"Candy Bar is one of those place you instantly feel cooler when you enter. Its one of these trendy, swish bars that attempts to be uber cool and chic. However, I feel there is a bit of a contradiction going on.\n\nCandy Bar advertises all their food as under a fiver. So riddle me this, how can you be so chic and fancy by serving food so cheap? Its a ploy to attract people in off the usually expensive George Street, and it works. I was there for lunch and the place was packed with 20-something woman having a gossip. \n\nThe menu consists of nachos, sandwiches, lite bites, salads etc. We had the nachos to share- nothing special here quite a measly portion if you ask me. We both went for Caesar Salad for our main course and it was below average. Far too much mayo (not really what I would call Caesar dressing) and chewy croutons. I haven't had a chewy crouton before, but it isn't very pleasant I tell you. We both had tap water which came with cucumber in it. The only place I have had that before is the Ritz in Paris, so this must be the new trendy chic thing to do with water.\n\nOverall, there is nothing outstanding about Candy Bar. They do have a varied cocktail list, but we didn't try. Its basically a fancy looking bar with mediocre food. And if your selling food for under a fiver what do you expect?"

S'My husband and I visited for lunch as part of our "Team Lara Saturday". \n\nCuban Sylvain Bakery is tucked away in a strip mall on the north side of Tropicana. The parking lot is small but parking is ample. Inside are four high boy tables with stools and a small bartop, making seating for just about 12. As such, it seemed most of the orders were to go. \n\nLet me get this out: this is not, by any means, a fancy place. It\'s straightforward - menu, tables, and pizza and very fair prices. \n\nLike the ambiance, the menu is focused: small and large pizzas ranging from $5-$12 with mostly pork-centric toppings (chorizo, ham, or Hawaiian) and a selection of Cuban beverages, including shakes. As far as bakeries go, the pastry selection seemed limited, but they do offer cakes and a few desserts. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuban-sylvain-bakery-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=pibdh3ESU8EMzTIJ-DPZcQ&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA#RQzwp3EDKtwkBrt3tpqoEA\n\nNow, what makes a Cuban pizza, you ask? My extensive *cough* GOOGLE *cough* research leads me to understand the following:\n\n1. The crust is puffier.\n2. The cheese used is a blend of mozzarella and gouda.\n3. The toppings are baked IN to the pizza (meaning crust, sauce, toppings, AND THEN cheese)\n\nAll that said, at $13 for two small pizzas (one pepperoni and one ham), a Malta (AKA instant diabetes with 36g sugar 58g carbs), and a bottle of water, I\'m satisfied. What stood out for me was the crust, which was definitely puffier, but not at all doughy. It was like a pizza crust had a baby with a loaf of Cuban bread and happiness happened for all. It was well baked and had a lovely cheesy crispiness on the edges. Clearly, from my photo, the the toppings were baked on top, but that\'s fine with me. We ate the pepperoni pizza on site and it was served straight out of the oven. The ham pizza was devoured upon our return home. I have to say, it was just as good a little cold as it allowed for the flavors of the sauce, crust, and jam to become more pronounced. Also, the jam was far more generously topped. The plan, next time, is to try the onion pizza as it seemed a popular selection among those who ordered after us.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuban-sylvain-bakery-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=pibdh3ESU8EMzTIJ-DPZcQ&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA#pibdh3ESU8EMzTIJ-DPZcQ'

Went in with an open mind and I have no problem giving 4 or 5 stars when it is warranted, even for a buffet, but this place barely qualifies for 1 pitiful star. I would give it ZERO stars if it was an option. As someone who loves asian food, this buffet made me feel so sad for the total lack of flavor and passion by those who prepared the food at this sorry excuse for a chinese buffet. Case in point, raw jalapeno pepper in a sushi roll and breaded chicken that was so black it looked like a piece of coal. WTF? Would not be suprised when Lin Buffet is on Dirty Dining. Do not go here!

S"We ended up at Sammy's Famous Corned Beef after trying to get pho at Tram's Kitchen and forgetting it was a Monday (Tram's is closed on Mondays).  The bright neon lights flashing FAMOUS across the street beckoned for us to head over and try it out... so we did.\n\nI ordered the Sammy's Special, which is 5 ounces of corned beef topped with sauerkraut or cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing on your choice of rye.  I went with sauerkraut and rye bread.  I also got a side of potato salad b/c it costs a buck and I was kinda worried I'd still be a little hungry after the sandwich.  The sandwich was alright; the corned beef wasn't as salty as I expected and sliced really thin.  I would've liked my bread toasted, the heat of the meat and sauerkraut warmed up the bread from the inside.  Toasted bread might have also held up to the wetness of the sauerkraut and Russian dressing; the bread was extremely soggy by my last bite.\n\nOne of my companions said their pastrami was underwhelming and to stick with corned beef (he had two sandwiches).\n\nThe potato salad was pretty standard with a dijon mustard base.  \n\nThey also have a bar in the dining section of the place, but since it was around 2:30 PM in the afternoon I decided not to get a beer at that time.\n\nOverall I was satisfied with my meal and I'd probably drop by again if I was in the area, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get their sandwich."

The lack of parking is kind of a bummer here, but the overall location is so much better.  \n\nI'd say in the last 15+ years that I've been going, the location is the only thing that's improved...because the food could never be topped from day 1!  My folks are still driving 30 miles on a regular basis to get pizza here.

S'It wasn\'t until my recent visit to Rose\'s Ice Cream, that I even noticed Calli\'s. Since then, I\'ve driven by a few times and been meaning to check them out--mostly because I had no idea what to expect. After I (finally) finished catching up around the house on Sunday, it seemed like the perfect point to head out for dinner and do a review. A little poking around Urban Spoon suggested Calli\'s is open for dinner 7 days a week, so a Sunday evening visit proved quite successful.\n\nIf I had to characterize the new establishment, I\'d call it "low-key casual dining." The menu lists appetizers, sandwiches and a few entrees, but no salads. From over at the bar (a surprise attribute), you can order a few craft beer options in bottles with one or two on draft, and even a wine option or two. If the weather\'s nice, they even have a good bit of cafe seating on the side walk.\n\nWhat did I find? Well, Calli\'s has only been around for 4 or 5 short weeks (since mid-July), and they already have some key details either in order or heading in the right direction. That\'s not to say Regent Square\'s newest dining option has smoothed over all the rough edges, but I definitely expect great things from this place.\n\nThere\'s actually a more detailed review here...\nhttp://www.foodburgh.com/2009/08/callis-regent-square'

S'I think "promising" is perhaps the best word for Turquoise Thistle. Situated in the Hotel Indigo, on York Place, it\'s a smart restaurant space, with a nice adjoining bar area. Lunch is reasonably priced at \xc2\xa312.95 for two courses; \xc2\xa314.95 for three. It lacks something, though, and a number of the dishes have room for improvement. However, the beef shin, currently on their menu, is very good, so it\'s worth a visit simply to sample that dish.\n\nSo overall, we said: "Turquoise Thistle was pretty decent. I get the impression that there\'s a really good restaurant waiting to happen here, but things just need to be approached with a little more confidence. Dishes were well thought out, but lacked a little in the execution. The place is likely to suffer from lack of lunchtime footfall, while the tram works are going on in York Place, but will serve its hotel patrons rather nicely. I can imagine that I\'ll be back in the future. I hope to see them building on the success of their friendly service and stylish premises, as well as that excellent beef dish, which was a real winner."'

S"When I saw that ASU had decided to put in a hotdog stand within sight of my office window, I became concerned for my arteries.  Luckily, however, they also put in E2.  E2, I believe, means the second incarnation of the Engrained restaurant in ASU's MU building, which focuses on local and organic healthy foods.  E2 takes up the same mantra, but offers less (due to its size and focus on speed).\n\nIn the what has become my crisis of conscience corner, I have reluctantly chosen E2 over the hotdog place every time.  Devil be damned.\n\nI'm afraid that the food at E2 isn't all that stellar however.  I have enjoyed the morning yogurt, but they do over sweeten it a bit.  That's not to my taste, but they will probably sell a ton of it to frappachino types.  The sandwiches I've had have been premade, making the bread a bad texture from refrigeration and the bottom layer always soggy from the dressing they use.  The drinks here are great, as are the pastries.  The green tea is delicious and keeps me going for hours.  \n\n4 stars because I applaud the attempt to make campus healthier, but not 5 because I feel like the menu design is all talk and not actually tested on a daily basis."

S"First & last trip in one. We stopped to try something different for lunch. I got chicken sandwich with red potatoes & my husband got meatloaf sandwich with mashed potatoes & gravy. All our potatoes were cold & were in dire need of seasoning. The gravy had no flavor. The bread was so tough you couldn't eat the sandwich. The chicken was terribly DRY. Tea dispenser was water, not even any brown color. We got lemonade (taste more like Kool Aide). We wasted almost $20 on that lunch. Would not recommend Boston Market!!"

Not exactly true, but it IS hard to find! \n\nI've been here twice and both times the food was very tasty. I think the prices are too high for this type of food or I would have given it a better rating. I almost always try to get some pie; the French apple is the best! Oh my god - so good! They also have sweet tea, so yes. \n\nCustomer service is usually a nice elderly lady. In fact, most of the clientele are elderly people or families.

The website was beautiful and the interactive layout was so well presented that I thought I would be in for a great experience. Unfortunately, the eel was a bit fishy (ha ha I know, it's fish, but the taste was too strong) and the salmon was bland and water-washy. It tasted like soba sushi to me, and I am not a fan of soba sushi.\n\nThe tartar maki however, was the best and I think that's why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 2.. It had strawberries and the combination of tastes worked really well.. \n\nThe sauces were...... All the same. I couldn't distinguish between them due to the extensive amount of mayonnaise in both. \n\nI can't describe the taste of the fish because it wasn't necessarily bad, but the quality was not up to par."

S'I moved to this area in 2003 and have been coming here ever since. There have been some times that the crew wasn\'t at their sharpest, and one period of about a year when there was a language barrier (I always had to check before I drove off to see if my Diet Coke was really a Dr. Pepper), but overall, it\'s been very good. And ALWAYS very, very clean, which is what I *really* want in a restaurant. \n\nThe food is typical McDonalds. I\'ve never had a cold or stale sandwich or fries, and whenever there\'s something wrong, it\'s always fixed quickly. \n\nNow, as for "quickly" .. please consider that people can only move and food can only cook so fast. I usually go during breakfast & lunch, and while it\'s very busy, they usually have a full kitchen. There are only one or two cashiers, but if you pile up too many orders, there\'s more of a chance to get it wrong. \n\nSaturdays are CRAZY busy, I try not to go then! Sometimes I really, really need a Filet \'O Fish, but I know what it\'ll be like, so I\'m not surprised if I\'m waiting forever. \n\nAnd Shane M ... is it really fair to rate this one McDs so low when you get sick at ALL of them? I\'ve noticed that on other restaurants I\'ve reviewed, too; food allergies are a real problem these days, perhaps it\'s not "karma". \n\nAnyway, if you like McDonald\'s, it\'s a good one, but busy.

As someone who recently moved here from a small southern town, that\'s great news for me. Everything from the leg lamp (who doesn\'t love a good Christmas movie reference?!) to the friendly greeter to the awesome waitress made this experience really special.\n\nWe both ordered chicken fingers. They came out quickly, and they were delicious. My mother joined us halfway through the meal and ordered pumpkin pie, warm and with "twice the whipped cream you\'d normally get." It was no problem at all. At the end of the meal, my daughter wanted another one of the cardboard sleighs the kids meal came in (which was a really nice touch). It was no problem. the waitress hopped off with a smile and came back with two clean ones. \n\nI\'ll definitely be going back.

S'My boyfriend\'s dad gave us the 2011 Entertainment Guide book for Christmas and, slowly, we have been exploring new-to-us-restaurants with our coupons. His dad also has the same book and used his coupon for Anntony\'s yesterday for lunch. His dad is not one to call us and rave about a place, but he said we needed to check it out. We checked out the menu that was advertised in the book to see if the food matched our tastes. I was excited to see they offered Caribbean Crab Cakes so we headed out to Anntony\'s for dinner.\n\nWhen we walked in at 6:45, there was not a single person in the restaurant. We sat down and were handed menu\'s that differed from the menu in the entertainment book. I checked their menu on-line after dinner and found it to be correct with the menu at the restaurant though. The menu consisted of all chicken and some pork options. I was really disappointed to find that no crab-cake listed. In addition, their menu did not supply a description of the entrees, but it did for their sides. I found the menu very underwhelming. \n\nI ordered the chicken wing dinner that was tossed in a special Caribbean sauce with their black beans and mac and cheese. My boyfriend ordered the chicken breast with collard greens and rice. The wings were okay, some were dry and some were not. He said his chicken tasted like it was leftover from lunch and was dry as well. The beans, mac and cheese, and rice were very good though. \n\nTheir slogan is "Don\'t Worry About Nothin\' Mon!" I WISH! I was very worried while I was dining for the following reasons: \n-They had two TVs on that showed depressing world events (Not sure why a restaurant has TVs in it, it\'s not a bar). \n-The server, although very pleasant and sweet, did not have her hair tied back and wore a strapless dress with flip flops. We asked for hot sauce and she brought out a bottle of sauce with out a lid on it. Where was the Health Department when we needed them? \n-Why were we the only people in the restaurant??? \n\n\nI can only assume that my boyfriends dad liked the place so much was due to the amount of food you get with the low priced meals and that lunch was a bit fresher than dinner. \n\nI would not recommend this place for dinner. Maybe lunch is better, but the food safety and health issues are a bit concerning.'

I sure didnt.\nOne day at lunch break my buddy Jose and I are out on the search for a good burrito, we\'d been burned previously by a competing little Taquer\xc3\xada, Senor Taco- now La Palapa, but i digress. So wondering where to go for our measly 30 minute break, and running short on time I was getting desperate. Then Jose opines, "oh man they have a salsitas here!"\nSo I jam on the e-brake and spin my 96 hyundai accent into a tailspin 180 degrees and jam on the pedal whipping it into the Salsitas parking lot.\nWe climb out of the egg shaped vehicle and i slide across the hood dukes of hazard style and we trot into the joint.\nStraight up authentico feel to the place, not a whitey around and just some really smelly (in a good way) grub sizzling away, there is a sneeze guard but behind it you can see all the various types of meats they offer, from Carnitas to Pastor, I was in hog heaven. \nWe order two burritos de pastor, I get mine w/ guac, pico, and refriend pintos free of charge. \nAs we waited we sipped on horchata poured from a huge bucket, and labour over the salsa bar picking and choosing our condiments. The salsa bar is really, probably my favorite part. I always get some sliced raddish, pickled carrot, shredded cabbage, lime, salsa verde, and a few sliced cucumbers to supplement my already hulking burro.\nBy the time we\'re done w/ the salsa bar, our burritos are finished and off we speed back to work. \nAs I\'m typing this my fingers smell of garlic and spiced pork meat, my stomach is full, and my eyelids heavy. \nAlthough the remainder of my day is hard to accomplish after my trips to salsitas I always leave satisfied. For under $5 you can grab a monster of a meal, that frankly isnt nearly as greasy or fatty as say Filly B\'s or that shit hole taco bell.\nI love salsitas and will continue to make my weekly pilgrimage.'

I normally order a two taco combo plate (the shredded beef is what I opt for), and they're pretty good. What really makes this place a win for me personally is their queso dip and their salsa.

The very next time after that I got very sick again. It was one of the worst food poisoning I've had since I was a kid. There also seems to be a foul smell inside, a mixture between them not cleaning out their grease traps properly, raw sewage, and a dirty restaurant with mildew floors. As far as the rude service goes, my friend and I were ordering take out a while back, and my buddy thought he had paid the whole balance, but apparently he was off by 10 dollars which was purely accident.

S"New and...I liked it! It's located on the second floor of the Ivy, just across the street from the Blumenthal Theater. If you come in from Tryon, you'll walk up a narrow stairwell and come in facing the bar. If you come in from the main Ivy's building, I am pretty sure you can find an elevator to get in. \n\nThe service was very friendly and attentive. There is plenty of seating and I've got to say, if you are into people watching, this is a nice set up. The decor is classy and room for lots of people. Sitting on the second floor, windows line the dining area. \n\nWe ordered the veggie lo mein and the General Tso's chicken. They came out promptly and fresh. Both portions were large and really enough to share if you weren't hungry for your own plate. \n\nTry it next time you are in Uptown. Most of the dishes for dinner are just under $10. Their menu also states that they can deliver."

S"as a lover of french cuisine I have been wanting to try this place for a while now. My husband and I finally made it there for valentine's day weekend and after seeing the special menu for the evening I had really high hopes. \n\nThe waiter brought us an amuse bouche - smoked bean puree on an endive leaf and a duck prosciutto with a raspberry balsamic reduction. The portion for the smoked bean was too large for an amuse bouche and the taste was ok, a little flat taste wise, my husband did not care for it at all. The prosciutto was well balanced with the raspberry reduction and was the prefered portion of the plate. \n\nThe next course was the appetizers - a trio of small dishes. A brown butter almond soup with some fresh creme and chervil. This was the best on the plate, lovely flavor and not too rich. Next was veal with a citrus glaze on a skewer. The veal was very tough and bland, very disappointing.  Finally was an oyster on the half shell with shallot. I was expecting something very different as I have had raw oysters prepared this way a few times when I have been in France. I was expecting a small amount of vinaigrette with some small pieces of shallot - what we got was an oyster with a pile of shallot that was been sauteed (?) in a vinaigrette. way too much on top that it ruined the flavor of the oyster, plus there was none of the natural juice from the oyster left. \n\nThe salad came next. baby filed greens with chilled steamed asparagus topped with a fresh goat cheese - lovely and fresh flavors. the chevre was excellent quality and taste. \n\nFinally was the main course. I opted for the quail over a Gorgonzola risotto. First, I was surprised with the choice of a blue cheese, why not use a french blue? But it was very tasty and the quail was well seasoned and prepared. There were also some crispy onions which added little to the dish but I liked the green beans. My husband picked the fillet with an avocado horseradish mash with crisped potatoes (think potato sticks) He was very happy with his dish overall. I tasted it, loved the mash - I had never had that combination before, the avocado lent a creaminess to it and the horseradish - love this stuff - added a subtle peppery like spice to it. Very nice. The beef was well prepared as well.\n\nThe final course was a desert sampler. 3 truffles - none of which were terribly good, IMO. The dark chocolate with rosemary was the best of the three, the sesame with white chocolate I would have spat out had I not been at a restaurant and the lavender in milk chcolate tasted like I was eating perfume - much much too strong. Thankfully the other desserts were much better. A tartlette filled with some sort of dark cherry filling topped with a cream cheese. As a huge fan of fruit tarts I was happy - especially once i pulled some of the cream cheese off the top. The crust had a great texture and flavor and the cherry filling was excellent. The best,however, was the chcolate macaroon passion fruit ice cream sandwich drizzled with a passionfruit caramel. I am still thinking about how delicious this was the next day. A complete homerun. \n\nThe restaurant decor, itself, was nice if not a tad boring and uninspired - we dined in the upstairs dining room - maybe it feels more authentic downstairs?  Some french music piped in was charming. The service staff was very friendly and attentive. The dishes were beautifully presented as well. \n\nI don't think we will go out of our way to go again. While it was one of the better meals we've had in Pittsburgh - we have not had much luck since moving here -  Le Pommier did not really live up to what I was expecting - especially for an almost $200 meal. That said, I would not rule out going again, maybe the a la carte menu is better?"

The table comes with a jug of water though, so it's not a big problem.\n\nThe service is brilliant too - when my cousin still hadn't arrived they took away his pre-ordered steak and chips and kept it on heat for him, providing fresh chips.

S'Sorely disappointed is the best way to sum up my evening. I went for restaurant week with a date and we both regret making regions bistro our choice. To start off they are clearly on the restaurant week website but although the event ends Sunday they said they had already ended it. To their credit the manager on duty did allow us to choose an app, main course and desert and give it to us at the special price. This only allowed us to experience more of the terrible. For apps we had the crab cakes and the gazpacho (I clearly remember saying the shrimp gazpacho, but our waiter must have misheard us). The soup was awful. The crab cakes uninspiring. The main course we chose turkey dinner and prime rib. The mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a bag, the vegetables also tasted like they came frozen in a bag. The worst might have been the stuffing, OMG what are they thinking, this is probably the absolutely worst stuffing I have ever tasted in my entire life. The only deceit thing was the bananas foster, but it was too little too late to save this disaster. Oh did I not mention the severely lacking wine selection? Oh yes, it was sad, like a puppy with three legs. For over a 100$ tab for two people I must reiterate I am sorely disappointed.'

S"I'm having a really hard time writing this review. I mean, I want to love this place so bad. It's Peruvian (as am I), it's close to my house, and it's close to my mom's house, too. So why, if I'm so predisposed to loving this place, is it only three stars? Read on, friend.\n\nFirst of all, this place is tucked away in the Marketon shopping center. It's near the Dotty's, in the back corner of the shopping center. The location isn't really an issue, except that parking in this shopping center is a pain. Again, it's in the Marketon shopping center, so there are tons of families and kids and stuff. I park near the burnt-down Jack in the Box because there are less cars there. Plus egress onto Decatur is easier. \n\nThe food servings are generous, but they're also expensive. the Ceviche Don Beto, which is a regular fish ceviche plus fried seafood stuffs, was delicious and a large portion, but $18 for that dish still seemed too high. I also ordered a lomo saltado (stir fried steak plus fries and rice) for my brother, and that was $12. That price seemed to more accurately match the meal: the food was good and the portion was good, and it wasn't too expensive!\n\nThe service at this place isn't the best, and I take issue with that. See, I expect that most low-budget restaurants are going to have poor decor and such, but providing good service is free. It costs nothing to ask me how my food is, refill my drink, or to more carefully wipe down the tables. Seriously. \n\nAgain, the prices aren't cheap. For two ceviches like mine, plus an appetizer and drinks, you're looking at like a $65 dinner for two. I would expect more for that price.\n\nUltimately, I can recommend this place based on the food. It's good and the portions are hearty, too. But the lack of service and high prices really bring this place down. I'll come here again, but now I know what to expect. So do you."

Both were wonderful, as were the drinks on the specials menu.  For our entrees, we ordered the Margherita pizza and the eggplant parm (Melanzane Alla Parmigiana).  The pizza was.....OK, nothing to write home about, but the eggplant parm was absolutely perfect, with the accompanying pasta served perfectly al dente.  We mentioned to the excellently attentive waiter that it was our anniversary, and he brought out a huge slice of tiramisu for our dessert, without our asking for it, and without charging us for it!  And when he brought out the check, we noticed he'd taken the 20% off the entire meal, including alcohol.  Doesn't get any better than that.  Now if they could only make the pizza a little more enticing, they'd earn five stars."

S"With St Andrew's there are two section' one for the takeaway's and the other as a sit in restaurant. The restaurant area looks more like a country pub look to it with wooden beams on the ceiling and chairs that look as they have come from a Greek restaurant.\n\nIt was the specials board that tempted us in \xc2\xa36.90 for a set meal was a steal.\n\n\nEven though the place may have smelt clean there where dead fly's in the window.\n\nOn second visit I was told that fresh fish would take 20 minutes to cook, the guy obviously was not a chef or cook.\n\nThe end product was over cooked and in edible fish, from a four star recommendation  now to a two star, very poor service."

S'This Carl\'s Jr. location probably has the best service I\'ve ever received at a fast food establishment.  Immediately after entering we were greeted with a cheerful "Welcome to Carl\'s Jr.!"  The cheerful demeanorwas carried by all of the employees leading to a pleasing experience.  Food came out fast and warm, and we were allowed to use a coupon even though we had already ordered and paid.  Halfway through lunch the employee that took our order came by the table and asked if there was anything she should get us.  \n\nAs for food, I had the portobello $6 burger.  It\'s a big burger, but they don\'t skimp on the mushrooms.  Lots of mushrooms with melty swiss cheese make this seem like this burger didn\'t come from a fast food restaurant.\n\nI never thought I\'d review a fast food restaurant, but seriously, service with a smile certainly does make an experience that much better!'

The expiration was at the end of the month, so I decided to give them a try.\n\nWow, the menu has gone upscale!  \n\nNow, we have good looking salads, wrap sandwiches, smoothie drinks and even Cinnabons.  Also, Burger King has this new TV ads featuring celebrities like David Beckham, Jay Leno, Salma Hayek and R&B singer Mary J. Blige.  Who sings about the ingredients of their snack wraps.  Sad.\n\nRead more: http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2012/04/03/burger-king-new-menu-looks-lot-like-mcdonald/#ixzz2E7SB7fqW\n\nThe one problem I see is their need to upgrade the taste of the older food items.  Their Classic Chicken Sandwich is still a piece of process meat, and the Whopper still has those little pieces of brown substance on one side of their burger.  \n\nMy last rant will be the taste of their onions, which still tastes as if they've left them out too long and have oxidized.

I called the location that has the GF menu and was told that they don't deliver to my area and that i'd have to call the North Side location. I'm not driving anywhere when I want pizza (it's a lazy night in/delivery kind of thing for me), so no gluten free for me. Sorry, stomach. \nBoth locations I called had terrible phone service. I was given a turnaround time of an hour, and much to my surprise, it arrived after 30 minutes. I ended up pretty dissatisfied though. \nI ordered a buffalo wing pizza which tasted like greasy bread. They just threw slices of breaded chicken on top and a few sprinkles of buffalo sauce under the cheese. They also failed to include the ranch dressing(s!) that the pizza was supposed to come with. Getting a whiff of ranch dressing was what made me crave pizza in the first place, ha. I ordered spicy citrus wings as well and they just tasted like... kind of spicy fried food. I'm bummed that the one time a year I eat pizza was such a letdown. I had high hopes for you Mandy's!"

So cheap, in fact, that my NYC friend couldn't believe his eyes and was double-fisting the whole night. Oh and offering to buy everyone drinks. WIN!\n\n2. The bartenders were friendly. Just as expected at a joint like this.\n\n3. Pool tables. They weren't free the night we went there, but sounds like they have free pool. Perfect for a cheap beer place.\n\n4. I don't like the smoke. I come from Ohio where it's been illegal to smoke in restaurants in Columbus since even before the laws were passed state-wide. There is an outside patio area for those who want to escape it. (it could easily be where the smokers are sent. hint hint Brookline Pub. :) ) \n\nBut I do think this bar is for those Yinzers who are there for a cheap beer, a game of pool and a good time, and unfortunately that involves smoking for the majority of them. All in all, this place is cool in my book."

I really have problems with businesses that do overcharges and they may not mean to do it purposely but if it's a constant issue, they should attend to it.

Otherwise, Restaurant Ethan will stir up a little sense of that nostalgia. \n\nDo not expect the staff to be friendly.

Broken furniture,stale cig\nodor even though supposed to be a n/s room. Location is not ideal.\nWhy stay here? One reason would be if you're going to party all night\nat Gilley's (which we did one night--enjoyed the bikini bull riding). \nAnother reason might be the huge pool,one of the largest I've ever\nseen. Besides that this place has nothing going for it. It was slated\nfor the wrecking ball years ago,why is it still standing? Strange."

S"Great hip hop bar with an extremely diverse crowd. There were everything from b boys to crackers in this place. The DJ was good and spun some interesting music (happy to hear de la soul and tribe) plus they had some good local talent hip hop. Its a cash only bar but the drinks are very cheap so its not a huge deal and they also have an ATM on site incase you run out of paper. I ventured into the other side of it, and was kind of frightened. The flourescent lights were on, there was no music, and it was a friggin hole. Only thing that wasn't cool about the hip hop side is the female bartender that works there. 3 girls I was there with got kicked out, because one of them had an expired ID, not fake, expired. I figured after the doorman scrutinized it and let her in, the bartender should be ok with it. She kicked all 3 of them out because she deemed they were together, and why she let me stay (wasn't drinking) is beyond me. \n\n4 stars -1 for the crazy bartender.\n\nAlso please ignore the couple of reviews that say they take CCs for tabs. As of May 26th, they stopped doing this... Don't trip they say."

S'This little mom and pop shop is the -premiere- date spot for Pittsburgh\'s growing ghetto community. Seriously though, what can be said about it? Well the location is great, which merits a star, if you are coming from or going to work and need a bite to eat, Pittsburgh\'s integral T and bus stations are just across the street. The food here isn\'t bad, and the restaurant has plenty of seating. Now for all the down sides.. The service here has never been great, I know it\'s McDonald\'s and it\'s in a busy city center, but you can always count on many lines and a lot of young employees joking around and goofing off here. Not only this, while you are waiting in said lines you can observe one of the following: someone trying to sell you stolen items; a homeless person accosting you for change; someone making a huge scene about how long their food is taking; teenagers just hanging around with no intention of even eating there. I mean this is one of the biggest companies in the world, you think they could at least afford one security guard! Similar scenes can be found at the restaurant\'s tables. I remember they had clearly posted detailed "no loitering signs" and literally there were homeless people napping at the tables under them. I used to dread coming in here. Dos estrellas.'

This place is owned and staffed by Nepalis. The owner both cooks and serves tables.  He is starting out and is putting out a great product, eventually other logistics will come together and I am sure will warrant a 5th star.  On a final note, make sure to get the milk tea (chai)!'

S"I had the Grunter with haggis and BBQ sauce. The pork was good and juicy. For the amount of meat for the price (\xc2\xa34.60), I was really happy. The meat was spilling from the bun and I made sure that I got every piece. The Oink isn't far from Arthur's seat so I grabbed my food when I was done the the climb. The lady who fixed my sandwich was really nice and patient with me while I decided what to order. I give 5 stars for the food, the price, and the friendly service."

S'EKK- Pass this place. \n\nI came into this place for the first time the other day and i was having high hopes for a new, awesome BBQ place close to home- this was not it. \n\nAt first glance, i was surprised to see the menue only has brisket on select days, no mac-n-cheese anywhere in sight and the prices are on the high side. \n\nI ordered a split meat platter- pulled chicken and pulled pork, corn bread and chips. My meat was such a small portion i was shocked- not to mention, my pulled chicken was not pulled, it was roughly chopped and tasted like cheap chinese food quality chicken. the cornbread was filled with jalojenos (which it did not say on the menue!) and the chips were a small bag of lunch sytle lays... The pork was good. I have to give credit when credit is due. \n\nOther than that, the server was slow and could care less that she took forever to refill drinks or that she took a long time to bring the food to our table, bringing the food in shifts with 5-10 minutes inbetween each persons food. \n\nThe cherry on the cake was when we were getting up to leave we say her offering samples to other patrons so they could try the different types of meat before they picked their meals- We would have LOVEDDD this option, bc had we tried a few things before we picked we probably would have been much happier.'

S"If I told you that McDonald's was a big factor in my weight loss of 20 lbs last year, you probably wouldn't believe me. Not unless you are one of my coworkers that see me at work every morning eating my Sausage McMuffin and have witnessed my slimmer physique. \n\nWell, it's true. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day and I found that skipping breakfast is not a good idea if you're trying to lose weight/get fit. Even though its not the most wholesome breakfast option, this is the quickest, cheapest way for me to get my morning meal.\n\nI am not writing anything about McDonald's that you might already know. I'm writing about this particular location. They are always super fast and efficient at the drive thru and every employee I've encountered over the past few years here are very friendly. I come here so often that I should just write a review and give kudos to the Mon-Fri morning crew for always getting my order out fast, quick and in a hurry before heading to work. Even when the drive thru lane is packed, they move it pretty quickly so I've never found myself sitting in my car for more than a few minutes.\n\nSo just in case you're wondering what I order every morning here it is: a sausage Egg White Delight and a medium sugar-free vanilla iced coffee. I automatically throw away one piece of the muffin to save on carbs. I know it sounds crazy but it works. For me, a carb conscious way of life works best. And this keeps me satiated enough until I have to nuke my Lean Cuisine around noon time."

S"Recently opened but as yet no website only twitter connections in Edinburgh Osteria del Tempo Perso, made lunchtime a no-faff deal. Great service, cosy surroundings, soft music, generous portions made our tapas styled meal all the more authentic. Very tasty and lovely presented food, interesting decor and great company all made for a unique lunch experience.\n\nOn arrival we were presented with a sample of house white wine and a small portion of Parmesan paste coupled with cheese crunch. A short time later after more catching up our group demolished a selection of veggie goats cheese bruschetta, mushrooms, ham and cheese platter. We had so much fun during lunch that an hour just flew by.\n\nTwinned with their Italian sister opened around a decade ago on the East Coast of Italy, the team are providing authentic simplistic in style but delicious food combos with the exception of a menu without pizza.\n\nGo and try for yourself as there are plenty tables for medium sized groups (table share), or romantic night out. I will have to come back again of course to try their macaroni Italian cheese pasta(made in-house) or some of their fish dishes. \n\nThe restaurant however was quiet when we were in, over the coming weeks I'm sure they will be peppered with pre-event bookings. But in all another decent Italian establishment to add to the culinary delights in our great city."

S"Here's a quick summary of the following novel: After my first lunch at The Improper Pig, here's my assessment. The pulled pork was delicious, the brisket the same though a little fatty, the mac and cheese was good, stay away from the sweet potato hash, and don't sit at the high tables. For an in-depth review, keep reading.\n\n\nThe Meal\n\nI ordered the Cotswold Platter, which consisted of 2 meats and 2 sides. I chose the brisket (which happened to be a slightly-shady extra $4, but I'll talk about that more later) and the pulled pork for my meats. The sides available were pretty varied, but my first choice was the mac and cheese (what I believe to be a staple in any good BBQ restaurant). For my second side, I decided to try the sweet potato hash, something I had never heard of and was interested in.\n\nWe'll start with the meats:\n   The pulled pork was fantastic. I have found that I'm hard to please with pulled pork, and this really hit the spot. It was very flavorful and moist enough that it didn't require any sauce to eat (I like the flavor of good barbecue without dousing it in sauce). Quite possibly the best pulled pork I've had in Charlotte.\n   The beef brisket, while a little on the fatty side, was also delicious. My favorite brisket in Charlotte still comes from Lancaster BBQ, but this was a close second. Improper's version is more pulled than sliced, which was a nice change, and was good enough to eat by itself. The extra fat took it down a slight notch, but the flavor was great.\n   With the meats, there are 5 or 6 different options for sauces. There's a Thai sauce, mustard BBQ, regular BBQ (tomato), Eastern NC BBQ (vinegar), and Frank's Redhot (I forget if there's another). The Thai was sweet with a little spice, very good. The mustard, which is my favorite usually, was very good here also.\n\nAs for the sides, the mac and cheese was good, nothing to write home about, but a strong staple and something I would order again. A little more saucy than some of the baked versions you'll find at other BBQ joints, but good none-the-less. The sweet potato hash, on the other hand, was a disappointment. My coworkers and I all agreed that we could definitely have done without it. What it seemed to be was a version of sweet potato casserole without brown sugar; a bland mash, maybe slightly bitter, with no real redeeming quality unfortunately.\n\nThe meal also came with what looked like a cornbread cookie and some red onions (maybe pickled onions? I didn't try them, I thought they were maybe just for show). The cornbread was alright, it didn't really add or detract from the meal. But then again, I'm used to a larger portion of moist cornbread, maybe with a little bit of honey, and I might just be spoiled.\n\nAll in all, the meal was good, with one regrettable side choice, but I would otherwise order it again. Good flavors and good portions.\n\n\nThe Rest\n\nThe inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated, the kitchen is open and visible, and it felt appropriate for a nicer BBQ restaurant. Not much to talk about, save for two things. One, they should put some sort of blinds or window covering on the larger windows as it is darker inside, and the outside light can be a little blinding. Two, they need to get nicer chairs for the high tables. The chairs they have seem to be there for looks more than functionality. The seats are small (I bet they're not far off from 9 in x 9 in) and are just plain uncomfortable. The booths seem like they sit nice, and the higher chairs at the bar seem nice. But the chairs at the high tables are a bit of an inconvenience.\n\nAs someone with just enough graphic design understanding to get himself in trouble, the menu made me cringe a bit. The layout doesn't flow well at all, and its confusing to read at first. Once you can figure out where everything is, it isn't hard, but I feel like it shouldn't be that hard to read a one page menu. Not a big deal, just a random quirk. Do pay attention though to the prices. The menu does a poor job of letting you know about extra costs. The brisket is apparently an extra $4, I'm assuming for all entrees, and it wasn't immediately apparent to me. Just something to keep an eye out for.\n\n\nIf you're still reading, you're a trooper :-)\n\nTo finish this book, after my lunch experience, I will most likely be heading back to The Improper Pig, but with a better understanding of the menu, the cost, and the seating. I can't stay away from a place with meat this good, I just hope I can find some sides that match in flavor!"

We didn't take it personally because he heckled everyone who stopped by.

Well the quality of the food is ok. It used to be better. The sushi was fresh. Didn't have Mongolian off the grill this time but previous visits it was good. I guess it's called lucky star out front but Yelp pulls up China star buffet.\nThe ice cream machine was out of order. The fried rice and chow mein was on Saran wrap in the hot tray. The chicken skewers were decent. Same with the broccoli beef and orange and sesame chicken. Nothing stood out and was memorable. The donuts had been out forever and were hard as a rock.

He tried to figure out which was which for a minute until we told him to just set them down and we'd figure it out. We also saw him stroll the length of the dining room with tray of food looking for its expectant diners. \nThe fries on our sandwiches ranged in color from dark brown to black and in texture from crunchy to rock hard. And they were cold. We sent them back and they were replaced by acceptable ones. \nIt's really sad that the Primanti Brothers once proud name is attached to a place that stinks of corporate greed and apathy."

So I ordered everything on the menu.... all THREE things!... Carnitas, shredded beef, and chicken. I also ordered some salsa and tortillas.  When I got home and opened the boxes I was disappointed to find that they were boxes of meat and nothing else.  I mean, No sides of any kind.  No rice.  No beans.  No veggies.  It's a good thing that I had ordered the tortillas or I wouldn't have even had anything to put the meat in. \n\nThis wouldn't have been a big deal if I hadn't woken up a handful of hours, violently ill from what I had eaten.

S"I go to this part of town sometimes to visit.  We've gone several times to Chiltepin, as there's this dish called blondie or 'guera', I believe, that my sister's rave about (the name may not be advertised that way).  I tried it and it was damn tasty - loaded with lots of veggies (pico-style) and other mexican-style ingredients (meats, beans, etc).  They are good with portion sizes as I bought a burrito here that was ginormous... and the beans were yummy.\n\nThe owners are a Latin (don't know their exact background) husband and wife couple and I'm pretty sure they do all the work themselves (ie. prep, cook, serve, clean, etc) as I've never seen anyone else there.  They are very friendly and I think that friendliness/neighborliness and their food quality is the main reason my family and I still go here.  They seem to be improving from the first few months when we had tried them and their service was sssslloooow.. they are much quicker now (experience, I think) and their quality is still good.  I think they now accept card, but I usually pay cash to small businesses...\n\nI would suggest they keep their menu limited and not so vast.. especially for a new start-up, you want to make sure you can deliver what you say in a timely manner and not waste product.. if you have a surprlus of product because your menu is vast, you are wasting and not meeting your cycle time for customer service... \n\nOut of all the shady taco/burrito/tostada places on Central in SoPho, I choose this one to go to because of the owners and operators."

Jade was more than happy to seat us and we proceeded to order 4 different courses that we shared.  Each one was very tasty and I probably have to say that the black been and beef noodles were the best by far that I have tried in a long time.  The decor is calming with dark red walls and the wait staff was good.  While we were dining there was another customer who walked in, a bit drunk, and proceeded to yell at the waiter and then manager about wanting something unique from the kitchen, that was not on their menu.  Even though she made quite the scene, the staff handled the situation well.  All in all I was impressed and would definitely return.'

S"Normally, I think I'd give Jaded (formerly Burger Betty's) a three.  But considering that it's two previous incarnations were struggling to be average, I'll make an exception and laude the effort to really improve the quality of the menu.\n\nAn assortment of appetizers, salads, burgers, hot sandwiches, and acutal entrees (like you can order a steak!).  \n\nI had the philly steak sandwhich, which was really good.  My friend had the cranberry-pesto pasta and enjoyed it as well.\n\nWhile the effort to go upscale with what is clearly a casual dining kind of place has not really evolved yet in the decor (though anything is better than faux-Aussie), they are really doing good things with the food.\n\nI'm actually motivated to make a return trip and not just by lack of other options."

My sons French toast came out without bananas. Other sons spaghetti came out without meatballs, wife\'s fries were severely undercooked. Asked for these things to be fixed and by the time they were our food was gone. I let our server Tyler know we were unhappy and the response was "sorry, here\'s your bill." Walked up to pay, told him I was unhappy again and offered a lame 15% off. Bad service, poor quality food and an unhappy ex-customer.'

S'This a "new" Chinese Restaurant that we decided to go to, since my aunt knows the Owner. We came here on Saturday with about 8 of us. There was no one else in the restaurant at 7pm. Not a good sign? or maybe it is....My uncle and aunt ordered for the table, they just ordered from the full course Chinese menu where we get soup, entree\'s, veggies, etc. \n\nThe soup was ok, really salty and I don\'t like the bitter after taste that it left in my mouth. The salt and Pepper porkchops came out next and I love porkchops, but these porkchops had a sour taste. Maybe I just got a bad piece but when my cousin had agreed with me I felt sick. The whole reason why we came here was for the Soy Sauce Chicken. My grandma loves this chicken and rightfully so. It\'s pretty good chicken. I ended up eating a lot of chicken, since the beef stew bowl had overly tough meat to eat and everything else was mediocre. I guess I just have high expectations! \n\nOverall, its a clean place, service was good and the soy sauce chicken is delicious!!!!!!!'

They had obviously never changed out the soy in their bottles. It goes bad in a day w/o refridgeration.  For me this is a sign of poor food handling. \n\nThe fish had a very fishy flavor and a terrible texture.

I don\'t really care because either way you\'re getting cheap sushi.  To say that the sushi is nontraditional is an understatement!   If the Philadelphia rolls are listed under the ""Traditional Rolls" then you know the signature rolls will be insane.   \n\nAnd they were.  In addition to the Philly roll, we had the Me-So-Horny roll, a Dirty Sanchez and the Killer Bee.   The Killer Bee roll was phenomenal.   All the rolls we ordered were 50% off.  We also had a rock shrimp tempura appetizer that was really good and was the most expensive thing we ordered at $14!   My favorite part was the one dessert they have....tempura apples in caramel with cream and cinnamon.  Seriously they are SO good.   My husband wants to break out our deep fryer to try to make them ourselves.  They have a long martini menu too but I like to have champagne with sushi and non of the martinis had "bubbles".   Although it was very busy they didn\'t mind us lingering for a few drinks after our meal.'

S'First time here today, on a lunch date with the wife. She got the Baked Bacon & Turkey, and I got the French Dip.\nPROS:\n- Both sandwiches were tasty. Not "out of this world," but a good lunch. The fries were good as well.\n- The front staff are very friendly and welcoming.\nCONS:\n- The ambiance is just so-so. It lacked a certain homey warmth we like to see in a local cafe.\n- The chef (who I think is the owner as well) does not come across as super friendly. We caught eyes a couple times while he was in the kitchen (it\'s a small place), but not once did he crack a smile. Perhaps he was just "in the zone" on his work.\n- We were in the mood for a couple IPAs, so we ordered the only ones on the beer menu, which was very slim pickings in the first place. Unfortunately, when they arrived (bottles already opened), they were "pale ales" and not true IPAs (any self-respecting IPA drinker knows a pale ale tastes VERY different than an IPA). We brought this to the manager\'s (at least we think she was the manager) attention, and while she DID apologize and state that they would be correcting the menu for the future, she did NOT offer to comp our beers. Granted, we drank them (they were already open, so to pour them out would be true "alcohol abuse"!), but I would expect at least a 50% discount given the inaccuracy of their menu. As it was, we paid $8 for a couple pale ales we could\'ve purchased across the street for a couple bucks.\n\nIn the end, while we enjoyed a nice lunch together, my wife and I probably will not be frequenting this local cafe even though it is only a mile from our house. We hope the business does well though. It\'s been sad to see so many businesses come and go in that location, so it\'d be nice to see one stick around longer and thrive.'

S'i ended up here a couple of days ago after the CES Show. We (me and my super-foodie-Asian-girlfriend) intended to go to Lotus of Siam, which is located in the same strip mall. It was 5:05, and Lotus didn\'t open till 5:30 so we decided on Korean BBQ. \n\nFirst of all, it is called "Elephant BBQ" and not "Elephant Snack". The snack part only comes up on your receipt...\n\nWe couldn\'t flag down the waitress to save our lives, and there was only 3 other tables in the whole restaurant. When I finally got her attention, she was intercepted by the table next to us, so it took her even longer to make it over to us.\n\nAt 5:27 after sitting there with nothing in front of us for nearly half an hour and starving to death, we debated getting up and leaving and heading back to Lotus of Siam. She finally brought over our waters, and my friend requested the little starters, and they were actually very fresh and good. (We had six small dishes of a seaweed salad, bean sprouts, kim-chi, potato pancake, fish cake). We ordered the Cha Dol Baeki (thin sliced beef with no marinade) and a soup. Both were really, really good. My friend asked for a lot of other little things (lettuce to wrap the meat for one) and they didn\'t have any of it.\n\nAs a whole: the service sucked; the food is a solid 3.5, decor is nothing to look at. \n\nBring on the LA Korean BBQ.'

S"There are a lot of places around George Sq. for students to pick up sandwiches and paninis for lunch. These places seem to really have exploded in recent years (that is in numbers, they haven't all combusted), taking advantage of less people making their own lunch (which will presumably change in these troubled times). Unfortunately that means that a lot of them turn out to be much of the same.\n\nA friend recommended this place to me after I complained about the above. I have to say I was reasonably satisfied with my visit. Greens Deli does do much of the same thing, but the quality is above standard. There selection of tortillas and paninis are a bit more exciting that the usual norm. \n\nThe place itself seems clean and hygienic and the staff friendly enough. I wasn't too pleased about the price, but I expected this. All of these snack deli joints seem to end up costing over a fiver for lunch, which considering what else you get for that or just a little more at a restaurant, leaves me wishing I had made my own sandwiches."

It's never spectacular, and I wouldn't come here for a dinner or proper meal but for a warm, filling lunch I have always been happy.

The hot and sour soup was so-so, but I had to add their "sweet sauce" to make it interesting. Although the obligatory chili icon indicate this was a spicy dish, the General Tso\'s chicken had zero heat and very little flavor. If I had to guess, I\'d say it was just colored corn syrup for sauce. The crab puffs we\'re big and packed... with dried, crumbled blah inside. I didn\'t bother eating the second one. \n\nMy friend who ordered the same dish agreed that everything was "eh". The other two weren\'t impressed with their chow-mein or the Shanghai Club special.\n\nThe decor is nice: dark, comfortable atmosphere with tasteful water fountains and traditional Chinese instruments on display.

This is near my work, so I decided to try it out since I\'ve heard good things about its California locations...\n\nWell, I am usually not a big meat eater...but this place was excellent!!! Just like the name implies...you get pastrami here in addition to other succulent sandwiches.\n\nThe portions are HUGE!!! I got a "small" which felt like an XL pastrami. I am originally from the East coast, so let me tell you when I say that it was the best pastrami that I\'ve ever had, it means a lot. The meat was tender, but not too much so, spicy but not overkill. Rye bread is delish and made fresh--you can really taste the freshness in this place from bread to meat--everything is super fresh and top notch.\n\nThe prices are a bit high for a sandwich place, but considering sandwich sizes and quality, it is worth it.\n\nI also tried their liver sandwich, which was excellent as well.\n\nWith each sandwich combo, you either get a side of potato salad (pretty good, but not ground breaking in taste), cole slaw, chips or fries. Fries are excellent dinner-style and taste great!!!\n\nOverall, I am glad that this place opened. It is definitely one of the best lunch stops out there.

How many backstreet takeaway noodle bars have you ever stumbled across with Ipads to use whilst you wait for your food?\n\nThe food itself was good, although nowhere near as good as the Red Box Noodle Bar just around the corner. In fact, on the basis of the food alone I\'d give this place 3 stars, and it\'s also pricier than Red Box.\n\nWhat this place has over all the other noodle places I\'ve ever bought from is the banter, namely in the form of the rules surroundig the use of the Ipads. You\'re allowed to use them for 20 minutes free of charge, but not a minute longer. And even then that\'s only if you know how to use one... it\'s clearly stated that you\'re not allowed to ask the staff any questions because "they are very busy cooking your food". If recent stories surrounding Ipads are to be believed, that\'s the vast majority of the population ruled out then...!\n\nQuirks aside, this is an ok little place to grab lunch on the go.

S"As the name says, they make the pizza then you take it home and bake it.  Interesting concept.\n\nI think it's a little pricey, but they put on a LOT of toppings.  Their largest size barely fits in our oven (which is a standard wall oven).  But it fits.  They put it on a baking tray for you, but after about 8-10 minutes you want to take it off the tray so the bottom of the crust will firm-up a bit.  You can leave it on the tray, but it will come out limp.  Cooked, but limp.  Transferring to the oven rack resolves that problem.  It is easy to tear the crust doing this, so be careful (or put the tray on a rack below the pizza to catch anything that may drip).  We ripped one because we tried to move it too soon.\n\nThe pizza itself is very tasty.  Toppings seem fresh, and the sauce is good.  And I prefer eating at home anyway!\n\nThere are coupons available pretty regularly (mail flyers and such), which make it a bit less pricey."

He is delightful and clearly a BBQ master, his eyes lit up telling us about his various BBQ equipment and cutting techniques. \n\nIf size or price are a concern consider taking someone along and sharing a meal! It's definitely a must try for BBQ lovers!"

S"I had no idea this restaurant was here until recently, when I was invited here for a birthday meal. In fact, I've realised that a lot of my reviews start this way, with me not realising somewhere exists, despite having spent a long time living here. Anyway, I'm now aware of this restaurant's existence, and now that I know it's here, I'll certainly be coming back for some more of their tasty, served up wares.\n\nThe restaurant makes up part of the eclectic range of delights to be found on St Stephen St, at both basement and street level. Stockbridge Restaurant is tucked away down a set of stairs, and is fairly miniature in size, much like a lot of restaurants on the street, but I think that gives them a lot of character and individuality, although it does mean booking ahead, especially at the weekends.\n\nThe look here is plush, classy, and well furnished. If you want somewhere impressive, but not too overdone by everyone in Edinburgh for some romance time, or somewhere nice to take the family, this restaurant is a great option. The food runs along traditional lines, with a stylised edge and presentation, and I recall going for the pigeon to start, followed by a sturdy meat option. The tables are quite close together, but it's all good if you have a decent level of concentration. Sadly, I'm really nosey, so couldn't help but look round the restaurant a couple of times to see how a few couples' dates were going."

S"Yesterday night was my first time here. I went with my boyfriend. \n\nI liked the spot, and the restaurant is nice. However, if you are looking for a romantic or intimate ambiance this is not the place for you. The restaurant is quite small and gets noisy as it gets full (and it will get full). However, everything is spotless clean. \n\nWe started with the guacamole for two. It was very tasty and the nachos were very pretty in red, green and yellow. The guacamole itself could have used more spices, but was perfectly fresh and appealing. We also ordered a Margarita and a daiquiri. They were both excellent. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the red enchiladas, and I, the enchiladas Del patron. His three chicken enchiladas were served with rice and beans (pureed frijoles) with tomato sauce and cheese. It was very good and perfect if you need comfort food. My three duck enchiladas were served only with rice (I hadn't realized that when I ordered, so was quite disappointed not to see frijoles in my plate) and the best mole sauce I have ever tasted. The flavor is rich, spicy (not to much) and sweet at the same time. Truly delicious!  \n\nWe didn't take dessert because we were quite full after our enchiladas. We paid around 40$ each, which is a bit pricey. \n\nI have to say I was a bit disappointed in the service. First, the waiters seemed to think that my boyfriend was not worth the attention and only spoke to me. We also waited a bit long for our meal to arrive. \n\nOverall, I might come back and recommend it to friends."

So I find myself driving down Indian School rd and see the Chinese buffet sign. I thought great because I was not sure what I wanted and with a buffet there are so many choices right? WRONG! \n\nThe choices were not many and the food was not good. The rice tasted like dirt. I had some mushrooms that were good. Everything was labeled wrong. They had fried chicken wings the size of my pinky. If these came off a chicken it must have been a chick. The egg foo young looked like scrambled eggs with mushrooms. This place is gross. We took one bite of everything on our plates and when nothing tasted good we left! \n\nWe told them your buffet is garbage and we left. BTW we did not pay for it either.'

Service was ok, and we moved through the line pretty quickly, but man... Is it me or is KFC going down the wayside for taste?? The taco bell was still the same horrible for me style that I love, and I'd come back for it, but the last couple times of KFC have been downright disappointing. The biscuit was hard and tasted funky, and the chicken itself was very gristly and just not that familiar flavor that kept me coming back. The prices seemed to be a bit higher too...

S"*sigh*\n\nInitally, I gave this place a 4 star review this morning, but I decided that I needed to be honest, and share an experience here that I had that initally I had wanted to leave out, but now i feel that I can't.  I wanted to ignore what *really* happened, as it's been bothering me more and more and more as the day has gone on.\n\nWhen I came here, the place was empty.  It was just 2 workers, and not a soul in sight.  Despite the food being good, the service here left me feeling angry and upset.  Here's why:\n\nThe guy that seated me, (and obiously worked here as some form of staff member) made it his point to flirt with me non stop, so much so that it actually RUINED my experience here, and I don't know that I will be back.  He was so aggressive in his tactics, that he actually had the balls to pull up a chair TO MY table while I was trying to eat and enjoy my dinner.  Mind you, I was alone, and trying to enjoy a good book and some quiet time...and this douche ruined it.\n\nHe sat with me through the majority of my dinner, asking me personal questions about if I was single, what kind of guys Iike, and other personal questions that I found grossly innapropriate.  I was so annoyed, that I actually had my dinner boxed up and left half way through, lying and saying that I had somewhere to be....just to get out of here.\n\nI found it rude, annoying, and downright disrespectful that a staff member at this establishment made it his personal playground, and taking it upon himself to not only hit on me, but spend most of the time sitting AT MY TABLE talking to me discussing things that I found grossly inapporpriate.\n\nDue to this experience, I will NOT be back to this location.

S"I tried this place based upon the recommendation of a friend. There is no shortage of pizza places in this general area so one has to actually do something different to stand out. I would say Herk's accomplishes this admirably. \n\nFirst, they have a nice selection of specialty pizzas I am working my way through. The Longhorn, which is my friend's favorite is quite good and the garlic parm crust is delicious. Other reviewers have mentioned the Dirty Mac and I, having tried it, also recommend you try this abomination. It truly does taste and smell like a Big Mac. My only real complaint about it is that I think it needs a lot more ground beef on it but , as it stands, it raises the interesting realization that, when you eat a Big Mac, you aren't really tasting the meat, but rather everything else such as bun, thousand island, pickles, american cheese, etc. Speaking of crust, this is another thing that sets them apart. The crust has a really nice chew to it and all their pizzas seem to come with some sort of seasoning (the Dirty Mac comes with a sesame seed crust). \n\nThe chicken wings are also quite good and come in a larger variety of flavors than just buffalo and bbq (although the buffalo is good, even if hot buffalo isn't even remotely hot, as was my experience). \n\nAll in all, give it a shot. I have a feeling this is the type of place that you will either really like or really hate. I fall solidly in the former category."

S"Locations like this are the reason chain restaurants have such a dubious reputation. I've been several times in the last few years and there is always a problem with my order or someone else's. The service is always slow, whether the location is busy or not - how long can it take to make a pizza? Somehow it takes these people half an hour. At least.\n\nThe first sign that this place is unreliable is the fact that they quote lengthy delivery times whether it's a busy day or not. 75 minutes? To bake two pizzas and some wings and bring them the mile or so to my home? Forget it. It's easier to place the order and go pick it up. Or it should be. It would be if they didn't lose orders routinely. I'm not the only customer who's had this happen to them, I've seen other people wait an extra 25 minutes when they tried to pick up their missing order.\n\nThe pizzas have been lacking in toppings. They sure do know how to skimp on the meats. I hate to say good things about the wings and breadsticks, but I'll let them be the bright spot in my review.\n\nOh - they will offer you some coupons for your next order if you have issues during your pickup. But why would you want to come back?\n\nIf you absolutely must have Pizza Hut, find another location. Best choice is to go someplace else, period."

S'Over the weekend I took my bike out and road the canals towards Camelback Road.  I stopped at Taco Del Mar on Camelback and 40th Street.   I sometimes stop in the middle of my ride to have lunch at this location.  I am always satisfied with the tacos.  I got three tacos - chicken and shredded beef.  The food is light and tasty, yet simple without all of the fillers (e.g. cheddar cheese and sour cream).  I always enjoy stopping here when I have the chance. \n\nThe atmosphere is simple with a surfer theme and a television in front.  The portions are modest - not too heavy, not too light.\n\nThe salsa selection is very good with green and red salsa in various strengths.  Reasonably priced at about $5.00 to $8.00 per person.\n\nA great stop for a simple and fulfilling lunch.'

The well done steak ordered by one of our party was still noticeably bloody and whilst the wait for that to arrive on the table will have contributed to the other meals' cooling I maintain that my risotto was much less hot than it should have been.\n\n\n No complaints about the service (indeed my companions were rather demanding at times but this was handled admirably) but I think I'll be sticking to Victoria Street when it comes to suggesting one of the four establishments to patronise."

If you look at it that way, this place is just fine... great if you want a bar, not so great if you want a restaurant.  Although I've only been for lunch, I'm sure this is a fun place for happy hour or hanging out after work/on the weekends.  Like previous reviews have said, it's a dive and frequented by a lot of locals.  It's clean and there are a number of TV's.  It's just not a lunch spot.  It's got that dark bar atmosphere inside, and their sandwiches are nothing to write home about.  To be fair, I have not tried their pizza, which is their showcased menu item.  And their onion rings are fantastic.  If you come for a beer and stick to bar food I think you'll enjoy yourself.  The waitress/bartender who helped me both times I went (not sure if it was the same lady both times) was efficient and pleasant.  I won't be back for lunch, but maybe I'll try out the happy hour some day."

S"The Wee Windaes is great if you're looking for an alternative to the uber cool food establishments in Edinburgh.\n\nBy that I don't mean that it is the dork of Edinburgh's restaurants or anything - far from it. It's got a great, solid menu that will rival many of Edinburgh's finest dining places, and is a firm favourite with the locals. \n\nIt's got a really impressive seafood menu which includes the classic cullen skink but I am a sucker for Bangers and Mash, so I opted for that last time I was here. It was absolutely delicious and done to perfection. It's simple but one of their strongest and most popular options.\n\nThe decor is staid and arguably a little dated but I quite like its charm. The way it looks reminds me of hotel dining rooms I used to visit in British seaside resorts when I was a kid. It looks like it's not changed in years but there's something comforting about that.\n\nMy only complaint would be a small one - its opening hours. They serve food from 6-10 but sometimes I'm really craving a bangers and mash if I'm through for a gig and have done a shift of mad dancing. But that's a selfish demand and it's nice to pop in for a quiet, calming meal at dinnertime.\n\nGood old fashioned grub with a couple of fancy options. I like it."

The delivery was awesome as they stated online that my expected time was 29 minutes and they arrived in 27 minutes.

And while Brooklyn's taste in furnishings is often impeccable, and the selection rotates rapidly, it's their intriguing and often tantalizing selection of breakfasts, lunches, and snacks that have made them a local hangout--all the more so since they added a lovely and secluded terrasse out back.  Don't judge the boutique/caf\xc3\xa9 by its name (I can hear you sneering through my screen, you self-proclaimed hipster-hunter you)--the name is actually a reference to the owner's longstanding sobriquet.

That said, i hate this place....Why is it called fast food when everytime there is a 10 min wait and the staff are very blah and mean!!  I would love it if they shut this location down so i didnt have to get mad at myself for continuing to fall into the trap.'

S"Some of the best sushi I have every found anywhere, but definitely Montreal.\n\nThe sushi is inventive with a great variety of interesting rolls.  One of the best parts of the restaurant experience is the plate presentation.  The restaurant uses a lot of cut flowers, herbs and fruit/vegetables to make each entree special.  I'm always interested in seeing the presentation when I go.  \n\nThe restaurant is very accessible to Old Montreal and is on Place d'Armes and on the same block as Notre Dame Cathedral so it's hard to miss.  \n\nOne of the coolest things is the that most of the tables are aquariums with tropical salt water fish in them.... so you are eating directly on a piece of glass on top of the aquarium.  \n\nIf you're touring Old Montreal and have a sushi craving, you won't be disappointed in this place!"

If you're in the back of the line, you'll be out the door in 7 min. The food has always been fresh, and they ensure you get exactly what and how much you want. They even allow people to turn a foot long into 2 separate sandwiches (same base with different toppings) so cheap asses can save $1.50! You can text in orders which makes it more convenient to pick up mutiple sandwiches. Great job every time! If youre in a rush and want to get your subway on, go there!"

We chatted to the owner/chef who has his takeaway cartons arriving shortly...no doubt these guys will be seeing our custom from all angles! I genuinely didn't have one complaint.

The marinara sauce is delicious, not acidic.  The melted cheese is a nice touch and just the right amount.  The eggplant is sooo good!  I highly recommend ordering the eggplant parmesan if you\'re a fan of eggplant.  ;)  My coworkers and I are hooked on this place and order take-out from Meatballz often.  The prices are AWESOME too!

There were a few other people around, but no hostess to seat us, so we weren't sure if we could just choose our own seats or not. We decided to sit down at a table in the terrasse since there were other people there ordering. The terrasse is beautiful, by the way. Just sunny enough and very nicely decorated. The place has character. Service was slow. It took a while for the waitress to notice us and bring us water and menus, even though she knew we were there.\n\nThat said, the entire menu looks fresh, tasty, and healthy, and the prosciutto pizza was incredible. The crust wasn't really anything like a real Italian pizza, but delicious nonetheless. If you have the time to spare, it's definitely worth a try,"

The in-laws were in town and kindly watched our daughter so we could have a date night. We decided on dinner and a movie. I suggested adorable little place since it was just on the other side of the mall from the movie theater. We parked and since we didn't know what to expect of the menu, we were reading the posted menu on the window when the FOH & Catering Manager, Scott, came out to greet us and invite us in. There was live music and a very warm ambiance to the restaurant. It was very cozy and friendly, however, we were by a good twenty years the youngest couple in there. There was live music, a man singing easy listening hits from Lionel Ritchie to Barry White to the Isley Brothers. We were seated immediately and had a very attentive but not annoyingly so waitress. We ordered the panko breaded asparagus appetizer which was served with a balsamic vinegar reduction, they were simply amazing. Our salads came out and they were your standard mixed greens and assortment of veggies. I ordered the Goat Cheese Stuffed Shrimp which was served around of bed of linguine and it was FAB-U-LOUS. I enjoyed every moment of it. Jason ordered the Catfish Gumbo. He loved the gumbo itself but he said the catfish was slightly lacking on it's own but when paired together it was perfect. The service here was fantastic. We felt like it was a bargain for how satisfied we were with our experience. We will definitely be going back AND now I know a great little hide away where I can sneak off to go have a quiet lunch away from work!"

You are closing the kitchen at 6:15pm on a Saturday night? Well, they didn\'t have the ingredients to make the Goulash. 10 people came in after us and ordered meals.

I was first attracted to the bar by the modern d\xc3\xa9cor and the cool name. The bar does breakfasts and lunches- in the morning you can have porridge and rolls, although I have not tried this yet. \nIn the afternoon, you can get a good selection of sandwiches, soups and paninis and there is also a good range of salads, where you can get a selection of salad to choose from to put in a salad box. \nThere is a few seats in there although not many, and the place can get pretty busy at lunch times as the office workers fill the place, but the staff were very good at providing quick and polite service.'

The pizza is a thin crust, not cripsy, but the crust was good.  Not tough like cardboard.  The wings were meaty, and the sauce tasted good.  I like my wings a little crispy though, being from western NY.  These wings may have been oven baked.  Although healthier, the skin was too slippery/slimy, and I like a fried wing or if oven baked, a dry rub is needed and they should be grilled to offer them some crisp.  I am a snob when it comes to pizza and wings, so I am very picky.  That is the only reason this gets a 3 star.'

What you'll come to quickly realize is they only have a few items that are repeated multiple times on the different dishes. For example - olives and macrona almonds. These two will end up repeatedly on every dish. They were also out of a few items which were frustrating. \n\nDiners beware - if you're getting one dish you may enjoy (although there is little substance). If you want wine you'll also get a selection. Otherwise be prepared to get a sandwich next door (or keep walking to the next dining and drinking area in the grill by gate 11)."

I asked for a Medium Rare Burger Bacon Blue Burger and it was medium well and lacking of flavor. There are bottles of regular and spicy BBQ sauce on the table and I'm wondering if someone put the regular BBQ sauce in the Spicy bottle as neither one had any heat at all, which is to bad as I was hoping that they would make the fries better. My partner got a pulled pork sandwich and he said that it was good, though his cornbread was like cake. Also, the servers (it took two and we were the only ones in the place) ideally should not make you feel uncomfortable and have to be asked for silver wear or plates."

Service was fantastic the atmosphere was comfortable while at the same time sophisticated and the food was great. The dinner salad that came with the meal was hands down the best I've ever had, complimentary bread was great and was always refilled by a very friendly staff. Our only complaint (if you want to call it a complaint) was the gnocchi came a little over cooked, still tasted amazing and would recommend this dish to anyone but the dish was just on that borderline of being sent back because of its consistency. Chicken Parm dish was exceptional and not overly heavy. Overall great experience and we will definitely be back."

It tasted like nothing...well rice..fried in oil i guess.  The beef was totally horrific. It was slimy and sort of rubbery.  The chicken was almost edible, and honestly the best part was the carrots and water chestnuts. The 6 dollars, for 6 beef on a sticks was totally blubbery, wet and not at all edible. They forgot 1 of 2 fried rice containers, which is fine really, because my two year old was the only one who would touch the fried rice anyway, then it was tossed. 30 dollars for 2 gross entrees and fried rice that is tasteless, plus 6 nasty wet beef hunks on a stick.

The salad was 'not bad' for a bar; but the 'gyro' sandwich - ugh!  they simply place the lettuce on top of the pita bread, then a few very thin and not particularly tasty pieces of meat, then smother the whole thing with masses of white sauce, which didn't taste too much like 'tahina' to me.

The algio was bland (I did not taste that kick you get from the red peppers... in fact there were no specks of it in my dish), and the noodles were not cooked all the way. The plate was drenched in watery oil too, which made my lips itch. The alfredo had a large cream sauce to noodle ratio but lacked flavor.\n\nService wasn't bad but it almost seemed to cover the minimum. They came by twice to refill water before the main course. We didnt get another water refill until the check came. They don't really give you a choice of how much pepper or cheese you want on your plate. They just dump the cheese on or turn the pepper grinder once and call it good. \n\nMaybe it was an off day.  Who knows? If not then avoid these two dishes. \n\nOh and $7 for side salad, you may as well get the full salad."

S"19 janvier 2013\nUn beau samedi frisquet et humide, quel meilleur moment pour se \xc3\xa9chauffer avec une grande marmitte de fondue mongolienne. Un classique de la cuisine asiatique, avec un choix de l\xc3\xa9gumes, de viandes et d'ar\xc3\xb4mates. L'endroit est tr\xc3\xa8s bien \xc3\xa9clair\xc3\xa9, parfaitement adapt\xc3\xa9 aux groupes comme aux couples discrets. On vous demande tout d'abord quel choix de bouillon vous d\xc3\xa9sirez. Je choisi un bouillon nourrissant aux herbes. Puis, les viandes. Je choisis, porc, boeuf et poulet. On vous apporte la marmitte (en petit format ou en grand format, selon votre ap\xc3\xa9tit) qu'on d\xc3\xa9pose sur une plaque chauffante centrale, encastr\xc3\xa9e dans la table. Vous faites vous-m\xc3\xaame votre propre cuisine en d\xc3\xa9posant dans le bouillon ce qu'il vous pla\xc3\xaet. Laissez d\xc3\xa9geler les viandes lentement en laissant l'assiette pr\xc3\xa8s de la plaque chauffante, ce sera ainsi plus facile. Vous n'avez que pour seul outil, des baguettes. Si vous manipulez les viandes crues, vous pouvez ensuite st\xc3\xa9riliser rapidement les baguette dans le bouillon. Vous contr\xc3\xb4lez la temp\xc3\xa9rature de chauffe du bouillon, au go\xc3\xbbt. Pour finir, vous pouvez demander de filtrer la fondue et terminer le tout dans un grand bol comme une soupe. Vous y ajoutez ensuite ce que vous voulez car vous avez acc\xc3\xa8s \xc3\xa0 un grand buffet de condiments et divers produits de la mer, crevettes enti\xc3\xa8res, boules de poisson. Afin de bien contr\xc3\xb4ler la temp\xc3\xa9rature du bouillon, vous pouvez ajouter des l\xc3\xa9gumes croustillants comme le Bok Choy. Malheureusement, vous n'avez pas de take out pour vos restants. J'aurais aimer rapporter ma soupe avec moi et l'aggr\xc3\xa9menter chez moi.\n\nJanuary 19th 2013\nA nice and wet saturday, what better time to get your heater back on with a mongolian hot pot. An asian classic with vegetables, meats and aromatic herbs. The place is well lighted, perfectly adapted to groups or cosy couples. You chose your hot pot stock. I picked a nice nutricious herbs stock. Then the meat cuts, beef, pork, chicken. The hot pot is brought to you and put on a heating plate installed inside the table center. You have two sizes of hot pot. It's better if you leave the frozen meat plate near the hot plate so it can thaw easily. Your only tools are chopsticks. You can sterilise them in the hot stock once you've touched raw meat, if you want. At last, you can ask to filter down the stock and finish it as a soup. If you want to control the temperature of you hot pot, you can use raw Bok Choy. You have access to a variety of condiments, sea food and sauces. Unfortunately, you cannot bring home your leftovers. I would've liked it."

S"Mercury was a summer staple for me years ago, mostly because the bartender never once charged me for a drink. We also worked out a deal on their near-empty 80s nights with DJ McFly: you give us $2 PBR tallboys and rails, we'll pack your bar weekly. It worked out for the best - the Merc actually made money and we had a weekly dance party that we didn't have to clean up after. \n\nIn the seven or so years that have passed, Mercury has gone downhill (or, realistically, stopped offering the perks on the side that made it worthwhile). On a recent visit, the only people at the bar on a Friday night were our friends - all there to hear our friend DJ. I do love they have an ample back patio (something I don't remember from years back), and the drinks are apparently still cheap (I don't know for sure, I only had one and a friend purchased it), so it's not a total loss, and if they keep letting our friend DJ I'll probably be back. \n\nIf I do go back, though, I'll have to remember to stash a roll of toilet paper in my purse, as they were completely out of paper products. No TP, no towels, no napkins. How you don't keep a stockpile in back, I don't know. Even if your regular delivery falls through, you'd think for a Friday someone would have run up the block to Walgreens to buy a few rolls or at the very least asked a neighboring restaurant to help out. \n\nAlso, friends, keep an eye out when coming in from the patio - the back step tilts downward and slippery shoes or a drunk gait might send you tumbling."

S"Spurred on by my friend Ryan C.'s  review, I decided to give this buffet a try today. I didn't expect much, especially since I came in at 2 PM. My first glance of the inside of the place made me immediately wonder whether I should immediately leave and eat somewhere else - after all, there's a Los Reyes de la Torta down the street - or take a chance and stay; I decided to do the latter. As you can see from the pics I posted, it's definitely not a fancy place. In fact, it's quite the opposite of a glitzy and spacious super buffet: small, cramped dining area, limited menu with some dishes that did not look very appealing, and only one soup (egg drop, natch). But whereas some super buffets have a large array of attractive-looking but often bland menu items, the food items in this place, in spite of their somewhat unappealing appearance, are fresh and good-tasting! What a surprise! My friend Ryan was right. In all, I had a really satisfying meal here and learned that sometimes you really can't judge a place (or its food) by appearances alone."

Sometimes things work smoothly, as they should, and other times, not so much. I\'ve seen employees come in from a smoke break and start touching food without washing their hands; I\'ve had delivery show up on time but still somehow warm or cold-ish; and I will bet money that if you call them, regardless of what time of day it is, you will get put on hold. \n\nHowever, my most recent call to them will also be my last. Instead of being greeted by a polite, knowledgeable employee, I was accosted by an angry Latino man whose tone implied I was wasting his time...by calling his job... where he works... to give them money... \n\nAside from his apparent agitation at the mere thought of customer service, he also didn\'t know the standard ordering procedure that every other Domino\'s employee throughout my entire life has parroted precisely. Normally, he\'d ask a series of questions that would allow me to quickly and easily place my order, but instead he just said, "You want a pizza, huh? What kind? Like toppings and stuff?"\n\nYes, sir, like toppings and stuff.\n\nSo, I\'ve come to the conclusion that this store is, even as I write this, being robbed. That was not an actual Domino\'s employee I encountered, but rather the robber pretending to be one (Fact: this sort of thing happens all the time, as seen in countless movies). I would call the police, but as I\'m leaving Phoenix shortly, forever, this criminal and the subpar Domino\'s he works out, however temporarily, will be out of my life for good.'

S'Our experience here was not the best in many ways unfortunately. We just happen to be in the neighborhood while running some errands and hungry so we stopped.\n\nThis is not our first ride on the LJS train so we know what to expect as far as taste and quality of the food.\n\nThe place was empty however one customer in front of us trying to use a coupon with a new employee so that was a total disaster. We should have left after waiting 10 minutes in line to place our order however we were there and hungry so we waited and waited and waited some more.\n\nFinally what appeared to be a Manager comes out and takes our order while the "new" employee is still fumbling and bumbling trying to understand how to input a coupon into the register.\n\nIt was frustrating for us to have to witness what this woman in front of us is going through trying to place her simple order.\n\nNo apologies to her or us for the long ridiculous wait.\n\nThe food just did not taste good either, the fish was not crisp as it usually is, the coleslaw tasted off and our root beer floats were not very floaty.\n\nWe will never return to this location, we only stopped here because it was near where we were running errands.\n\nCommon sense goes a very long way! It is too bad some people don\'t have common sense or manners in this industry. Also however they are storing or cooking the food should be up to par like the other LJS in town. This was the worst food we have ever eaten from a LJS and truly disappointing on so many levels.\n\nBad staff and bad food, no bueno!'

S"Disappointed. Ingredients and toppings looked like they had been sitting there for a few days undermining the quality and freshness of the Pizza. We asked for basil and the guy took the only packet out of the fridge and it was completely rotten so he threw it all away. \n\nWe ordered 5 pizzas and they all came out with soggy crusts. The cooking system may be fast but it pales in comparison to a wood burning oven or even a more conventional electrical system where the crust gets cooked properly and the toppings don't have to be exposed to intense high heat for such a short period of time. I don't mind waiting another 5 minutes for a pizza that is decently cooked.\n\nThe concept of choosing your own toppings and designing your own pizza is just a recipe for disaster- it dilutes the identity of the pizza characteristic to the establishment. A pizza's combo of toppings and ingredients should be studied and offered as a tried and tested combination, otherwise you end up with a 'mish mash' of ingredients that just don't marry well together especially when you also have the option of choosing the type of sauce and cheese etc.\n\nThe pre-made dough was also a big disappointment- making it one step closer to a store bought pizza. That, in combination with the lack of freshness of the toppings really disqualifies it from being considered a freshly made pizza.\n\nYes, there are set pizzas too but the pricing just doesn't make sense compared to the build your own.\n\nWe gave it a try but won't be back- there are much better pizzas to be had and if you can afford to wait an extra minute or two then why come here?"

S'I was away from my neighborhood helping a friend move but wanted for dinner what my family eats EVERY Tuesday. So while in North Las Vegas my friend directed me here. I went through the drive thru and ask for "Two specials, mild and a pie, and I want that same order twice." The cashier says back to me, "You will have to pay for them both together."  I responded that I understood and let him know that I didn\'t mean separate orders but  that I was saying it like that because my child an I will be eating in the car and I wanted us each to have our own individually wrapped order.  (Its easier to just give her a bag than to hand her some pieces while I\'m driving) I added 1/2 dozen biscuits and a corn on the cob to my order and asked for lots of "grape jelly, hot sauce and butter." My friend says after I completed my order that we can eat at her house.  So we drove back to her house and opened the bag to find ONLY two 2 piece orders! Also the two apple pies had been smashed open under the weight of the chicken packked into the small handle bag that my order was given to us in. I was upset at myself because I thought that maybe I wasn\'t clear when I ordered.  I just decided to eat and go ahead and get home. I kid you NOT today I\'m doing laundry I take out the change and reciept from my jeans I had on that day and guess WTF they did charge me for 4 two piece specials!! I had to research the phone number since it is not on my receipt, but I\'ve tried calling the store to say what happened and no one will answer the phone. I live near Henderson its not like I\'m going to drive to NLV to talk! I asked  a friend if I should care anymore, you know I asked if he thought I was being dramatic over $2.58 worth of chicken and he said "yes." But, the more I think about it the madder I get because if I walked into Popeye\'s packed up food and just walked out the door with 4 pieces of chicken they would call the police and pursue me no matter how far!'

My 5 year old had the day off from school and I had the day off from work.  I needed my tires rotated (see my Discount Tire comments) and it was lunch time.  My son was excited to go to McDonalds, so we dropped my car off at Discount Tire and walked to McDonalds- it was very windy and he was a little annoyed.  We got to McDonalds and their debit functionality was offline.  So I had no cash on me and I had to explain to my 5 year old that we couldn't eat there.  We had to walk back to Discount Tire and cancel our rotation.  I then called another Discount Tire with food within walking distance and they were not busy- so we went there and between the call and our arrival they got slammed.  So rather than get my tires rotated there and go to Chik-Fil-A, we drove back to our local Chik-Fil-A for a wonderful lunch.  I blame McDonalds for a horrible day."

Of course, you can hold the sauce and just have a normal mild sandwich, but it's the hot sauce choices that make Firehouse Subs really special. Hot sauces with names like Gator Hammock, Bee Sting, and Cheeches Gnarly Garlic, make for a fun experience and you can doctor your sub differently each time making for some unique concoctions.

If the food was bad, at least we'd be at a 17th century manor with peacocks. \n\nLuckily, the food wasn't bad, not by a long shot.

From our arrival we were greeted by a cheerful doorman in a swank black kilt, and whisked upstairs to the tapestry room, where we sank into an antique sofa and took in the gorgeous furnishings. Prestonfield is just as beautiful, decadent, and opulent as it appears in the photos, and the rich history here is palpable. Yes, there are peacocks, and pheasants, and Highland cows in a pasture by the drive. \n\nThe house is gorgeous. The grounds are gorgeous. The food is incredible and the service is impeccable.

S'Stayed in the hotel for a conference and did not feel like going out to eat. Ordered the caprese salad. Pretty safe bet, right? 5 tiny cubes of mozzarella with 3 cherry tomatoes.  I also ordered the buffalo wings. It was hard to describe the texture but imagine if the chicken had been soaking in water all day and then put in the fryer for 30 seconds. It was weird and mushy and made me question the safety of eating it. The ranch dressing that came with it was also so watery that it dripped off of the carrot stick so that only a thin whitish film remained.  \n\nI ordered a side of arugula because I like to eat it with my caprese salad. This was good thinking because it ended up being the only (sort of) substantial thing I ate that night.\n\nService was great, though. \n\nLess than a 10 minute walk away is Switch Restaurant, an IHOP and a bunch of other places.

S'In brief: I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nFor Mexican food, I like more "authentic" (I mean, as much as I as a food nerd in Wisconsin can reasonably claim to know about authentic Mexican) than Midwest overstuffed-with-dairy Mexican.  \n\nA couple of my preferred Mexican joints have shut down lately, this place opens up like a mile from my house.  Hey potentially solid Mexican place real close to home is worth investigating.  \n\nIt\'s in a strip mall, in a space that\'s been a couple other restaurants before. Inside it\'s pretty bare. Definitely mom-n-pop. When I went, one daughter was taking orders, her mom was cooking, and another sister was helping in the kitchen.  \n\nSo look at my surprise when one of their standard meats that you can throw in pretty much any shape & size of masa dough, is cochinita pibil (slow roasted achiote rubbed pork shoulder).  A lot of places that\'s like an entree unto itself but here you can get it on anything. \n\nI had a cochinita pibil huarache which was plenty of food, and really good. My friend who had been lifting all day got 4 tacos (cochinita, pastor, steak, chicken), and a GIANT chicken quesadilla (1/3 of which I ended up eating). Then he wanted to try the fish taco special and tried to order 1 fish taco, but we ended up with a whole order of fish tacos, so I had one of those and it was pretty solid too. Nice slaw & salsa. \n\nWay too much food, but all good, and very cheap.  Support my new neighborhood Mexican joint. Because I want to eat there more!'

You have to look at the take out menu.\n-"We\'ll be right with you," means 10-15 minutes.\n-"Let me clean your table first," means wipe it down, but then leave the spray bottle on the table.\n-"We\'re out of salad," supposedly meant "We\'re out of salmon," which actually means that they had both in stock.  Huh?  I don\'t know either.\n-The "office" for the restaurant is the last table in the corner, with a computer and everything set up in plain view of the customers.\n-Behind the "office" is the daycare for the employee\'s daughters, who had toys, papers and a TV there on the floor.\n-The employee\'s daughters are nice enough to come and play with their toys on your table.  The toys that have been on the floor and the girl\'s mouth.  Also, be on the lookout for them throwing their toys around the restaurant.\n-The men\'s restroom had dirty aprons from the kitchen and an open toolbox.\n-The employee\'s daughters were also in the men\'s restroom.  Quite the surprise when I go in and almost trip over a couple little girls.\n-The food is around $10 per dish and is not that good.  But it will take 20-25 minutes to prepare.\n-The macaroni salad is actually a penne salad.  As in, it was penne pasta used in the recipe.  It lacked flavor and was warm.\n-Chicken katsu was mostly breading, very little chicken.  Katsu sauce was barely present on the chicken.\n\nIt was an uncomfortable meal, spending an hour and a half at this restaurant.  A lot of time was spent waiting, but when the food arrived, you spent your time eating while also hoping the kids wouldn\'t come to your table after playing on the floor the whole time.  Take out is offered, so you can avoid the environment if you go that route.  However, the food was nothing special, so I can\'t even recommend that.

S"not a bad restaurant located in my developing area.  its a small restaurant on the corner of a strip mall.  inside black table/chairs, burnt orange colored walls, and a wide open view of the kitchen.  it reminded me of being inside a villa.  the restaurant is fairly new, and possibly the staff was new to the restaurant business.  our waiter failed to tell us about the specials of the day or the dessert menu, that another asian waitress was informing other customers. \ni was really impressed with the portions of the dishes served here.  we started with a huge antipasto platter, with artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, marinated mushrooms, red and green olives, provolone cheese, soft mozzarella, and my favorite salty prosciutto.  we also shared a small thin crust sausage and peppers pizza, where the thinness wasn't thin enough and not crispy enough.  definitely not a new york pizza.  i also didnt enjoy the peppers, for they were added to late in the baking process. i like the peppers a bit more cooked or just served raw on my pizza.  dont do it in between.  we also ordered angel hair pasta cooked in garlic and oil sauce.  this dish was ridiculously huge, perfect for somebody loading up on carb before a big run.  we asked them to put some tomatoes in it for more pizazz.   they also served garlic knots with a side of garlic and oil to drizzle all over the knots.  yummy\ni also like how they had entertainment on saturday night...they had a gentleman singing frank sinatra songs....ah...only vegas..."

S"Thank you to Yonaka, Snow Shavery, and Christina W. for kicking off the first of many delicious monthly lunch feasts.  This was an epic meal for sure, as I needed no food the rest of the day!  The sake tasting was unbelievable, and I found happiness in the Murai Family Daiginjo (green bottle).  I also enjoyed the grapefruit-Thai basil soda concoction as well.\n\nEverything I tasted was pure heaven, from the mushroom and shishito robata with bonito flakes, chicken yakitori sprinkled with green onions, lemon snow and frozen grapes, cured hamachi, fresh scallops, a fried bun with fish and cherries!!!, a whole sea bass with fennel-apple slaw and yucca chips...to a green tea-strawberry-milk-chocolate experience for dessert!\n\nI loved the cantaloupe snow because we all could smell it before it got to the table and it was deliciously powerful.  The whole experience was a journey through flavors that are hard to imagine outside of Yonaka's doors.  We also go to take away a beautiful macaron from Chef Indri.  I think the ideas being executed here in the edible form are nothing short of spectacular, and I am glad to be a part of this lunch's debut!"

S"Note to anyone who is reading this and thinking I have never heard/seen this place before........ check. it. out! I ended up here after a wee stroll round town this Saturday afternoon, now this place does have only a few seats so I wasn't expecting to get one, but I got a lovely stool by the window to watch the world go by.\n\nMain reason I am rating this place, the salads........ YUMMERS. I had a hot smoked trout, crayfish, creme fraiche and salsa salad, man alive was it heaven for my belly! Plus they are not stingy with the fish, which I was half expecting as it was only a fiver which seemed very reasonable. Another reason..... everywhere these days seems to do paninis, not that I have anything against that whatsoever, but it was nice to see something different. Instead of your usual toasted panini, they do toasted wraps, with a selection that sound devine! And I would imagine you can mix it up a little and choose your own. \n\nService was good, friendly and efficient. Nice, interesting interior, free newspapers and they have a specials board, always a bonus. I already have my eye on a toasted wrap with parma ham, mozzarella and pesto for next time!"

S'Somehow in the midst of my excitement over the abnormally high number of slushy flavors, every time I go to this QT gas station, I somehow overlooked the thing in the middle.  IT IS A WHIPPED TOPPING MACHINE.  Who would ever expect a whipped topping machine in the middle of a wall of slushies? I almost thought I was dreaming. \n\nOn the machine it says, "Add whipped topping to your favorite frozen or hot drink."  \n\nI assume that since the machine is smack dab in the middle of the wall of slush, that "favorite frozen drink" refers to slushy.  I never thought that I would see the day that putting whipped topping on a slushy would not only be deemed appropriate, but even be encouraged. This QT gas station is clearly one (or 100) steps ahead of the game and I hope that all other QTs (and circle Ks and 7Elevens) follow their lead. \n\nSo, the curious reader is probably wondering, "how does whipped topping on a slushy taste?"   Let me just say: why eat a popsicle when you can eat a creamsicle?\nI  now realize that a slushy without whipped topping is like a cake without icing or a raisin without chocolate.  \n\nThe machine is a little loud, do not let this scare you.  It also is a little slow, so you must be patient as you wait for your whipped topping to drop.\n\nAside from the screen that says "Push Here for Whipped Topping," there are no instructions, but do practice caution when mixing the whipped topping on soda.  Yes, you can put it in soda...it\'s not as weird as it sounds, think of rootbeer floats, or the more obvious, cream soda.  Unfortunately, the whipped topping seems to trigger a volcanic effect when added to soda so make sure you leave a good 2-3 inches in your cup to prepare yourself.  Even if you quickly put a lid on it, the increased carbonation will fizz right through the straw hole.  My husband foolishly waited in the car for me while I ran in to buy (aka "create") his fountain drink and unbeknownst to him, I added whipped topping, which continued to fizz through the straw hole for quite some time.   If this does happen to you, just try to not make any sharp turns while you drive.  It will be messy.'

S'Like most people I had heard from friends about how good the food at Rossario\'s was; so I had to try it. It was a Sunday, and one of the specials was "Famous" sausage on some sort of pasta. I ordered a salad as a side, and we were brought bread to share. The salad was fine, the bread was fine, then our dinners arrived. I looked at my plate and I was started thinking, a steak may have been a better choice.\nI cut up the sausage and started chowing.  The sausage was a little hard on the outside, and pretty dry. The pasta and sauce were very bland, like the sausage. The friend I was with, had the same thing, and we came to the same conclusion. It was all very bland, no flavor what so ever.  \nI really couldn\'t understand how this place could be voted "best of" anything. The service was friendly and prompt, price was reasonable, but the food just wasn\'t good. I might go back to have the big prime rib, but I\'m apprehensive after the grey tastelessness that was my Sunday night dinner.'

S"Sometimes ordering to go is just easier then actually sitting down at a restaurant for a meal. That being said I've had take home from here 3x now and have physically gone in 2x including the time from my first review. Each time I've had food from here there's been something wrong. Weather it be no steak in my steak queso which happened again last night!! Or weather it be a steak undercooked or cinnamon sugar missing from a sweet potato that comes with cinnamon sugar.  \n\nAll that side over all the food is very good. It's by no means poor quality and the portions are reasonable for a steak house. I chalk the missing steak up to it falling to the bottom of whatever container they take it from and the person who puts it into the dish just takes from the top. \n\nNow for the staff our waitress this vast time we went in could have listened a bit better. The other half asked for a beer and she just walked away. Also when we were ordering my sons kids meal we ordered applesauce and told her 3x as she just listed off possible sides.  We also spoke to a very friendly manager who went out of her way to correct the issues we've had over the last several meals. She was genuinely interested in what they should have done better to make the dining experience more enjoyable. F it wasn't for her this would still be a 2 star review."

S'Hello Friends, \n\nWell, if you "know" me and check out my profile you will see out of over 130 reviews only 9 are ONE STAR (Eek! Methinks not). Well now its 10. For good reasons. \n\nI do not base my reviews off previous reviews of a company. \nI give a lot of places at least 2 or 3 chances to redeem themselves.\nI love food and try to find the silver lining in all experiences (good & bad)\n\nWell well well..... This place WILL NOT get a second chance.   jankie establishment the flyer/promotion (that they left on my door) spelled the place "CHeeRY HOUSE". Really?? and I notice on Yelp and the building its CHERRY HOUSE II... Not "ChEEry House".  Lazy owners that don\'t care enough to get the name of the place right..smh Well, they do offer %10 off on delivery and %15 off pick up over a certain amount. (sorry, i didn\'t commit to memory since i WONT be back)\nI know how some are about "strip mall" and this is located inside one.. ekk ekk ekk\n\nNow to the "food"... Not bad in prices, buttttttt..... you get what you pay for. \n \nMy GF had Lemon Chicken (breaded tiny piece of "chicken" With a lot of breading to trick you into thinking you got a lot of food) with Crab rangoon (Wasn\'t bad 3.5/5), & "brown rice"\n\ni ordered Shrimp/Chicken & Brocclli & "Brown rice" as in white rice with brown sauce on it (and I can tell due to the large lump of white rice in the middle), an Egg Roll that didn\'t make it to the bag as i guess they forgot even tho it comes in the combo) .\nI had, and please believe me.. i counted.. 5 shrimp in my whole order. And it wasn\'t the big shrimp, it was the 20-30 count. The "spring roll" was as long as Your middle finger and as wide as 2 fingers. I have a finger for them alright... ah ah ahhhh.. not that finger but my thumb. Pointing at me as to say... I won\'t be back!'

S'After reading Nelson\'s review, I had to try this place.  It is hiding in plain sight.  I can\'t believe the number of times I\'ve passed on the freeway and saw that large open shopping plaza, much of it empty, and little did I know there was a gem of a restaurant right in my line of sight.\n\nI stopped here after a "Showgirls of Las Vegas" program at the Nevada State Museum.  I was the only customer at 5:10 and remained the only customer for the hour I was there.  It\'s a shame.  They should have more business.\n\nI got the chips and salsa and I asked for the hot salsa.  That salsa with habanero peppers is quite good.  The mild salsa is fine, too, and I liked the small bits of avocado in the mild salsa.\n\nThe woman brought me a bowl of complimentary soup. It was not the vegetable soup shown in other photos for Chicken Itza but rather a noodle soup--fideo soup.  It was very good and very hot!!  Let it cool for awhile so you don\'t burn your lips, tongue, throat, and anything else to which this may come in contact!\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the panuchos.  Since there are three to an order, I got one, chicken, one turkey, and one pork (cochinita pibil).  All three were excellent!  The split tortilla filled with refried black beans with the tasty meat and toppings were super!! The meats were very juicy and this was a more than one napkin experience.  The meat could have been a bit hotter, but it didn\'t detract from the flavors.\n\nFor dessert, I had arroz con leche which was not complimentary.  It is really, really, good!  It had a nice amount of cinnamon, raisins, and bananas and there seemed to be some pieces of crust as if the rice and milk were baked in a pie crust of some kind.\n\nThe horchata was very good. \n\nI\'m coming back to try their other Mayan (Yucatan) specialties!  It is so wonderful to live in such a diverse city with all these different foods from which to choose.'

The restaurant itself looks to have seen better days but the service is friendly and, as mentioned, the food gets to you fast.  They don't have the fries warming under a light, instead they are dropped about the time your steak and onions hit the grill so you get them hot and crispy with a dusting of seasoned salt.\n\nOn the Original cheesesteak you get steak, onions and choice of white american and provolone cheese.  I like the hoagie version which has lettuce, tomato and olive oil.  My only asks would be more seasoning on the meat as it's cooked and some vinegar to go with the olive oil and cut some of the fattiness."

The steak was good and tender but over all the burrito had no flavor and was served barely luke warm. Even the cup of hot sauce I got barely had any kick.

S"They have improved their recipe quite a bit. The last time I had Pizza Hut was when I lived on the east coast and it was as bad as Domino's during their Noid days. Now they have both made leaps and bounds with their recipes. Their sauce has gotten leaps and bounds better and their dough is decent.\n\nWe had the internet only special for a large garlic parmesan crust pizza. They are still limited on their toppings compared to other franchise pizza joints like NO banana pepper as a topping and their veggie selection is weak too.\n\nWhen ordering on-line one thing that I did not like was if you were getting a pizza w/ 2 toppings you could not get 2 different toppings on each half like how Dominoes lets you do. You can also not request for it to be double baked which i like b/c these franchise pizza joints always tend to under cook their pies (imo). The other bonus is it is literally 2 minutes from our house and since Papa John's doesn't deliver to our neighborhood we've had to look elsewhere for our quick and easy pizza orders for when we're lazy."

You can order breadsticks if you want this much crust without toppings.  It needs more consistent coverage of whole pizze, not the center 2/3 only.  Sometimes no one is up front or acknowledges you.  They seem to be out back smoking or socializing , or something.  Mostly good service and we like the pizza."

They used to have a reasonable salad, now it's just iceberg lettuce and a sad slice of tomato. The cut of meat for their steak is now chewy and has fatty inedible bits."

We thought it sounded like a fun place since the site we were on stated it was created to mimic the movie Roadhouse with Patrick Swayze. No it's not.\n\nThey have been open 2 months and while we were eating our dinner they were doing construction on the dance floor/stage area! Seriously? \n\nThe menu had several items blacked out with a sharpie, if you're opening a restaurant don't you think the menu would be one of the things that is set in stone first?\n\nMy dinner literally made me sick (Gyro sandwich) everything was bland, the fried tasted like they were freezer burnt but used anyway.\n\nMy daughter had a burger - asked for American cheese on it but got cheddar, also bland and she agreed on the fries being freezer burnt.\n\nSon-In-Law had a steak and he said it was okay but putting into context that call him a human disposal that's not saying much.\n\nGranddaughter doesn't count - she's 6, ate off my plate and never had a gyro before so had no basis of comparison. She ate off my plate because this is a FAMILY RESTAURANT with NO CHILDREN'S MENU. They did however offer her a basket of crayons and a sheet of notebook paper which the server had to take back long enough to rip off the phone number that was written at the top of it.\n\nThey've been open for 2 months but are having their GRAND OPENING this Saturday. I hope for their sake they can get this right and soon or they will be calling Gordon Ramsey in for help as they go belly up."

S"First of all I'm shocked that no one has written a review yet as it was part of the Crossroads Charlotte Taste of the World bus tour. The location is near Ben Thanh on Central between Kilborne and Sharon Amity, so it's not a stretch I frequent. Anyway I was a little nervous as I walked up and the sign above the door is in corrugated plastic.\n\nAs I entered, the place has tables with glass tops over the tablecloths and basic chairs that were comfortable enough. It's a no nonsense interior - think Meskerem Ethiopian but less homey and less interesting.  You don't come here for the ambiance.\n\nHowever their menu has about 30 options on it luckily with photos for each item in a grid. While the owners are from Somalia, not all of the food is Somali. There is a selection of dishes primarily $8-10 mostly chicken, beef or goat. Jamile prefers chicken, and I have a thing against eating animals my family has kept as pets, so I won't eat goat.  (RIP our beloved nubian goats, Bravo and Symphony) I got something Jamile recommended that is of course not on the menu, but basically it's the Chicken with canjeera (Sp?) which is really similar to the Ethiopian injera flat pancake bread but less zingy. It came with spinach and potato (room temp but very good) and a side salad that was nice. It also came with water and mango juice all for $8. I told her it wasn't enough. \n\nSo what the heck was Somali food like you ask? It wasn't nearly as unusual as I expected. The chicken which was spiced, yet not spicy was pleasant and mild. I couldn't identify any of the spices but it definitely wasn't overtly curry yet it was orange- possibly turmeric and some berbere?  It wasn't as similar to Ethiopian food as I had thought it might be except the bread.  Most of the dishes came with rice (which I heard was nice and moist), pasta (spaghetti) or a combo of both, or another bread called chapatti that was kind of like somewhat crunchy pita bread. I recommend the rice or my canjeera bread. \n\nIt was a great value, and something out of your comfort zone yet not weird from a culinary perspective. Why not try it? The service was friendly and Jamile was lovely and was amused by our fun loving group. She even agreed to take a picture with us!  I will go back."

S'I attended a private party at this venue. One star is generous. Not only was the extortionately priced buffet over 3 hours late, but I think the catering staff must have assumed that they were feeding a small group of anorexics, as my girlfriends were starving after having to fight for the small morsels of cold pasta and soggy pizza that were on offer. \xc2\xa315 plus \xc2\xa35 for a glass of alleged "prosecco"?! Are you having a laugh? \n\nThe toilets, due to the wonkiness of the entire venue, a water spill that had not been cleaned up and the tiled floor were dangerously slippery and more than one of us nearly broke our necks trying to negotiate our way back to the door. \n\nI was unable to take part in the buffet due to food allergies (thank god, as I would have felt more ripped off than I already do, and that\'s bad) and had phoned the venue explaining this a few days previously. I was instructed to look at the menu for another restaurant (?) and select what I wanted. I did this and sent an email which apparently never arrived. \n\nWhen I arrived at the venue, the rightfully embarassed bar staff member told me that the venue doesn\'t do food and that the restaurant is closed, despite the menu being on the website, and no mention of this when I called! However, miraculaously, I was offered the option of steak or chicken. OK, fine. So I wait, and wait and wait and wait and EVENTUALLY a steak arrives. It was fine. Not good, not great, but OK. Chips were cold and soggy, but to be honest, after I\'d seen what the rest of the group had been subjected to, I was oddly grateful. \n\nSo, I went to settle the bill afterwards and explained to the staff member that I thought \xc2\xa315 was a bit harsh and that I hadn\'t been told the price before ordering. The dish that I had actually ordered in my email was \xc2\xa37.95. So, off she goes to get the manager, who was the most exceptionally rude individual I have ever come across. Customer service or even being vaguely civil was obviously not covered in the training course.\n\nSo, after me asking and being told straight out that the steak is "normally \xc2\xa318 on the menu" and I was already getting a discount, I very grudgingly pay my \xc2\xa315 and leave. However, I actually look at the menu today and find that in fact the steak is \xc2\xa312.95!! I find this absolutely outrageous. \n\nI  hope that no other poor chumps make the same mistake my disappointed, undernourished group did.'

This pretty much described the dissapointment we felt for the whole meal - lacking that certain something, the punch as it were. The food generally tasted like something you could buy from a supermarket, but was way more expensive.\n\nHowever, Voujon has some redeeming features - the restaurant is beautifully modern and elegant - and the staff were helpful.\n\nOverall, Voujon was a dissapointment - and I doubt Voujon will post this review in its window."

S"Our first sign that this was a bad choice should have been the fact that in a place that seats around 100, we were the ONLY ones there. I read a very nice review of this place on Pittsburgh Live (http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/lifestyles/fooddrink/s_619820.html), but now am skeptical of the reviewers motives. The review made this place sound like it was a hip new addition to the Pittsburgh food scene, but really it's more like a not so hip new addition to the tired old ideas executed poorly scene (okay, that was lame). \n\nBut seriously, for the price and the hype, I was expecting a lot more. So let's begin with the decor. You walk in and things seem nice and posh. Dark lighting, classy tables and chairs...the works. But then you start looking at the art and it's of various sports? I get that we live in a sports centered city, but now I just think that Melange is a glorified sports bar, not a classy eatery. And if it's a sports bar, how can they justify charging ~$30-40/person? So perhaps they need to think about their identity a bit.\n\nNext, we move on to the service, which, for the most, part was okay, but given that we were the ONLY party in the restaurant, wasn't exactly stellar. Our waiter was very nice and made no substantial mistakes, but when I asked for a wine recommendation (they have three Malbecs...which I tend to love), he named something else all together (thinking that it was a Malbec) and then back peddled when he realized that I saw he was making it up as he went along. He recommended a good wine, but my experience is that those are all good, so really the credit does not go to him. Then, when our main dishes came out (4 of which were meat dishes) he forgot to bring our steak knives. Again, wouldn't have been a problem, but our butter knives were covered in...well...butter. So probably not a good idea to reuse them. Then, it turned out that they only had 2 clean steak knives in the entire place. Really? Again, keep in mind that we were the only people there and it was 7:30pm...not exactly right after opening. So yah, service was so-so.\n\nFinally, the pi\xc3\xa8ce de r\xc3\xa9sistance, the food (please note the sarcasm). A few us ordered the chili lime quesadillas (which sounded great...see photo), but the chef apparently forgot the chili and the lime. They were as bland as anything I've eaten in a long time. On to the main dish. I ordered pork tenderloin (see photo) which was actually not too bad. The sauce was sweet (I like that) and the meat was cooked just right. So, on that front, well done. But my girlfriend ordered the lamb (the most expensive dish on the menu) and it was completely boring...and a little cold. I usually love to pick at food on her plate, but this time I had no such inclination. Sorry love, but that one is all yours :-p\n\nSome of the other dishes were okay, but not great. A friend got the walnut salad and said it was tasty. Another friend got the wasabi popcorn and enjoyed it as well. So I can't say that ALL the food was bad, but the majority was. And for the price, not even close to being worth it.\n\nMelange needs to decide if they are a glorified sports bar, an upscale eatery, or just a passing fad. Regardless, as it stands, I can't see this restaurant surviving too long. Given that it's across the street from the PSO, I'd happily see this one go to be replaced by a restaurant that deserves the prime location."

No idea what the place was like 3 years ago but it was a pleasant enough visit in 2014. I wouldn't be lusting after another visit, but certainly not the miserable experience noted as previous. \n\nWe had soup (cullen skink and tomato & lentil) - what looked to be smallish bowls turned out to be the Mary Poppins of bowls - this soup seemed to grow and was crazy filling, yo. Cullen skink so fresh it had some leftover bones (added flavour) although quite salty, even by my salt-encrusted standards. Tomato and lentil was well received and didn't require further seasoning either. Scones were presented warmed through with jam and butter, and pretty tasty. Didn't feel shop bought either (or look it). We also got sandwiches, but they left with us too, for later, as soup and a sandwich here was just too much. Would note the sandwich options aren't super exciting, and some more appealing options were available in the 12.95 two course menu... but I was reluctant to pay 8 quid for a salad when it didn't seem much different in content to the \xc2\xa34.50 sandwiches (salmon and prawn salad with toast versus a salmon salad sandwich...). \n\nAll pleasant enough and certainly not the disappointment (kitchens also clean on our visit too). \n\nCash preferred, credit cards under 10 come at a supplementary cost."

S"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the service was very friendly and accommodating by changing our table from a very noisy area to a more quiet one. But it took speaking to the manager because the poor waiters couldn't get the volume down.\n\nIt might be because it was Christmas parties but extremely rowdy crowds with lots of alcohol going around.\n\nAfter that my comments are pretty well the same as Mark's.\nThe food was very well prepared but extremely pricey considering the size of the portions. When I asked to substitute the potatoes with pasta, I was refused the vegetables that originally came with the dish unless I was willing to pay for a side order. $7.00 for an appetizer salad and $6.00 for a cappuccino to finish your meal is way overpriced.\n\nMy friend took the table d'h\xc3\xb4te and was offered a dessert and then was charged $10 extra for the dessert.\n\nI think they are taking advantage of a BYOB to jack up the prices.\n\nThey got me once and only once......"

S"Shinji opened recently and we've been looking forward to checking it out. Based on the interview that I heard with one of the owners Shinji was billing itself as an Izakaya.  I must say that the restaurant nor the menu has the feel of an Izakaya. That being said the food was very good and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. \n\nShinji's decor is unique with two tables that run the length of the main area of the restaurant. Although this results in you sitting right next to someone that you were not planning on having dinner with there are privacy screen that you can lower between you and your neighbor which are very effective. There is also a second seating area, downstairs in front of the sushi bar.\n \nWe started with the oysters, ceviche and scallops all of which were excellent. We then had the sushi for 2 and sashimi Moriawase. The fish was extremely fresh, they say they bring it in daily from NY, Vancouver & Japan, and the presentation was nice. \n\nOverall the food was very good, although not mind blowing or particularly creative and fairly expensive. A great place to go for a special occasion, but not necessarily somewhere you would eat regularly."

It's not quite on par with Portillo's (the undisputed king of Italian beef sammies in the city), but it's pretty damn tasty!

S"In my first year of university, my friends and I developed a bizarre attachment to Coffee Corner, although looking back it's hard to know exactly why.  Perhaps it was because staff members would unexpectedly pop up from a trap door in the floor to serve you, before disappearing down again into  mysterious depths below.  Or perhaps it was because of the trashy magazines we would read while we waited for our chips, which we all secretly enjoyed but were too embarrassed to buy.  It certainly wasn't the coffee, anyway, which I mistakenly tried once and discovered it was so bad as to be virtually undrinkable.  I seem to remember the chips were alright, thin crispy ones rather than the fat greasy ones you get in most chippies.\n\nI actually haven't been back to Coffee Corner for several years, so it may have drastically changed.  It's in a good location, between the Cowgate and the Royal Mile, for those times when you're overcome with the need for hot, greasy food halfway through a night out, and on such occasions, where cheapness and availability count for more than quality, Coffee Corner perfectly fits the bill."

S'Always hit and miss- but mostly miss\n\nI rarely take the time on my days off from work to sit down for a large lunch in a good restaurant (I do for dinner). During lunch hour I am usually on a roll and I don\'t have the time for extended lunches.  With that in mind I am always searching for a good and quick place to eat. Unfortunately, Del Taco falls short. \n\n\nI have  said it many times before, I\'m not a fan of Del Tacos food because their tacos do not have much filling in them, even when you order the double meat double cheese and the quality of food is always hit and miss.  However, my nephew enjoys the  food  at Del Taco so we decided to give it a shot. We decided to go through the drive thru.  I ordered two of the number six meals which included 2 double beef double cheese tacos, fries, and a drink.  I asked for the fries to be made "extra crispy" in hopes of getting fresh fries.  My hopes were crashed at least partially. As we pulled away I realized that one order of fries was fresh and hot while the other order was cold and stale. The frustrating thing beyond the cold fries was I asked the employee at the drive thru if the fries were fresh and extra crispy and she replied "yes".\n\nThe quality as a whole at Del Taco has seem to gone downhill fast.  I realize that Del Taco is a fast food establishment and fast food is what your going to get and I am fine with that. Howerever, I do believe the food should be fresh and made to order.  This doesn\'t appear to be the case with Del Taco. I have spoken to management on different occasions about the quality of food and have had meals replaced.\n\nI will not be going back to Del Taco any time soon.'

When you get there, take the elevator, the floor plan will make your head spin more than a ride at nearby amusement park La Ronde).\n\nQuality, yes.  Reasonable prices? If $25.95 is reasonable for a buffet.  Moderately priced for the quality delivered.  I must say they lost money on me.\n\nThe menu is mostly French and American, even Quebecois "pudding chomeur" (OK, so it\'s an in-joke).  Lots of Asian tidbits when I was there (e.g., Dim Sum and lychee). Quite well done, and the frult was fine (one of the main problems with the budget-priced buffets).  I can\'t think of a single dish that disappointed.  I was so full, the dessert pastries were wasted on me. Or, rather I was wasted on an overdose of food.\n\nThe (Canadian dollars) "prix fixe" is $15.95 (lunch), $25.95 (dinner MON-THU) , $34.95 (dinner FRI/SAT ) and $19.95 (brunch).

So, although not really hungry for more pickles nor very enthused about the name of the company but intrigued nevertheless, I decided to not let this opportunity for a head to head comparison pass me by.  So, I strolled over to The Redneck Kitchen Food Truck, and ordered the only pickle dish on the menu: Deep-fried Irish Pickle Spears, and a Coke.\n\nBefore I got my completed order, I was summoned by name to the truck window, and was handed $4 as change that I had forgotten to wait for just after I placed my order.  This alone was worth an extra star.\n\nAnd when I received my pickles soon afterward, what initially came to mind as I first saw three fairly thin pickle spears resting in a small paper basket was "This is all I get for $3?!"  But then I liked crunching down on the warm battered spears and tasting the thin length of pickle inside each one, and by the time I was through noted how very filling and delicious they were, with or without ketchup or a mild white remoulade applied.  I don\'t know how Irish pickle spears are different from other pickle spears, but these deep-fried beauties were mighty tasty--even though priced at $1 a spear.  In fact, they narrowly won my personal Fried Pickle Throwdown pitted against The Rusty Pickle\'s more lightly battered but also tasty, deep-fried slices. \n\nAnd, the friendly employees of The Redneck Kitchen didn\'t seem rednecky at all.

The food came with salad and lentil soup. The lentil soup was the best part of the meal.  I thought the soup was quite good.  The kabobs were horrible.  Flavorless and Bland.  It did not seem fresh or even grilled.  They also put some vegetables on a stick on the plate.  The vegetables  were not cooked.  Why not put the vegetables on the grill at least.  The bread was not made fresh.  It is pretty much the same pita bread that you get at your local grocery store. The kabobs seems like they were fried or something.

The menu is rather extensive and I suggest studying it before you order because I definitely missed a whole section of it.  They have all your standard choices you find at a lunch place.  One thing I wish they did have was the ability to make a half sandwich/soup/salad combo of your choice.  (You can choose the sandwich but the other parts of the combo have to come from a predetermined list)   There are lots of desserts in cases too which looked ok but not appetizing enough for me to order them.\n\nThere is plenty of seating and we chose to sit outside as it was a beautiful day.  (Aren't they all beautiful here?!)  We were definitely the youngest people there by a good 40 years.  It was fine though, I'm just saying the Borgata is designed for the older set.  As in your grandparents.  But the old people are cute, I love seeing old couples hand in hand.  Its heartwarming.  \n\nBut I digress.  After a bit of a wait our lunches arrived and yes, Gabi's was drowned in a thick brown gravy like sauce.  My salad was covered in cheese.  There was definitely not a lack of meat or cheese in my salad (the Italian).....I thought it was interesting that my dressing was served on the side yet Gabi's dish was covered in sauce.  The dressing was actually pretty tasteless which was a little bit of a disappointment.  It also came with a mini muffin (very yummy) and saltines (strange).  \n\nI would definitely return for lunch and the breakfast options look great too.  Its a great choice for a relaxing quiet lunch.  (Unless the old people start to act up!)"

S'Today was my first time dining in the restaurant but second time having their food. I had pad Thai for takeout and was pretty decent. Today I had the noodle soup called Thoon - dark broth with chicken and rice noodles topped with cilantro and scallions. Lunch meals come with a small side salad and an egg roll, so that makes lunch filling and a pretty good deal. I was a bit disappointed with the size of the soup. It was small and shallow in comparison to the bowls of other Asian noodle soup establishments. Also felt that they skimped the amount of broth too. I was also expecting a much richer, deeper flavor in the broth.\n\nService is attentive and waitstaff is very pleasant. Will likely not have the soup again, but will definitely try other dishes.'

You have to get a burger with fries. Everything is so overpriced! The burgers sadly, were quite undercooked. I ate some parts of the perimeter of the burger but couldn't eat anywhere near the center. It was gross. It was such a long walk to go back to the food court from where our booth was, so we just said screw it and threw it away.  $29 and change for two undercooked burgers, fries and one sprite. Yucka!"

I love only my husband and cats more than I love pizza, and some days, it's a three-way draw. Zella's pizza simply doesn't live up to the standards of a timelessly good pizza. Very thin, flavorless crust (needs more salt, guys), but doughy and chewy, the way crust should be. Almost no sauce, and--other than pepperoni--my Hawaiian pizza had very few other toppings (and considering I paid an extra 1.50, I kinda hoped to have more than just 10 pepperoncini slices). It satisfied my pizza craving, but I can't say I'll order a pie from them again. \n\nHowever, these garlic breadsticks! Sweet six pound, eight ounce baby Jesus, these garlic breadsticks are enough to make me go back. Four bucks for twenty chewy, rich, warm, actually-covered-in-garlic-and-butter sticks? Nailed it, Zella's. You've got my business there."

The place is very tiny. I can\'t even think of a place to compare it to, but somehow they managed to fit about 4 small tables inside. When we just walked in, I went directly up to the girl at the cash register and asked her if I could use my voucher. She just said, "No." Um, okay. So I asked for an explanation and just said something about how they don\'t have the codes. No apology, no nothing; Not the best customer service. I\'ll be honest, the ONLY reason why I came here was because I bought the voucher, so I was pretty annoyed that they weren\'t accepting it when we came, especially since I purchased it only 10 days ago. \n\nNeedless to say, we stayed and ate anyway. I ordered 2 fish tacos ($2 ea) and a medium lemonade and my sister got a lengua burrito and a Jarritos. Our total came out to $14, which was actually a pretty good deal. The food came out after about 5 minutes. My sister\'s burrito was pretty huge and she actually started laughing at it because she didn\'t expect it to be so big. It came with a small salad and a few chips on the side. She said it tasted okay, but was a little watery inside. My tacos were delicious. After talking to the cashier girl, I thought I had my mind set on giving this place two stars. However, once I took a bite from my fish taco, I knew I couldn\'t give this place anything less than 3 stars. These were seriously some of the best fish tacos I\'ve had in Vegas. They were so fresh, so crisp, and so flavorful. The orange sauce inside the tacos was very tasty and there were even slices of avocado inside the tacos, which was a huge bonus.\n\nIf you\'re ever in the area and craving some fish tacos, you should definitely give this place a shot. The ambiance and customer service isn\'t the best, but you can always take it to go.'

I could have given 10 stars if it was an option.\n\nBorn and raised in Vietnam for 18 years, I know how Vietnamese cuisine should be.  Their Hue-style rice noodle, B\xc3\xban B\xc3\xb2 Hu, is exceptionally good. It was such a surprise to me. Many Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix area managed to get the beef noddle soup, Ph, to a nice level but the rest of the menu were just wrong. Loi Name's Hue-style rice noodle is not only over the top delicious, it also comes in a very generous portion. $5 for a takeout that fills up a huge bowl. Nobody can beat that.\n\nSteam buns, B\xc3\xa1nh Bao, are to die for. The flour is moist, sweet, soft. The meat is just right.\n\nVietnamese specialty dessert, mung-bean ball (sorry don't really know the real English name), ch\xc3\xa8 Tr\xc3\xb4i Nc, gave me a jaw-dropping experience. Huge ball of soft, chewy flour, with mashed mung-bean inside in sweet ginger flavored sauce. Served with coconut milk. Never ever I had ch\xc3\xa8 Tr\xc3\xb4i Nc this good in the U.S. (and I tried almost everything in Little Saigon, CA).\n\nVery difficult Ph to make, chicken noodle soup, comes with eggs (trng g\xc3\xa0 non). Real Vietnamese chick noodle soup would not miss these special type of eggs.\n\nLoi Nam's food draw me to their store again and again. Not only they know how to cook real Vietnamese food, they choose to do it correctly, with focus on detail. They wouldn't skip any ingredient.\n\nHowever, there is a hassle to get to these good food. The owner, ch By,  doesn't cook the same food everyday. I have to call in to make an order for the next day pickup. I asked her why she doesn't make the food more available. She said she only makes the food fresh and sell within a day. The next day, some food won't remain the same quality she would like (like ch\xc3\xa8 Tr\xc3\xb4i Nc if refrigerated the flour would get hard and must be microwaved before eating, hence reduce taste). \n\nIt is best to call when you're nearby and ask what she has for the day. If you're lucky you'll get some real specialty food."

S'After only a few minutes inside you completely forget that you are in Scotland, everything is so French with enthousiastic staff talking French, Michelin stickers on the door, and a nice French menu. \n\nThis is a very nice place and I had a great dinner with some Scottish-French fusion dishes. Rillette de Lapin, (rabit) was nice but a little dry and I actually would prefered French style bread with it in stead of the (I guess Scottish?) biscuits.\n\nThe entrecote of Scottish beef was beautiful and tasty. I saw on one of the neigbouring tables a great Cote du boeuf \n \nThe french (and maybe also some Scottish) cheese plate was good. The (expensive) Chateauneuf du Pape wine was excellent!\n\nThe waiting staff was very attentive and fun as well.'

S'One star is too generous. Having just arrived in Old Montreal via the Metro, it was 2pm and we were famished. Wandered down to de la Commune looking for terrace seating on a spectacular late-August day, and a pleasant fellow handed us a menu (with pictures) of a simple, kid-friendly, reasonably pried lunch dishes. We sat down.  \n\nBig mistake.\n\nYes, this is a tourist area - I get that.  But this food was barely edible. \nThe famous Quebec poutine?  Cold fries sprinkled with unmelted mozzarella cheese and canned brown gravy.  All cold.  \nMicrowaved chicken nuggets (nothing like picture) & more cold fries.\nPasta Salad? Cold spirals doused in mayo with chunks of green pepper\nHam crepe? Doused with more mayo, inside and out.\nThe warm water has already been mentioned, at least our paper cups were clean.\n\nIronically, the only decent item was the 1,99$ hot dog, it was hot (!), the bun toasted in a panini press.\n\nHowever, in total - this meal was pathetic.  Zero stars. Beware.'

S'Went here yesterday for lunch, and a had pretty decent experience at Crazy Taco.  You should know this not the wow a date place, its much more of a solo Saturday lunch spot.\n\nAs previous reviews have stated, I was drawn in by the festive mural on the outside of the building.  Parking was a breeze, and upon entering, I was immediately greeted by a young lady who asked if I was dining in or placing a to-go order.  As the interior didn\'t feel to homey, I decided "to-go" it was going to be.\n\nAfter perusing the menu for a minute, I ordered the California Carne Asada steak burrito.  My order was brought to in me in a styrofoam box, with hot (red) salsa.  Altogether, my order came to $9 and change.  \n\nUpon getting my meal home, I was delightfully surprised at the bounty of cheese they dispensed over the top of the burrito.  Don\'t mistake this for a chipolte-esq burrito that you eat with your hands.  No sir, this was something you might order at On-the-Border and eat with a fork and knife and cut into slices.  \n\nThe overall presentation of the burrito was great, it was filled with fresh looking/tasting bell peppers, onions and steak.  It was accompanied by sour cream and and a bed of lettuce.  For me however, the steak was a little tough and the burrito was a little bland.  I felt like it could have used an additional seasoning, or another side item other than lettuce to make it "pop".   \n\n\nDespite the fact that Crazy Taco didn\'t "WOW" me, I would definitely give it another shot.  I missed not having that chips and salsa which usually accompany any Mexican meal, therefore I\'d also like to dine in as well.  I\'ll be back, but not after I try some of the other Mexican fare in the area.'

This isn't the first trouble at this restaurant..last time they also got my order wrong by forgetting my sides but he replaced the meal my following visit,\n\nTonight i called to tell the manager what all had gone wrong and the phone rang and rang..then disconnected the 3rd time someone finally answered...I wasn't even offered an apology.... certainly not any kind of compensation for my time and trouble.

S'I would totally come back here to try the three course fondue extravaganza, I missed out on the cheese and chocolate courses this time and I still regret it. They also do raclette, which if you haven\'t had you absolutely should try here while in town, but if you live in Montreal you probably have a raclette plate at home and can do epic feasts for less without taking off your house pants. \n\nThe "Chinese style" broth fondue was tasty but the broth could have been much more flavourful. I tried the first-timer melange of meats and seafood, which is a great way to go if you feel like a bit of everything, but the filet mignon and the salmon were the definite highlights. \n\nService was friendly, not rushed but timely, the decor is warm and the art not bad at all. The tables are nicely spaced, and the lighting and colouring is warm and yellowy, and reminiscent of cheese. Ideal.'

Cinnabon is like the overweight, gun-toting, conservative distant relative you only see once or twice a year at family reunions or funerals. But damn it if you don't love them because they'd have your back if you were getting carjacked or if you needed a truck to move a washer/dryer. That, ladies and gents, is Cinnabon.

If you're looking for good pizza in the Fashion Show, I prefer the Nordstrom's Cafe's, which is a 2 min walk from Luciano's and made to order in a brick oven.\nOtherwise, the rest of Luciano's offerings are worthwhile for the most part. Their star is the made to order pastas. Bang for your buck all the way. Good flavors, good ingrediants. \nLast time, I had the seafood linguine that includes baby clams, shrimp, and calamari. The sauce was not overbearing in taste and was light but apparent, unlike most places that just slop it on top rather than cook it in the pan with the ingredients like Luciano's does. You do have to be a little more patient to order this way, but it is well worth it."

Shortly afterward, the rest of the people eating in cleared out and the music was changed from something that was just background noise to HARD ROCK.  VERY LOUD hard rock.\nAt this point, I threw out the rest of my sandwich and left.\nSomebody please tell me that the manager stepped out for a little while.\nI need a new sub place!"

Krispy Kreme donuts are the newest fad in my opinion. \n\nIf you join the drive through queue, you can expect to lose at very least half an hour of your life. And that's at opening time first thing in the morning, not the rush hour marathon wait. You can go inside and order but most folks ant be bothered getting out the car. \n\nThe donuts themselves are beautiful, but they're blatant American donuts and are totally saturated with sugar. The original glaze are the best - all the other fancy ones are nice but I can't get excited about them. \n\nYou can get better donuts quicker and cheaper in my opinion. If you want a good burger would you wait an hour for McDonald's? If yes then Krispy Kreme may be for you. I'd rather have a proper burger and a proper donut."

S'We tried this new place, even though there was only one car in the parking lot during lunch hour. The waitress was super nice and took feedback well, and there was a lot of feedback from my husband about the food. We ordered chips and salsa - the chips clearly came from the 99 cent store and the "salsa" was a little container of pink tomatoes and onions. my husband ordered a double Beam and Coke. Even though they had Jim Beam stuff everywhere, no Jim Beam yet. \n\nMy husband had the carne asada, which looked promising. A big pile of meat with several char-grilled tortillas. Unfortunately they forgot to season the meat AT ALL and the tortillas were purchased at the same store as the chips. Maybe throwing in some onions and peppers would have helped. \n\nI had a salad (standard salad fare) and mac and cheese bites that we sampled at Costco last weekend (although the sauce was delicious.) \n\nSo, with the $9 drink (double Captain and Coke) lunch was $44. Way too pricey for food that was mediocre, at best. If the food was good, it would be well priced. \n\nAgain, can\'t rave enough about the server but the kitchen needs to get it together and maybe taste their own food.'

There was only one customer in there and she was leaving so we didn't have to wait. I asked for a 6 inch Subway Melt on flatbread. When he asked me what kind of cheese I looked down and saw roast beef instead of bacon. I told him I wanted the Melt not the Club. He fixed it promptly.
